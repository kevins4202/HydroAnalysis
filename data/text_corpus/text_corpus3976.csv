19880,dairy cattle treated wastewaters are potential resources for production of microalgae biofuels a study was conducted to evaluate the capability of arthrospira platensis cultivated in dairy farm wastewater for biodiesel production the biomass of arthrospira platensis was found to be 4 98 g l 1 and produced 30 23 wt lipids to dry biomass cultivated in wastewater which was found nitrogen stressed in photo bioreactor the extracted lipid displayed a suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel although the content of linolenic acid was found a little higher than the standard en14214 it was found that nitrogen stressed medium increase the total lipid content but temperature and intensities of light were the most important factors to control the quantity of linolenic acid and hence the quality of biodiesel while the optimum co2 helped to achieve maximum biomass and triacylglycerols the arthrospira platensis offer a good option for the treatment of wastewater before final discharge

removal lipid profile 1 introduction exhausted water and petroleum resources have put the viability of algal biofuel into account although the idea of using microalgae as a source of biofuel is not new chisti 2007 in fact it has been known for more than five decades meher et al 2006 production of biodiesel from rejected cooking oil is also very common alsharifi et al 2017 demirbas 2005 felizardo et al 2006 but indeed it is now being taken seriously because of the well associated global warming with burning fossil fuels and escalating price of petroleum gavrilescu and chisti 2005 algal biodiesel is the best option to reduce the effects of global warming caused by burning fossil fuels the water requirement for algae culture is very high especially in open pond system but fortunately they are capable to grow in industrial farm municipal and agricultural wastewater umdu et al 2009 judd et al 2017 this contributes in treatment of wastewater by decreasing the value of cod bod and removal of heavy metals which can be used in other purposes such as irrigation munoz and guieysse 2006 on the other hand the reuse of nutrients present in wastewater for culturing algae to produce biodiesel efficiently contributes for wastewater treatment as well as controlling the algal bloom in the water bodies simultaneously culturing microalgae is the simple and direct method of sequestration of greenhouse gases ghg since the growth of algae requires co2 as one of the main nutrients needed other benefits in recycling wastewater are saving of freshwater and cost of media for culture as well as reducing eutrophication in water bodies therefore microalgae culture technology could offers an effective way for both sequestering flue gas co2 and removing nutrients from wastewater in a single process as well as providing a recoverable resource in the form of biofuel from subsequent extraction and conversion steps judd et al 2017 the variation in wastewater composition may limit the growth of biomass and as well as the profile of extracted lipid from algae chinnasamy et al 2010 therefore it is necessary to screen the strains of different microalgae for specific type of wastewater those algae are wise to grow in particular wastewater which could decrease the cod of wastewater effectively as well as could show high biomass with high lipid content and standard quality of lipid composition microalgae have been considered as a promising alternative source of biodiesel lorenz and cysewski 2003 sing et al 2005 spolaore et al 2006 other than biodiesel microalgae can produce many different types of biofuels methane and biohydrogen are produced by anaerobic digestion of the algal biomass spolaore et al 2006 and by photobiological method akkerman et al 2002 melis 2002 fedorov et al 2005 kapdan and kargi 2006 respectively algae can accumulate significant amounts of lipids in their cells which extend up to 50 of their dry cell weight in certain species chisti 2007 sheehan et al 1998 arthrospira platensis is well known for protein rich and low fat microalgal species large scale culture and harvesting are easy for a platensis and also this microalga is resistant to contamination balaji et al 2014 2015 2016 in spite of low fat content in a platensis it has been chosen as for the production of biodiesel in this study because of its well productive biomass in this study the performance of arthrospira platensis will be thoroughly investigated for biodiesel production and dairy cattle wastewater treatment simultaneously in open and close systems farm wastewater was low in salinity even then the challenge to grow halophilic algae arthrospira platensis was considered since it shows osmotic adjustment in high as well in low salinity culture condition of the wastewater by intracellular accumulation of the low molecular weight and high molecular weight carbohydrate respectively warr et al 1985 it has also been examined that low salinity favors to increase the biomass kebede 1997 the influence of light intensities on algal lipid and biomass will also be investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents methylation catalysts fame standards hexane and methanol were obtained from sigma aldrich switzerland all chemicals were analytical grade reagents 2 2 wastewater collection and analysis the wastewaters used in this study were collected from treatment plant fig 1 of a moderate size commercial cattle farm located at penang malaysia and due to the variation in wastewaters compositions with collection time the factory and farm effluents used as growth media were collected in a batch of two 1000 l containers and immediately stored at 4 c to minimize substrate decomposition before analysis prior to experimentation wastewater was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm for the settlement of excess colloidal particles to prevent forming flocs during algal cells culture therefore only the soluble fraction of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and other trace elements were considered in the wastewater 2 3 microalgae culture growth and maintenance arthrospira platensis was obtained from algaetech sdn bhd malaysia and maintained in 250 ml flasks containing 150 ml standard zarrouk medium at 30 c with an irradiance of 120 μmol m2 s and l d cycle of 12 12 h for 10 days under 1 5 co2 and

chlorophyll a content preliminary experiments were conducted in test tubes containing 15 ml wastewaters as growth medium for 10 days incubation conditions were the same as mentioned in section 2 3 a time scale batch study was done to evaluate a platensis biomass and lipid production potential in wastewaters all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 5 growth of a platensis and bioremediation of wastewater 2 5 1 effect of temperature to evaluate the biomass production of a platensis the experiments were conducted under three different temperatures 25 c 30 c and 35 c in 1 l capacity flasks

leds and co2 controller 2 5 2 effect of light intensities the cultures were carried under four different intensities of light 80 120 160 and 200μmol m2 s to check the effect of light intensities on the biomass production and lipid content in a platensis the experiments were conducted in 1 l capacity flasks with 500 ml wastewater as growth medium in triplicates for 10 days under 1 5 co2 at 120 rpm in photo bioreactor at 30 c 2 5 3 effect of co2 on a platensis biomass to demonstrate the optimum co2 that could enhance the biomass as well as lipid accumulation in a platensis the cultures were conducted in three different doses of co2 0 5 1 1 5 3 and 5 the experiments were conducted in 1 l capacity flasks with 500 ml wastewater as growth medium in triplicates for 10 days at 120 rpm in photo bioreactor at 30 c in 160μmol m2 s at its initial exponential curve day 0 6 and rose to 300μmol m2 s at its late exponential phase day 7 10 abbreviated as 160 300μmol m2 s 2 6 upscale of a platensis biomass in high rate algae pond hrap the outdoor cultures of a platensis were upscaled in hrap the hrap were of single loop raceway with the dimensions of 2 5 m 0 7 m 0 7 m and mixed by paddle wheel 20 rpm the transparent corrugated acrylic roofs were fixed at a height of approximately 2 5 m above from the top of the pond to protect the algae from rain and to obtain the optimum intensities of sunlight 160 μmol m2 s the cultures were conducted at 6 co2 air mixture bubbled through the growth medium at a rate of 1 l min 1 with an irradiance range of 140 180 μmol m2 s and the tropical daylight dark cycle was close to 12 h 12 h for 10 days the recorded temperature for 10 days of culture growth medium varied from 27 to 32 c twelve batches of a platensis were grown in photo bioreactor and last batch xiii was grown in hrap the experimental design is shown in table 1 all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 7 nile red fluorescence analysis the accumulated neutral lipid in a platensis cultured in zarrouk medium and all the batches from i to xiii were measured at the end of exponential phase of growth 5 ml of algal suspensions were added with 0 01 ml of 2 ppm nile red solution in dimethylsulfoxide and agitated on a vortex vigorously for 1 min and kept in dark place for 10 min to incubation nile red indicator reacts with neutral lipid and emits golden yellow fluorescence fluorescence intensity of stained strains were measured using spectrofluorometer hitachi japan at an excitation and emission wavelength of 480 nm and 575 nm respectively doan et al 2011 as earlier mentioned by hena et al 2015a actual fluorescence intensity of stained neutral lipid was attained after subtraction of auto fluorescence of alga and self fluorescence of nile red at 575 nm all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 8 lipid extraction to assess the feasibility of producing biodiesel from a platensis the algae was cultivated in wastewater in hrap as well as 1 l capacity flasks with 500 ml growth medium all as batch i to xiii after 10 days the biomasses were harvested using a continuous flow centrifuge harvested algae were dried at 60 c for 24 h for extraction of lipids analysis lipids were extracted with hexane in a soxhlet apparatus operated at 80 c for 10 h hena et al 2015b after soxhlet extraction hexane was evaporated at 50 c and 100 mbar using a rotary evaporator the crude lipid was then re dissolved in hexane and stored into a sealed glass vial in the dark at 5 c for not more than 15 days all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 9 production of biodiesel from extracted algal lipid biodiesel from crude algal lipid was obtained by two step process crude lipid or oil containing more than 4 free fatty acids should go through an acid esterification process to increase the yield of biodiesel the first step used an acid esterification all reagents were added in stoichiometric excess in acid esterification process methanol and 10 h2so4 were added to the lipid in hexane solution stored in vial the mixture was transferred into a flask heated to 50 c and moderately agitated for 2 h in the second step 25 potassium methoxide kch3o in methanol was added drop wise until a ph value of 13 was attained halim et al 2011 to neutralize the excess acid added during acid esterification and to reduce the interference of water as contaminant addition of 25 potassium methoxide kch3o in methanol also helps to transmethylate acylglycerols and phospholipids lang et al 2001 the mixture was evaporated at 60 c to obtain fatty acid methyl ester fame all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 10 instrumental analysis of fame analysis of the obtained fame compositions was carried out using perkinelmer inc 600 gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid equipped with a sp 2340 fused silica column l i d 30 m 0 32 mm df 0 20 μm sigma aldrich helium was used as the carrier gas at constant flow rate of 1 5 ml min the oven temperature was raised from 150 c at 2ºc min to 200 c and maintained for 10 min both the injector and the fid temperatures were 210 c one μl sample of fame was injected into the column each sample was analyzed in triplicates individual fame was identified by comparison of its retention time with that of the mixed standard fame concentrations of different fames in the sample were quantified by comparing their peak areas with those obtained from the mixed standard fame of known concentration the cetane number of each fame was obtained by using the equ 1 as below ramírez verduzco et al 2012 1 ϕ i 7 8 0 302 m i 20 n where ϕ i is the cetane number of the ith fame m i represents the molecular weight of the ith fame and n is the number of double bonds in a given fame therefore n varies with the value of zero one two and three for the methyl ester e g c18 0 c18 1 c18 2 and c18 3 respectively whereas the total predicted cetane number of biodiesel was calculated as equ 2 knothe 2012 2 pcn i ϕi j ϕj z ϕz 100 where pcn is predicted cetane number of biodiesel and i is percentage of ith fame present in biodiesel and j is percentage of jth fame present in biodiesel and so on 2 11 quantification of common parameters to determine the chlorophyll 10 ml of homogenized algal cells were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min the algal pellet was exhaustively extracted with warm methanol at 40 c until it was colorless chinnasamy et al 2010 chlorophyll a was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer at 630 nm hena et al 2015a 2015b to calculate biomass whatman gf c glass fiber filters were dried at 60 c for 24 h total carbohydrate was quantified by the method of dubois et al 1956 using glucose as standard protein content was determined by the method of kjeldhal according to hungria and araujo 1994 total lipid quantification was done as mentioned in hena et al 2015b all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 12 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using spss software the combined effect of temperature 25 35 c and media sufficient and deficient nitrogen media on biomass total lipid and fatty acid profile were analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range test differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of cattle wastewater the cattle wastewater used in this study was analyzed for determining physico chemical characteristics in wastewater biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds total volatile solids tvs total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were analyzed and provided in table 2 concentration of phosphorus was found sufficient to support a platensis growth in wastewater hillebrand and sommer 1999 recommended 46 1 7 7 1 mass ratio of c n p for algal growth whereas in this study the wastewater used had n p ratio of 1 137 1 which indicated n limitation media the wastewater used was considered as favorable for production of algal lipids as other researchers had also found that the stress of n deficiency increased the lipid content in algal cell uslu et al 2011 olguin et al 2001 cultured a platensis to determine the amount of lipid in two different culture mediums zarrouk s and nitrogen deficient and recorded 28 6 lipid of total dry biomass cultured in nitrogen deficient medium which was higher than the lipid obtained from the algae cultured in zarrouk s media other parameters of wastewater for the present study were found within the safe range 3 2 microalgae culture and growth a 4 1gl 1 biomass and 12 32 lipid of dry weight biomass of a platensis were obtained during strain maintenance in standard zarrouk s media at specific conditions which has been described in section 2 3 and considered as control while uslu et al 2011 obtained 1 12gl 1 of biomass of a platensis in same media it was concluded that the reason of different biomasses obtained in same media might be due to the different conditions applied during culture such as low temperature ambient co2 and low light intensity had been applied by uslu et al 2011 comparing to present study the detailed discussions are available in 3 4 1 effect of temperature 3 4 2 effect of light intensities and 3 4 3 effect of co 2 3 3 preliminary test the growth of algae in wastewater showed a good response despite of low n and p concentration with efficient removal of cod 98 4 phang et al 2000 removed 98 0 cod from digested sago starch factory wastewater the biomass of a platensis was found 3 81gl 1 in wastewater which was lower than the biomass obtained from standard zarrouk s media 4 1gl 1 at 30 c temperature with an irradiance of 120 μmol m2 s and l d cycle of 12 12 h for 10 days under 1 5 co2 and continuous stirring at 120 rpm in photo bioreactor model infors ht minitron the nutrient consumption profile confirmed that po4 p and no3 n in the culture media was depleted in 4 days and reached up to 98 8 and 99 6 respectively whereas nh4 n was found zero even after a short period of 18 h of culture table 3 since the first day of culture the biomass and chlorophyll a increased with time but from 0 3 to 1 1gl 1 and 3 4 μg ml 1 to 12 2 μg ml 1 respectively after 4 days of incubation unexpectedly the biomass showed increasing trend although determination of chlorophyll a did not show any significant changes during culture finally the biomass increased by 246 from 1 1gl 1 to 3 81 gl 1 while the chlorophyll a only increased by 81 from 12 2 μg ml 1 to 22 8 μg ml 1 on day 10 however the nitrogen in the medium was depleted within 4 days of incubation hena et al 2015a and chinnasamy et al 2010 had also noticed the same trends the above observations clearly proved that growth in biomass after 4 days of incubation was due to increase in internal cellular nutrients rather than increase in number of algal cell in nitrogen limiting medium the carbon fixation during photosynthesis preferred synthesis of carbohydrate rather than to opt the path of protein synthesis fogg 1975 chinnasamy et al 2010 work of uslu et al 2011 also favored this concept 3 4 optimization conditions in a platensis for biomass and lipid production 3 4 1 effect of temperature a platensis shows a wide range of temperature tolerance it was observed that microalgae growth increased with temperature from 25 c to 30 c at 35 c the chlorophyll a decreased and hence the growth decreased according to oliveira et al 1999 from observations of different strains of arthrospira the optimal growth temperature was between 25 c and 35 c while with higher temperature injury occurred to algae cells therefore it was decided to verify the growth and associated lipid profile of a platensis in between 25 c and 35 c of temperature range it was evident from table 4 that the highest biomass of a platensis was achieved at 30 c the temperature showed negative effect on biomass at 35 c although the lipid content in dry weight of biomass increased with temperature from 25 c to 35 c considering both the factors lipid content g 1 and obtained biomass l 1 into account it was observed that the total lipid from culture at 30 c was more than at 35 c 3 4 2 effect of light intensities the experiment revealed that biomass increased as the intensities of light increased the biomass increased till 160μmol m2 s without altering the lag phase 1 day whereas at 200μmol m2 s the a platensis showed long lag phase 3 4 days at 160μmol m2 s the a platensis reach the maximum growth in shorter time 10 days than at 200μmol m2 s about 16 days when the algal cells were cultured under high illumination photosystem ii is continuously damaged and repaired which indeed take long time to reach exponential phase of culture in the presence of a significant cells shading high light cultures 300μmol m2 s had found beneficial effects in the late exponential phase day 7 and onward as shown in fig 2 for obtaining higher concentrations of biomass to achieve maximum lipid it was interesting to note that a platensis cultured in 160μmol m2 s at its initial exponential curve day 0 6 and rose to 300μmol m2 s at its late exponential phase day 7 10 showed decrease in percentage of highly unsaturated fatty acids table 4 at lab scale in photo bioreactor it was easy to manipulate the intensity of light during the culture at late exponential phase although it was not possible to change the intensity of light at late exponential phase in hrap during upscale since the transparent corrugated acrylic roof was fixed and only transmit from 140 to 210μmol m2 s range 3 4 3 effect of co2 a platensis was grown under three different doses of co2 for 12 h continuous illumination of 160μmol m2 s and 12 h dark alternatively at 30 c under optimum illumination 160μmol m2 s a platensis has shown maximum growth at 3 v v co2 while at elevated condition 5 the growth showed significant decrease in biomass due to the acidity caused by excess co2 and the ph of the media was dropped to 5 8 within 24 h interestingly our results in this experiment indicated that culture in optimum 160μmol m2 s or optimum to high illumination 160 300μmol m2 s of light at limiting co2 0 5 obtained less biomass and hence less lipid accumulation this is because the efficiency of the calvin benson cycle was probably limiting while at optimum to high illumination 160 300μmol m2 s of light and excess co2 3 downstream of carbon dioxide fixation were more likely triggered triacylglycerols biosynthesis and showed highest biomass as well as lipid while in hrap cultivation the nutrients was constant since every batch was cultivated in one time stored wastewater it was interesting to note that during upscale culture of a platensis in hrap the maximum biomass was collected at 6 co2 air mixture bubbled through the growth medium wastewater for 10 days the temperature varies from 32 to 27 c during day and night respectively with an irradiance range of 140 210 μmol m2 s self shading effects of algal cells were minimized by the deliberate use of shallow tanks culture depth 0 5 m however it was difficult to control all parameters in hrap during the culture and hence the biomass obtained in hrap was less than the biomass obtained in lab at optimum temperature 30 c while the lipid accumulation was little higher 3 5 neutral lipid analysis main constituent of total lipids in algal cells include neutral lipids or triacylglycerols in the form of reserved energy and polar lipids phospholipids and glycolipids essential structural component of membranes neutral lipids accumulation depends on several factors such as temperature light available nutrients as well as species specificity doan et al 2011 chen et al 2008 although both neutral and polar lipids can be converted to biodiesel ichihara et al 2010 but neutral lipids are highly desirable fractions as neutral lipids or triacylglycerols can be easily converted into biodiesel while conversion of phospholipids into biodiesel is difficult and lengthy process revellame et al 2012 neutral lipids or triacylglycerols accumulate in two phases i kinetic phase accumulation of neutral lipids during the growth or exponential phase and ii stationary phase accumulation of neutral lipids in stationary phase nile red fluorescence technique has been widely used for determination of neutral lipid since this technique is quick easy and sensitive to quantify intracellular lipid in vivo pick and rachutin zalogin 2012 in this study nile red staining fluorescence technique was used to investigate the accumulation of intracellular lipids during growth cycle of microalgae and as well as a screening tool to select the batch conditions content high neutral intracellular lipid accumulation and it was noticed that nile red fluorescence was directly proportional to lipid accumulation in microalgae cells as shown in fig 3 few microscopic pictures of a platensis with significant different amount of lipid in cells are shown in fig 4 for comparisons 3 6 lipid extraction and characterization dynamic hexane lipid extraction method was used to study the feasibility of producing biodiesel from a platensis cultured under different conditions all samples of the algal oil obtained from a platensis were converted to methyl esters and analyzed for the fatty acid profiles using gc fid some fractions of the obtained methyl esters had become insoluble and formed precipitates when they were diluted into hexane for fame analysis the data as shown in fig 5 a had mentioned that culture in zarrouk s media is considered as nitrogen sufficient media whereas culture in cattle wastewater is considered as nitrogen deficient media the analysis of variance show that the variation of temperature from 25 c to 35 c mainly effect the composition of fatty acid while nitrogen content cause significant effects on the concentration of total fatty acids fig 5 b the major fames extracted from the a platensis in different medium and temperature are shown in fig 5 c other fatty acids e g c12 0 c14 0 c16 2 and 20 carbons are not shown because they were present only in traces the percentages of the major fames in the a platensis cultivated in this study were in accordance with other literature colla et al 2005 olguin et al 2001 the principal fatty acids present were palmitic linolenic and linoleic acid followed by oleic palmitoleic and stearic acid it was observed that the temperature from 25 c to 35 c had a positive effect and increased the percent of palmitoleic stearic oleic and linoleic in total lipid content but increasing the availability of nitrogen had a negative effect this study showed that the interaction of both factors nitrogen concentration and temperature were significant and should be taken into account instead of the individual effects of the two factors this study also proved that at all the three studied temperatures a platensis could produce more lipids in wastewater than in zarrouk s media the relationship between the concentration of the nitrogen source in the culture medium and the fatty acid content of a platensis has been studied by colla et al 2005 who have shown that reserve compounds accumulate during nitrogen depletion palmitic fatty acid was the most abandoned fatty acid found in a platensis which was present as high as 45 52 12 of the total lipid content of palmitic acid showed very less effect towards the factors changed during the study while linolenic acid decreased with the increase of temperature colla et al 2005 had mentioned that the content and composition of the fatty acids are temperature dependent in a platensis an increase in temperature reduces the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane lipids there are two reasons behind this fact first reason is homeo viscous adaptation under which the saturation of fatty acid is regulated by desaturase enzymes second reason was discussed by cohen et al 1987 and explained that at lower temperatures more dissolved oxygen was available in the culture medium for desaturase enzymes that are oxygen dependent although many previous researches had identified that the desaturase enzyme is responsible for the introduction of double bonds into saturated fatty acids meesapyodsuk et al 2001 mikami and murata 2003 but still the real mechanisms by which polyunsaturated fatty acids are synthesized are not completely understood alonso and maroto 2000 meesapyodsuk et al 2001 had discussed that the desc and desa desaturase enzymes are temperature independent and responsible for the first and second double bonds in the fatty acids this was the reason why palmitoleic and oleic acid reflected their concern more towards factor nitrogen rather than the factor temperature it was evident as shown in fig 4 that at different temperature content percentage of palmitoleic and oleic acid did not increase until and unless the medium was changed from sufficient to deficient nitrogen medium according to the above mentioned concept of temperature independent of desc and desa desaturase enzymes linoleic acid should also show the same trend as palmitoleic and oleic acid but its concentration varied with temperature meesapyodsuk et al 2001 had extended their discussion and mentioned that the desd desaturase responsible for the desaturation of linoleic acid c18 2 9 12 to linolenic acid c18 3 6 9 12 is temperature dependent and consequently linoleic acid c18 2 content can vary because it is a substrate for the desd desaturase during optimization of conditions it was found that the light intensities played a significant role in increasing the total quantity of lipid and enhance the percentage of saturated and monoenoic fatty acids in a platensis at optimum temperature 30 c different intensities of light influenced the biomass as well as lipid composition of algae as stated in section 3 4 2 the best condition we achieved was to culture a platensis in 160μmol m2 s till its initial exponential curve and rise to 300μmol m2 s at its late exponential phase it showed remarkable increase in biomass and lipid and decrease in percentage of highly unsaturated fatty acids a platensis cultured in 200μmol m2 s took slightly longer time to accumulate same biomass as in 160μmol m2 s there was very little decrease in percentage of unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid c18 2 linolenic acid c18 3 when it grew in 200μmol m2 s while in 160μmol m2 s light intensity the a platensis accumulated more linoleic acid c18 2 and linolenic acid c18 3 and less palmitic acid c16 0 and oleic acid c18 1 in hrap culture the fatty acid profile showed that the linoleic acid c18 2 and linolenic acid c18 3 in algal oil was slightly lesser than the algae grown in 160μmol m2 s but higher than the algae cultured in 160μmol m2 s till its initial exponential curve and rose to 300μmol m2 s at its late exponential phase in photo bioreactor that might happened because the alteration of light intensities were not possible in upscale culture of algae in hrap this proved that alteration of light intensities during culture can improve the quality of biodiesel and can lead it to the required standard en14214 as well as to enhance the total of lipid in dry weight of algal biomass table 4 co2 was another vital factor which influenced the growth of algae and accumulation of lipid in a platensis the microalgae are absolute miniature biochemical factories and appear more photosynthetically efficient than terrestrial plants patil et al 2008 and are efficient co2 fixers pokoo aikins et al 2010 the growth of algae requires co2 as one of the main nutrients needed the simple direct method of green house gases ghg mitigation is the removal of co2 from stack gases followed by long term sequestration of co2 by microalgae ponds hu et al 2008 there is an opportunity to sequester co2 by using flue gas emissions from industrial sources as the co2 feed for algae cultivation and produce the biofuel from the algae biomass although in this study we have used commercial co2 tank both carbon sequestration and bio diesel production from micro algae are popular subjects of research and development in this study the results clearly indicated that the co2 directly influenced the biomass of algae and hence the lipid in lab scale 1 l flask the 3 of co2 were found the optimum limit for maximum biomass production whereas more than 3 caused acidity to the media and eventually decreased the biomass while in hrap the highest tolerant limit was found to be 6 simultaneously it was also evident from the results that co2 caused production of triglycerols in short the biomass increased with the increase of co2 supply till optimum level in lab scale 1 l flask at limiting 0 5 co2 the percentage of free fatty acid in total lipid was found more than the algal lipid which was obtained at optimum 3 co2 and eventually the later favored the quality of biodiesel fatty acid composition in hrap at 6 co2 was found almost same as at 3 co2 in the lab scale although co2 optimization did not affect the quantity of unsaturated fatty acid for a platensis culture in either lab or hrap with wastewater 3 7 compositional analysis of algal biomass cultured at hrap and photo bioreactor biochemical and proximate analysis of biomass obtained from a platensis grown in hrap and under alteration intensities of light were analyzed for its compositions before and after lipid extraction and the results are listed in table 5 energy stored in a platensis cultured in photo bioreactor batch xi before and after lipid extraction was 24 35 and 20 15 mj kg 1 respectively while it was 23 11 and 20 67 mj kg 1 when cultured in hrap batch xiii which were quite comparable with the values cited by other researchers chinnasamy et al 2010 ranging from 20 to 25 mj kg 1 the energy values of algal biomass cultured in photo bioreactor and hrap were reduced by 17 26 and 10 56 respectively after lipid extraction it is interesting to note higher energy reduction in biomass obtained in photo bioreactor rather than hrap and the obvious reason is higher lipid contained in biomass cultured in photo bioreactor 3 8 biodiesel conversion in order to obtain the biodiesel from biomass of a platensis cultured in batch xi and xiii in dairy farm wastewater about 800 g of dry biomass were treated with dynamic hexane method to extract algal oil generally algal oil contains high value of free fatty acids which is an undesirable trait for biodiesel conversion process and this process is commonly resolved by acid catalyzed transesterification process xu et al 2006 it was necessary to go through an acid esterification process for free fatty acids present in algal oil to increase the yield of biodiesel in present study the free fatty acids were calculated as high as 30 in photobioreactor at 3 co2 under the altered intensities of light while in hrap the free fatty acid was found even less 21 and these were converted into fatty acid methyl esters fames via acid esterification process followed by alkaline catalyst process lipid extracts must be converted into fames so that the fuel will perform consistently in engines that burn traditional diesel fuel table 4 showed predominantly methyl esters of c16 0 palmitic c18 3 linolenic c18 2 linoleic c18 1 oleic c16 1 palmitoleic and c18 0 stearic european standard en 14214 2004 applied a condition on limit of 12 for c18 3 linolenic for quality vehicle biodiesel however the biodiesel produced by this study contained 15 68 of c18 3 linolenic at 30 c in photo bioreactor batch xi among all the attempts the best production of biodiesel was found at 3 co2 under the influence of altered light intensities 160 300 at 30 c in lab in general the composition of many microalgal oils is not suitable to stand with the en 14214 biodiesel standards because of the extent of unsaturation of microalgal oil chisti 2007 but this problem can be solved and the quality of biodiesel can be improved either by partial catalytic hydrogenation of the oil jang et al 2005 dijkstra 2006 or by blending with other sources of biodiesel obtained from non food feed stocks chinnasamy et al 2010 the quality and quantity of algal oil obtained from this study can be used for biodiesel production in this study the lipid were 30 45 and 26 25 while the biomass was found 5 35 g l 1 hyper concentrated and 4 01 g l 1 in photobioreactor and hrap respectively altogether the obtained biodiesel was found much better than several previous studies olguin et al 2001 obtained 28 6 lipid from arthrospira sp but the biomass obtained was as little as 0 38 g l 1 in complex medium tan and lin 2011 reported that 42 2 lipid can be obtained from scenedesmus rubescens like microalga under low nitrogen 3 mm and phosphate concentration 20 μm while the received biomass 1 105 g l 1 was significantly less than this study whereas chinnasamy et al 2010 worked on consortium of native algae and reported biomass production potential and lipid content as 0 041 g l 1d 1 and 6 82 respectively the cetane number table 6 achieved in the current study were higher than the previously reported biodiesel composition produced from heterotrophically grown a protothecoides lipids chen et al 2008 cetane number is a reverse function of a fuel s ignition interval the time period between the fuel injection and the first distinguishable pressure during its combustion the higher cetane number fuel combusts more easily in shorter ignition delay period than lower cetane fuels which results in less unburned fuel in the cylinder and less intense knock in the present study the predicted cetane number of the algal biodiesel were 58 78 and 54 82 while the energy content of the extracted algal oil were 41 91 and 40 45 mj kg 1 for batch xi and hrap respectively which were quite close to the fuel content energy of algal oil obtained by other researchers hena et al 2015b chinnasamy et al 2010 but lesser than the heating value 42 0 mj kg 1 of petroleum diesel after the extraction of lipid the energy stored in the residual algal biomass could be recovered by anaerobic digestion into biogas 4 conclusion the wastewater could support the growth of arthrospira platensis for the production of biodiesel a platensis shows a wide range of temperature tolerance however 30 c was found more suitable for lipid production change in intensity of light from 160 to 300 μmol m2 s during halfway exponential phase favors the production of saturated fatty acid in arthrospira platensis the recycling of wastewater nutrients in culture of a platensis can also contribute towards climate change adaptation and mitigation arthrospira platensis can reduce 98 cod as well as nutrient very efficiently within 4 5 days of culture acknowledgement this

19880,dairy cattle treated wastewaters are potential resources for production of microalgae biofuels a study was conducted to evaluate the capability of arthrospira platensis cultivated in dairy farm wastewater for biodiesel production the biomass of arthrospira platensis was found to be 4 98 g l 1 and produced 30 23 wt lipids to dry biomass cultivated in wastewater which was found nitrogen stressed in photo bioreactor the extracted lipid displayed a suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel although the content of linolenic acid was found a little higher than the standard en14214 it was found that nitrogen stressed medium increase the total lipid content but temperature and intensities of light were the most important factors to control the quantity of linolenic acid and hence the quality of biodiesel while the optimum co2 helped to achieve maximum biomass and triacylglycerols the arthrospira platensis offer a good option for the treatment of wastewater before final discharge graphical abstract dairy farm wastewater treatment and biodiesel production by arthrospira platensis cultivation image keywords phycoremediation arthrospira platensis wastewater treatment nutrients removal lipid profile 1 introduction exhausted water and petroleum resources have put the viability of algal biofuel into account although the idea of using microalgae as a source of biofuel is not new chisti 2007 in fact it has been known for more than five decades meher et al 2006 production of biodiesel from rejected cooking oil is also very common alsharifi et al 2017 demirbas 2005 felizardo et al 2006 but indeed it is now being taken seriously because of the well associated global warming with burning fossil fuels and escalating price of petroleum gavrilescu and chisti 2005 algal biodiesel is the best option to reduce the effects of global warming caused by burning fossil fuels the water requirement for algae culture is very high especially in open pond system but fortunately they are capable to grow in industrial farm municipal and agricultural wastewater umdu et al 2009 judd et al 2017 this contributes in treatment of wastewater by decreasing the value of cod bod and removal of heavy metals which can be used in other purposes such as irrigation munoz and guieysse 2006 on the other hand the reuse of nutrients present in wastewater for culturing algae to produce biodiesel efficiently contributes for wastewater treatment as well as controlling the algal bloom in the water bodies simultaneously culturing microalgae is the simple and direct method of sequestration of greenhouse gases ghg since the growth of algae requires co2 as one of the main nutrients needed other benefits in recycling wastewater are saving of freshwater and cost of media for culture as well as reducing eutrophication in water bodies therefore microalgae culture technology could offers an effective way for both sequestering flue gas co2 and removing nutrients from wastewater in a single process as well as providing a recoverable resource in the form of biofuel from subsequent extraction and conversion steps judd et al 2017 the variation in wastewater composition may limit the growth of biomass and as well as the profile of extracted lipid from algae chinnasamy et al 2010 therefore it is necessary to screen the strains of different microalgae for specific type of wastewater those algae are wise to grow in particular wastewater which could decrease the cod of wastewater effectively as well as could show high biomass with high lipid content and standard quality of lipid composition microalgae have been considered as a promising alternative source of biodiesel lorenz and cysewski 2003 sing et al 2005 spolaore et al 2006 other than biodiesel microalgae can produce many different types of biofuels methane and biohydrogen are produced by anaerobic digestion of the algal biomass spolaore et al 2006 and by photobiological method akkerman et al 2002 melis 2002 fedorov et al 2005 kapdan and kargi 2006 respectively algae can accumulate significant amounts of lipids in their cells which extend up to 50 of their dry cell weight in certain species chisti 2007 sheehan et al 1998 arthrospira platensis is well known for protein rich and low fat microalgal species large scale culture and harvesting are easy for a platensis and also this microalga is resistant to contamination balaji et al 2014 2015 2016 in spite of low fat content in a platensis it has been chosen as for the production of biodiesel in this study because of its well productive biomass in this study the performance of arthrospira platensis will be thoroughly investigated for biodiesel production and dairy cattle wastewater treatment simultaneously in open and close systems farm wastewater was low in salinity even then the challenge to grow halophilic algae arthrospira platensis was considered since it shows osmotic adjustment in high as well in low salinity culture condition of the wastewater by intracellular accumulation of the low molecular weight and high molecular weight carbohydrate respectively warr et al 1985 it has also been examined that low salinity favors to increase the biomass kebede 1997 the influence of light intensities on algal lipid and biomass will also be investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents methylation catalysts fame standards hexane and methanol were obtained from sigma aldrich switzerland all chemicals were analytical grade reagents 2 2 wastewater collection and analysis the wastewaters used in this study were collected from treatment plant fig 1 of a moderate size commercial cattle farm located at penang malaysia and due to the variation in wastewaters compositions with collection time the factory and farm effluents used as growth media were collected in a batch of two 1000 l containers and immediately stored at 4 c to minimize substrate decomposition before analysis prior to experimentation wastewater was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm for the settlement of excess colloidal particles to prevent forming flocs during algal cells culture therefore only the soluble fraction of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and other trace elements were considered in the wastewater 2 3 microalgae culture growth and maintenance arthrospira platensis was obtained from

leds and co2 controller 2 5 2 effect of light intensities the cultures were carried under four different intensities of light 80 120 160 and 200μmol m2 s to check the effect of light intensities on the biomass production and lipid content in a platensis the experiments were conducted in 1 l capacity flasks with 500 ml wastewater as growth medium in triplicates for 10 days under 1 5 co2 at 120 rpm in photo bioreactor at 30 c 2 5 3 effect of co2 on a platensis biomass to demonstrate the optimum co2 that could enhance the biomass as well as lipid accumulation in a platensis the cultures were conducted in three different doses of co2 0 5 1 1 5 3 and 5 the experiments were conducted in 1 l capacity flasks with 500 ml wastewater as growth medium in triplicates for 10 days at 120 rpm in photo bioreactor at 30 c in 160μmol m2 s at its initial exponential curve day 0 6 and rose to 300μmol m2 s at its late exponential phase day 7 10 abbreviated as 160 300μmol m2 s 2 6 upscale of a platensis biomass in high rate algae pond hrap the outdoor cultures of a platensis were upscaled in hrap the hrap were of single loop raceway with the dimensions of 2 5 m 0 7 m 0 7 m and mixed by paddle wheel 20 rpm the transparent corrugated acrylic roofs were fixed at a height of approximately 2 5 m above from the top of the pond to protect the algae from rain and to obtain the optimum intensities of sunlight 160 μmol m2 s the cultures were conducted at 6 co2 air mixture bubbled through the growth medium at a rate of 1 l min 1 with an irradiance range of 140 180 μmol m2 s and the tropical daylight dark cycle was close to 12 h 12 h for 10 days the recorded temperature for 10 days of culture growth medium varied from 27 to 32 c twelve batches of a platensis were grown in photo bioreactor and last batch xiii was grown in hrap the experimental design is shown in table 1 all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 7 nile red fluorescence analysis the accumulated neutral lipid in a platensis cultured in zarrouk medium and all the batches from i to xiii were measured at the end of exponential phase of growth 5 ml of algal suspensions were added with 0 01 ml of 2 ppm nile red solution in dimethylsulfoxide and agitated on a vortex vigorously for 1 min and kept in dark place for 10 min to incubation nile red indicator reacts with neutral lipid and emits golden yellow fluorescence fluorescence intensity of stained strains were measured using spectrofluorometer hitachi japan at an excitation and emission wavelength of 480 nm and 575 nm respectively doan et al 2011 as earlier mentioned by hena et al 2015a actual fluorescence intensity of stained neutral lipid was attained after subtraction of auto fluorescence of alga and self fluorescence of nile red at 575 nm all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 8 lipid extraction to assess the feasibility of producing biodiesel from a platensis the algae was cultivated in wastewater in hrap as well as 1 l capacity flasks with 500 ml growth medium all as batch i to xiii after 10 days the biomasses were harvested using a continuous flow centrifuge harvested algae were dried at 60 c for 24 h for extraction of lipids analysis lipids were extracted with hexane in a soxhlet apparatus operated at 80 c for 10 h hena et al 2015b after soxhlet extraction hexane was evaporated at 50 c and 100 mbar using a rotary evaporator the crude lipid was then re dissolved in hexane and stored into a sealed glass vial in the dark at 5 c for not more than 15 days all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 9 production of biodiesel from extracted algal lipid biodiesel from crude algal lipid was obtained by two step process crude lipid or oil containing more than 4 free fatty acids should go through an acid esterification process to increase the yield of biodiesel the first step used an acid esterification all reagents were added in stoichiometric excess in acid esterification process methanol and 10 h2so4 were added to the lipid in hexane solution stored in vial the mixture was transferred into a flask heated to 50 c and moderately agitated for 2 h in the second step 25 potassium methoxide kch3o in methanol was added drop wise until a ph value of 13 was attained halim et al 2011 to neutralize the excess acid added during acid esterification and to reduce the interference of water as contaminant addition of 25 potassium methoxide kch3o in methanol also helps to transmethylate acylglycerols and phospholipids lang et al 2001 the mixture was evaporated at 60 c to obtain fatty acid methyl ester fame all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 10 instrumental analysis of fame analysis of the obtained fame compositions was carried out using perkinelmer inc 600 gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid equipped with a sp 2340 fused silica column l i d 30 m 0 32 mm df 0 20 μm sigma aldrich helium was used as the carrier gas at constant flow rate of 1 5 ml min the oven temperature was raised from 150 c at 2ºc min to 200 c and maintained for 10 min both the injector and the fid temperatures were 210 c one μl sample of fame was injected into the column each sample was analyzed in triplicates individual fame was identified by comparison of its retention time with that of the mixed standard fame concentrations of different fames in the sample were quantified by comparing their peak areas with those obtained from the mixed standard fame of known concentration the cetane number of each fame was obtained by using the equ 1 as below ramírez verduzco et al 2012 1 ϕ i 7 8 0 302 m i 20 n where ϕ i is the cetane number of the ith fame m i represents the molecular weight of the ith fame and n is the number of double bonds in a given fame

and so on 2 11 quantification of common parameters to determine the chlorophyll 10 ml of homogenized algal cells were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min the algal pellet was exhaustively extracted with warm methanol at 40 c until it was colorless chinnasamy et al 2010 chlorophyll a was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer at 630 nm hena et al 2015a 2015b to calculate biomass whatman gf c glass fiber filters were dried at 60 c for 24 h total carbohydrate was quantified by the method of dubois et al 1956 using glucose as standard protein content was determined by the method of kjeldhal according to hungria and araujo 1994 total lipid quantification was done as mentioned in hena et al 2015b all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 12 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using spss software the combined effect of temperature 25 35 c and media sufficient and deficient nitrogen media on biomass total lipid and fatty acid profile were analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range test differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of cattle wastewater the cattle wastewater used in this study was analyzed for determining physico chemical characteristics in wastewater biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds total volatile solids tvs total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were analyzed and provided in table 2 concentration of phosphorus was found sufficient to support a platensis growth in wastewater hillebrand and sommer 1999 recommended 46 1 7 7 1 mass ratio of c n p for algal growth whereas in this study the wastewater used had n p ratio of 1 137 1 which indicated n limitation media the wastewater used was considered as favorable for production of algal lipids as other researchers had also found that the stress of n deficiency increased the lipid content in algal cell uslu et al 2011 olguin et al 2001 cultured a platensis to determine the amount of lipid in two different culture mediums zarrouk s and nitrogen deficient and recorded 28 6 lipid of total dry biomass cultured in nitrogen deficient medium which was higher than the lipid obtained from the algae cultured in zarrouk s media other parameters of wastewater for the present study were found within the safe range 3 2 microalgae culture and growth a 4 1gl 1 biomass and 12 32 lipid of dry weight biomass of a platensis were obtained during strain maintenance in standard zarrouk s media at specific conditions which has been described in section 2 3 and considered as control while uslu et al 2011 obtained 1 12gl 1 of biomass of a platensis in same media it was concluded that the reason of different biomasses obtained in same media might be due to the different conditions applied during culture such as low temperature ambient co2 and low light intensity had been applied by uslu et al 2011 comparing to present study the detailed discussions are available in 3 4 1 effect of temperature 3 4 2 effect of light intensities and 3 4 3 effect of co 2 3 3 preliminary test the growth of algae in wastewater showed a good response despite of low n and p concentration with efficient removal of cod 98 4 phang et al 2000 removed 98 0 cod from digested sago starch factory wastewater the biomass of a platensis was found 3 81gl 1 in wastewater which was lower than the biomass obtained from standard zarrouk s media 4 1gl 1 at 30 c temperature with an irradiance of 120 μmol m2 s and l d cycle of 12 12 h for 10 days under 1 5 co2 and continuous stirring at 120 rpm in photo bioreactor model infors ht minitron the nutrient consumption profile confirmed that po4 p and no3 n in the culture media was depleted in 4 days and reached up to 98 8 and 99 6 respectively whereas nh4 n was found zero even after a short period of 18 h of culture table 3 since the first day of culture the biomass and chlorophyll a increased with time but from 0 3 to 1 1gl 1 and 3 4 μg ml 1 to 12 2 μg ml 1 respectively after 4 days of incubation unexpectedly the biomass showed increasing trend although determination of chlorophyll a did not show any significant changes during culture finally the biomass increased by 246 from 1 1gl 1 to 3 81 gl 1 while the chlorophyll a only increased by 81 from 12 2 μg ml 1 to 22 8 μg ml 1 on day 10 however the nitrogen in the medium was depleted within 4 days of incubation hena et al 2015a and chinnasamy et al 2010 had also noticed the same trends the above observations clearly proved that growth in biomass after 4 days of incubation was due to increase in internal cellular nutrients rather than increase in number of algal cell in nitrogen limiting medium the carbon fixation during photosynthesis preferred synthesis of carbohydrate rather than to opt the path of protein synthesis fogg 1975 chinnasamy et al 2010 work of uslu et al 2011 also favored this concept 3 4 optimization conditions in a platensis for biomass and lipid production 3 4 1 effect of temperature a platensis shows a wide range of temperature tolerance it was observed that microalgae growth increased with temperature from 25 c to 30 c at 35 c the chlorophyll a decreased and hence the growth decreased according to oliveira et al 1999 from observations of different strains of arthrospira the optimal growth temperature was between 25 c and 35 c while with higher temperature injury occurred to algae cells therefore it was decided to verify the growth and associated lipid profile of a platensis in between 25 c and 35 c of temperature range it was evident from table 4 that the highest biomass of a platensis was achieved at 30 c the temperature showed negative effect on biomass at 35 c although the lipid content in dry weight of biomass increased with temperature from 25 c to 35 c considering both the factors lipid content g 1 and obtained biomass l 1 into account it was observed that the total lipid from culture at 30 c was more than at 35 c 3 4 2 effect of light intensities the experiment revealed that biomass increased as the intensities of light increased the biomass increased till 160μmol m2 s without altering the lag phase 1 day whereas at 200μmol m2 s the a platensis showed long lag phase 3 4 days at 160μmol m2 s the a platensis reach the maximum growth in shorter time 10 days than at 200μmol m2 s about 16 days when the algal cells were cultured under high illumination photosystem ii is continuously damaged and repaired which indeed take long time to reach exponential phase of culture in the presence of a significant cells shading high light cultures 300μmol m2 s had found beneficial effects in the late exponential phase day 7 and onward as shown in fig 2 for obtaining higher concentrations of biomass to achieve maximum lipid it was interesting to note that a platensis cultured in 160μmol m2 s at its initial exponential curve day 0 6 and rose to 300μmol m2 s at its late exponential phase day 7 10 showed decrease in percentage of highly unsaturated fatty acids table 4 at lab scale in photo bioreactor it was easy to manipulate the intensity of light during the culture at late exponential phase although it was not possible to change the intensity of light at late exponential phase in hrap during upscale since the transparent corrugated acrylic roof was fixed and only transmit from 140 to 210μmol m2 s range 3 4 3 effect of co2 a platensis was grown under three different doses of co2 for 12 h continuous illumination of 160μmol m2 s and 12 h dark alternatively at 30 c under optimum illumination 160μmol m2 s a platensis has shown maximum growth at 3 v v co2 while at elevated condition 5 the growth showed significant decrease in biomass due to the acidity caused by excess co2 and the ph of the media was dropped to 5 8 within 24 h interestingly our results in this experiment indicated that culture in optimum 160μmol m2 s or optimum to high illumination 160 300μmol m2 s of light at limiting co2 0 5 obtained less biomass and hence less lipid accumulation this is because the efficiency of the calvin benson cycle was probably limiting while at optimum to high illumination 160 300μmol m2 s of light and excess co2 3 downstream of carbon dioxide fixation were more likely triggered triacylglycerols biosynthesis and showed highest biomass as well as lipid while in hrap cultivation the nutrients was constant since every batch was cultivated in one time stored wastewater it was interesting to note that during upscale culture of a platensis in hrap the maximum biomass was collected at 6 co2 air mixture bubbled through the growth medium wastewater for 10 days the temperature varies from 32 to 27 c during day and night respectively with an irradiance range of 140 210 μmol m2 s self shading effects of algal cells were minimized by the deliberate use of shallow tanks culture depth 0 5 m however it was difficult to control all parameters in hrap during the culture and hence the biomass obtained in hrap was less than the biomass obtained in lab at optimum temperature 30 c while the lipid accumulation was little higher 3 5 neutral lipid analysis main constituent of total lipids in algal cells include neutral lipids or triacylglycerols in the form of reserved energy and polar lipids phospholipids and glycolipids essential structural component of membranes neutral lipids accumulation depends on several factors such as temperature light available nutrients as well as species specificity doan et al 2011 chen et al 2008 although both neutral and polar lipids can be converted to biodiesel ichihara et al 2010 but neutral lipids are highly desirable fractions as neutral lipids or triacylglycerols can be easily converted into biodiesel while conversion of phospholipids into biodiesel is difficult and lengthy process revellame et al 2012 neutral lipids or triacylglycerols accumulate in two phases i kinetic phase accumulation of neutral lipids during the growth or exponential phase and ii stationary phase accumulation of neutral lipids in stationary phase nile red fluorescence technique has been widely used for determination of neutral lipid since this technique is quick easy and sensitive to quantify intracellular lipid in vivo pick and rachutin zalogin 2012 in this study nile red staining fluorescence technique was used to investigate the accumulation of intracellular lipids during growth cycle of microalgae and as well as a screening tool to select the batch conditions content high neutral intracellular lipid accumulation and it was noticed that nile red fluorescence was directly proportional to lipid accumulation in microalgae cells as shown in fig 3 few microscopic pictures of a platensis with significant different amount of lipid in cells are shown in fig 4 for comparisons 3 6 lipid extraction and characterization dynamic hexane lipid extraction method was used to study the feasibility of producing biodiesel from a platensis cultured under different conditions all samples of the algal oil obtained from a platensis were converted to methyl esters and analyzed for the fatty acid profiles using gc fid some fractions of the obtained methyl esters had become insoluble and formed precipitates when they were diluted into hexane for fame analysis the data as shown in fig 5 a had mentioned that culture in zarrouk s media is considered as nitrogen sufficient media whereas culture in cattle wastewater is considered as nitrogen deficient media the analysis of variance show that the variation of temperature from 25 c to 35 c mainly effect the composition of fatty acid while nitrogen content cause significant effects on the concentration of total fatty acids fig 5 b the major fames extracted from the a platensis in different medium and temperature are shown in fig 5 c other fatty acids e g c12 0 c14 0 c16 2 and 20 carbons are not shown because they were present only in traces the percentages of the major fames in the a platensis cultivated in this study were in accordance with other literature colla et al 2005 olguin et al 2001 the principal fatty acids present were palmitic linolenic and linoleic acid followed by oleic palmitoleic and stearic acid it was observed that the temperature from 25 c to 35 c had a positive effect and increased the percent of palmitoleic stearic oleic and linoleic in total lipid content but increasing the availability of nitrogen had a negative effect this study showed that the interaction of both factors nitrogen concentration and temperature were significant and should be taken into account instead of the individual effects of the two factors this study also proved that at all the three studied temperatures a platensis could produce more lipids in wastewater than in zarrouk s media the relationship between the concentration of the nitrogen source in the culture medium and the fatty acid content of a platensis has been studied by colla et al 2005 who have shown that reserve compounds accumulate during nitrogen depletion palmitic fatty acid was the most abandoned fatty acid found in a platensis which was present as high as 45 52 12 of the total lipid content of palmitic acid showed very less effect towards the factors changed during the study while linolenic acid decreased with the increase of temperature colla et al 2005 had mentioned that the content and composition of the fatty acids are temperature dependent in a platensis an increase in temperature reduces the composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane lipids there are two reasons behind this fact first reason is homeo viscous adaptation under which the saturation of fatty acid is regulated by desaturase enzymes second reason was discussed by cohen et al 1987 and explained that at lower temperatures more dissolved oxygen was available in the culture medium for desaturase enzymes that are oxygen dependent although many previous researches had identified that the desaturase enzyme is responsible for the introduction of double bonds into saturated fatty acids meesapyodsuk et al 2001 mikami and murata 2003 but still the real mechanisms by which polyunsaturated fatty acids are synthesized are not completely understood alonso and maroto 2000 meesapyodsuk et al 2001 had discussed that the desc and desa desaturase enzymes are temperature independent and responsible for the first and second double bonds in the fatty acids this was the reason why palmitoleic and oleic acid reflected their concern more towards factor nitrogen rather than the factor temperature it was evident as shown in fig 4 that at different temperature content percentage of palmitoleic and oleic acid did not increase until and unless the medium was changed from sufficient to deficient nitrogen medium according to the above mentioned concept of temperature independent of desc and desa desaturase enzymes linoleic acid should also show the same trend as palmitoleic and oleic acid but its concentration varied with temperature meesapyodsuk et al 2001 had extended their discussion and mentioned that the desd desaturase responsible for the desaturation of linoleic acid c18 2 9 12 to linolenic acid c18 3 6 9 12 is temperature dependent and consequently linoleic acid c18 2 content can vary because it is a substrate for the desd desaturase during optimization of conditions it was found that the light intensities played a significant role in increasing the total quantity of lipid and enhance the percentage of saturated and monoenoic fatty acids in a platensis at optimum temperature 30 c different intensities of light influenced the biomass as well as lipid composition of algae as stated in section 3 4 2 the best condition we achieved was to culture a platensis in 160μmol m2 s till its initial exponential curve and rise to 300μmol m2 s at its late exponential phase it showed remarkable increase in biomass and lipid and decrease in percentage of highly unsaturated fatty acids a platensis cultured in 200μmol m2 s took slightly longer time to accumulate same biomass as in 160μmol m2 s there was very little decrease in percentage of unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid c18 2 linolenic acid c18 3 when it grew in 200μmol m2 s while in 160μmol m2 s light intensity the a platensis accumulated more linoleic acid c18 2 and linolenic acid c18 3 and less palmitic acid c16 0 and oleic acid c18 1 in hrap culture the fatty acid profile showed that the linoleic acid c18 2 and linolenic acid c18 3 in algal oil was slightly lesser than the algae grown in 160μmol m2 s but higher than the algae cultured in 160μmol m2 s till its initial exponential curve and rose to 300μmol m2 s at its late exponential phase in photo bioreactor that might happened because the alteration of light intensities were not possible in upscale culture of algae in hrap this proved that alteration of light intensities during culture can improve the quality of biodiesel and can lead it to the required standard en14214 as well as to enhance the total of lipid in dry weight of algal biomass table 4 co2 was another vital factor which influenced the growth of algae and accumulation of lipid in a platensis the microalgae are absolute miniature biochemical factories and appear more photosynthetically efficient than terrestrial plants patil et al 2008 and are efficient co2 fixers pokoo aikins et al 2010 the growth of algae requires co2 as one of the main nutrients needed the simple direct method of green house gases ghg mitigation is the removal of co2 from stack gases followed by long term sequestration of co2 by microalgae ponds hu et al 2008 there is an opportunity to sequester co2 by using flue gas emissions from industrial sources as the co2 feed for algae cultivation and produce the biofuel from the algae biomass although in this study we have used commercial co2 tank both carbon sequestration and bio diesel production from micro algae are popular subjects of research and development in this study the results clearly indicated that the co2 directly influenced the biomass of algae and hence the lipid in lab scale 1 l flask the 3 of co2 were found the optimum limit for maximum biomass production whereas more than 3 caused acidity to the media and eventually decreased the biomass while in hrap the highest tolerant limit was found to be 6 simultaneously it was also evident from the results that co2 caused production of triglycerols in short the biomass increased with the increase of co2 supply till optimum level in lab scale 1 l flask at limiting 0 5 co2 the percentage of free fatty acid in total lipid was found more than the algal lipid which was obtained at optimum 3 co2 and eventually the later favored the quality of biodiesel fatty acid composition in hrap at 6 co2 was found almost same as at 3 co2 in the lab scale although co2 optimization did not affect the quantity of unsaturated fatty acid for a platensis culture in either lab or hrap with wastewater 3 7 compositional analysis of algal biomass cultured at hrap and photo bioreactor biochemical and proximate analysis of biomass obtained from a platensis grown in hrap and under alteration intensities of light were analyzed for its compositions before and after lipid extraction and the results are listed in table 5 energy stored in a platensis cultured in photo bioreactor batch xi before and after lipid extraction was 24 35 and 20 15 mj kg 1 respectively while it was 23 11 and 20 67 mj kg 1 when cultured in hrap batch xiii which were quite comparable with the values cited by other researchers chinnasamy et al 2010 ranging from 20 to 25 mj kg 1 the energy values of algal biomass cultured in photo bioreactor and hrap were reduced by 17 26 and 10 56 respectively after lipid extraction it is interesting to note higher energy reduction in biomass obtained in photo bioreactor rather than hrap and the obvious reason is higher lipid contained in biomass cultured in photo bioreactor 3 8 biodiesel conversion in order to obtain the biodiesel from biomass of a platensis cultured in batch xi and xiii in dairy farm wastewater about 800 g of dry biomass were treated with dynamic hexane method to extract algal oil generally algal oil contains high value of free fatty acids which is an undesirable trait for biodiesel conversion process and this process is commonly resolved by acid catalyzed transesterification process xu et al 2006 it was necessary to go through an acid esterification process for free fatty acids present in algal oil to increase the yield of biodiesel in present study the free fatty acids were calculated as high as 30 in photobioreactor at 3 co2 under the altered intensities of light while in hrap the free fatty acid was found even less 21 and these were converted into fatty acid methyl esters fames via acid esterification process followed by alkaline catalyst process lipid extracts must be converted into fames so that the fuel will perform consistently in engines that burn traditional diesel fuel table 4 showed predominantly methyl esters of c16 0 palmitic c18 3 linolenic c18 2 linoleic c18 1 oleic c16 1 palmitoleic and c18 0 stearic european standard en 14214 2004 applied a condition on limit of 12 for c18 3 linolenic for quality vehicle biodiesel however the biodiesel produced by this study contained 15 68 of c18 3 linolenic at 30 c in photo bioreactor batch xi among all the attempts the best production of biodiesel was found at 3 co2 under the influence of altered light intensities 160 300 at 30 c in lab in general the composition of many microalgal oils is not suitable to stand with the en 14214 biodiesel standards because of the extent of unsaturation of microalgal oil chisti 2007 but this problem can be solved and the quality of biodiesel can be improved either by partial catalytic hydrogenation of the oil jang et al 2005 dijkstra 2006 or by blending with other sources of biodiesel obtained from non food feed stocks chinnasamy et al 2010 the quality and quantity of algal oil obtained from this study can be used for biodiesel production in this study the lipid were 30 45 and 26 25 while the biomass was found 5 35 g l 1 hyper concentrated and 4 01 g l 1 in photobioreactor and hrap respectively altogether the obtained biodiesel was found much better than several previous studies olguin et al 2001 obtained 28 6 lipid from arthrospira sp but the biomass obtained was as little as 0 38 g l 1 in complex medium tan and lin 2011 reported that 42 2 lipid can be obtained from scenedesmus rubescens like microalga under low nitrogen 3 mm and phosphate concentration 20 μm while the received biomass 1 105 g l 1 was significantly less than this study whereas chinnasamy et al 2010 worked on consortium of native algae and reported biomass production potential and lipid content as 0 041 g l 1d 1 and 6 82 respectively the cetane number table 6 achieved in the current study were higher than the previously reported biodiesel composition produced from heterotrophically grown a protothecoides lipids chen et al 2008 cetane number is a reverse function of a fuel s ignition interval the time period between the fuel injection and the first distinguishable pressure during its combustion the higher cetane number fuel combusts more easily in shorter ignition delay period than lower cetane fuels which results in less unburned fuel in the cylinder and less intense knock in the present study the predicted cetane number of the algal biodiesel were 58 78 and 54 82 while the energy content of the extracted algal oil were 41 91 and 40 45 mj kg 1 for batch xi and hrap respectively which were quite close to the fuel content energy of algal oil obtained by other researchers hena et al 2015b chinnasamy et al 2010 but lesser than the heating value 42 0 mj kg 1 of petroleum diesel after the extraction of lipid the energy stored in the residual algal biomass could be recovered by anaerobic digestion into biogas 4 conclusion the wastewater could support the growth of arthrospira platensis for the production of biodiesel a platensis shows a wide range of temperature tolerance however 30 c was found more suitable for lipid production change in intensity of light from 160 to 300 μmol m2 s during halfway exponential phase favors the production of saturated fatty acid in arthrospira platensis the recycling of wastewater nutrients in culture of a platensis can also contribute towards climate change adaptation and mitigation arthrospira platensis can reduce 98 cod as well as nutrient very efficiently within 4 5 days of culture acknowledgement this

19881,microorganisms inhabiting filtration media of a drinking water treatment plant can be beneficial because they metabolize biodegradable organic matter from source waters and those formed during disinfection processes leading to the production of biologically stable drinking water however which microbial consortia colonize filters and what metabolic capacity they possess remain to be investigated to gain insights into these issues we performed metagenome sequencing and analysis of microbial communities in three different filters of a full scale drinking water treatment plant dwtp filter communities were sampled from a rapid sand filter rsf granular activated carbon filter gac and slow sand filter ssf and from the schmutzdecke scm a biologically active scum layer accumulated on top of ssf respectively analysis of community phylogenetic structure revealed that the filter bacterial communities significantly differed from those in the source water and final effluent communities respectively network analysis identified a filter specific colonization pattern of bacterial groups bradyrhizobiaceae were abundant in gac whereas nitrospira were enriched in the sand associated filters rsf scm and ssf the gac community was enriched with functions associated with aromatics degradation many of which were encoded by rhizobiales 30 of the total gac community predicting minimum generation time mgt of prokaryotic communities suggested that the gac community potentially select fast growers 15 h of mgt among the four filter communities consistent with the highest dissolved organic matter removal rate by gac our findings provide new insights into the community phylogenetic structure colonization pattern and metabolic capacity that potentially contributes to organic matter removal achieved in the biofiltration stages of the full scale dwtp graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofiltration drinking water treatment microbial community metagenomics 1 introduction microbial growth in a drinking water distribution system dwds causes undesirable consequences which include a decline in water quality taste odor problem turbidity clogging corrosion and health risk e g pathogen occurrence accordingly residual disinfectants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine are commonly used to limit the unwanted growth of microorganisms in a dwds while this approach has been successful in the majority of drinking water treatment plants dwpts over the world dwtps in several european countries e g switzerland austria germany and the netherlands produce drinking water effluents without such residual disinfectants hambsch 1999 hammes et al 2010 these dwtps instead remove organic nutrients essential for microbial regrowth which eventually help achieve biological stability of the drinking water without the aid of residual disinfectants the treatment train of such dwtps include a combination of ozonation and filtration in series lautenschlager et al 2014 2013 smeets et al 2008 filtration processes using various filter media such as granular activated carbon gac sand and or anthracite can remove a wide range of organic and inorganic matter filter materials serve as excellent supporting media for microbial growth due to the high surface area to volume ratio thus in addition to the physicochemical route e g straining and sorption microbial consortia colonizing pores and surfaces of filter particles contribute to remove various contaminants including taste odor causing compounds and trace organic compounds e g industrial chemicals pesticides and pharmaceuticals and personal care products given the fact that biological contaminant removal during filtration steps is important for producing biologically stable drinking water elucidating which microorganisms colonize and how they metabolize unwanted compounds are essential for the sustainable predictive operation of biofiltration based dwtps contaminant removal biological stability of water and bacterial community dynamics in the biofiltration based full scale dwtp operated in zurich switzerland was previously documented hammes et al 2010 lautenschlager et al 2014 2013 the plant treats surface water from lake zurich and provides drinking water to about 40 of the city s residents the unit processes of the plant consist of pre ozonation rapid sand filter rsf intermediate ozonation gac filtration and slow sand filter ssf using the successive ozonation and filtration steps the plant produces the drinking water effluent with approximately 105 cells ml 0 8 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc and 40 μg l of assimilable organic carbon lautenschlager et al 2014 although residual disinfectants were not added to the final effluent bacterial abundance was found to be stable through the dwds at least 7 km from the plant indicating the biological stability of the produced drinking water hammes et al 2010 while the ozonation was primarily responsible for disinfection the three filtration steps were indeed responsible for the doc removal achieved by the dwtp lautenschlager et al 2014 since all filter materials harbor over 109 cells cm3 and show catalytic enzyme activities such as esterase phenoloxidase and phenolperoxidase lautenschlager et al 2014 some extent of the organic matter removal by filtration steps should be microbially mediated a previous study reported that the bacterial community structure at the phylum level is similar across the filters however the rate and type of organic matter e g humic substances building blocks neutrals and polysaccharides removed differ significantly among the three filters lautenschlager et al 2014 the latter result implied that there might be filter specific microbial taxa metabolism particularly in relation to the organic matter removals achieved through the successive filters the main objective of this study was therefore to characterize the metabolic versatility that might be differential among the successive filter communities and thus that might contribute to the differential organic matter removals in the dwtp previously reported lautenschlager et al 2014 hence we performed metagenomic analysis of microbial communities taken from the filter biomass our metagenomic study uncovered the filter specific colonization and metabolic profiles of filter microbial communities in addition we provide genomic characteristics of filter communities reflecting the filter biofilm ecosystem and its associated microbial life style overall our work provides new genomic view on the ecology of filter biofilm communities and population specific metabolism that can facilitate the organic matter removals which has an important implication relevance to biofiltration based dwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling dna extraction and metagenome sequencing triplicate filter biomass samples were collected from rapid sand filter rsf granular activated carbon filter gac slow sand filter ssf and the schmutzdecke scm respectively triplicate samples were taken from ssf and scm respectively in parallel filters the rsf and gac samples were taken after backwashing suggesting that the biomass samples could represent those from the entire depth of the filters sample preparation and dna extraction were performed as described previously lautenschlager et al 2014 triplicate dna aliquots i e resulting from filter biomass samples were combined into a single dna pool for metagenome sequencing about 5 μg of a dna aliquot was sequenced using the illumina ga ii sequencer 100 bp paired end reads at the roy j carver biotechnology center at the university of illinois at urbana champaign 2 2 metagenomic sequence analysis metagenomic datasets were first trimmed using a q 20 phred quality score cutoff using solexaqa2 cox et al 2010 idba ud peng et al 2012 was used to assemble the trimmed metagenomic reads into contigs using the pre correction option and a range of k mer from 20 to 100 with a step increase of 20 with other parameters at default settings for taxonomic analysis metagenomic reads were searched against the silva small subunit ribosomal rna ssu rrna gene database 16s and 18s quast et al 2013 using blastn with a cutoff of 70 nucleotide identity and 90 query length coverage the blastn search results were used to determine the taxonomic affiliation at the domain and phylum level respectively metagenomic reads were also searched against all bacterial and archaeal genome sequences available in the genbank database ftp ftp ncbi nih gov using blastx with a cut off of 50 identity and 90 query length coverage the blastx search results were used to estimate relative abundance of microbial taxa at the phylum and genus level respectively for functional annotation protein coding genes were predicted on the assembled contigs using metagenemark zhu et al 2010 the protein coding genes and metagenomic reads were searched against the seed subsystem using a blastp and blastx search respectively with a cut off of 50 identity and 90 query length coverage relative abundance of a taxon functional category was determined as the number of matches to a reference taxon functional category normalized by the total number of matches as described previously oh et al 2014a b to estimate an average genome size ags of a prokaryotic community million reads were randomly drawn 100 times from a metagenomic dataset the ags of a metagenomic dataset was estimated using microbecensus nayfach and pollard 2015 with 100 permutations a minimum generation time mgt of a prokaryotic community was predicted using growthpred as described previously vieira silva and rocha 2010 growthpred predicts minimum doubling time based on codon usage bias using genomic or metagenomic datasets the protein coding genes recovered from a metagenomic dataset were used to estimate the mgt using growthpred with the parameters temperature 4 c and the other parameters at default settings 2 3 16s rrna gene pyrosequence analysis raw 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequence data the hypervariable v4v5 region positions 515 909 of bacterial communities resulting from the source waters via the full scale dwtp to the dwds were obtained from the two previous studies lautenschlager et al 2014 2013 the 16s rrna gene sequence data were pre processed and analyzed according to the 454 sop pipeline schloss et al 2009 in brief barcode primer and ambiguous sequences were first filtered out the remaining sequences were removed using the following parameters minimum length 200 average quality score 35 and maximum length of homopolymer 8 the preprocessed sequences were searched against the silva 16s rrna gene database using blastn with a cutoff of 70 nucleotide identity and 90 query length coverage the blastn search results were used to estimate relative abundance of bacterial taxa as conducted on the metagenomic data the taxonomic composition of bacterial communities at the phylum and genus level respectively was compared to those obtained from the metagenomic analysis 2 4 nucleotide sequence accession number the metagenomic datasets used in this study were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers srr5680088 rsf srr5680089 gac srr5680086 scm and srr5680087 ssf 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter bacterial communities differ from those of source and effluent waters the illumina ga ii analyzer yielded 3 5 to 4 gbp of metagenomic data per sample table 1 describes the statistics of all metagenomic datasets generated in this study fig s1 shows the best match analysis results of all metagenomic reads against all bacterial and archaeal genome database outer circles proteobacteria 57 12 of the total dominated the four prokaryotic communities followed by bacteroidetes 10 1 firmicutes 7 3 and actinobacteria 5 1 the analysis of the metagenomic reads encoding 16s rrna gene sequences inner circles showed similar relative abundance of the major phyla fig s1 the bacterial community composition estimated using 16s rrna gene pyrosequence data was used to perform the principal component analysis pca fig 1 communities clustered closely together within each group and showed a substantial distance in the bacterial community structure among source water filter and final effluent communities the average similarity of the phylogenetic structure estimated based on the bray curtis distance metric was 0 43 0 03 filter vs source water communities 0 56 0 08 filter vs effluent communities and 0 41 0 01 source water vs effluent communities a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova test anderson 2001 showed that the phylogenetic structure of the filter bacterial communities differed significantly from those of the source waters and effluents respectively bonferroni corrected p 0 05 a similarity percentage simper analysis clarke 1993 identified several phyla classes that mainly contributed to distinguish among the three groups of bacterial communities actinobacteria alphaproteobacteria acidobacteria betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria 49 0 and deltaproteobacteria 14 2 were overrepresented in the source and effluent communities respectively alphaproteobacteria 27 1 betaproteoacteria 15 7 and acidobacteria 14 2 were enriched in the filter bacterial communities compared to the others the three taxa substantially contributed to discriminate the filter bacterial communities from the source 35 of the total dissimilarity and effluent communities 43 respectively it was reported that the bacterial community structure in the effluent of a filter e g gac effluent tends to resemble that in the filter e g gac lautenschlager et al 2014 this tendency was observed to some degree since the effluent communities were more closely related 0 61 of the bray curtis distance to the communities of ssf the last unit process compared to the distance between the source water and the effluent communities 0 42 nevertheless the pca of this study suggested that the phylogenetic structure of the filter communities was distinct from that in the final effluent communities p 0 05 by permanova test these results are congruent with other previous studies reporting that bacterial community composition in filters differs from that in final effluents the differentiation primarily resulted from final disinfection and or bacteria that preferentially attach to filter surfaces and thus that were not released with effluents pinto et al 2012 since the zurich dwtp produces final effluents without residual disinfectants the discrimination of the filter bacterial communities from the effluent communities could be attributable to those particularly overrepresenting in filters e g alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and acidobacteria as well as other factors these results called further metagenomic investigation to address what specific microbial populations inhabit the filter media 3 2 bacterial taxa particularly enriched in the successive filters the taxonomic analysis of the metagenomic reads fig 2 a identified dominant bacterial genera 1 of the total prokaryotic community in the four filter communities fig 2a shows an array of bacterial genera belonging to alphaproteobacteria afipia bradyrhizobium hyphomicrobium methylobacterium nitrobacter rhizobium rhodopseudomonas and sphingomonas betaproteobacteria acidovorax burkholderia and polaromonas and acidobacteria solibacter which were overrepresented in the filter communities fig 1 bradyrhizobium 4 7 6 4 and nitrospira 4 0 1 6 were found to be two of the most abundant genera in the four filter communities fig 2a based on the metagenomic datasets the relative abundance of the two genera from the source water via the dwtp to the dwds was measured using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence data fig s2 bradyrhizobium were enriched in gac 4 4 compared to those in the source 0 1 waters and effluent and dwds waters 0 05 0 04 nitrospira were overrepresented in rsf 9 5 and ssf 6 1 compared to the source waters 0 25 and effluent and dwds waters 1 4 0 6 these results suggested that the significant enrichment p 0 05 by mann whitney u test of bradyrhizobium and nitrospira within gac and sand filters respectively compared to both prefiltration the source waters and postfiltration the final effluents and dwds stages while the two genera were present in the filters they occurred differentially in relative abundance among the successive filters bradyrhizobium were particularly enriched in the gac community 15 whereas nitrospira were the most dominant 4 7 in the sand associated filter communities rsf scm and ssf hence we performed a network analysis to quantitatively assess whether there is a positive co occurrence or negative mutual exclusion association in relative abundance between any major genera the network analysis fig 2b using the pearson correlation metric revealed that nitrospira had a negative association pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 7 with p 0 05 with bradyrhizobium rhodopseudomonas and afipia respectively in addition the analysis revealed a positive association r 0 7 with p 0 05 of rhodopseudomonas with bradyrhizobium and afipia respectively notably bradyrhizobium rhodopseudomonas and afipia belonging to bradyrhizobiaceae were collectively enriched 7 fold in the gac whereas nitrospira were overrepresented 3 fold in the sand associated filters a positive association between two taxa detected in this study may indicate a mutualistic interaction or sharing the same ecological niche without direct biological interactions accordingly we encourage future experiments investigating temporal dynamics and co occurrence network patterns of organisms within a filter in the plant which will provide insights into biological interactions within the filter nitrospira are enriched in filter associated biofilms e g trickling filter and found to be abundant up to half of the total microbial community in oligotrophic waters such as those in drinking water treatment plants and distribution networks palomo et al 2016 vignola et al 2017 it is noted that the ammonia concentration in the raw water decreased more than 50 through the zurich plant lautenschlager et al 2014 although nitrification was not an essential process of the plant nitrification involves two biological sequential steps where ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite which is further oxidized to nitrate the two steps were thought to be mediated by two phylogenetically distinct groups however recent studies have shown that a single organism comammox carries out a complete ammonia oxidation and the organism is phylogenetically affiliated with nitrospira daims et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 our taxonomic results obtained by both metagenome and pyrosequence data showed that nitrospira are much more overrepresented than frequently reported nitrifying organisms e g nitrosomonas and nitrobacter in all the filters hence our results and the phylogeny and physiology of comammox collectively implied that the nitrification achieved in the plant might be primarily carried out by the nitrospira population presumable comammox particularly enriched in the filters binning of the assembled contigs was performed based on metagenomic read coverage tetranucleotide frequency and the occurrence of unique marker genes as described previously oh et al 2014a b using maxbin wu et al 2014 unfortunately the genome bin showed a low genome completeness 50 and the genetic signature of comammox e g ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase was not detected in a contig assigned to the nitrospira genome bin we therefore suggest future genomic and phenotypic characterizations of the nitrospira population in relation to the comammox capacity which will allow a systematic assessment of the nitrification potential of drinking water by a biofiltration based dwtp 3 3 metabolic pathways differentially enriched among the filters functional annotation of all metagenomic reads using the seed subsystem revealed metabolic pathways differentially abundant among filter community metagenomic datasets fig 3 first hierarchical clustering analysis using the metabolic profiles revealed that the sand associated filter communities were closely related to each other 0 982 0 005 of bray curtis distance in contrast to the relatively distant relatedness 0 960 0 009 between the gac and the sand associated communities fig 3a notably the metabolic pathway associated with aromatics degradation was the most significantly enriched in the gac community p 0 05 the sub functional categories of the aromatics metabolism were divided into the central peripheral and anaerobic degradation pathways in the seed subsystem the metagenomic reads assigned to each sub functional category were normalized by the total reads assigned to the aromatics metabolism pathway the analysis revealed that the central 36 and peripheral 52 degradation pathways were more pronounced than the anaerobic degradation pathway 12 in the gac community this observation led to the question of which organisms are potentially responsible for the functions associated with the aromatics degradation metabolism to address this we examined the taxonomic affiliation of the metagenomic reads encoding the central and peripheral degradation metabolism respectively a best match blastx analysis of the metagenomic reads i e those associated with aromatics metabolism against all archaeal and bacterial genome sequences was performed the analysis identified major genera carrying the aromatics degradation genes such as bradyrhizobium 30 and 23 for the central and peripheral pathway respectively burkholderia 3 and 8 afipia 3 and 1 ralstonia 1 and 3 polaromonas 2 and 2 rhodopseudomonas 2 and 2 and rhizobium 2 and 2 members of the rhizobiales bradyrhizobium afipia rhodopseudomonas and rhizobium were the major group encoding the central 37 and peripheral 27 aromatics degradation pathways among the total gac community rhizobiales are frequently detected in gac filters that receive pre ozonated surface waters in dwtps niemi et al 2009 given the higher abundance of rhizobiales within filters and postfiltration stages compared to prefiltration they were suggested as leaky filter colonizers pinto et al 2012 rhizobiales are widely distributed in soil environments and include bacteria capable of fixing nitrogen in symbiosys with leguminous plants while rhizobiales are metabolically versatile and are found to be abundant in biologically active gac filters how they are selected in the gac filters remains unknown rhizobiales genomes encode a variety of aromatics degradation genes and aromatic compounds stimulate the growth of rhizobiales in the rhizosphere latha and mahadevan 1997 teng et al 2015 a recent study reported that more than half of natural organic matters noms in river waters contain aromatic compounds cao et al 2015 given our metagenomic results and literature the aromatics bound noms are likely primarily biodegraded in gac where the rhizobiales e g bradyrhizobium potentially play a key role in removing the aromatic noms from the water when source waters were treated through the successive filters organic carbons were disproportionately removed in each filtration stage and in particular polymeric compounds e g polysaccharides were largely removed in the last filtration step ssf lautenschlager et al 2014 hence the relative abundance of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides metabolic pathways was assessed respectively fig 3d although the polysaccharides metabolic pathways showed a detectable increase in relative abundance along with the sequence of the filtration process train it did not meet the statistical threshold p 0 05 in the zurich plant the rsf and gac filters received waters from the preceding ozonation process ozonation breaks down high molecular weight noms into smaller fractions thereby increasing the biodegradability of the noms lautenschlager et al 2014 nutrient rich environments and easily degradable substrates are known to select for fast growing microorganisms rodriguez r et al 2015 vieira silva and rocha 2010 accordingly it was speculated that the rsf and gac microorganisms may grow faster by metabolizing more easily degradable noms than ssf microorganisms because rsf and gac receive ozonated waters and are located in the preceding positions i e ssf in the last step hence a minimum generation time mgt of microbial communities was estimated using growthpred as described previously vieira silva and rocha 2010 the mgt estimated at 4 c water temperature of the dwtp was 18 7 1 8 14 6 0 9 27 5 2 7 and 20 3 1 5 h for rsf gac scm and ssf communities respectively our mgt estimation of the filter communities suggested that the potential faster growers are selected in gac and rsf rather than ssf these results are supported by our previous result reporting the higher doc removal rates in gac 500 mg h m3 and rsf 450 mg h m3 than ssf 40 mg h m3 lautenschlager et al 2014 3 4 enrichment and phylogenetic diversity of the eukaryotic community on scm fig 3a shows that the scm community was enriched in secondary metabolism sub functional categories of the secondary metabolism were further examined to explore what specific secondary metabolism pathways were particularly overrepresented among the secondary metabolism genes those encoding steroid associated enzymes such as steroid sulfatase metazoan cell defense were found to be differentially abundant fig 3e steroid hormones of eukaryotic organisms activate control innate immune systems against bacterial invasion and infection regan et al 2013 these results suggested that microbial communities may interact with metazoan populations in scm more substantially than other filter biofilms metagenomic reads that encode both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ssu rrna 16s and 18s rrna genes were subjected to phylogenetic analysis fig s3 the analysis identified a small number of archaeal sequences 1 of the total ssu rrna gene sequences in all metagenomic datasets while the majority of the ssu rrna gene sequences were phylogenetically affiliated with bacteria 86 99 across all datasets a substantial number of eukaryotic sequences was recovered from the scm dataset 14 much more than those in the rsf 3 gac 1 and ssf 2 datasets the majority of the eukaryotic sequences in the scm dataset were taxonomically affiliated with animalia 54 of the total 18s rrna gene sequences and viridiplantae 20 among the animalia the phylum annelida 23 dominated followed by arthropoda 16 mollusca 3 nematoda 5 platyhelminthes 5 and rotifera 1 fig 4 in particular the majority 77 of the annelida sequences were taxonomically affiliated with enchytraeidae enchytraeidae are a family of annelida which resemble small earthworms found in both terrestrial and marine environments the earthworms are also found in filter biofilms e g trickling filter and can control e g prey prokaryotic populations i e the primary consumer of soluble organic matters which potentially affects the quality of water wastewater treatment coombs et al 1996 lourenc and nunes 2017 earthworms are versatile decomposers of various complex recalcitrant organic matters e g lignin and cellulose for that reason they have been extensively applied in solid waste treatment and bioremediation e g vermitechnology wang et al 2010 further the earthworms can grind large particulate matters that bacterial populations are unable to uptake and dig holes in sand filters the latter characteristic is interrelated with creating macropores within filter media which improves percolating conditions in filtration the application of earthworms could significantly alleviate surface clogging of sand filters treating wastewater which accompanied with increasing effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the filters wang et al 2010 ssf of the zurich plant investigated in this study have a relatively smaller pore size and are not backwashed which results in the accumulation of extracellular substances scm on the surface since the small earthworms were abundant on the surface layer of the last filtration step ssf the earthworms highly likely affect the drinking water production i e infiltration rate which may be much more significant than realized although earthworms are supposed to play a positive role in ssf in many ways to what extent they contribute to the overall drinking water production and treatment efficiency remain to be further investigated the earthworm populations revealed in this study will be useful basis for future experimental investigation on the exact role and impact of earthworms on drinking water treatment using a filtration process 3 5 microbial life style and adaptation reflected on filter biofilm metagenomes implications on drinking water treatment microbial lifestyle and adaptation strategies could be reflected by the genomic architecture of microorganisms among others genome size and g c content a fraction of guanine and cytosine bases in a genome are quantitative traits of the genomic constitution which have been relatively well documented for the association with the organism s taxonomy evolution and environmental habitat foerstner et al 2005 mann and chen 2010 the filter communities showed 5 4 6 3 mb of genome size and 56 59 of g c content table 1 while planktonic prokaryotic communities in marine and freshwater environments are characterized by 47 and 34 of g c content in their metagenomes respectively soil communities are by the high g c content 61 on average eiler et al 2013 foerstner et al 2005 oh et al 2011 raes et al 2007 the ags of marine freshwater and soil communities is 1 6 2 5 1 9 4 2 and 4 7 5 9 mb angly et al 2009 eiler et al 2013 oh et al 2016 2011 raes et al 2007 respectively overall the higher g c content and ags of filter communities resembled those of soil microorganisms rather than those of planktonic microorganisms in freshwater and oceanic environments the differential genomic characteristics may result from the different community composition of microbial taxa natural process selection and or environmental factors although the exact mechanism shaping the ags remains unclear yet the ags has been associated with the environmental variability nutritional condition and ecological niche a large genome size is directly proportional to a high number of genes encoded in the genome a prerequisite for a metabolic versatility the versatile repertoire of metabolic genes provides competitive fitness for organisms to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions rather than stable environments konstantinidis and tiedje 2004 mann and chen 2010 as typical soil environments filter media are supposed to host a number of localized microenvironments with varied oxygen nutrient and other biotic and abiotic conditions hence the higher ags of filter communities may reflect heterogeneous microenvironment ecosystems established in filter media further the larger genomes tend to enrich in functions associated with secondary metabolism konstantinidis and tiedje 2004 secondary metabolism is associated with catabolism biosynthesis and transport of specialized compounds such as antibiotics pigment and various toxic chemicals drinking water sources consist of a variety of metals and trace organic pollutants typically occurring at very low levels but being suspected to pose human and environmental health risks since filter communities are characterized by the higher metabolic versatility e g secondary metabolism our results strongly suggest future experiments on the bioremediation potential of micropollutants by filter communities for instance bradyrhizobium overrepresented in the filters have large genomes 8 2 mb of the median genome size from those deposited in genbank at the time of investigation with the high g c content 64 bradyrhizobium are known to be disproportionately enriched in secondary metabolism marks et al 2013 and have a demonstrated capacity that detoxifies aromatic organic pollutants e g pahs and pcbs herbicide and metals e g cadmium zinc and nickel teng et al 2015 accordingly filters communities including bradyrhizobium would have the potential for bioremediation of drinking water contaminated with a range of organic and inorganic pollutants which has important implications on drinking water treatment 4 conclusions this study provided a metagenomic view of the colonization metabolism and ecology of filter microbial communities in the successive filters of a full scale dwtp producing biologically stable drinking water taxonomic and network analyses revealed a filter specific occurrence pattern of bacterial genera bradyrhizobium predominant in gac and

19881,microorganisms inhabiting filtration media of a drinking water treatment plant can be beneficial because they metabolize biodegradable organic matter from source waters and those formed during disinfection processes leading to the production of biologically stable drinking water however which microbial consortia colonize filters and what metabolic capacity they possess remain to be investigated to gain insights into these issues we performed metagenome sequencing and analysis of microbial communities in three different filters of a full scale drinking water treatment plant dwtp filter communities were sampled from a rapid sand filter rsf granular activated carbon filter gac and slow sand filter ssf and from the schmutzdecke scm a biologically active scum layer accumulated on top of ssf respectively analysis of community phylogenetic structure revealed that the filter bacterial communities significantly differed from those in the source water and final effluent communities respectively network analysis identified a filter specific colonization pattern of bacterial groups bradyrhizobiaceae were abundant in gac whereas nitrospira were enriched in the sand associated filters rsf scm and ssf the gac community was enriched with functions associated with aromatics degradation many of which were encoded by rhizobiales 30 of the total gac community predicting minimum generation time mgt of prokaryotic communities suggested that the gac community potentially select fast growers 15 h of mgt among the four filter communities consistent with the highest dissolved organic matter removal rate by gac our findings provide new insights into the community phylogenetic structure colonization pattern and metabolic capacity that potentially contributes to organic matter removal achieved in the biofiltration stages of the full scale dwtp graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofiltration drinking water treatment microbial community metagenomics 1 introduction microbial growth in a drinking water distribution system dwds causes undesirable consequences which include a decline in water quality taste odor problem turbidity clogging corrosion and health risk e g pathogen occurrence accordingly residual disinfectants such as chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine are commonly used to limit the unwanted growth of microorganisms in a dwds while this approach has been successful in the majority of drinking water treatment plants dwpts over the world dwtps in several european countries e g switzerland austria germany and the netherlands produce drinking water effluents without such residual disinfectants hambsch 1999 hammes et al 2010 these dwtps instead remove organic nutrients essential for microbial regrowth which eventually help achieve biological stability of the drinking water without the aid of residual disinfectants the treatment train of such dwtps include a combination of ozonation and filtration in series lautenschlager et al 2014 2013 smeets et al 2008 filtration processes using various filter media such as granular activated carbon gac sand and or anthracite can remove a wide range of organic and inorganic matter filter materials serve as excellent supporting media for microbial growth due to the high surface area to volume ratio thus in addition to the physicochemical route e g straining and sorption microbial consortia colonizing pores and surfaces of filter particles contribute to remove various contaminants including taste odor causing compounds and trace organic compounds e g industrial chemicals pesticides and pharmaceuticals and personal care products given the fact that biological contaminant removal during filtration steps is important for producing biologically stable drinking water elucidating which microorganisms colonize and how they metabolize unwanted compounds are essential for the sustainable predictive operation of biofiltration based dwtps contaminant removal biological stability of water and bacterial community dynamics in the biofiltration based full scale dwtp operated in zurich switzerland was previously documented hammes et al 2010 lautenschlager et al 2014 2013 the plant treats surface water from lake zurich and provides drinking water to about 40 of the city s residents the unit processes of the plant consist of pre ozonation rapid sand filter rsf intermediate ozonation gac filtration and slow sand filter ssf using the successive ozonation and filtration steps the plant produces the drinking water effluent with approximately 105 cells ml 0 8 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc and 40 μg l of assimilable organic carbon lautenschlager et al 2014 although residual disinfectants were not added to the final effluent bacterial abundance was found to be stable through the dwds at least 7 km from the plant indicating the biological stability of the produced drinking water hammes et al 2010 while the ozonation was primarily responsible for disinfection the three filtration steps were indeed responsible for the doc removal achieved by the dwtp lautenschlager et al 2014 since all filter materials harbor over 109 cells cm3 and show catalytic enzyme activities such as esterase phenoloxidase and phenolperoxidase lautenschlager et al 2014 some extent of the organic matter removal by filtration steps should be microbially mediated a previous study reported that the bacterial community structure at the phylum level is similar across the filters however the rate and type of organic matter e g humic substances building blocks neutrals and polysaccharides removed differ significantly among the three filters lautenschlager et al 2014 the latter result implied that there might be filter specific microbial taxa metabolism particularly in relation to the organic matter removals achieved through the successive filters the main objective of this study was therefore to characterize the metabolic versatility that might be differential among the successive filter communities and thus that might contribute to the differential organic matter removals in the dwtp previously reported lautenschlager et al 2014 hence we performed metagenomic analysis of microbial communities taken from the filter biomass our metagenomic study uncovered the filter specific colonization and metabolic profiles of filter microbial communities in addition we provide genomic characteristics of filter communities reflecting the filter biofilm ecosystem and its associated microbial life style overall our work provides new genomic view on the ecology of filter biofilm communities and population specific metabolism that can facilitate the organic matter removals which has an important implication relevance to biofiltration based dwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling dna extraction and metagenome sequencing triplicate filter biomass samples were collected from rapid sand filter rsf granular activated carbon filter gac slow sand filter ssf and the schmutzdecke scm respectively triplicate samples were taken from ssf and scm respectively in parallel filters the rsf and gac samples were taken after backwashing suggesting that the biomass samples could represent those from the entire depth of the filters sample preparation and dna extraction were performed as described previously lautenschlager et al 2014 triplicate dna aliquots i e resulting from filter biomass samples were combined into a single dna pool for metagenome sequencing about 5 μg of a dna aliquot was sequenced using the illumina ga ii sequencer 100 bp paired end reads at the roy j carver biotechnology center at the university of illinois at urbana champaign 2 2 metagenomic sequence analysis metagenomic datasets were first trimmed using a q 20 phred quality score cutoff using solexaqa2 cox et al 2010 idba ud peng et al 2012 was used to assemble the trimmed metagenomic reads into contigs using the pre correction option and a range of k mer from 20 to 100 with a step increase of 20 with other parameters at default settings for taxonomic analysis metagenomic reads were searched against the silva small subunit ribosomal rna ssu rrna gene database 16s and 18s quast et al 2013 using blastn with a cutoff of 70 nucleotide identity and 90 query length coverage the blastn search results were used to determine the taxonomic affiliation at the domain and phylum level respectively metagenomic reads were also searched against all bacterial and archaeal genome sequences available in the genbank database ftp ftp ncbi nih gov using blastx with a cut off of 50 identity and 90 query length coverage the blastx search results were used to estimate relative abundance of microbial taxa at the phylum and genus level respectively for functional annotation protein coding genes were predicted on the assembled contigs using metagenemark zhu et al 2010 the protein coding genes and metagenomic reads were searched against the seed subsystem using a blastp and blastx search respectively with a cut off of 50 identity and 90 query length coverage relative abundance of a taxon functional category was determined as the number of matches to a reference taxon functional category normalized by the total number of matches as described previously oh et al 2014a b to estimate an average genome size ags of a prokaryotic community million reads were randomly drawn 100 times from a metagenomic dataset the ags of a metagenomic dataset was estimated using microbecensus nayfach and pollard 2015 with 100 permutations a minimum generation time mgt of a prokaryotic community was predicted using growthpred as described previously vieira silva and rocha 2010 growthpred predicts minimum doubling time based on codon usage bias using genomic or metagenomic datasets the protein coding genes recovered from a metagenomic dataset were used to estimate the mgt using growthpred with the parameters temperature 4 c and the other parameters at default settings 2 3 16s rrna gene pyrosequence analysis raw 16s rrna gene amplicon pyrosequence data the hypervariable v4v5 region positions 515 909 of bacterial communities resulting from the source waters via the full scale dwtp to the dwds were obtained from the two previous studies lautenschlager et al 2014 2013 the 16s rrna gene sequence data were pre processed and analyzed according to the 454 sop pipeline schloss et al 2009 in brief barcode primer and ambiguous sequences were first filtered out the remaining sequences were removed using the following parameters minimum length 200 average quality score 35 and maximum length of homopolymer 8 the preprocessed sequences were searched against the silva 16s rrna gene database using blastn with a cutoff of 70 nucleotide identity and 90 query length coverage the blastn search results were used to estimate relative abundance of bacterial taxa as conducted on the metagenomic data the taxonomic composition of bacterial communities at the phylum and genus level respectively was compared to those obtained from the metagenomic analysis 2 4 nucleotide sequence accession number the metagenomic datasets used in this study were deposited in genbank under the accession numbers srr5680088 rsf srr5680089 gac srr5680086 scm and srr5680087 ssf 3 results and discussion 3 1 filter bacterial communities differ from those of source and effluent waters the illumina ga ii analyzer yielded 3 5 to 4 gbp of metagenomic data per sample table 1 describes the statistics of all metagenomic datasets generated in this study fig s1 shows the best match analysis results of all metagenomic reads against all bacterial and archaeal genome database outer circles proteobacteria 57 12 of the total dominated the four prokaryotic communities followed by bacteroidetes 10 1 firmicutes 7 3 and actinobacteria 5 1 the analysis of the metagenomic reads encoding 16s rrna gene sequences inner circles showed similar relative abundance of the major phyla fig s1 the bacterial community composition estimated using 16s rrna gene pyrosequence data was used to perform the principal component analysis pca fig 1 communities clustered closely together within each group and showed a substantial distance in the bacterial community structure among source water filter and final effluent communities the average similarity of the phylogenetic structure estimated based on the bray curtis distance metric was 0 43 0 03 filter vs source water communities 0 56 0 08 filter vs effluent communities and 0 41 0 01 source water vs effluent communities a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova test anderson 2001 showed that the phylogenetic structure of the filter bacterial communities differed significantly from those of the source waters and effluents respectively bonferroni corrected p 0 05 a similarity percentage simper analysis clarke 1993 identified several phyla classes that mainly contributed to distinguish among the three groups of bacterial communities actinobacteria alphaproteobacteria acidobacteria betaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria actinobacteria 49 0 and deltaproteobacteria 14 2 were overrepresented in the source and effluent communities respectively alphaproteobacteria 27 1 betaproteoacteria 15 7 and acidobacteria 14 2 were enriched in the filter bacterial communities compared to the others the three taxa substantially contributed to discriminate the filter bacterial communities from the source 35 of the total dissimilarity and effluent communities 43 respectively it was reported that the bacterial community structure in the effluent of a filter e g gac effluent tends to resemble that in the filter e g gac lautenschlager et al 2014 this tendency was observed to some degree since the effluent communities were more closely related 0 61 of the bray curtis distance to the communities of ssf the last unit process compared to the distance between the source water and the effluent communities 0 42 nevertheless the pca of this study suggested that the phylogenetic structure of the filter communities was distinct from that in the final effluent communities p 0 05 by permanova test these results are congruent with other previous studies reporting that bacterial community composition in filters differs from that in final effluents the differentiation primarily resulted from final disinfection and or bacteria that preferentially attach to filter surfaces and thus that were not released with effluents pinto et al 2012 since the zurich dwtp produces final effluents without residual disinfectants the discrimination of the filter bacterial communities from the effluent communities could be attributable to those particularly overrepresenting in filters e g alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and acidobacteria as well as other factors these results called further metagenomic investigation to address what specific microbial populations inhabit the filter media 3 2 bacterial taxa particularly enriched in the successive filters the taxonomic analysis of the metagenomic reads fig 2 a identified dominant bacterial genera 1 of the total prokaryotic community in the four filter communities fig 2a shows an array of bacterial genera belonging to alphaproteobacteria afipia bradyrhizobium hyphomicrobium methylobacterium nitrobacter rhizobium rhodopseudomonas and sphingomonas betaproteobacteria acidovorax burkholderia and polaromonas and acidobacteria solibacter which were overrepresented in the filter communities fig 1 bradyrhizobium 4 7 6 4 and nitrospira 4 0 1 6 were found to be two of the most abundant genera in the four filter communities fig 2a based on the metagenomic datasets the relative abundance of the two genera from the source water via the dwtp to the dwds was measured using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence data fig s2 bradyrhizobium were enriched in gac 4 4 compared to those in the source 0 1 waters and effluent and dwds waters 0 05 0 04 nitrospira were overrepresented in rsf 9 5 and ssf 6 1 compared to the source waters 0 25 and effluent and dwds waters 1 4 0 6 these results suggested that the significant enrichment p 0 05 by mann whitney u test of bradyrhizobium and nitrospira within gac and sand filters respectively compared to both prefiltration the source waters and postfiltration the final effluents and dwds stages while the two genera were present in the filters they occurred differentially in relative abundance among the successive filters bradyrhizobium were particularly enriched in the gac community 15 whereas nitrospira were the most dominant 4 7 in the sand associated filter communities rsf scm and ssf hence we performed a network analysis to quantitatively assess whether there is a positive co occurrence or negative mutual exclusion association in relative abundance between any major genera the network analysis fig 2b using the pearson correlation metric revealed that nitrospira had a negative association pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 7 with p 0 05 with bradyrhizobium rhodopseudomonas and afipia respectively in addition the analysis revealed a positive association r 0 7 with p 0 05 of rhodopseudomonas with bradyrhizobium and afipia respectively notably bradyrhizobium rhodopseudomonas and afipia belonging to bradyrhizobiaceae were collectively enriched 7 fold in the gac whereas nitrospira were overrepresented 3 fold in the sand associated filters a positive association between two taxa detected in this study may indicate a mutualistic interaction or sharing the same ecological niche without direct biological interactions accordingly we encourage future experiments investigating temporal dynamics and co occurrence network patterns of organisms within a filter in the plant which will provide insights into biological interactions within the filter nitrospira are enriched in filter associated biofilms e g trickling filter and found to be abundant up to half of the total microbial community in oligotrophic waters such as those in drinking water treatment plants and distribution networks palomo et al 2016 vignola et al 2017 it is noted that the ammonia concentration in the raw water decreased more than 50 through the zurich plant lautenschlager et al 2014 although nitrification was not an essential process of the plant nitrification involves two biological sequential steps where ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite which is further oxidized to nitrate the two steps were thought to be mediated by two phylogenetically distinct groups however recent studies have shown that a single organism comammox carries out a complete ammonia oxidation and the organism is phylogenetically affiliated with nitrospira daims et al 2015 palomo et al 2016 our taxonomic results obtained by both metagenome and pyrosequence data showed that nitrospira are much more overrepresented than frequently reported nitrifying organisms e g nitrosomonas and nitrobacter in all the filters hence our results and the phylogeny and physiology of comammox collectively implied that the nitrification achieved in the plant might be primarily carried out by the nitrospira population presumable comammox particularly enriched in the filters binning of the assembled contigs was performed based on metagenomic read coverage tetranucleotide frequency and the occurrence of unique marker genes as described previously oh et al 2014a b using maxbin wu et al 2014 unfortunately the genome bin showed a low genome completeness 50 and the genetic signature of comammox e g ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase was not detected in a contig assigned to the nitrospira genome bin we therefore suggest future genomic and phenotypic characterizations of the nitrospira population in relation to the comammox capacity which will allow a systematic assessment of the nitrification potential of drinking water by a biofiltration based dwtp 3 3 metabolic pathways differentially enriched among the filters functional annotation of all metagenomic reads using the seed subsystem revealed metabolic pathways differentially abundant among filter community metagenomic datasets fig 3 first hierarchical clustering analysis using the metabolic profiles revealed that the sand associated filter communities were closely related to each other 0 982 0 005 of bray curtis distance in contrast to the relatively distant relatedness 0 960 0 009 between the gac and the sand associated communities fig 3a notably the metabolic pathway associated with aromatics degradation was the most significantly enriched in the gac community p 0 05 the sub functional categories of the aromatics metabolism were divided into the central peripheral and anaerobic degradation pathways in the seed subsystem the metagenomic reads assigned to each sub functional category were normalized by the total reads assigned to the aromatics metabolism pathway the analysis revealed that the central 36 and peripheral 52 degradation pathways were more pronounced than the anaerobic degradation pathway 12 in the gac community this observation led to the question of which organisms are potentially responsible for the functions associated with the aromatics degradation metabolism to address this we examined the taxonomic affiliation of the metagenomic reads encoding the central and peripheral degradation metabolism respectively a best match blastx analysis of the metagenomic reads i e those associated with aromatics metabolism against all archaeal and bacterial genome sequences was performed the analysis identified major genera carrying the aromatics degradation genes such as bradyrhizobium 30 and 23 for the central and peripheral pathway respectively burkholderia 3 and 8 afipia 3 and 1 ralstonia 1 and 3 polaromonas 2 and 2 rhodopseudomonas 2 and 2 and rhizobium 2 and 2 members of the rhizobiales bradyrhizobium afipia rhodopseudomonas and rhizobium were the major group encoding the central 37 and peripheral 27 aromatics degradation pathways among the total gac community rhizobiales are frequently detected in gac filters that receive pre ozonated surface waters in dwtps niemi et al 2009 given the higher abundance of rhizobiales within filters and postfiltration stages compared to prefiltration they were suggested as leaky filter colonizers pinto et al 2012 rhizobiales are widely distributed in soil environments and include bacteria capable of fixing nitrogen in symbiosys with leguminous plants while rhizobiales are metabolically versatile and are found to be abundant in biologically active gac filters how they are selected in the gac filters remains unknown rhizobiales genomes encode a variety of aromatics degradation genes and aromatic compounds stimulate the growth of rhizobiales in the rhizosphere latha and mahadevan 1997 teng et al 2015 a recent study reported that more than half of natural organic matters noms in river waters contain aromatic compounds cao et al 2015 given our metagenomic results and literature the aromatics bound noms are likely primarily biodegraded in gac where the rhizobiales e g bradyrhizobium potentially play a key role in removing the aromatic noms from the water when source waters were treated through the successive filters organic carbons were disproportionately removed in each filtration stage and in particular polymeric compounds e g polysaccharides were largely removed in the last filtration step ssf lautenschlager et al 2014 hence the relative abundance of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides metabolic pathways was assessed respectively fig 3d although the polysaccharides metabolic pathways showed a detectable increase in relative abundance along with the sequence of the filtration process train it did not meet the statistical threshold p 0 05 in the zurich plant the rsf and gac filters received waters from the preceding ozonation process ozonation breaks down high molecular weight noms into smaller fractions thereby increasing the biodegradability of the noms lautenschlager et al 2014 nutrient rich environments and easily degradable substrates are known to select for fast growing microorganisms rodriguez r et al 2015 vieira silva and rocha 2010 accordingly it was speculated that the rsf and gac microorganisms may grow faster by metabolizing more easily degradable noms than ssf microorganisms because rsf and gac receive ozonated waters and are located in the preceding positions i e ssf in the last step hence a minimum generation time mgt of microbial communities was estimated using growthpred as described previously vieira silva and rocha 2010 the mgt estimated at 4 c water temperature of the dwtp was 18 7 1 8 14 6 0 9 27 5 2 7 and 20 3 1 5 h for rsf gac scm and ssf communities respectively our mgt estimation of the filter communities suggested that the potential faster growers are selected in gac and rsf rather than ssf these results are supported by our previous result reporting the higher doc removal rates in gac 500 mg h m3 and rsf 450 mg h m3 than ssf 40 mg h m3 lautenschlager et al 2014 3 4 enrichment and phylogenetic diversity of the eukaryotic community on scm fig 3a shows that the scm community was enriched in secondary metabolism sub functional categories of the secondary metabolism were further examined to explore what specific secondary metabolism pathways were particularly overrepresented among the secondary metabolism genes those encoding steroid associated enzymes such as steroid sulfatase metazoan cell defense were found to be differentially abundant fig 3e steroid hormones of eukaryotic organisms activate control innate immune systems against bacterial invasion and infection regan et al 2013 these results suggested that microbial communities may interact with metazoan populations in scm more substantially than other filter biofilms metagenomic reads that encode both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ssu rrna 16s and 18s rrna genes were subjected to phylogenetic analysis fig s3 the analysis identified a small number of archaeal sequences 1 of the total ssu rrna gene sequences in all metagenomic datasets while the majority of the ssu rrna gene sequences were phylogenetically affiliated with bacteria 86 99 across all datasets a substantial number of eukaryotic sequences was recovered from the scm dataset 14 much more than those in the rsf 3 gac 1 and ssf 2 datasets the majority of the eukaryotic sequences in the scm dataset were taxonomically affiliated with animalia 54 of the total 18s rrna gene sequences and viridiplantae 20 among the animalia the phylum annelida 23 dominated followed by arthropoda 16 mollusca 3 nematoda 5 platyhelminthes 5 and rotifera 1 fig 4 in particular the majority 77 of the annelida sequences were taxonomically affiliated with enchytraeidae enchytraeidae are a family of annelida which resemble small earthworms found in both terrestrial and marine environments the earthworms are also found in filter biofilms e g trickling filter and can control e g prey prokaryotic populations i e the primary consumer of soluble organic matters which potentially affects the quality of water wastewater treatment coombs et al 1996 lourenc and nunes 2017 earthworms are versatile decomposers of various complex recalcitrant organic matters e g lignin and cellulose for that reason they have been extensively applied in solid waste treatment and bioremediation e g vermitechnology wang et al 2010 further the earthworms can grind large particulate matters that bacterial populations are unable to uptake and dig holes in sand filters the latter characteristic is interrelated with creating macropores within filter media which improves percolating conditions in filtration the application of earthworms could significantly alleviate surface clogging of sand filters treating wastewater which accompanied with increasing effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the filters wang et al 2010 ssf of the zurich plant investigated in this study have a relatively smaller pore size and are not backwashed which results in the accumulation of extracellular substances scm on the surface since the small earthworms were abundant on the surface layer of the last filtration step ssf the earthworms highly likely affect the drinking water production i e infiltration rate which may be much more significant than realized although earthworms are supposed to play a positive role in ssf in many ways to what extent they contribute to the overall drinking water production and treatment efficiency remain to be further investigated the earthworm populations revealed in this study will be useful basis for future experimental investigation on the exact role and impact of earthworms on drinking water treatment using a filtration process 3 5 microbial life style and adaptation reflected on filter biofilm metagenomes implications on drinking water treatment microbial lifestyle and adaptation strategies could be reflected by the genomic architecture of microorganisms among others genome size and g c content a fraction of guanine and cytosine bases in a genome are quantitative traits of the genomic constitution which have been relatively well documented for the association with the organism s taxonomy evolution and environmental habitat foerstner et al 2005 mann and chen 2010 the filter communities showed 5 4 6 3 mb of genome size and 56 59 of g c content table 1 while planktonic prokaryotic communities in marine and freshwater environments are characterized by 47 and 34 of g c content in their metagenomes respectively soil communities are by the high g c content 61 on average eiler et al 2013 foerstner et al 2005 oh et al 2011 raes et al 2007 the ags of marine freshwater and soil communities is 1 6 2 5 1 9 4 2 and 4 7 5 9 mb angly et al 2009 eiler et al 2013 oh et al 2016 2011 raes et al 2007 respectively overall the higher g c content and ags of filter communities resembled those of soil microorganisms rather than those of planktonic microorganisms in freshwater and oceanic environments the differential genomic characteristics may result from the different community composition of microbial taxa natural process selection and or environmental factors although the exact mechanism shaping the ags remains unclear yet the ags has been associated with the environmental variability nutritional condition and ecological niche a large genome size is directly proportional to a high number of genes encoded in the genome a prerequisite for a metabolic versatility the versatile repertoire of metabolic genes provides competitive fitness for organisms to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions rather than stable environments konstantinidis and tiedje 2004 mann and chen 2010 as typical soil environments filter media are supposed to host a number of localized microenvironments with varied oxygen nutrient and other biotic and abiotic conditions hence the higher ags of filter communities may reflect heterogeneous microenvironment ecosystems established in filter media further the larger genomes tend to enrich in functions associated with secondary metabolism konstantinidis and tiedje 2004 secondary metabolism is associated with catabolism biosynthesis and transport of specialized compounds such as antibiotics pigment and various toxic chemicals drinking water sources consist of a variety of metals and trace organic pollutants typically occurring at very low levels but being suspected to pose human and environmental health risks since filter communities are characterized by the higher metabolic versatility e g secondary metabolism our results strongly suggest future experiments on the bioremediation potential of micropollutants by filter communities for instance bradyrhizobium overrepresented in the filters have large genomes 8 2 mb of the median genome size from those deposited in genbank at the time of investigation with the high g c content 64 bradyrhizobium are known to be disproportionately enriched in secondary metabolism marks et al 2013 and have a demonstrated capacity that detoxifies aromatic organic pollutants e g pahs and pcbs herbicide and metals e g cadmium zinc and nickel teng et al 2015 accordingly filters communities including bradyrhizobium would have the potential for bioremediation of drinking water contaminated with a range of organic and inorganic pollutants which has important implications on drinking water treatment 4 conclusions this study provided a metagenomic view of the colonization metabolism and ecology of filter microbial communities in the successive filters of a full scale dwtp producing biologically stable drinking water taxonomic and network analyses revealed a filter specific occurrence pattern of bacterial genera bradyrhizobium predominant in gac and nitrospira in the sand associated filters respectively aromatics degradation metabolism was enriched in the gac community largely by rhizobiales suggesting that aromatics bound noms are primarily

allocations in the united states and 4 identify reference pathogen reductions needed to consistently meet currently applied benchmark risk levels sensitivity analyses illustrated changes in cumulative annual risks estimates the significance of which depends on the pathogen group driving the risk for a given treatment train for example updates to norovirus nov raw wastewater values and use of a nov dose response approach capturing the full range of uncertainty increased risks associated with one of the treatment trains evaluated but not the other additionally compared to traditional log credit allocation approaches our results indicate that the risk methodology provides more nuanced information about how consistently public health benchmarks are achieved our results indicate that viruses

previously published a microbial risk assessment methodology to evaluate infection risks associated with various dpr treatment train combinations currently under consideration which noted several important findings soller et al 2017a first there are quantitative human health based advantages for dpr projects in which product water is introduced into the raw water supply upstream of a conventional drinking water treatment facility raw water augmentation compared to those in which product water is introduced directly into a potable water distribution system drinking water augmentation second cumulative annual risk estimates for any particular treatment train are driven by the highest daily risks for any of the individual reference pathogens thus a single day of peak pathogen wastewater inputs can cause annual risks to exceed benchmark risk levels finally proposed dpr project designs need to carefully consider reduction of both cryptosporidium spp and human enteric viruses such as norovirus nov soller et al 2017a both of these enteric pathogens are often found in high densities in raw sewage eftim et al 2017 are infectious at low doses teunis et al 2008 and exhibit attributes allowing them to persistent in the environment and through treatment processes pouillot et al 2015 an advantage of our proposed risk methodology is that it can be iteratively refined as more information becomes available and can be applied to additional treatment train combinations since publication of our risk methodology new information about nov densities in raw wastewater eftim et al 2017 and dose response relationships for cryptosporidium spp messner and berger 2016 adenovirus adv teunis et al 2016 and nov soller et al 2017b have been published the objectives of this work are 1 to provide an updated compilation of pathogen density data in raw sewage reductions across treatment and dose response functions 2 to conduct a series of sensitivity analyses to consider potential risk implications using updated pathogen data 3 to extend our analysis to evaluate state log reduction credit allocations as proposed by the state of california mosher et al 2016 and 4 to identify reference pathogen reductions needed to consistently meet currently applied benchmark risk levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 dpr treatment trains two different dpr treatment trains were evaluated in the risk assessment sensitivity analysis fig 1 the first treatment train referred to as tta consists of a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant wwtp that produces non disinfected secondary effluent feeding into an advanced water treatment facility awtf the awtf is composed of microfiltration reverse osmosis ultraviolet disinfection and an engineered storage buffer with free chlorine disinfection esb cl2 previous evaluations of this tta indicated that the risks were predominately driven by viral enteric pathogens soller et al 2017a the second evaluated treatment train referred to as ttb assumes identical wwtp treatment but the awtf consists of ozonation biologically active filtration ultrafiltration ultraviolet disinfection and an esb cl2 in contrast to tta previous evaluations of ttb indicated that the risks were predominately driven by protozoan pathogens such as cryptosporidium spp soller et al 2017a to identify the potential public health significance of a treatment train design choice the base tta and ttb configurations were also evaluated with the assumption of a lower ultraviolet disinfection dose 12 mj centimeter2 mj cm2 in lieu of the higher ultraviolet disinfection dose 800 mj cm2 the lower ultraviolet disinfection dose is consistent with conventional wwtp disinfection while the higher ultraviolet disinfection dose is typically applied often with the use of advanced oxidation for the purposes of disinfection by product destruction gerrity et al 2015 our previous analysis indicated that the ultraviolet disinfection dose low versus high was the most sensitive parameter in the dpr risk model soller et al 2017a 2 2 qmra approach the qmra approach applied to the treatment train evaluations was described previously soller et al 2017a briefly a stochastic static qmra methodology was used to estimate infection from reference pathogens through ingestion of dpr product water for tta and ttb described above fig 1 using a two step monte carlo simulation we estimated a distribution of cumulative annual risks of infection due to all of the evaluated pathogens this analysis is accomplished in a step wise fashion by 1 calculating the reference pathogen specific daily risk estimates 2 combining the pathogen specific daily risks to generate a cumulative daily risk estimates n 365 and 3 combining the cumulative daily risks to generate a cumulative annual risk estimate this step is then repeated 1000 times to generate a distribution of cumulative annual risk estimates 2 3 sensitivity analysis raw wastewater pathogen densities and dose response models as with our previous work soller et al 2017a six reference pathogens nov adv cryptosporidium spp giardia lamblia campylobacter spp and salmonella enterica representing the major enteric pathogen classes were included in this study a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of changing the following input parameters 1 nov density in raw wastewater 2 nov dose response model 3 adv dose response model 4 and cryptosporidium spp dose response model table 1 summarizes the dose response relationships used in the previous risk analysis soller et al 2017a and the additional dose response relationships evaluated within this study the updated adv dose response model is specific for ingestion teunis et al 2016 as compared to the base model which was developed for inhalation crabtree et al 1997 the updated nov dose response model accounts for the full range of uncertainty in the available observed human trial data soller et al 2017b the updated cryptosporidium spp dose response model allows for more uncertainty than the previously used fractional poisson or exponential models while also approximating the fractional poisson as the model parameter approaches 1 messner and berger 2016 table 1 in addition to the dose response models we updated the previously published literature review soller et al 2017a characterizing the density of each of the reference pathogens in raw wastewater and the reduction of each of the reference pathogens across each of the individual unit treatment processes under consideration with more recently published information table 2 2 4 evaluation of log reduction credit allocations allowable log reduction value lrv credits for various unit treatment processes currently employed by states in the united states were compared to log reductions found in the peer reviewed literature we then analyzed tta and ttb using the allowable lrv credits table 3 in lieu of the range of literature review values table 2 lrvs were applied as point estimates in our risk assessment simulations to obtain the cumulative annual risks for tta and ttb simulations assumed that the treatment trains achieve no more reduction than the log reduction credited values these simulations used the updated raw wastewater reference pathogen densities and newer dose response models as presented in tables 1 and 2 2 5 evaluation of pathogen log reduction targets needed to consistently meet benchmark risk levels we also evaluated the amount of log reduction per pathogen class virus protozoa bacteria required to consistently achieve the benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year in this analysis we estimated distributions of cumulative annual risks of infection based on 1000 simulations associated with viral and bacterial reductions ranging from 12 to 16 logs while also varying the log reductions for cryptosporidium and giardia from 10 to 15 logs the updated raw wastewater pathogen densities table 2 and dose response relationships table 1 were applied in these simulations but the log reductions for the pathogen classes were varied as point estimates 3 results 3 1 updated pathogen densities in raw wastewater and reductions across unit treatment processes a compilation of reference pathogen densities and reductions across each of the dpr unit treatment processes is provided table 2 unless described below the values in table 2 are consistent with those described in soller et al 2017a maximum values of giardia spp 9 0 104 cysts l wallis et al 1996 cryptosporidium spp 2 4 104 oocysts l robertson et al 2006 and salmonella spp 2 4 107 colony forming units l jimenez cisneros et al 2001 in raw wastewater were used in our analysis additionally nov concentrations in raw wastewater are now modeled as a normal distribution with log10 mean densities of 4 7 log10 standard deviation of 1 5 copies l to account for the effect of seasonality eftim et al 2017 log reduction values for nov after disinfection with free chlorine have also been updated to a minimum of 1 1 and a maximum of 3 9 log reductions pouillot et al 2015 3 2 sensitivity analyses raw wastewater pathogen densities and dose response models a total of thirteen simulations were run for each of the treatment trains to evaluate the model s sensitivity to input parameters as described in the methods section above fig 2 a and b presents the estimated distributions of cumulative annual risks of infection based on 1000 simulations for tta as shown a median increase of approximately 0 75 logs of nov in raw wastewater from 103 76 to 104 7 resulted in nearly a 2 log increase in cumulative annual risks fig 2a and b compare simulation a to b and h to i additionally when accounting for the full uncertainty in the nov dose response model simulation c resulting cumulative annual risk estimates were more similar to risk estimates associated with the upper bound dose response model simulation b than the lower bound dose response model simulation f for tta the model output was relatively insensitive to the changes in the cryptosporidium spp dose response model fig 2a and b compare simulations c to d and a to e and to the adv dose response model fig 2a compare simulations a and g our previous work indicated that risks in this treatment train are driven by nov risks and thus aside from the ultraviolet disinfection dose employed results in this treatment train were most sensitive to the updated nov raw wastewater information eftim et al 2017 all simulations that used the low dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration resulted in risks that were substantially above the benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year fig 2b the results for ttb are provided in fig 2c and d increased nov densities in raw wastewater have a much smaller effect on the annual risks for ttb as compared to tta compare simulations a to b simulations for both tta and ttb further the model output for ttb with a high dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration was relatively insensitive to the nov dose response model fig 2c compare simulations b c and f however results for the low dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration were increased and in some cases simulation results were above the benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year fig 2d compare simulation h to i j k and m our previous work indicated that risks in this treatment train are driven by cryptosporidium spp risks and thus aside from the ultraviolet disinfection dose employed the results in this treatment train were more sensitive to the cryptosporidium spp dose response model than any other parameter evaluated fig 2c compare simulations c to d and a to e 3 3 evaluation of log reduction credit allocations table 3 presents a summary of lrv credits currently used for various unit treatment processes in california olivieri et al 2016 corresponding to tta and ttb a graphical comparison of these results to the pathogen log reduction ranges found in our literature review is presented fig 3 a comparison of the lrv credit allocations olivieri et al 2016 to our literature review results indicate that the lrv credit values are generally at the low end of the literature values as would be anticipated one notable exception is that the virus lrv from free chlorine disinfection is at the high end of literature based range fig 3 to evaluate whether treatment trains would meet benchmark risk levels when allowable lrv credits were applied to our risk methodology we analyzed tta and ttb using the lrv credits shown in table 3 reference pathogen raw wastewater densities summarized in table 2 were applied to these simulations along with all newer dose response relationships table 1 simulation results evaluating the cumulative annual risks associated with the allowable lrv credits are presented fig 4 for both tta and ttb the predicted cumulative annual risks associated with the allowable lrv credits are substantially higher than those associated with the literature based log reduction values compare fig 4 with high dose ultraviolet disinfection to fig 2a and c and fig 4 with low dose ultraviolet disinfection to fig 2b and d low dose ultraviolet disinfection configurations for both tta and ttb always exceeded the benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year however the high dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration exceeded the benchmark risk level approximately 20 of the time for tta but not ever for ttb 3 4 pathogen log reduction targets needed to consistently meet benchmark risk levels the final set of simulations determined the amount of reference pathogen reduction that would be needed to consistently achieve california s ipr dpr benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year fig 5 table 4 fig 5 presents the estimated distributions of cumulative annual risks of infection based on 1000 simulations associated with viral reductions ranging from 12 to 16 logs x axis as a factor of cryptosporidium and giardia log reductions ranging from 10 to 15 logs shown as different colored boxes results indicate that the benchmark is only consistently achieved at viral reductions of 14 logs or greater table 4 fig 5 at 13 logs of virus reduction less than half of the simulations had annual risks less than 1 infection per 10 000 people per year at 14 logs of virus reduction and 11 or more logs of cryptosporidium and giardia reduction approximately 95 of the simulations had annual risks less than 1 infection per 10 000 people per year at 15 or more logs of virus reduction and 11 or more logs of cryptosporidium and giardia reduction nearly 100 of the simulations had annual risks less than 1 infection per 10 000 people per year the commonly recommended lrvs of 12 logs for virus 10 logs for cryptosporidium and 10 logs for giardia did not achieve the benchmark level in any of the simulations 4 discussion in this paper we updated prior work with the information on several raw wastewater pathogen densities wallis et al 1996 jimenez cisneros et al 2001 robertson et al 2006 eftim et al 2017 pathogen reductions pouillot et al 2015 and the latest dose response relationships for nov adv and cryptosporidium spp messner and berger 2016 teunis et al 2016 soller et al 2017b in a sensitivity analysis we applied the updated information to two treatment train configurations tta and ttb both at low and high ultraviolet disinfection doses tta and ttb were chosen because they represent treatment trains with and without reverse osmosis and because different pathogen classes drive risks for the two configurations one important finding that remained consistent with our previous work was that treatment trains employing low doses of ultraviolet disinfection 12 mj cm2 do not achieve the benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year soller et al 2017a rather the application of high dose ultraviolet disinfection is a critical unit process for meeting this benchmark further ultraviolet disinfection dose is the single most important parameter in our sensitivity analyses in our risk analyses high dose ultraviolet disinfection is assumed to remove pathogens up to 6 logs gerba et al 2002 u s epa 2006 no data are currently available to better characterize the efficacy of high dose ultraviolet disinfection but it is possible pathogen reductions are greater and risks are overestimated in these particular scenarios however to date greater pathogen reductions have not been demonstrated in our sensitivity analyses the cumulative annual risks associated with the updated nov densities were increased by approximately two orders of magnitude in tta with the high dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration fig 2a simulations a and b the increased cumulative annual risk results were caused not only by the increase in the nov mean value but by the higher variance log10sd associated with published nov raw wastewater densities eftim et al 2017 this observation highlights the importance of accounting for the full distribution of raw wastewater pathogen densities in microbial risk assessments not just the mean maximum or another point estimate value additionally the updated nov raw wastewater densities applied to our tta and ttb account for the seasonality of nov which often peaks during the colder winter spring months eftim et al 2017 gerba et al 2017 our results indicate that treatment configurations should also consider accounting for seasonal peaks of nov particularly if raw wastewater is to be used as the source water for potable reuse our sensitivity analyses also explored the impact of newer dose response models for nov adv and cryptosporidium spp for nov we evaluated an approach that includes the full spectrum of observed results from all available clinical trials soller et al 2017b as suggested by van abel et al 2017 the simulation results indicate that this approach yields slightly lower risks than the more commonly used upper bound estimate teunis et al 2008 but substantially greater risks than those with the lower bound dose response model messner et al 2014 our findings highlight that cumulative annual risks are driven by the highest daily pathogen raw wastewater values this is especially true for nov and cryptosporidium spp greater evidence continues to emerge in the peer reviewed literature regarding the importance of nov with respect to adverse human health effects from exposure to waterborne pathogens soller et al 2010 viau et al 2011 arnold et al 2017 gerba et al 2017 yet there is resistance among some practitioners in accounting for nov risks in recycled water for example pecson et al 2017 reports uncertainty associated with the selection of a dose response model the lack of regulatory direction on the appropriate dose response to utilize absence of a culture method to assess nov infectivity and uncertainty related to the use of molecular methods to assess nov infectivity as reasons for not including nov in their dpr risk model pecson et al 2017 however given that nov is estimated to cause more illnesses on an annual basis than all other known pathogens combined mead et al 1999 scallan et al 2011 and that newer dose response approaches can capture the full ranges of uncertainty in the models soller et al 2017b we view the consideration of nov to be important in the evaluation of dpr and other recycled water projects and the stated limitations to be secondary to ensuring public health protection this perspective is consistent with recent who guidelines for potable reuse which specifically use nov as a reference pathogen for human enteric viruses who 2017 while nov is not readily culturable qpcr to cell culture ratios for other enteric viruses can be quite low francy et al 2011 moreover because raw sewage contains recently excreted fecal matter it has been suggested that most of the viruses detected including those detected by qpcr are infectious gerba et al 2017 additionally gerba et al 2017 noted that since neither cell culture nor molecular methods can assess all the potentially infectious virus in wastewater conservative estimates should be used to assess the virus load in untreated wastewater our simulation results also highlight the risk management need to understand which pathogen group contributes to the greatest risk in any proposed treatment train results from the tta indicate that the model output was relatively insensitive to the updated cryptosporidium spp dose response and adv dose response models this work illustrated that nov was the most important pathogen in terms of risk for the tta configuration in contrast the ttb configuration was somewhat more sensitive to the updated cryptosporidium spp dose response model and was similarly insensitive to the adv dose response model unlike tta ttb was less sensitive to changes in nov raw wastewater densities this and prior work showed that cryptosporidium spp was the most important pathogen in terms of risk for this treatment train soller et al 2017a an additional key finding from this work is that the currently recommended target reductions e g the 12 10 10 rule do not appear to provide the sufficient reductions needed to achieve the targeted benchmark level of risk protection our simulations suggest that treatment trains achieving 12 logs of virus reduction and 10 logs of cryptosporidium and giardia reduction will not meet the benchmark of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year in our analyses 14 logs of virus removal and more than 11 logs of cryptosporidium and giardia were needed to achieve the risk benchmark 1 infection per 10 000 people per year in 95 of the simulations an additional log of virus reduction would be needed to confidently reach the benchmark greater than 95 of the time we highlight that the foundation for these estimates is strong since they are based on the latest nov densities in raw wastewater pouillot et al 2015 eftim et al 2017 gerba et al 2017 and account for a the full uncertainty in the nov dose response relationship teunis et al 2008 atmar et al 2014 soller et al 2017b van abel et al 2017 until further information becomes available indicating that nov genome copies in raw and treated wastewater are not infectious we suggest that treating them as infectious and taking into account the full uncertainty associated with the nov dose response relationship is prudent and health protective particularly in the case of dpr our findings are consistent with the conclusions from gerba et al 2017 that an additional 2 to 3 log reduction of viruses above current recommendations may be needed to ensure the safety of recycled water 5 conclusions this work provides updated insights about the relative level of public health protection provided by dpr treatment trains with and without reverse osmosis new reference pathogen raw wastewater data and dose response model information were easily incorporated and yielded additional insights compared to previously published results soller et al 2017a this probabilistic risk based approach provides more nuanced information about how consistently public health benchmarks are achieved than the traditional log credit allocations approach annual risk estimates for any treatment train are driven by the highest peak pathogen days for any of the reference pathogens and thus changes in raw wastewater pathogen densities can substantially influence cumulative annual risks particularly if that pathogen group drives the risk for the treatment train under consideration finally based on our simulations the currently proposed pathogen reduction values of 12 logs of virus reduction and 10 logs of giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp reduction do not consistently achieve the

additionally nov concentrations in raw wastewater are now modeled as a normal distribution with log10 mean densities of 4 7 log10 standard deviation of 1 5 copies l to account for the effect of seasonality eftim et al 2017 log reduction values for nov after disinfection with free chlorine have also been updated to a minimum of 1 1 and a maximum of 3 9 log reductions pouillot et al 2015 3 2 sensitivity analyses raw wastewater pathogen densities and dose response models a total of thirteen simulations were run for each of the treatment trains to evaluate the model s sensitivity to input parameters as described in the methods section above fig 2 a and b presents the estimated distributions of cumulative annual risks of infection based on 1000 simulations for tta as shown a median increase of approximately 0 75 logs of nov in raw wastewater from 103 76 to 104 7 resulted in nearly a 2 log increase in cumulative annual risks fig 2a and b compare simulation a to b and h to i additionally when accounting for the full uncertainty in the nov dose response model simulation c resulting cumulative annual risk estimates were more similar to risk estimates associated with the upper bound dose response model simulation b than the lower bound dose response model simulation f for tta the model output was relatively insensitive to the changes in the cryptosporidium spp dose response model fig 2a and b compare simulations c to d and a to e and to the adv dose response model fig 2a compare simulations a and g our previous work indicated that risks in this treatment train are driven by nov risks and thus aside from the ultraviolet disinfection dose employed results in this treatment train were most sensitive to the updated nov raw wastewater information eftim et al 2017 all simulations that used the low dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration resulted in risks that were substantially above the benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year fig 2b the results for ttb are provided in fig 2c and d increased nov densities in raw wastewater have a much smaller effect on the annual risks for ttb as compared to tta compare simulations a to b simulations for both tta and ttb further the model output for ttb with a high dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration was relatively insensitive to the nov dose response model fig 2c compare simulations b c and f however results for the low dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration were increased and in some cases simulation results were above the benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year fig 2d compare simulation h to i j k and m our previous work indicated that risks in this treatment train are driven by cryptosporidium spp risks and thus aside from the ultraviolet disinfection dose employed the results in this treatment train were more sensitive to the cryptosporidium spp dose response model than any other parameter evaluated fig 2c compare simulations c to d and a to e 3 3 evaluation of log reduction credit allocations table 3 presents a summary of lrv credits currently used for various unit treatment processes in california olivieri et al 2016 corresponding to tta and ttb a graphical comparison of these results to the pathogen log reduction ranges found in our literature review is presented fig 3 a comparison of the lrv credit allocations olivieri et al 2016 to our literature review results indicate that the lrv credit values are generally at the low end of the literature values as would be anticipated one notable exception is that the virus lrv from free chlorine disinfection is at the high end of literature based range fig 3 to evaluate whether treatment trains would meet benchmark risk levels when allowable lrv credits were applied to our risk methodology we analyzed tta and ttb using the lrv credits shown in table 3 reference pathogen raw wastewater densities summarized in table 2 were applied to these simulations along with all newer dose response relationships table 1 simulation results evaluating the cumulative annual risks associated with the allowable lrv credits are presented fig 4 for both tta and ttb the predicted cumulative annual risks associated with the allowable lrv credits are substantially higher than those associated with the literature based log reduction values compare fig 4 with high dose ultraviolet disinfection to fig 2a and c and fig 4 with low dose ultraviolet disinfection to fig 2b and d low dose ultraviolet disinfection configurations for both tta and ttb always exceeded the benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year however the high dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration exceeded the benchmark risk level approximately 20 of the time for tta but not ever for ttb 3 4 pathogen log reduction targets needed to consistently meet benchmark risk levels the final set of simulations determined the amount of reference pathogen reduction that would be needed to consistently achieve california s ipr dpr benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year fig 5 table 4 fig 5 presents the estimated distributions of cumulative annual risks of infection based on 1000 simulations associated with viral reductions ranging from 12 to 16 logs x axis as a factor of cryptosporidium and giardia log reductions ranging from 10 to 15 logs shown as different colored boxes results indicate that the benchmark is only consistently achieved at viral reductions of 14 logs or greater table 4 fig 5 at 13 logs of virus reduction less than half of the simulations had annual risks less than 1 infection per 10 000 people per year at 14 logs of virus reduction and 11 or more logs of cryptosporidium and giardia reduction approximately 95 of the simulations had annual risks less than 1 infection per 10 000 people per year at 15 or more logs of virus reduction and 11 or more logs of cryptosporidium and giardia reduction nearly 100 of the simulations had annual risks less than 1 infection per 10 000 people per year the commonly recommended lrvs of 12 logs for virus 10 logs for cryptosporidium and 10 logs for giardia did not achieve the benchmark level in any of the simulations 4 discussion in this paper we updated prior work with the information on several raw wastewater pathogen densities wallis et al 1996 jimenez cisneros et al 2001 robertson et al 2006 eftim et al 2017 pathogen reductions pouillot et al 2015 and the latest dose response relationships for nov adv and cryptosporidium spp messner and berger 2016 teunis et al 2016 soller et al 2017b in a sensitivity analysis we applied the updated information to two treatment train configurations tta and ttb both at low and high ultraviolet disinfection doses tta and ttb were chosen because they represent treatment trains with and without reverse osmosis and because different pathogen classes drive risks for the two configurations one important finding that remained consistent with our previous work was that treatment trains employing low doses of ultraviolet disinfection 12 mj cm2 do not achieve the benchmark risk level of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year soller et al 2017a rather the application of high dose ultraviolet disinfection is a critical unit process for meeting this benchmark further ultraviolet disinfection dose is the single most important parameter in our sensitivity analyses in our risk analyses high dose ultraviolet disinfection is assumed to remove pathogens up to 6 logs gerba et al 2002 u s epa 2006 no data are currently available to better characterize the efficacy of high dose ultraviolet disinfection but it is possible pathogen reductions are greater and risks are overestimated in these particular scenarios however to date greater pathogen reductions have not been demonstrated in our sensitivity analyses the cumulative annual risks associated with the updated nov densities were increased by approximately two orders of magnitude in tta with the high dose ultraviolet disinfection configuration fig 2a simulations a and b the increased cumulative annual risk results were caused not only by the increase in the nov mean value but by the higher variance log10sd associated with published nov raw wastewater densities eftim et al 2017 this observation highlights the importance of accounting for the full distribution of raw wastewater pathogen densities in microbial risk assessments not just the mean maximum or another point estimate value additionally the updated nov raw wastewater densities applied to our tta and ttb account for the seasonality of nov which often peaks during the colder winter spring months eftim et al 2017 gerba et al 2017 our results indicate that treatment configurations should also consider accounting for seasonal peaks of nov particularly if raw wastewater is to be used as the source water for potable reuse our sensitivity analyses also explored the impact of newer dose response models for nov adv and cryptosporidium spp for nov we evaluated an approach that includes the full spectrum of observed results from all available clinical trials soller et al 2017b as suggested by van abel et al 2017 the simulation results indicate that this approach yields slightly lower risks than the more commonly used upper bound estimate teunis et al 2008 but substantially greater risks than those with the lower bound dose response model messner et al 2014 our findings highlight that cumulative annual risks are driven by the highest daily pathogen raw wastewater values this is especially true for nov and cryptosporidium spp greater evidence continues to emerge in the peer reviewed literature regarding the importance of nov with respect to adverse human health effects from exposure to waterborne pathogens soller et al 2010 viau et al 2011 arnold et al 2017 gerba et al 2017 yet there is resistance among some practitioners in accounting for nov risks in recycled water for example pecson et al 2017 reports uncertainty associated with the selection of a dose response model the lack of regulatory direction on the appropriate dose response to utilize absence of a culture method to assess nov infectivity and uncertainty related to the use of molecular methods to assess nov infectivity as reasons for not including nov in their dpr risk model pecson et al 2017 however given that nov is estimated to cause more illnesses on an annual basis than all other known pathogens combined mead et al 1999 scallan et al 2011 and that newer dose response approaches can capture the full ranges of uncertainty in the models soller et al 2017b we view the consideration of nov to be important in the evaluation of dpr and other recycled water projects and the stated limitations to be secondary to ensuring public health protection this perspective is consistent with recent who guidelines for potable reuse which specifically use nov as a reference pathogen for human enteric viruses who 2017 while nov is not readily culturable qpcr to cell culture ratios for other enteric viruses can be quite low francy et al 2011 moreover because raw sewage contains recently excreted fecal matter it has been suggested that most of the viruses detected including those detected by qpcr are infectious gerba et al 2017 additionally gerba et al 2017 noted that since neither cell culture nor molecular methods can assess all the potentially infectious virus in wastewater conservative estimates should be used to assess the virus load in untreated wastewater our simulation results also highlight the risk management need to understand which pathogen group contributes to the greatest risk in any proposed treatment train results from the tta indicate that the model output was relatively insensitive to the updated cryptosporidium spp dose response and adv dose response models this work illustrated that nov was the most important pathogen in terms of risk for the tta configuration in contrast the ttb configuration was somewhat more sensitive to the updated cryptosporidium spp dose response model and was similarly insensitive to the adv dose response model unlike tta ttb was less sensitive to changes in nov raw wastewater densities this and prior work showed that cryptosporidium spp was the most important pathogen in terms of risk for this treatment train soller et al 2017a an additional key finding from this work is that the currently recommended target reductions e g the 12 10 10 rule do not appear to provide the sufficient reductions needed to achieve the targeted benchmark level of risk protection our simulations suggest that treatment trains achieving 12 logs of virus reduction and 10 logs of cryptosporidium and giardia reduction will not meet the benchmark of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year in our analyses 14 logs of virus removal and more than 11 logs of cryptosporidium and giardia were needed to achieve the risk benchmark 1 infection per 10 000 people per year in 95 of the simulations an additional log of virus reduction would be needed to confidently reach the benchmark greater than 95 of the time we highlight that the foundation for these estimates is strong since they are based on the latest nov densities in raw wastewater pouillot et al 2015 eftim et al 2017 gerba et al 2017 and account for a the full uncertainty in the nov dose response relationship teunis et al 2008 atmar et al 2014 soller et al 2017b van abel et al 2017 until further information becomes available indicating that nov genome copies in raw and treated wastewater are not infectious we suggest that treating them as infectious and taking into account the full uncertainty associated with the nov dose response relationship is prudent and health protective particularly in the case of dpr our findings are consistent with the conclusions from gerba et al 2017 that an additional 2 to 3 log reduction of viruses above current recommendations may be needed to ensure the safety of recycled water 5 conclusions this work provides updated insights about the relative level of public health protection provided by dpr treatment trains with and without reverse osmosis new reference pathogen raw wastewater data and dose response model information were easily incorporated and yielded additional insights compared to previously published results soller et al 2017a this probabilistic risk based approach provides more nuanced information about how consistently public health benchmarks are achieved than the traditional log credit allocations approach annual risk estimates for any treatment train are driven by the highest peak pathogen days for any of the reference pathogens and thus changes in raw wastewater pathogen densities can substantially influence cumulative annual risks particularly if that pathogen group drives the risk for the treatment train under consideration finally based on our simulations the currently proposed pathogen reduction values of 12 logs of virus reduction and 10 logs of giardia spp and cryptosporidium spp reduction do not consistently achieve the

19883,it is commonly accepted that high salt concentrations negatively affect microbial activity in biological wastewater treatment reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors microbial aggregation in such reactors is equally important it is well documented that anaerobic granules when exposed to high salinity become weak and disintegrate causing wash out operational problems and decreasing process performance in this research the possibility of microbial granule formation from dispersed biomass was investigated at salinity levels of 5 and 20 g na l high removal efficiencies of soluble influent organics were achieved at both salinity levels and this was accompanied by fast and robust formation of microbial granules the process was found to be stable for the entire operational period of 217 days as far as we know this is the first time it has been demonstrated that stable granule formation is possible at a salinity level as high as 20 g na l methanosaeta was identified as the dominant methanogen at both salinity levels streptococcus spp and bacteria belonging to the family lachnospiraceae were identified as the dominant microbial population at 5 and 20 and g na l respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic sludge granulation uasb high salinity methanosaeta 1 introduction saline wastewater streams are generated by several industries such as the fish processing soto et al 1991 chemical agro food petroleum and leather industry lefebvre and moletta 2006 biodegradation of organics in such saline waste streams is reported to be poor due to toxic effects of sodium on the bacterial cells and archaea causing cell lysis and death sleator and hill 2002 vyrides and stuckey 2009 sochacki et al 2011 physical and chemical treatment processes are energy intensive and more expensive compared to biological processes fakhru l razi et al 2009 hence the need to explore the limits of biological wastewater treatment regarding salinity and to stretch these limits where possible because of a lower sensitivity of aerobic biomass to salt toxicity compared to anaerobic biomass most research is done on aerobic treatment freire et al 2001 tellez et al 2002 2005 zhao et al 2006 ozgun et al 2013 anaerobic biological wastewater treatment has several advantages over aerobic such as net energy recovery reduced sludge production and the possibility to handle higher volumetric loading rates if formation of granular or immobilised biomass is possible vieira et al 2005 vyrides et al 2010 xiao and roberts 2010 in the field of anaerobic wastewater treatment it is generally accepted that methanogenic activity is inhibited above sodium levels of 5 g na l mccarty and mckinney 1961 patel and roth 1977 rinzema et al 1988 liu and boone 1991 de vrieze et al 2016b however sodium toxicity may depend on the composition of wastewater due to possible antagonistic and synergistic effects caused by other ions mccarty and mckinney 1961 moreover the type of organic substrate generally determines the type of microorganisms evolving in the reactors and thus their sensitivity to sodium toxicity patel and roth 1977 lefebvre et al 2007 hence the potential of anaerobic treatment of saline wastewaters thus far may have been largely underestimated if high rate anaerobic bioreactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb for treatment of wastewater are applied both microbial activity and formation of granular microbial aggregates plays a crucial role on the process performance o flaherty et al 1997 yu et al 1999 liu et al 2009 lu et al 2013 after the initial formation of granules it is of equal importance to maintain a robust granular structure mchugh et al 2003 microbial granules of sufficient strength and weight then allow the decoupling of hydraulic and sludge retention times achieve high biomass concentrations and permit the use of compact reactors o flaherty et al 1997 liu et al 2009 the most commonly used methods to enhance the rate of granulation are addition of multivalent cations such as calcium 150 300 mg l zeeuw 1984 mahoney et al 1987 hulshoff pol 1989 yu et al 2001 and or addition of a support material such as powdered activated carbon pac wirtz and dague 1996 yu et al 1999 only a few studies have reported on the effect of monovalent salt stress on anaerobic granules all of these studies were performed by inoculating intact granular sludge and without exception showed subsequent granule disintegration biomass washout and loss of microbial activity rinzema et al 1988 jeison et al 2008 ismail et al 2010 li et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2016a as far as we know formation of anaerobic granules from dispersed biomass under saline conditions has not been reported before in this paper granulation from dispersed biomass accompanied by stable uasb process performance at sodium concentrations as high as 20 g na l is demonstrated for the first time the rate of granulation was compared to granulation at a reference level of 5 g na l the effect on granulation of small amounts of powdered activated carbon pac was studied calcium was only fed at extremely low concentrations of 13 mg l

mastersizer 2000 malvern uk sampling was done as described above the volume and surface based mean particle sizes were calculated based on total volume or total surface of the particles respectively strength of the microbial aggregates was measured as described in xiao et al 2008 approx 0 12 g of suspended solids were used in each test the microbial aggregates were put in 50 ml centrifuge tubes filled with reactor medium up to 30 ml and vortexed at 2500 rpm for 2 4 and 8 min after each period of vortexing the aggregates were allowed to settle for 1 min and the supernatant was decanted to quantify the amount of fines produced as total suspended solids to minimize biomass removal from running bioreactors singletons were measured at each time point for strength characterization the integrity coefficient ic is calculated as follows i c x 1 s s x s s 0 100 where ic x the integrity coefficient after x minutes of vortexing ss x the amount of solids quantified after x minutes of

granulation r1 r2 r4 and growth of particle size r3 was observed in all bioreactors irrespective of the salinity level or whether pac was added to the inoculum as an example fig 2 illustrates the development of granules over time in r4 microbial aggregation was already observed on day 23 fig 2 b while on day 33 the majority of the sludge bed consisted of granules fig 2 c by day 43 the sludge bed was completely filled with granular biomass fig 2 d particle size distribution psd was followed over time and was similar for r1 and r2 fig 3 a b shows an increase of particle sizes in r1 and r2 operated at 5 g na l compared to the maximum particle size of 125 μm of the inoculum fig 3 c d show that also in r3 and r4 operated at 20 g na l the particle size increased table 2 summarizes the development of volume and surface based average particle sizes in all four bioreactors addition of pac to the inoculum did not result in a faster development of granules compared to the inoculum where no pac was added r1 compared to r2 also no observable difference in the rate of granulation was found when comparing the start up of reactors with sieved biomass at 5 g na l r2 and 20 g na l r4 on day 79 the volume based average size of granules in r3 was higher than in r1 and r2 this difference is due to larger particles inoculated in r3 compared to the inoculum the average volume based size increased by 141 1 μm 124 7 μm and 121 4 μm in r1 r2 and r3 respectively thus the rate at which particle size increased in r1 r2 and r3 was similar the srts were 74 9 98 6 and 70 days for reactors r1 r2 and r3 respectively for r4 no solids balance was made as it was merely started up to study if the process of granulation from dispersed biomass is possible at 20 g na l in table 3 strength measurements of the granules indicate that in all bioreactors aggregates of higher strength compared to the inoculum developed the strength of microbial granules in r1 r2 and r3 was similar implying that strength was not affected by the sodium concentration or by addition of pac also the strength of granules formed from sieved biomass r1 and r2 was not different from the strength of the granules that developed from intact granules r3 the integrity coefficients during strength tests in r1 r3 stabilised with vortexing time while in r4 a decreasing trend remained these outcomes suggest that granules in r4 were less resistant to shear forces compared to r1 r3 this difference may be caused by scaled up set up of r4 which may have resulted in sludge exposure to different shear forces and mixing patterns of influent 3 1 2 microscopic analyses microscopic analysis carried out using fesem and fluorescence microscopy coupled with fish visualized the differences between granules operated at 5 and 20 g na l sem images of granules showed that the dominant morphology of the microorganisms was filamentous fig 4 in r1 and r2 operated at 5 g na l the most abundant morphologies were coccus shaped microorganisms organized in chains fig 4 a b c d in r3 operated at 20 g na l filaments were also observed but these mainly consisted of aggregated rod shaped cells fig 4 e f the difference in morphology at 5 g na l and 20 g na l suggests that different microbial communities were selected in response to salinity for further analysis fish probes were used to target the microbial groups commonly found in anaerobic treatment systems table s2 and in anaerobic environments the use of arc915 archaea domain specific probe combined with the application of specific probes for methanosarcinales methanosaetaceae and methanomicrobiales table s2 revealed acetoclastic methanosaetaceae as the dominant methanogen at both salinities fig 5 a c e and f in green while members of the hydrogenotrophic order of methanomicrobiales were present in much lower amounts in both r1 fig 5 e and r3 fig 5 f populations in r1 rods and filaments appeared whereas only few rods hybridized with the probes in r3 within the bacterial population in all samples taken at the end of the operational runs day 217 streptococcus spp dominated in low salinity reactors 5 g na l fig 5 b which corresponds to the twisted chain shaped microorganism shown by sem at the exterior of the granule fig 4 a d while a long filamentous bacterium belonging to the family lachnospiraceae was the most represented in the granules grown at 20 g na l fig 5 d both belong to the phylum firmicutes and are reported as carbohydrate fermenting bacteria cotta and forster 2006 milinovich et al 2008 apparently salinity resulted in a shift in the bacterial and hydrogenotrophic methanogens populations while the other methanogenic biomass was not affected by increasing sodium concentration no other specific group of microorganisms could be visualized when applying all probes listed in table s2 3 2 cod removal efficiency fractionation in the effluent and methane production fig 6 shows that all reactors accomplished high removal efficiencies regardless of the salinity level and cod loading rate the average removal efficiencies based on scod during the entire operation period were 97 2 2 1 96 6 3 3 94 0 2 2 and 92 8 5 4 for r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively showing that the reactors operated at 5 g na l r1 and r2 performed slightly better than the ones operated at 20 g na l r3 and r4 no clear differences were observed between reactors seeded and not seeded with pac r1 and r2 at any stage of the continuous operation thus showing no effect of additional pac on start up of r1 and r2 effluent tcod was higher in reactors operated at 20 g na l in composite effluent samples at day 179 day 100 for r4 tcod was 257 mg l 330 mg l 769 mg l and 1170 mg l for r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively the pcod concentrations in the effluent were 31 89 5 120 8 and 222 5 mg l for r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively the fractions contributing to total effluent cod were similar for all reactors and are depicted in fig 7 a the detected vfas in the effluent were acetate and propionate the sum of these vfas contributed between 29 5 and 60 5 to the effluent soluble cod fig 7 b the highest vfa fraction was found in r3 operated at 20 g na l and the lowest fraction in r2 operated at 5 g na l these results show that between 39 5 and 70 5 of the soluble effluent cod consisted of organic material other than vfas the profiles of effluent vfas are shown in fig s3 generally lower effluent acetate and propionate concentrations were measured in r1 and r2 compared to r3 and r4 however both in r3 and r4 the effluent vfa concentrations showed a downward trend indicating an improvement of reactor performance over time the effluent acetate concentration at the end of operational runs of r3 and r4 were 85 and 34 7 mg l respectively whereas propionate concentration was 34 8 mg l in r3 and could not be detected in r4 cumulative biogas production as well as biogas composition were monitored over time biogas composition over the whole period was similar in the reactors operated at both 5 g r1 and r2 and 20 g na l r3 and r4 63 6 4 6 65 9 6 5 68 4 4 3 and 70 2 9 for r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively biogas production curves are presented in fig s4 and show continuous biogas production with increasing slopes as the loading rates increase 4 discussion 4 1 granulation and start up period 4 1 1 rapid granulation and start up at high salinity role of cations and pac in our uasb reactors a rapid granular sludge formation from dispersed biomass at 5 g na l and even at 20 g na l occurred figs 2 and 3 the first granules were already observed after 23 days fig 2 this is in contrast with ismail et al 2008 who showed that considerable washout of granular biomass from uasb reactors took place even at salinity levels as low as 5 g na l robust granules were formed even though the wastewater only contained a background concentration of 13 mg l of calcium during the first 3 months of operation multivalent cations are known to play a crucial role in the formation of microbial granules biofilms by bridging negatively charged groups of eps mahoney et al 1987 yu et al 2001 vlyssides et al 2009 flemming and wingender 2010 although their role with respect to effects on rates of granulation is somewhat controversial mahoney et al 1987 and yu et al 2001 reported that dosing of 100 300 mg ca2 l increases the rates of granulation and biomass retention during uasb start up whereas hulshoff pol 1989 and guiot et al 1988 found no positive effect upon addition of 150 640 mg ca2 l at non saline conditions since at high na concentrations ca2 is displaced in the eps matrix of granules thereby weakening the granular structure jeison et al 2008 ismail et al 2010 it would be expected that at highly saline conditions additional ca2 dosing would be needed to promote granulation here we demonstrated that at highly saline conditions granulation rate can be fast without dosing of additional calcium probably due to gelling of eps with sodium ions as discussed in paragraph 4 1 3 for all reactors a start up period as defined by ghangrekar et al 1996 of only 3 weeks was necessary at both salinity levels and regardless of the inoculum being sieved or intact fig 6 a d this period coincided with the appearance of the first granules fig 2 b and was as fast as reported at non saline conditions with operational parameters chosen for enhanced uasb start up ghangrekar et al 1996 interestingly during the start up no sizable difference was observed in process performance between r1 no pac added and r2 0 1 of inoculum mass pac and in the development of the particle size fig 3 a b as opposed to yu et al 1999 who reported faster granulation upon addition of pac to inoculum however the amount of pac that was mixed with the inoculum in our study was only 0 02 compared to 0 24 gpac gvss in experiments of yu et al 1999 zhou et al 2015 demonstrated that the diameter of the activated carbon can be a determining factor for enhancing the granulation process of sludge due to velocity field differences between the flocs and activated carbon it was concluded that 0 33 g gac gvss with a diameter of 0 2 mm enhances microbial granulation and reactor start up also yu et al 1999 used pac with a diameter of 0 2 mm whereas in our study the diameter of pac was 0 037 0 149 mm due to differences in both type and quantity of pac used in our study a definitive conclusion on why additional pac had no effect on process performance and granulation cannot be made 4 1 2 microbial key players sem fig 4 and fish fig 5 analysis show that different bacterial communities developed at different salinity levels even though the same organic substrate and inoculum were used within the archaeal population a member of the methanosaetaceae was the dominant methanogen in all reactors studied meanwhile the hydrogenotrophic methanomicrobiales decreased in abundance with increasing salinity it has been hypothesized by wiegant 1988 that a precursor of granulation is formation of filamentous methanosaeta nuclei to which other microbial cells can attach the aggregation properties of methanosaeta were also found to be crucial during anaerobic digestion in several other studies calli et al 2003 angenent et al 2004 li et al 2015 gagliano et al 2017a in r1 and r3 granules methanosaeta like cells and filaments were always detected in large clusters forming a nucleus for aggregation to which a bacterial population could attach fig 5 this demonstrated the possible fundamental role of this acetoclastic methanogen in granulation as already discussed by gagliano et al 2017b however the presence of the two bacteria as filaments may also have contributed to the aggregation this is the first time that streptococcus sp and lachnospiraceae family members were identified at salinity levels of 5 20 g na l and as key population within anaerobic granules fish analysis confirmed their association with methanosaeta clusters fig 5 a c in the 20 g na l granules the filamentous members of the family lachnospiraceae and methanosaeta clusters were uniformly distributed within the granule fig 4 e f with a clear dominance of the methanogens along the granular structure fig 5 c the close connection between the methanogenic and bacterial community in the granules suggests the presence of a syntrophic metabolism which given the substrate composition of the synthetic wastewater stream and the microbial metabolic characteristics could be based on glucose fermentation coupled with methane production the presence of methanomicrobiales was already shown in highly saline natural environments and wastewater treatment systems webster et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2016b and suggests that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was taking place most likely coupled with either protein or glucose fermentation stams 1994 however fish analysis could not clarify the utilization of the proteinaceous substrate which could be partially used for the eps build up by one of microbial protagonists 4 1 3 strength of granules the strength of the granules at low and high salinity was similar and the granules that were formed were stronger than the granules in the inoculum table 3 this is in conflict with the results of others using the same inoculum ismail et al 2008 2010 jeison et al 2008 also the high values of 70 98 6 days found for srts confirmed that robust granules were formed the different outcomes between ours and the other studies may be explained by different carbon sources used a factor shown to affect chemical composition of eps wolfaardt et al 1998 which can in turn affect the gelling properties of these polymers both monovalent and divalent cations can form gels with microbial polysaccharides e g gellan chandrasekaran and radha 1995 and alginate like eps are likely to bind both calcium and sodium ions seviour et al 2012 stewart et al 2014 meaning that both can play a role in granulation at high salinity calcium ions will form stronger gels than monovalent cations because carboxylate ca2 carboxylate interactions are stronger than those of for example carboxylate na water na carboxylate chandrasekaran and radha 1995 due to a much higher concentration of sodium over calcium in the influent wastewater of all reactors in our study sodium is very likely to play an important role in the process of granulation thus explaining the similar strength of granules measured both at 5 g na l and 20 g na l fig s5 shows that the concentration of sodium is 5 75 and 22 79 g l in granular sludge of r1 and r3 respectively whereas the concentration of calcium is 0 159 and 0 037 in the granular sludge of r1 and r3 the preliminary outcomes of metal analysis within the granular sludge indeed indicate that further investigation of the abovementioned hypothesis is needed to further understand the gelling properties of eps formed at high monovalent salt concentration 4 2 process performance 4 2 1 performance of bioreactors at 5 and 20 g na l role of substrate and inoculum biomass the reactors r1 r2 and r3 have been continuously operated for more than 200 days and reactor r4 for more than 170 days with stable process performance fig 6 this shows that with an appropriate inoculum selection start up procedure and operation highly saline waste streams can be treated in uasb reactors at loading rates as high as 16 g cod m3 d even though good cod removal efficiencies were obtained at 5 and 20 g na l fig 6 a d it becomes clear that total effluent cod concentrations around 1000 mg l require a further polishing step the higher effluent cod concentration at 20 g na l can be explained by a lower methanogenic activity li et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2016a sloughing of loosely bound eps a higher production of soluble eps corsino et al 2017 washout of individual cells and by a lower affinity of the microorganisms to the substrate since different microbial communities developed at 5 and 20 g na l fig 5 fig 7 shows that colloidal and soluble fractions were contributing to the largest effluent cod difference between 5 and 20 g na l reactors in these fractions both eps and microorganisms can potentially contribute to the cod content although deteriorating process performance and operational problems were found by other authors at levels close to or below 5 g na l patel and roth 1977 rinzema et al 1988 lefebvre et al 2007 jeison et al 2008 li et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2016a our findings are in agreement with de baere et al 1984 who have reported salt tolerance of anaerobic biomass similar to the one demonstrated here potentially both the substrate and inoculum adapted to 8 g na l used may have influenced the positive outcome of this research mccarty and mckinney 1961 patel and roth 1977 lefebvre et al 2007 from bioenergetics point of view in most prokaryotes uptake of osmoprotectants from surrounding liquid is preferred over de novo synthesis oren 1999 roeβler and müller 2001 gunde cimerman et al 2006 since also amino acids and their derivatives can act as osmolytes roberts 2005 tryptone fed to the reactors during our study may have acted as source of cheap osmoprotectants after undergoing hydrolysis also in experiments of de baere et al 1984 who reported salt tolerance of anaerobic biomass similar to one presented here peptone tryptic soy was added to synthetic wastewater in contrast to other studies reporting sodium inhibition in the absence of such substances use of salt adapted microorganisms as inoculum was suggested as one of the most suitable strategies to overcome sodium toxicity in anaerobic wastewater treatment vyrides 2015 the inoculum used in our study had been adapted to 8 g na l which is considerably lower than the 20 g na l applied in r3 and r4 however in the few studies where high methanogenic activity was found at comparable salinities the inoculum was adapted to similar salinity as reported here ismail et al 2010 gagliano et al 2017b demonstrating the importance of inoculum at high salinities 5 conclusions granulation of anaerobic biomass from dispersed inoculum is possible even at sodium concentrations as high as 20 g na l which was not reported in literature before moreover calcium concentration as low as 13 mg l is sufficient to form microbial granules at 20 g na l and is around ten times lower than the traditionally reported 100 150 mg ca2 l in non saline conditions the granulation process at 20 g na l can be accompanied by efficient soluble cod removal however the removal efficiency is still lower 92 8 5 4 to 94 0 2 2 compared to reactors operated with the same substrate at 5 g na l 96 6 3 3 to 97 2 2 1 interestingly addition of powdered activated carbon to inoculum does not guarantee a faster reactor start up high salinity acted as a selective pressure on the dominant active microbial streptococcus spp at 5 g na l and bacterium belonging to lachnospiraceae at 20 g na l and hydrogenotrophic archaeal community decreasing abundance of methanomicrobiales at elevated salinity interestingly the active acetoclastic archaeal community remained similar within the range of 5 20 g na l methanosaeta as dominant methanogen at both salinities acknowledgements this research is financed by the netherlands organisation for scientific research nwo

19883,it is commonly accepted that high salt concentrations negatively affect microbial activity in biological wastewater treatment reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors microbial aggregation in such reactors is equally important it is well documented that anaerobic granules when exposed to high salinity become weak and disintegrate causing wash out operational problems and decreasing process performance in this research the possibility of microbial granule formation from dispersed biomass was investigated at salinity levels of 5 and 20 g na l high removal efficiencies of soluble influent organics were achieved at both salinity levels and this was accompanied by fast and robust formation of microbial granules the process was found to be stable for the entire operational period of 217 days as far as we know this is the first time it has been demonstrated that stable granule formation is possible at a salinity level as high as 20 g na l methanosaeta was identified as the dominant methanogen at both salinity levels streptococcus spp and bacteria belonging to the family lachnospiraceae were identified as the dominant microbial population at 5 and 20 and g na l respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic sludge granulation uasb high salinity methanosaeta 1 introduction saline wastewater streams are generated by several industries such as the fish processing soto et al 1991 chemical agro food petroleum and leather industry lefebvre and moletta 2006 biodegradation of organics in such saline waste streams is reported to be poor due to toxic effects of sodium on the bacterial cells and archaea causing cell lysis and death sleator and hill 2002 vyrides and stuckey 2009 sochacki et al 2011 physical and chemical treatment processes are energy intensive and more expensive compared to biological processes fakhru l razi et al 2009 hence the need to explore the limits of biological wastewater treatment regarding salinity and to stretch these limits where possible because of a lower sensitivity of aerobic biomass to salt toxicity compared to anaerobic biomass most research is done on aerobic treatment freire et al 2001 tellez et al 2002 2005 zhao et al 2006 ozgun et al 2013 anaerobic biological wastewater treatment has several advantages over aerobic such as net energy recovery reduced sludge production and the possibility to handle higher volumetric loading rates if formation of granular or immobilised biomass is possible vieira et al 2005 vyrides et al 2010 xiao and roberts 2010 in the field of anaerobic wastewater treatment it is generally accepted that methanogenic activity is inhibited above sodium levels of 5 g na l mccarty and mckinney 1961 patel and roth 1977 rinzema et al 1988 liu and boone 1991 de vrieze et al 2016b however sodium toxicity may depend on the composition of wastewater due to possible antagonistic and synergistic effects caused by other ions mccarty and mckinney 1961 moreover the type of organic substrate generally determines the type of microorganisms evolving in the reactors and thus their sensitivity to sodium toxicity patel and roth 1977 lefebvre et al 2007 hence the potential of anaerobic treatment of saline wastewaters thus far may have been largely underestimated if high rate anaerobic bioreactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb for treatment of wastewater are applied both microbial activity and formation of granular microbial aggregates plays a crucial role on the process performance o flaherty et al 1997 yu et al 1999 liu et al 2009 lu et al 2013 after the initial formation of granules it is of equal importance to maintain a robust granular structure mchugh et al 2003 microbial granules of sufficient strength and weight then allow the decoupling of hydraulic and sludge retention times achieve high biomass concentrations and permit the use of compact reactors o flaherty et al 1997 liu et al 2009 the most commonly used methods to enhance the rate of granulation are addition of multivalent cations such as calcium 150 300 mg l zeeuw 1984 mahoney et al 1987 hulshoff pol 1989 yu et al 2001 and or addition of a support material such as powdered activated carbon pac wirtz and dague 1996 yu et al 1999 only a few studies have reported on the effect of monovalent salt stress on anaerobic granules all of these studies were performed by inoculating intact granular sludge and without exception showed subsequent granule disintegration biomass washout and loss of microbial activity rinzema et al 1988 jeison et al 2008 ismail et al 2010 li et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2016a as far as we know formation of anaerobic granules from dispersed biomass under saline conditions has not been reported before in this paper granulation from dispersed biomass accompanied by stable uasb process performance at sodium concentrations as high as 20 g na l is demonstrated for the first time the rate of granulation was compared to granulation at a reference level of 5 g na l the effect on granulation of small amounts of powdered activated carbon pac was studied calcium was only fed at extremely low concentrations of 13 mg l microscopic analyses coupled with fluorescent in situ hybridization fish showed dominance of filamentous methanosaeta irrespective of the salinity 5 or 20 g na l at which the uasb reactors were

retention time srt were collected on days 178 and 179 sampling of the sludge from bottom and top of the reactor columns was performed while flushing them with n2 gas to achieve good mixing the srt was

mastersizer 2000 malvern uk sampling was done as described above the volume and surface based mean particle sizes were calculated based on total volume or total surface of the particles respectively strength of the microbial aggregates was measured as described in xiao et al 2008 approx 0 12 g of suspended solids were used in each test the microbial aggregates were put in 50 ml centrifuge tubes filled with reactor medium up to 30 ml and vortexed at 2500 rpm for 2 4 and 8 min after each period of vortexing the aggregates were allowed to settle for 1 min and the supernatant was decanted to quantify the amount of fines produced as total suspended solids to minimize biomass removal from running bioreactors singletons were measured at each time point for strength characterization the integrity coefficient ic is calculated as follows i c x 1 s s x s s 0 100 where ic x the integrity coefficient after x minutes of vortexing ss x the amount of solids quantified after x minutes of vortexing ss 0 the total amount of solids used for the test the higher ic value corresponds to stronger aggregates 2 4 microscopy and image analysis 2 4 1 scanning electron microscopy sem samples of

modified using the imagej software package version1 37v wayne rasband national institute of health bethesda md usa 3 results 3 1 granulation 3 1 1 size strength and retention during start up fast granulation r1 r2 r4 and growth of particle size r3 was observed in all bioreactors irrespective of the salinity level or whether pac was added to the inoculum as an example fig 2 illustrates the development of granules over time in r4 microbial aggregation was already observed on day 23 fig 2 b while on day 33 the majority of the sludge bed consisted of granules fig 2 c by day 43 the sludge bed was completely filled with granular biomass fig 2 d particle size distribution psd was followed over time and was similar for r1 and r2 fig 3 a b shows an increase of particle sizes in r1 and r2 operated at 5 g na l compared to the maximum particle size of 125 μm of the inoculum fig 3 c d show that also in r3 and r4 operated at 20 g na l the particle size increased table 2 summarizes the development of volume and surface based average particle sizes in all four bioreactors addition of pac to the inoculum did not result in a faster development of granules compared to the inoculum where no pac was added r1 compared to r2 also no observable difference in the rate of granulation was found when comparing the start up of reactors with sieved biomass at 5 g na l r2 and 20 g na l r4 on day 79 the volume based average size of granules in r3 was higher than in r1 and r2 this difference is due to larger particles inoculated in r3 compared to the inoculum the average volume based size increased by 141 1 μm 124 7 μm and 121 4 μm in r1 r2 and r3 respectively thus the rate at which particle size increased in r1 r2 and r3 was similar the srts were 74 9 98 6 and 70 days for reactors r1 r2 and r3 respectively for r4 no solids balance was made as it was merely started up to study if the process of granulation from dispersed biomass is possible at 20 g na l in table 3 strength measurements of the granules indicate that in all bioreactors aggregates of higher strength compared to the inoculum developed the strength of microbial granules in r1 r2 and r3 was similar implying that strength was not affected by the sodium concentration or by addition of pac also the strength of granules formed from sieved biomass r1 and r2 was not different from the strength of the granules that developed from intact granules r3 the integrity coefficients during strength tests in r1 r3 stabilised with vortexing time while in r4 a decreasing trend remained these outcomes suggest that granules in r4 were less resistant to shear forces compared to r1 r3 this difference may be caused by scaled up set up of r4 which may have resulted in sludge exposure to different shear forces and mixing patterns of influent 3 1 2 microscopic analyses microscopic analysis carried out using fesem and fluorescence microscopy coupled with fish visualized the differences between granules operated at 5 and 20 g na l sem images of granules showed that the dominant morphology of the microorganisms was filamentous fig 4 in r1 and r2 operated at 5 g na l the most abundant morphologies were coccus shaped microorganisms organized in chains fig 4 a b c d in r3 operated at 20 g na l filaments were also observed but these mainly consisted of aggregated rod shaped cells fig 4 e f the difference in morphology at 5 g na l and 20 g na l suggests that different microbial communities were selected in response to salinity for further analysis fish probes were used to target the microbial groups commonly found in anaerobic treatment systems table s2 and in anaerobic environments the use of arc915 archaea domain specific probe combined with the application of specific probes for methanosarcinales methanosaetaceae and methanomicrobiales table s2 revealed acetoclastic methanosaetaceae as the dominant methanogen at both salinities fig 5 a c e and f in green while members of the hydrogenotrophic order of methanomicrobiales were present in much lower amounts in both r1 fig 5 e and r3 fig 5 f populations in r1 rods and filaments appeared whereas only few rods hybridized with the probes in r3 within the bacterial population in all samples taken at the end of the operational runs day 217 streptococcus spp dominated in low salinity reactors 5 g na l fig 5 b which corresponds to the twisted chain shaped microorganism shown by sem at the exterior of the granule fig 4 a d while a long filamentous bacterium belonging to the family lachnospiraceae was the most represented in the granules grown at 20 g na l fig 5 d both belong to the phylum firmicutes and are reported as carbohydrate fermenting bacteria cotta and forster 2006 milinovich et al 2008 apparently salinity resulted in a shift in the bacterial and hydrogenotrophic methanogens populations while the other methanogenic biomass was not affected by increasing sodium concentration no other specific group of microorganisms could be visualized when applying all probes listed in table s2 3 2 cod removal efficiency fractionation in the effluent and methane production fig 6 shows that all reactors accomplished high removal efficiencies regardless of the salinity level and cod loading rate the average removal efficiencies based on scod during the entire operation period were 97 2 2 1 96 6 3 3 94 0 2 2 and 92 8 5 4 for r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively showing that the reactors operated at 5 g na l r1 and r2 performed slightly better than the ones operated at 20 g na l r3 and r4 no clear differences were observed between reactors seeded and not seeded with pac r1 and r2 at any stage of the continuous operation thus showing no effect of additional pac on start up of r1 and r2 effluent tcod was higher in reactors operated at 20 g na l in composite effluent samples at day 179 day 100 for r4 tcod was 257 mg l 330 mg l 769 mg l and 1170 mg l for r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively the pcod concentrations in the effluent were 31 89 5 120 8 and 222 5 mg l for r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively the fractions contributing to total effluent cod were similar for all reactors and are depicted in fig 7 a the detected vfas in the effluent were acetate and propionate the sum of these vfas contributed between 29 5 and 60 5 to the effluent soluble cod fig 7 b the highest vfa fraction was found in r3 operated at 20 g na l and the lowest fraction in r2 operated at 5 g na l these results show that between 39 5 and 70 5 of the soluble effluent cod consisted of organic material other than vfas the profiles of effluent vfas are shown in fig s3 generally lower effluent acetate and propionate concentrations were measured in r1 and r2 compared to r3 and r4 however both in r3 and r4 the effluent vfa concentrations showed a downward trend indicating an improvement of reactor performance over time the effluent acetate concentration at the end of operational runs of r3 and r4 were 85 and 34 7 mg l respectively whereas propionate concentration was 34 8 mg l in r3 and could not be detected in r4 cumulative biogas production as well as biogas composition were monitored over time biogas composition over the whole period was similar in the reactors operated at both 5 g r1 and r2 and 20 g na l r3 and r4 63 6 4 6 65 9 6 5 68 4 4 3 and 70 2 9 for r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively biogas production curves are presented in fig s4 and show continuous biogas production with increasing slopes as the loading rates increase 4 discussion 4 1 granulation and start up period 4 1 1 rapid granulation and start up at high salinity role of cations and pac in our uasb reactors a rapid granular sludge formation from dispersed biomass at 5 g na l and even at 20 g na l occurred figs 2 and 3 the first granules were already observed after 23 days fig 2 this is in contrast with ismail et al 2008 who showed that considerable washout of granular biomass from uasb reactors took place even at salinity levels as low as 5 g na l robust granules were formed even though the wastewater only contained a background concentration of 13 mg l of calcium during the first 3 months of operation multivalent cations are known to play a crucial role in the formation of microbial granules biofilms by bridging negatively charged groups of eps mahoney et al 1987 yu et al 2001 vlyssides et al 2009 flemming and wingender 2010 although their role with respect to effects on rates of granulation is somewhat controversial mahoney et al 1987 and yu et al 2001 reported that dosing of 100 300 mg ca2 l increases the rates of granulation and biomass retention during uasb start up whereas hulshoff pol 1989 and guiot et al 1988 found no positive effect upon addition of 150 640 mg ca2 l at non saline conditions since at high na concentrations ca2 is displaced in the eps matrix of granules thereby weakening the granular structure jeison et al 2008 ismail et al 2010 it would be expected that at highly saline conditions additional ca2 dosing would be needed to promote granulation here we demonstrated that at highly saline conditions granulation rate can be fast without dosing of additional calcium probably due to gelling of eps with sodium ions as discussed in paragraph 4 1 3 for all reactors a start up period as defined by ghangrekar et al 1996 of only 3 weeks was necessary at both salinity levels and regardless of the inoculum being sieved or intact fig 6 a d this period coincided with the appearance of the first granules fig 2 b and was as fast as reported at non saline conditions with operational parameters chosen for enhanced uasb start up ghangrekar et al 1996 interestingly during the start up no sizable difference was observed in process performance between r1 no pac added and r2 0 1 of inoculum mass pac and in the development of the particle size fig 3 a b as opposed to yu et al 1999 who reported faster granulation upon addition of pac to inoculum however the amount of pac that was mixed with the inoculum in our study was only 0 02 compared to 0 24 gpac gvss in experiments of yu et al 1999 zhou et al 2015 demonstrated that the diameter of the activated carbon can be a determining factor for enhancing the granulation process of sludge due to velocity field differences between the flocs and activated carbon it was concluded that 0 33 g gac gvss with a diameter of 0 2 mm enhances microbial granulation and reactor start up also yu et al 1999 used pac with a diameter of 0 2 mm whereas in our study the diameter of pac was 0 037 0 149 mm due to differences in both type and quantity of pac used in our study a definitive conclusion on why additional pac had no effect on process performance and granulation cannot be made 4 1 2 microbial key players sem fig 4 and fish fig 5 analysis show that different bacterial communities developed at different salinity levels even though the same organic substrate and inoculum were used within the archaeal population a member of the methanosaetaceae was the dominant methanogen in all reactors studied meanwhile the hydrogenotrophic methanomicrobiales decreased in abundance with increasing salinity it has been hypothesized by wiegant 1988 that a precursor of granulation is formation of filamentous methanosaeta nuclei to which other microbial cells can attach the aggregation properties of methanosaeta were also found to be crucial during anaerobic digestion in several other studies calli et al 2003 angenent et al 2004 li et al 2015 gagliano et al 2017a in r1 and r3 granules methanosaeta like cells and filaments were always detected in large clusters forming a nucleus for aggregation to which a bacterial population could attach fig 5 this demonstrated the possible fundamental role of this acetoclastic methanogen in granulation as already discussed by gagliano et al 2017b however the presence of the two bacteria as filaments may also have contributed to the aggregation this is the first time that streptococcus sp and lachnospiraceae family members were identified at salinity levels of 5 20 g na l and as key population within anaerobic granules fish analysis confirmed their association with methanosaeta clusters fig 5 a c in the 20 g na l granules the filamentous members of the family lachnospiraceae and methanosaeta clusters were uniformly distributed within the granule fig 4 e f with a clear dominance of the methanogens along the granular structure fig 5 c the close connection between the methanogenic and bacterial community in the granules suggests the presence of a syntrophic metabolism which given the substrate composition of the synthetic wastewater stream and the microbial metabolic characteristics could be based on glucose fermentation coupled with methane production the presence of methanomicrobiales was already shown in highly saline natural environments and wastewater treatment systems webster et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2016b and suggests that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was taking place most likely coupled with either protein or glucose fermentation stams 1994 however fish analysis could not clarify the utilization of the proteinaceous substrate which could be partially used for the eps build up by one of microbial protagonists 4 1 3 strength of granules the strength of the granules at low and high salinity was similar and the granules that were formed were stronger than the granules in the inoculum table 3 this is in conflict with the results of others using the same inoculum ismail et al 2008 2010 jeison et al 2008 also the high values of 70 98 6 days found for srts confirmed that robust granules were formed the different outcomes between ours and the other studies may be explained by different carbon sources used a factor shown to affect chemical composition of eps wolfaardt et al 1998 which can in turn affect the gelling properties of these polymers both monovalent and divalent cations can form gels with microbial polysaccharides e g gellan chandrasekaran and radha 1995 and alginate like eps are likely to bind both calcium and sodium ions seviour et al 2012 stewart et al 2014 meaning that both can play a role in granulation at high salinity calcium ions will form stronger gels than monovalent cations because carboxylate ca2 carboxylate interactions are stronger than those of for example carboxylate na water na carboxylate chandrasekaran and radha 1995 due to a much higher concentration of sodium over calcium in the influent wastewater of all reactors in our study sodium is very likely to play an important role in the process of granulation thus explaining the similar strength of granules measured both at 5 g na l and 20 g na l fig s5 shows that the concentration of sodium is 5 75 and 22 79 g l in granular sludge of r1 and r3 respectively whereas the concentration of calcium is 0 159 and 0 037 in the granular sludge of r1 and r3 the preliminary outcomes of metal analysis within the granular sludge indeed indicate that further investigation of the abovementioned hypothesis is needed to further understand the gelling properties of eps formed at high monovalent salt concentration 4 2 process performance 4 2 1 performance of bioreactors at 5 and 20 g na l role of substrate and inoculum biomass the reactors r1 r2 and r3 have been continuously operated for more than 200 days and reactor r4 for more than 170 days with stable process performance fig 6 this shows that with an appropriate inoculum selection start up procedure and operation highly saline waste streams can be treated in uasb reactors at loading rates as high as 16 g cod m3 d even though good cod removal efficiencies were obtained at 5 and 20 g na l fig 6 a d it becomes clear that total effluent cod concentrations around 1000 mg l require a further polishing step the higher effluent cod concentration at 20 g na l can be explained by a lower methanogenic activity li et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2016a sloughing of loosely bound eps a higher production of soluble eps corsino et al 2017 washout of individual cells and by a lower affinity of the microorganisms to the substrate since different microbial communities developed at 5 and 20 g na l fig 5 fig 7 shows that colloidal and soluble fractions were contributing to the largest effluent cod difference between 5 and 20 g na l reactors in these fractions both eps and microorganisms can potentially contribute to the cod content although deteriorating process performance and operational problems were found by other authors at levels close to or below 5 g na l patel and roth 1977 rinzema et al 1988 lefebvre et al 2007 jeison et al 2008 li et al 2014 de vrieze et al 2016a our findings are in agreement with de baere et al 1984 who have reported salt tolerance of anaerobic biomass similar to the one demonstrated here potentially both the substrate and inoculum adapted to 8 g na l used may have influenced the positive outcome of this research mccarty and mckinney 1961 patel and roth 1977 lefebvre et al 2007 from bioenergetics point of view in most prokaryotes uptake of osmoprotectants from surrounding liquid is preferred over de novo synthesis oren 1999 roeβler and müller 2001 gunde cimerman et al 2006 since also amino acids and their derivatives can act as osmolytes roberts 2005 tryptone fed to the reactors during our study may have acted as source of cheap osmoprotectants after undergoing hydrolysis also in experiments of de baere et al 1984 who reported salt tolerance of anaerobic biomass similar to one presented here peptone tryptic soy was added to synthetic wastewater in contrast to other studies reporting sodium inhibition in the absence of such substances use of salt adapted microorganisms as inoculum was suggested as one of the most suitable strategies to overcome sodium toxicity in anaerobic wastewater treatment vyrides 2015 the inoculum used in our study had been adapted to 8 g na l which is considerably lower than the 20 g na l applied in r3 and r4 however in the few studies where high methanogenic activity was found at comparable salinities the inoculum was adapted to similar salinity as reported here ismail et al 2010 gagliano et al 2017b demonstrating the importance of inoculum at high salinities 5 conclusions granulation of anaerobic biomass from dispersed inoculum is possible even at sodium concentrations as high as 20 g na l which was not reported in literature before moreover calcium concentration as low as 13 mg l is sufficient to form microbial granules at 20 g na l and is around ten times lower than the traditionally reported 100 150 mg ca2 l in non saline conditions the granulation process at 20 g na l can be accompanied by efficient soluble cod removal however the removal efficiency is still lower 92 8 5 4 to 94 0 2 2 compared to reactors operated with the same substrate at 5 g na l 96 6 3 3 to 97 2 2 1 interestingly addition of powdered activated carbon to inoculum does not guarantee a faster reactor start up high salinity acted as a selective pressure on the dominant active microbial streptococcus spp at 5 g na l and bacterium belonging to lachnospiraceae at 20 g na l and hydrogenotrophic archaeal community decreasing abundance of methanomicrobiales at elevated salinity interestingly the active acetoclastic archaeal community remained similar within the range of 5 20 g na l methanosaeta as dominant methanogen at both salinities acknowledgements this research is financed by the netherlands organisation for scientific research nwo

19884,ready access to comprehensive influent information can help water reclamation plant wrp operators implement better real time process controls provide operational reliability and reduce energy consumption the five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 a critical parameter for wrp process control is expensive and difficult to measure using hard sensors an alternative approach based on a soft sensor methodology shows promise but can be problematic when used to predict high bod5 values underestimating high bod5 concentrations for process control could result in an insufficient amount of aeration increasing the risk of an effluent violation to address this issue we tested a hierarchical hybrid soft sensor approach involving multiple linear regression artificial neural networks ann and compromise programming while this hybrid approach results in a slight decrease in overall prediction accuracy relative to the approach based on ann only the underestimation percentage is substantially lower 37 vs 61 for predictions of carbonaceous bod5 cbod5 concentrations higher than the long term average value the hybrid approach is also flexible and can be adjusted depending on the relative importance between energy savings and managing the risk of an effluent violation graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochemical oxygen demand bod decision making energy saving risk management soft sensor wastewater 1 introduction soft sensors mathematical statistical approaches based on easily acquirable information and historical data offer an effective way to predict real time and future information which can result in more cost effective controls at a water reclamation plant wrp although our previous assessment zhu and anderson 2016 demonstrated multiple benefits of soft sensors including reliable predictions and flexibility in that work we focused on predicting average values of the target variables with that kind of focus predictions of values that deviate from the average can be poor which is a concern because failure to predict high influent bod5 concentration can increase the risk of violating an effluent permit one way to eliminate this risk is to provide excess aeration but that approach leads to excess energy consumption to address these issues we developed a hybrid approach that integrates a soft sensor methodology with a multi criteria decision analysis mcda technique the overall objective was to balance energy demand and risk management when predicting influent carbonaceous bod5 cbod5 at the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrdgc calumet wrp we combined an artificial neural network ann for accurate predictions of low cbod5 concentrations to minimize excess energy demand with the upper confidence limit ucl at 95 confidence level of multiple linear regression mlr to overestimate high cbod5 concentrations to minimize the risk of insufficient treatment this paper begins with a description of the advantages of ann and mlr 95 ucl in dealing with these kinds of predictions subsequently we present how compromise programming cp one of many mcda techniques can help to determine a critical value that splits the cbod5 data into two groups low and high concentrations the paper concludes with an evaluation of this hybrid model and discussion of how this hybrid approach can be applied to different local conditions such as permit requirements and energy costs 1 1 prediction of influent conditions at the calumet wrp the mwrdgc calumet plant one of the oldest plants in the chicago area began operations in 1922 based on ten years of recent 2002 2011 historical data mwrdgc 2013 the plant treats about 11 4 m3 s of influent wastewater with average concentrations of 20 mg tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen l nh3 n tkn 0 55 74 mg cbod5 l and 138 mg ss suspended solids l vss volatile ss ss 0 67 a more detailed inventory of these historical data was presented by zhu 2015 many existing wrps currently use excess energy for aeration to satisfy effluent permit requirements therefore effluent quality is not sensitive to influent conditions that sensitivity however increases when the amount of aeration is decreased zhu and anderson 2017 as a result a better understanding of the dynamic variations of influent characteristics can help wrp operators plan more cost effective process management soft sensor applications at wrps are attractive because of their relatively low cost short response time and compatibility with conventional hard sensor networks fortuna et al 2007 our initial evaluation of a soft sensor approach at the calumet wrp demonstrated reliable predictions of the current day s influent ammonia concentration r2 0 83 with mean relative error mre 13 3 and the next day s influent flow 0 83 and 11 9 using an iterated stepwise mlr ismlr methodology zhu and anderson 2016 however the ismlr approach yielded much lower accuracy for influent cbod5 predictions 0 40 and 26 5 especially for higher cbod5 concentrations prediction of higher cbod5 values is important because adequate treatment demands more energy for aeration and inadequate treatment increases the risk of an effluent permit violation 1 2 prediction of high bod concentration in contrast with other common influent parameters such as ammonia and phosphorus the conventional bod measurements involves a five day test the resulting lack of recent bod data could be the major cause of the relatively lower accuracy in real time daily resolution bod predictions using the conventional ismlr method although several previous studies have addressed this concern their approaches often relied on real time data that a conventional wrp may not have for example oliveira esquerre et al 2004 applied mlr or partial least squares pls methods to predict inlet bod concentration in an aerated lagoon at a pulp and paper mill their models based on real time cod information gave reasonably accurate predictions 0 57 r2 0 70 dogan et al 2008 compared ann and mlr methods to predict inlet bod concentrations at a wrp in adapazari turkey although both ann r2 up to 0 92 and mlr up to 0 91 models achieved very good accuracy their approach relied on real time cod tn and tp concentrations similarly rustum et al 2008 used a kohonen self organizing map a type of ann algorithm to predict influent bod5 concentration at three wrps in scotland their model provided good agreement r2 0 81 with measured data but it also relied on both real time cod and ammonia data kusiak et al 2013 developed an integrated model to predict cbod5 concentrations at a wtp in des moines iowa they first used genetic programming to estimate the most recent four bod daily data without relying on real time cod or nitrogen compounds and then tested several conventional soft sensors for predicting cbod5 based on the estimated bod data and other available historical data their approach obtained fairly good overall results but did not provide good predictions on higher cbod5 values in general information provided by these studies cannot be directly used to address concerns at the calumet wrp because other studies used real time information cod nitrogen compounds and phosphorus or recent within four days bod data in their models this information may not be readily available for a conventional wrp other studies looked for overall accuracy in their bod predictions they did not emphasize the high bod concentrations to understand how to better manage higher influent bod concentrations we reviewed and compared merits and drawbacks of typical soft sensor approaches as described below 1 3 soft sensor methodologies soft sensor methodologies fall into four major categories multivariate statistics oliveira esquerre et al 2004 appels et al 2011 machine learning wilkes et al 2011 seshan et al 2014 fuzzy logic and hybrid haimi et al 2013 based on the assumption of a normal distribution haimi et al 2013 multivariate statistics can provide clear linear relationships between input regressors and the predicted variable machine learning methods are attractive because of their ability to address nonlinear problems even though their internal structures can be difficult to interpret and they can be subject to the risk of overfitting haimi et al 2013 fuzzy logic methods are increasingly used often combined with ann as network based fuzzy inference system anfis perendeci et al 2008 huang et al 2010 the anfis method combines advantages from ann and fuzzy logic so it can be readily adapted and easier to interpret relative to a typical ann haimi et al 2013 anfis is a hybrid method combining different modeling algorithms which can lead to more accurate predictions some studies have demonstrated that hybrid methods can address a specific problem for example lee et al 2005 tested five different non parametric models that worked with the asm1 model to predict common wastewater parameters mlss ss cod and cn at a full scale coke manufacturing wastewater treatment plant they found that the nnpls pls ann achieved the best performance and could help to interpret the operation behavior for fault detection and isolation more recently khan et al 2013 proposed a hybrid method mlr fuzzy logic to predict d o concentrations in bow river calgary rather than giving deterministic results the hybrid method provided a range of probabilistic outputs they determined that the risk of low d o concentrations below the suggested guideline of 5 mg o2 l was between 3 9 and 4 9 the advantage of a hybrid method is that it can provide a way to manage high cbod5 values in other words even if a soft sensor approach cannot predict high cbod5 values at the desired level of accuracy it is possible to slightly overestimate these cbod5 values which can result in better risk management we developed a hierarchical hybrid method ismlr mlr ann that combined advantages from each individual method ismlr can identify a subset of important regressors mlr provided a prediction interval which can help to manage high cbod5 concentrations compared to other common methods ann provided the highest global prediction accuracy based on our preliminary investigation detailed information is provided in the methods section therefore it can be used to provide better predictions for low cbod5 concentrations to implement this approach it is necessary to determine a critical threshold to separate high and low cbod5 concentrations the choice of this threshold is important because if it is too high only a small fraction of the high concentrations will be accounted for increasing the risk of violating effluent permit requirements conversely a critical threshold that is set too low could generate too many overestimates leading to excess energy consumption mcda techniques can help address this concern 1 4 multi criteria decision analysis techniques dozens of mcda techniques have been developed they can be divided into either multi objective decision making modm or multi attribute decision making madm methods mendoza and martins 2006 lai et al 2008 malczewski 1999 summarized the main differences between modm and madm modm is used to make a decision among multiple objectives when one objective may have many attributes whereas madm is an analysis of multiple attributes for one objective for example operating a wrp could have many objectives such as energy savings effluent quality maintenance greenhouse gas reduction biogas production nutrient recovery and treated wastewater reuse the objective of overall energy savings at a wrp could benefit from different sources attributes including aeration electricity pumping electricity natural gas and space heating as a result a decision maker dm could have a significant influence using modm depending on the preference of objective s whereas dm influence with madm is much more limited depending on the existing operating conditions modm and madm are commonly designed for continuous and discrete optimization problems respectively common modm techniques are goal programming gp and compromise programming cp lai et al 2008 frequently used techniques in madm include analytic hierarchy process ahp preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations promethee elimination and choice expressing reality electre and multi attribute utility theory maut taha and daim 2013 a challenge in our study was to determine the critical threshold cbod5 value that strikes a balance between the objectives of minimizing energy consumption and managing the risk of a permit violation because this problem involves multiple objectives an modm technique such as gp or cp would be an appropriate method several previous studies have compared gp and cp techniques romero et al 1998 created examples and reported that gp and cp yielded similar results their cp model and the corresponding gp formulation coincided at a typical value of the distance parameter which were used for different mathematical distances in this study we used cp to determine the optimum threshold cbod5 value 2 methods this section begins with a brief summary of the steps and results regarding outlier detection missing data management and selection of important regressors descriptions of a preliminary soft sensor test objectives cp and a summary of the hierarchical hybrid method are also included more detail on these issues can be found in our previous publication zhu and anderson 2016 2 1 preliminary treatment based on the ten years of historical data mwrdgc 2013 14 available individual influent variables table 1 were used to predict cbod5 concentration a statistical summary of these 14 influent variables is available in supporting information table s1 these influent variables were first examined using periodogram analysis to identify their respective period patterns a total of 103 potential regressors including real time information such as temperature precipitation ph and flow identified for the current day with an appended t and historical data identified with an appended t x where x is the number of days before the current day were prepared to predict real time cbod5 concentrations cbod t in a soft sensor approach outliers and missing data require careful management if we defined the data beyond the two standard deviations from the mean as outliers we would lose more than 10 of the data if all of a certain day s data was deleted from the study just because one or more potential regressors values were missing in that day we would lose about 57 of the data as an alternative approach we adopted a distance based outlier detection heuristic method to detect outliers and developed an ismlr method to reduce the loss of missing data zhu and anderson 2016 in that distance based method the mean value of each parameter was calculated data for each parameter were arranged from the lowest to the highest values and the differences between adjacent values were examined at a point where the value of the difference exceeded the mean all the values from that point on were identified as outliers with this method only 54 outliers were identified from a total 3652 days of data and most of those outliers were located at the tail of that parameter s distribution fig s1 the distribution of the treated historical cbod5 data can be seen in fig s2 the ismlr method identified 18 important subset regressors table s2 and reduced the amount of data lost from 57 to 35 consequently we used the final treated dataset 18 regressors 2364 days of data to predict cbod t the ten years of data were divided into two sub datasets one for training 2002 2010 2057 days and one for testing 2011 307 days 2 2 preliminary soft sensor test we compared performances of four common soft sensor approaches mlr ann svm and chi squared automatic interaction detector chaid for predicting cbod5 concentrations these four approaches were tested by the same dataset 18 regressors 2364 days used with the ismlr model prediction performance was evaluated based on four typical criteria r2 mean absolute error mae mre and root mean square error rmse a preliminary test showed that ann provided the best prediction on cbod t table s3 figs s3 s4 subsequently we applied a multilayered perceptron ann method to build the model including eight hidden neurons fig s5 the mlr method provides the estimation on the regression coefficients and confidence limits for the regressors montgomery and runger 2011 as well as prediction on the cbod5 concentrations in this study we adopted a 95 confidence level to calculate the ucl for the cbod5 concentrations 2 3 definition of the two objectives the two objectives in this study were to maximize the energy efficiency and minimize the risk of effluent violation we used prediction accuracy to help describe the energy efficiency with state of the art process control the amount of aeration should be associated with the influent conditions so a sufficient but not excess amount of aeration can be provided to degrade organics and nutrients as a result higher accuracy in predicting influent conditions can reduce excess energy consumption and increase energy efficiency prediction accuracy is related to the inverse of prediction error equation 1 1 prediction accuracy 1000 prediction error 1000 i 1 n y i y ˆ i n in the above expression the number 1000 is a scaling factor to make it easier to communicate the results the prediction error is the average of the absolute difference between observed y i and predicted ŷ i values it is also important to prevent incorrect process control decisions that might lead to insufficient aeration therefore we also defined a safety factor the ratio of overestimation to underestimation of cbod t equation 2 as a tool to help to achieve better risk management in the equation i v a l u e is an indicator function to indicate membership of the difference between two values specifically i v a l u e 1 v a l u e 2 1 and 0 otherwise thus to enlarge the safety factor we can either increase the number of overestimated predictions or decrease the underestimated predictions 2 safety factor i 1 n i y ˆ i y i y ˆ i y i i 1 n i y i y ˆ i y i y ˆ i 2 4 compromise programming the purpose of cp is to minimize the distance from the alternative option z k to the ideal point z k ideal for the kth criterion objective function in a trade off problem the ideal point is a hypothetical location in the decision space that represents the optimum values of all objectives in this study the ideal point describes an option that has the highest prediction accuracy and the highest safety factor the distance is measured by the function l p which is a normalized distance equation 3 zeleny 1982 gan et al 1995 3 l p k 1 m w k d k p 1 p where d k z k i d e a l z k z k i d e a l z k a n t i i d e a l a n d k 1 m w k 1 in the above expression the overall distance l p of multiple objectives k 1 m is measured based on the weight w k and individual distance d k of each objective as well as a parameter p which is used to measure different types of distances as described below the individual distance d k is normalized based on the possible option z k the ideal point z k ideal and the anti ideal point z k anti ideal in other words different objectives can be scaled to the same range 0 1 ensuring uniform treatment the anti ideal point similar to the ideal point is also a reference point but it represents a combination of the worst option of each objective the lowest prediction accuracy and the lowest safety factor before applying cp parameters p and w k should be determined the most common p values are 1 2 and which are used to measure the manhattan euclidean and chebyshev distances respectively the first two describe the longest and shortest distances from a geometrical sense respectively whereas the latter represents the shortest distance from a numerical sense lai and hwang 1994 tecle et al 1998 applied cp to determine the optimal option for five objectives on forest management they reviewed several relevant studies such as zeleny 1982 and szidarovszky et al 1986 and offered the following advice for selection of the p value when the p value is increased from 1 to the cp is changed from minimizing the sum of individual regrets perfect compensation to minimizing the maximum regret no compensation the p value depends on the type of problem and the dms preferences in a problem that has a greater conflict between objectives the compensation is smaller in our problem energy efficiency and risk management are opposing objectives which present a large conflict therefore we set p to minimize the maximum regret of either prediction accuracy or safety factor the w k value usually depends on the dms preferences for example zarghami et al 2008 integrated water management criteria to improve water supply in zahedan iran using cp weights of the three criteria were determined by the preferences lower social hazard greater water supply lower costs of a director of a local company in this study we initially defined equal w k values for the prediction accuracy w 1 0 5 and the safety factor w 2 0 5 to avoid setting any preferences thereby obtaining results for a default or reference study in a later section we further explore the influence of w value finally the overall distance l for each alternative option can be specified equation 4 4 l lim p k 1 2 w k d k p 1 p max k w k d k 2 5 hierarchical hybrid method we built a hierarchical hybrid method based on ismlr ann mlr 95 ucl and cp fig 1 ismlr was used to manage missing data and select important subset regressors cp was applied to determine a critical cbod5 threshold value splitting the data into lower and higher cbod5 concentrations ann was used to predict the lower cbod5 concentrations and mlr 95 ucl was employed to manage the higher cbod5 concentrations a preliminary test with ann prediction showed that the average and maximum predicted cbod t values were about 73 3 and 128 2 mg o2 l respectively based on the training dataset there is an infinite number of options for selecting a threshold value between those cbod t values we evaluated 21 options in a range from 70 to 120 mg o2 l with a step of 2 5 mg o2 l we first calculated the prediction accuracy and the safety factor for each candidate option next based on the result from cp we determined the optimum option and combined the prediction results from ann and mlr 95 ucl based on the training dataset we also included a confirmation step by repeating a similar procedure based on the testing dataset to examine whether or not the same threshold value was obtained cbod5 data in training and testing datasets have statistically the same distributions fig s6 based on a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test therefore in addition to our primary hypothesis that the hybrid model could slightly sacrifice accuracy but significantly reduce underestimations of influent cbod5 concentrations we also tested the hypothesis that the optimum option determined by the testing dataset should be similar to the option found in the training dataset 2 6 quality assurance and quality control qa qc all modeling and analyses were based on the historical data from the mwrdgc calumet wrp mwrdgc 2013 which has a rigorous qa qc program therefore there was no additional qa qc assessment in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 predictions based on individual ann and mlr 95 ucl the ann method has accurate predictions for low cbod5 concentrations but underestimates most of the high cbod5 concentrations fig 2 a applying the mlr at 95 ucl lead to better predictions for many high cbod5 concentrations fig 2 b more than 42 of the 2364 days of cbod5 concentrations are underestimated in the ann procedure but the mlr 95 ucl can reduce the percentage of the underestimated values to only about 3 5 when the evaluation is based on the 1058 days that have relatively higher cbod5 concentrations 73 8 mg o2 l the ann method does not overestimate the values for about 62 of the days whereas the mlr 95 ucl proves its ability to better manage risk by underestimating a smaller percentage 7 8 of the values for more information of their comparison in terms of concentration and residual refer to figs s7 s8 3 2 safety factor and prediction accuracy unsurprisingly the safety factor decreases and prediction accuracy increases as the threshold cbod5 value increases fig 3 characteristics of the hybrid model vary depending on the threshold cbod5 value when a higher threshold is applied the hybrid model begins to approach results from the ann model for example when 120 mg o2 l is selected as the threshold value there is no significant difference between the hybrid model and the ann model the safety factor in this hybrid model is about 1 which means a perfect balance between positive and negative residuals meanwhile the model provides relatively higher accuracy 68 8 l mg in other words it shows the advantages of a conventional soft sensor approach on residual balance and prediction accuracy in contrast lower threshold values cannot achieve high accuracy but they do provide a higher safety factor the model based on a threshold value of 70 mg o2 l is almost the same as the mlr 95 ucl model the accuracy is low 36 3 l mg but it results in a much higher safety factor 7 4 for each threshold value the model yields different values of the safety factor and the prediction accuracy because these two parameters have very different responses to changes in the threshold cbod5 value there is a trade off between the two objectives fig 3 in the range of threshold cbod5 values investigated the ideal point represents a combination of both the highest safety factor 7 4 and prediction accuracy 68 8 l mg and the anti ideal point represents a combination of the lowest safety factor 1 1 and prediction accuracy 36 3 l mg 3 3 decision making of the threshold value based on the cp analysis the shortest overall distance l was 87 5 mg o2 l which was consequently considered as the threshold cbod5 value fig 4 the relationship between l and the threshold value appears as a v shape each of the two sides reaches the same highest value 0 5 the v shape is not symmetrical and the best option at 87 5 mg o2 l has the smallest value of l 0 33 at this threshold value the model safety factor is 3 3 and the prediction accuracy is 47 1 l mg 3 4 confirmation based on the testing dataset although the testing dataset leads to different ranges for the safety factor and prediction accuracy relative to the training dataset the result yields a pattern similar to the training dataset fig 5 a it also results in the same best option 87 5 mg o2 l for the threshold value fig 5 b in general compared to the training dataset the testing dataset results in a lower prediction accuracy and a higher safety factor when the same threshold value is used as a result the testing dataset has different ideal 10 0 52 8 l mg and anti ideal 1 1 24 5 l mg points however the cp analysis suggests that a threshold value 87 5 mg o2 l is also the best alternative for the testing data in other words even for different datasets the same threshold value provides a good balance for the two objectives we conclude that one of our hypotheses is correct a similar decision the optimum option is very likely to be made based on independent datasets that have the same statistical distribution it is also worthwhile to note that we expected to obtain a similar option not the same option because our testing options are discrete it is possible that 87 5 mg o2 l is the closest option to the true threshold values which are not necessarily the same but must be very close to each other 3 5 overall evaluation the hybrid model provides a more flexible approach yielding good predictions for the lower concentrations and responding appropriately to higher cbod5 concentrations the ann and hybrid models lead to similar results in terms of linear correlations for training and testing datasets but the hybrid model has a larger error based on mre table 2 these two criteria show different patterns because they measure the prediction error from different perspectives a larger mre means the predicted values deviate more from the average values whereas this sacrifice of overall prediction accuracy offers better risk management with respect to high cbod5 concentrations specifically the days with cbod5 concentrations larger than the mean value 74 mg o2 l in the training and testing datasets are 904 and 147 respectively the ann model underestimates about 62 of these days whereas the hybrid model can reduce that value to about 37 when the evaluation is based on concentrations higher than 116 mg o2 l 90th percentile 113 mg o2 l more than 94 of the data are not managed very well using the ann method but the hybrid model yields a much lower underestimation percentage 38 a comparison between measured data and hybrid model results is also summarized in fig s9 training part and figs s10 s11 testing part two clear clusters show the predicted values based on ann or mlr 95 ucl the upper cluster of predictions based on mlr 95 ucl can also be divided into two subsets that represent sacrifice in energy savings or better risk management although several extremely high values are still underestimated fig s12 compared to the ann model the hybrid model has lower prediction residuals for example in the testing part the two highest cbod5 values are about 275 2 and 252 8 mg o2 l with the ann model the residuals are about 164 8 and 127 6 mg o2 l respectively whereas with the hybrid model the residuals are about 116 1 and 67 2 mg o2 l respectively a more detailed summary of underestimation can be seen in fig s13 to provide better risk management of the extremely high concentrations there are at least two ways the application might be improved the first way is to extend the approach to a more complicated multi hierarchy model where the model could have multiple threshold cbod5 values for each hierarchical group of data different upper confidence limits 90 99 could be used the second way which is more comprehensive and could be used in parallel with the approach used in this study involves simultaneous consideration of other influent compositions historical data suggest that more aeration should be used when certain influent scenarios occur for example on february 1st 2011 in addition to relatively high cbod5 concentration 112 9 mg o2 l there was also a very high influent ammonia concentration 21 1 mg n l vs average 10 8 mg n l and a low influent ss concentration 113 mg l vs average 138 mg l as a result the facility operated at an aeration rate 90 6 m3 s that was higher than the average 71 7 m3 s in contrast on march 10th 2005 although the influent cbod5 was high 109 5 mg o2 l the facility operated with lower aeration 56 6 m3 s at an average influent ammonia 11 9 mg n l and a high ss 305 mg l concentrations in other words if the cbod5 concentration is the only unusual high influent parameter the risk of lower effluent quality is smaller relative to the risk of lower effluent quality when influent cbod5 and ammonia are simultaneously high and the influent ss concentrations are low under such conditions it is better to provide more energy to avoid a permit violation this approach is feasible because compared to cbod5 ammonia and ss can be more readily predicted verma et al 2013 zhu and anderson 2016 it is also worthwhile to note that this proposed hybrid approach offers flexibility with respect to lower or upper confidence limits multiple confidence limits or replacement of ann with other more advanced algorithms as a result it is possible to adapt this approach to other constituents such as dissolved oxygen basant et al 2010 or total coliforms yazdi and scholz 2010 in an attempt to find the best way to manage extreme values 3 6 local applicability the hybrid approach described above includes an assumption of equal weights for both objectives however these weights could be adjusted by the dm taking into account the local conditions such as permit requirements energy costs process conditions weather conditions and control flexibility examples of how different weights of the safety factor from 0 to 1 influence the final decision are summarized in fig 6 because only two objectives were investigated in this study the weight of prediction accuracy is correspondingly changed from 1 to 0 in general although there is a slight bias toward weightsafety factor 0 and threshold cbod5 value 70 mgo2 l the distribution of l values is nearly symmetrical around the point where weightsafety factor 0 5 threshold cbod5 value 87 5 mgo2 l and l 0 33 when the weightsafety factor is relatively low the l decreases with increasing threshold cbod5 value and the lowest l value occurs at a relatively high threshold cbod5 value in contrast at higher values of weightsafety factor the l increases with increasing threshold cbod5 value and the shortest l occurs at a relatively low threshold cbod5 value when the weightsafety factor is between these two extreme values the change of l value similar to the information presented previously exhibits a v shape with different minimum l values at different values of weightsafety factor if the local dm believes that the safety factor is more important it is clear that a small threshold cbod5 value should be used as a result in addition to high cbod5 concentrations many median to high concentrations are also included in the overestimation this approach may be more appropriate in cases where the local energy cost is relatively low or the effluent permit limit is relatively strict in contrast a low safety factor weight seems more suitable if the occurrence probability of days with high influent cbod5 concentration especially extreme high concentration is low based on the local historical data 4 conclusions because our previous conventional soft sensor approach did not provide acceptable predictions for relatively high cbod5 concentrations we developed a hierarchical hybrid ismlr ann and mlr method to separately manage predictions of lower and higher influent cbod5 concentrations based on cp decision making results from this study can be summarized as follows when equal weights 0 5 were used for both safety factor and prediction accuracy the optimum option for the threshold cbod5 value was 87 5 mg o2 l based on the training dataset compared to the training dataset the testing dataset has relatively lower values of prediction accuracy and a wider range for the safety factor however the two datasets both lead to the same optimum threshold cbod5 value supporting the decision process compared to an individual ann approach the hybrid approach can significantly reduce the underestimation percentage for example from about 90 to 30 for concentrations larger than 110 mg o2 l with respect to relatively high cbod5 concentration with only a relatively small increase in the prediction error the hybrid model is flexible it can be modified to use different confidence limits or include other advanced algorithm s for predicting different constituents as well as to adapt to local conditions such as permit requirements energy costs process conditions weather conditions and control flexibility by adjusting the weights of the safety factor or prediction accuracy the dm can obtain a more compatible and practical local model in future work we hope to use a wrp process model to evaluate differences between a conventional ann approach and our hybrid soft sensor approach for balancing the energy savings and risk management the evaluation will be based on simulation results which include aeration consumption costs and effluent quality zhu 2015 demonstrated that pid controls based on simple d o set points can improve the energy efficiency therefore as part of the future work we will also investigate integration among soft sensors process simulation and process controls acknowledgement this study is part of project funded by the national science foundation nsf award

19884,ready access to comprehensive influent information can help water reclamation plant wrp operators implement better real time process controls provide operational reliability and reduce energy consumption the five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 a critical parameter for wrp process control is expensive and difficult to measure using hard sensors an alternative approach based on a soft sensor methodology shows promise but can be problematic when used to predict high bod5 values underestimating high bod5 concentrations for process control could result in an insufficient amount of aeration increasing the risk of an effluent violation to address this issue we tested a hierarchical hybrid soft sensor approach involving multiple linear regression artificial neural networks ann and compromise programming while this hybrid approach results in a slight decrease in overall prediction accuracy relative to the approach based on ann only the underestimation percentage is substantially lower 37 vs 61 for predictions of carbonaceous bod5 cbod5 concentrations higher than the long term average value the hybrid approach is also flexible and can be adjusted depending on the relative importance between energy savings and managing the risk of an effluent violation graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochemical oxygen demand bod decision making energy saving risk management soft sensor wastewater 1 introduction soft sensors mathematical statistical approaches based on easily acquirable information and historical data offer an effective way to predict real time and future information which can result in more cost effective controls at a water reclamation plant wrp although our previous assessment zhu and anderson 2016 demonstrated multiple benefits of soft sensors including reliable predictions and flexibility in that work we focused on predicting average values of the target variables with that kind of focus predictions of values that deviate from the average can be poor which is a concern because failure to predict high influent bod5 concentration can increase the risk of violating an effluent permit one way to eliminate this risk is to provide excess aeration but that approach leads to excess energy consumption to address these issues we developed a hybrid approach that integrates a soft sensor methodology with a multi criteria decision analysis mcda technique the overall objective was to balance energy demand and risk management when predicting influent carbonaceous bod5 cbod5 at the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrdgc calumet wrp we combined an artificial neural network ann for accurate predictions of low cbod5 concentrations to minimize excess energy demand with the upper confidence limit ucl at 95 confidence level of multiple linear regression mlr to overestimate high cbod5 concentrations to minimize the risk of insufficient treatment this paper begins with a description of the advantages of ann and mlr 95 ucl in dealing with these kinds of predictions subsequently we present how compromise programming cp one of many mcda techniques can help to determine a critical value that splits the cbod5 data into two groups low and high concentrations the paper concludes with an evaluation of this hybrid model and discussion of how this hybrid approach can be applied to different local conditions such as permit requirements and energy costs 1 1 prediction of influent conditions at the calumet wrp the mwrdgc calumet plant one of the oldest plants in the chicago area began operations in 1922 based on ten years of recent 2002 2011 historical data mwrdgc 2013 the plant treats about 11 4 m3 s of influent wastewater with average concentrations of 20 mg tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen l nh3 n tkn 0 55 74 mg cbod5 l and 138 mg ss suspended solids l vss volatile ss ss 0 67 a more detailed inventory of these historical data was presented by zhu 2015 many existing wrps currently use excess energy for aeration to satisfy effluent permit requirements therefore effluent quality is not sensitive to influent conditions that sensitivity however increases when the amount of aeration is decreased zhu and anderson 2017 as a result a better understanding of the dynamic variations of influent characteristics can help wrp operators plan more cost effective process management soft sensor applications at wrps are attractive because of their relatively low cost short response time and compatibility with conventional hard sensor networks fortuna et al 2007 our initial evaluation of a soft sensor approach at the calumet wrp demonstrated reliable predictions of the current day s influent ammonia concentration r2 0 83 with mean relative error mre 13 3 and the next day s influent flow 0 83 and 11 9 using an iterated stepwise mlr ismlr methodology zhu and anderson 2016 however the ismlr approach yielded much lower accuracy for influent cbod5 predictions 0 40 and 26 5 especially for higher cbod5 concentrations prediction of higher cbod5 values is important because adequate treatment demands more energy for aeration and inadequate treatment increases the risk of an effluent permit violation 1 2 prediction of high bod concentration in contrast with other common influent parameters such as ammonia and phosphorus the conventional bod measurements involves a five day test the resulting lack of recent bod data could be the major cause of the relatively lower accuracy in real time daily resolution bod predictions using the conventional ismlr method although several previous studies have addressed this concern their approaches often relied on real time data that a conventional wrp may not have for example oliveira esquerre et al 2004 applied mlr or partial least squares pls methods to predict inlet bod concentration in an aerated lagoon at a pulp and paper mill their models based on real time cod information gave reasonably accurate predictions 0 57 r2 0 70 dogan et al 2008 compared ann and mlr methods to predict inlet bod concentrations at a wrp in adapazari turkey although both ann r2 up to 0 92 and mlr up to 0 91 models achieved very good accuracy their approach relied on real time cod tn and tp concentrations similarly rustum et al 2008 used a kohonen self organizing map a type of ann algorithm to predict influent bod5 concentration at three wrps in scotland their model provided good agreement r2 0 81 with measured data but it also relied on both real time cod and ammonia data kusiak et al 2013 developed an integrated model to predict cbod5 concentrations at a wtp in des moines iowa they first used genetic programming to estimate the most recent four bod daily data without relying on real time cod or nitrogen compounds and then tested several conventional soft sensors for predicting cbod5 based on the estimated bod data and other available historical data their approach obtained fairly good overall results but did not provide good predictions on higher cbod5 values in general information provided by these studies cannot be directly used to address concerns at the calumet wrp because other studies used real time information cod nitrogen compounds and phosphorus or recent within four days bod data in their models this information may not be readily available for a conventional wrp other studies looked for overall accuracy in their bod predictions they did not emphasize the high bod concentrations to understand how to better manage higher influent bod concentrations we reviewed and compared merits and drawbacks of typical soft sensor approaches as described below 1 3 soft sensor methodologies soft sensor methodologies fall into four major categories multivariate statistics oliveira esquerre et al 2004 appels et al 2011 machine learning wilkes et al 2011 seshan et al 2014 fuzzy logic and hybrid haimi et al 2013 based on the assumption of a normal distribution haimi et al 2013 multivariate statistics can provide clear linear relationships between input regressors and the predicted variable machine learning methods are attractive because of their ability to address nonlinear problems even though their internal structures can be difficult to interpret and they can be subject to the risk of overfitting haimi et al 2013 fuzzy logic methods are increasingly used often combined with ann as network based fuzzy inference system anfis perendeci et al 2008 huang et al 2010 the anfis method combines advantages from ann and fuzzy logic so it can be readily adapted and easier to interpret relative to a typical ann haimi et al 2013 anfis is a hybrid method combining different modeling algorithms which can lead to more accurate predictions some studies have demonstrated that hybrid methods can address a specific problem for example lee et al 2005 tested five different non parametric models that worked with the asm1 model to predict common wastewater parameters mlss ss cod and cn at a full scale coke manufacturing wastewater treatment plant they found that the nnpls pls ann achieved the best performance and could help to interpret the operation behavior for fault detection and isolation more recently khan et al 2013 proposed a hybrid method mlr fuzzy logic to predict d o concentrations in bow river calgary rather than giving deterministic results the hybrid method provided a range of probabilistic outputs they determined that the risk of low d o concentrations below the suggested guideline of 5 mg o2 l was between 3 9 and 4 9 the advantage of a hybrid method is that it can provide a way to manage high cbod5 values in other words even if a soft sensor approach cannot predict high cbod5 values at the desired level of accuracy it is possible to slightly overestimate these cbod5 values which can result in better risk management we developed a hierarchical hybrid method ismlr mlr ann that combined advantages from each individual method ismlr can identify a subset of important regressors mlr provided a prediction interval which can help to manage high cbod5 concentrations compared to other common methods ann provided the highest global prediction accuracy based on our preliminary investigation detailed information is provided in the methods section therefore it can be used to provide better predictions for low cbod5 concentrations to implement this approach it is necessary to determine a critical threshold to separate high and low cbod5 concentrations the choice of this threshold is important because if it is too high only a small fraction of the high concentrations will be accounted for increasing the risk of violating effluent permit requirements conversely a critical threshold that is set too low could generate too many overestimates leading to excess energy consumption mcda techniques can help address this concern 1 4 multi criteria decision analysis techniques dozens of mcda techniques have been developed they can be divided into either multi objective decision making modm or multi attribute decision making madm methods mendoza and martins 2006 lai et al 2008 malczewski 1999 summarized the main differences between modm and madm modm is used to make a decision among multiple objectives when one objective may have many attributes whereas madm is an analysis of multiple attributes for one objective for example operating a wrp could have many objectives such as energy savings effluent quality maintenance greenhouse gas reduction biogas production nutrient recovery and treated wastewater reuse the objective of overall energy savings at a wrp could benefit from different sources attributes including aeration electricity pumping electricity natural gas and space heating as a result a decision maker dm could have a significant influence using modm depending on the preference of objective s whereas dm influence with madm is much more limited depending on the existing operating conditions modm and madm are commonly designed for continuous and discrete optimization problems respectively common modm techniques are goal programming gp and compromise programming cp lai et al 2008 frequently used techniques in madm include analytic hierarchy process ahp preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations promethee elimination and choice expressing reality electre and multi attribute utility theory maut taha and daim 2013 a challenge in our study was to determine the critical threshold cbod5 value that strikes a balance between the objectives of minimizing energy consumption and managing the risk of a permit violation because this problem involves multiple objectives an modm technique such as gp or cp would be an appropriate method several previous studies have compared gp and cp techniques romero et al 1998 created examples and reported that gp and cp yielded similar results their cp model and the corresponding gp formulation coincided at a typical value of the distance parameter which were used for different mathematical distances in this study we used cp to determine the optimum threshold cbod5 value 2 methods this section begins with a brief summary of the steps and results regarding outlier detection missing data management and selection of important regressors descriptions of a preliminary soft sensor test objectives cp and a summary of the hierarchical hybrid method are also included more detail on these issues can be found in our previous publication zhu and anderson 2016 2 1 preliminary treatment based on the ten years of historical data mwrdgc 2013 14 available individual influent variables table 1 were used to predict cbod5 concentration a statistical summary of these 14 influent variables is available in supporting information table s1 these influent variables were first examined using periodogram analysis to identify their respective period patterns a total of 103 potential regressors including real time information such as temperature precipitation ph and flow identified for the current day with an appended t and historical data identified with an appended t x where x is the number of days before the current day were prepared to predict real time cbod5 concentrations cbod t in a soft sensor approach outliers and missing data require careful management if we defined the data beyond the two standard deviations from the mean as outliers we would lose more than 10 of the data if all of a certain day s data was deleted from the study just because one or more potential regressors values were missing in that day we would lose about 57 of the data as an alternative approach we adopted a distance based outlier detection heuristic method to detect outliers and developed an ismlr method to reduce the loss of missing data zhu and anderson 2016 in that distance based method the mean value of each parameter was calculated data for each parameter were arranged from the lowest to the highest values and the differences between adjacent values were examined at a point where the value of the difference exceeded the mean all the values from that point on were identified as outliers with this method only 54 outliers were identified from a total 3652 days of data and most of those outliers were located at the tail of that parameter s distribution fig s1 the distribution of the treated historical cbod5 data can be seen in fig s2 the ismlr method identified 18 important subset regressors table s2 and reduced the amount of data lost from 57 to 35 consequently we used the final treated dataset 18 regressors 2364 days of data to predict cbod t the ten years of data were divided into two sub datasets one for training 2002 2010 2057 days and one for testing 2011 307 days 2 2 preliminary soft sensor test we compared performances of four common soft sensor approaches mlr ann svm and chi squared automatic interaction detector chaid for predicting cbod5 concentrations these four approaches were tested by the same dataset 18 regressors 2364 days used with the ismlr model prediction performance was evaluated based on four typical criteria r2 mean absolute error mae mre and root mean square error rmse a preliminary test showed that ann provided the best prediction on cbod t table s3 figs s3 s4 subsequently we applied a multilayered perceptron ann method to build the model including eight hidden neurons fig s5 the mlr method provides the estimation on the regression coefficients and confidence limits for the regressors montgomery and runger 2011 as well as prediction on the cbod5 concentrations in this study we adopted a 95 confidence level to calculate the ucl for the cbod5 concentrations 2 3 definition of the two objectives the two objectives in this study were to maximize the energy efficiency and minimize the risk of effluent violation we used prediction accuracy to help describe the energy efficiency with state of the art process control the amount of aeration should be associated with the influent conditions so a sufficient but not excess amount of aeration can be provided to degrade organics and nutrients as a result higher accuracy in predicting influent conditions can reduce excess energy consumption and increase energy efficiency prediction accuracy is related to the inverse of prediction error equation 1 1 prediction accuracy 1000 prediction error 1000 i 1 n y i y ˆ i n in the above expression the number 1000 is a scaling factor to make it easier to communicate the results the prediction error is the average of the absolute difference between observed y i and predicted ŷ i values it is also important to prevent incorrect process control decisions that might lead to insufficient aeration therefore we also defined a safety factor the ratio of overestimation to underestimation of cbod t equation 2 as a tool to help to achieve better risk management in the equation i v a l u e is an indicator function to indicate membership of the difference between two values specifically i v a l u e 1 v a l u e 2 1 and 0 otherwise thus to enlarge the safety factor we can either increase the number of overestimated predictions or decrease the underestimated predictions 2 safety factor i 1 n i y ˆ i y i y ˆ i y i i 1 n i y i y ˆ i y i y ˆ i 2 4 compromise programming the purpose of cp is to minimize the distance from the alternative option z k to the ideal point z k ideal for the kth criterion objective function in a trade off problem the ideal point is a hypothetical location in the decision space that represents the optimum values of all objectives in this study the ideal point describes an option that has the highest prediction accuracy and the highest safety factor the distance is measured by the function l p which is a normalized distance equation 3 zeleny 1982 gan et al 1995 3 l p k 1 m w k d k p 1 p where d k z k i d e a l z k z k i d e a l z k a n t i i d e a l a n d k 1 m w k 1 in the above expression the overall distance l p of multiple objectives k 1 m is measured based on the weight w k and individual distance d k of each objective as well as a parameter p which is used to measure different types of distances as described below the individual distance d k is normalized based on the possible option z k the ideal point z k ideal and the anti ideal point z k anti ideal in other words different objectives can be scaled to the same range 0 1 ensuring uniform treatment the anti ideal point similar to the ideal point is also a reference point but it represents a combination of the worst option of each objective the lowest prediction accuracy and the lowest safety factor before applying cp parameters p and w k should be determined the most common p values are 1 2 and which are used to measure the manhattan euclidean and chebyshev distances respectively the first two describe the longest and shortest distances from a geometrical sense respectively whereas the latter represents the shortest distance from a numerical sense lai and hwang 1994 tecle et al 1998 applied cp to determine the optimal option for five objectives on forest management they reviewed several relevant studies such as zeleny 1982 and szidarovszky et al 1986 and offered the following advice for selection of the p value when the p value is increased from 1 to the cp is changed from minimizing the sum of individual regrets perfect compensation to minimizing the maximum regret no compensation the p value depends on the type of problem and the dms preferences in a problem that has a greater conflict between objectives the compensation is smaller in our problem energy efficiency and risk management are opposing objectives which present a large conflict therefore we set p to minimize the maximum regret of either prediction accuracy or safety factor the w k value usually depends on the dms preferences for example zarghami et al 2008 integrated water management criteria to improve water supply in zahedan iran using cp weights of the three criteria were determined by the preferences lower social hazard greater water supply lower costs of a director of a local company in this study we initially defined equal w k values for the prediction accuracy w 1 0 5 and the safety factor w 2 0 5 to avoid setting any preferences thereby obtaining results for a default or reference study in a later section we further explore the influence of w value finally the overall distance l for each alternative option can be specified equation 4 4 l lim p k 1 2 w k d k p 1 p max k w k d k 2 5 hierarchical hybrid method we built a hierarchical hybrid method based on ismlr ann mlr 95 ucl and cp fig 1 ismlr was used to manage missing data and select important subset regressors cp was applied to determine a critical cbod5 threshold value splitting the data into lower and higher cbod5 concentrations ann was used to predict the lower cbod5 concentrations and mlr 95 ucl was employed to manage the higher cbod5 concentrations a preliminary test with ann prediction showed that the average and maximum predicted cbod t values were about 73 3 and 128 2 mg o2 l respectively based on the training dataset there is an infinite number of options for selecting a threshold value between those cbod t values we evaluated 21 options in a range from 70 to 120 mg o2 l with a step of 2 5 mg o2 l we first calculated the prediction accuracy and the safety factor for each candidate option next based on the result from cp we determined the optimum option and combined the prediction results from ann and mlr 95 ucl based on the training dataset we also included a confirmation step by repeating a similar procedure based on the testing dataset to examine whether or not the same threshold value was obtained cbod5 data in training and testing datasets have statistically the same distributions fig s6 based on a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test therefore in addition to our primary hypothesis that the hybrid model could slightly sacrifice accuracy but significantly reduce underestimations of influent cbod5 concentrations we also tested the hypothesis that the optimum option determined by the testing dataset should be similar to the option found in the training dataset 2 6 quality assurance and quality control qa qc all modeling and analyses were based on the historical data from the mwrdgc calumet wrp mwrdgc 2013 which has a rigorous qa qc program therefore there was no additional qa qc assessment in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 predictions based on individual ann and mlr 95 ucl the ann method has accurate predictions for low cbod5 concentrations but underestimates most of the high cbod5 concentrations fig 2 a applying the mlr at 95 ucl lead to better predictions for many high cbod5 concentrations fig 2 b more than 42 of the 2364 days of cbod5 concentrations are underestimated in the ann procedure but the mlr 95 ucl can reduce the percentage of the underestimated values to only about 3 5 when the evaluation is based on the 1058 days that have relatively higher cbod5 concentrations 73 8 mg o2 l the ann method does not overestimate the values for about 62 of the days whereas the mlr 95 ucl proves its ability to better manage risk by underestimating a smaller percentage 7 8 of the values for more information of their comparison in terms of concentration and residual refer to figs s7 s8 3 2 safety factor and prediction accuracy unsurprisingly the safety factor decreases and prediction accuracy increases as the threshold cbod5 value increases fig 3 characteristics of the hybrid model vary depending on the threshold cbod5 value when a higher threshold is applied the hybrid model begins to approach results from the ann model for example when 120 mg o2 l is selected as the threshold value there is no significant difference between the hybrid model and the ann model the safety factor in this hybrid model is about 1 which means a perfect balance between positive and negative residuals meanwhile the model provides relatively higher accuracy 68 8 l mg in other words it shows the advantages of a conventional soft sensor approach on residual balance and prediction accuracy in contrast lower threshold values cannot achieve high accuracy but they do provide a higher safety factor the model based on a threshold value of 70 mg o2 l is almost the same as the mlr 95 ucl model the accuracy is low 36 3 l mg but it results in a much higher safety factor 7 4 for each threshold value the model yields different values of the safety factor and the prediction accuracy because these two parameters have very different responses to changes in the threshold cbod5 value there is a trade off between the two objectives fig 3 in the range of threshold cbod5 values investigated the ideal point represents a combination of both the highest safety factor 7 4 and prediction accuracy 68 8 l mg and the anti ideal point represents a combination of the lowest safety factor 1 1 and prediction accuracy 36 3 l mg 3 3 decision making of the threshold value based on the cp analysis the shortest overall distance l was 87 5 mg o2 l which was consequently considered as the threshold cbod5 value fig 4 the relationship between l and the threshold value appears as a v shape each of the two sides reaches the same highest value 0 5 the v shape is not symmetrical and the best option at 87 5 mg o2 l has the smallest value of l 0 33 at this threshold value the model safety factor is 3 3 and the prediction accuracy is 47 1 l mg 3 4 confirmation based on the testing dataset although the testing dataset leads to different ranges for the safety factor and prediction accuracy relative to the training dataset the result yields a pattern similar to the training dataset fig 5 a it also results in the same best option 87 5 mg o2 l for the threshold value fig 5 b in general compared to the training dataset the testing dataset results in a lower prediction accuracy and a higher safety factor when the same threshold value is used as a result the testing dataset has different ideal 10 0 52 8 l mg and anti ideal 1 1 24 5 l mg points however the cp analysis suggests that a threshold value 87 5 mg o2 l is also the best alternative for the testing data in other words even for different datasets the same threshold value provides a good balance for the two objectives we conclude that one of our hypotheses is correct a similar decision the optimum option is very likely to be made based on independent datasets that have the same statistical distribution it is also worthwhile to note that we expected to obtain a similar option not the same option because our testing options are discrete it is possible that 87 5 mg o2 l is the closest option to the true threshold values which are not necessarily the same but must be very close to each other 3 5 overall evaluation the hybrid model provides a more flexible approach yielding good predictions for the lower concentrations and responding appropriately to higher cbod5 concentrations the ann and hybrid models lead to similar results in terms of linear correlations for training and testing datasets but the hybrid model has a larger error based on mre table 2 these two criteria show different patterns because they measure the prediction error from different perspectives a larger mre means the predicted values deviate more from the average values whereas this sacrifice of overall prediction accuracy offers better risk management with respect to high cbod5 concentrations specifically the days with cbod5 concentrations larger than the mean value 74 mg o2 l in the training and testing datasets are 904 and 147 respectively the ann model underestimates about 62 of these days whereas the hybrid model can reduce that value to about 37 when the evaluation is based on concentrations higher than 116 mg o2 l 90th percentile 113 mg o2 l more than 94 of the data are not managed very well using the ann method but the hybrid model yields a much lower underestimation percentage 38 a comparison between measured data and hybrid model results is also summarized in fig s9 training part and figs s10 s11 testing part two clear clusters show the predicted values based on ann or mlr 95 ucl the upper cluster of predictions based on mlr 95 ucl can also be divided into two subsets that represent sacrifice in energy savings or better risk management although several extremely high values are still underestimated fig s12 compared to the ann model the hybrid model has lower prediction residuals for example in the testing part the two highest cbod5 values are about 275 2 and 252 8 mg o2 l with the ann model the residuals are about 164 8 and 127 6 mg o2 l respectively whereas with the hybrid model the residuals are about 116 1 and 67 2 mg o2 l respectively a more detailed summary of underestimation can be seen in fig s13 to provide better risk management of the extremely high concentrations there are at least two ways the application might be improved the first way is to extend the approach to a more complicated multi hierarchy model where the model could have multiple threshold cbod5 values for each hierarchical group of data different upper confidence limits 90 99 could be used the second way which is more comprehensive and could be used in parallel with the approach used in this study involves simultaneous consideration of other influent compositions historical data suggest that more aeration should be used when certain influent scenarios occur for example on february 1st 2011 in addition to relatively high cbod5 concentration 112 9 mg o2 l there was also a very high influent ammonia concentration 21 1 mg n l vs average 10 8 mg n l and a low influent ss concentration 113 mg l vs average 138 mg l as a result the facility operated at an aeration rate 90 6 m3 s that was higher than the average 71 7 m3 s in contrast on march 10th 2005 although the influent cbod5 was high 109 5 mg o2 l the facility operated with lower aeration 56 6 m3 s at an average influent ammonia 11 9 mg n l and a high ss 305 mg l concentrations in other words if the cbod5 concentration is the only unusual high influent parameter the risk of lower effluent quality is smaller relative to the risk of lower effluent quality when influent cbod5 and ammonia are simultaneously high and the influent ss concentrations are low under such conditions it is better to provide more energy to avoid a permit violation this approach is feasible because compared to cbod5 ammonia and ss can be more readily predicted verma et al 2013 zhu and anderson 2016 it is also worthwhile to note that this proposed hybrid approach offers flexibility with respect to lower or upper confidence limits multiple confidence limits or replacement of ann with other more advanced algorithms as a result it is possible to adapt this approach to other constituents such as dissolved oxygen basant et al 2010 or total coliforms yazdi and scholz 2010 in an attempt to find the best way to manage extreme values 3 6 local applicability the hybrid approach described above includes an assumption of equal weights for both objectives however these weights could be adjusted by the dm taking into account the local conditions such as permit requirements energy costs process conditions weather conditions and control flexibility examples of how different weights of the safety factor from 0 to 1 influence the final decision are summarized in fig 6 because only two objectives were investigated in this study the weight of prediction accuracy is correspondingly changed from 1 to 0 in general although there is a slight bias toward weightsafety factor 0 and threshold cbod5 value 70 mgo2 l the distribution of l values is nearly symmetrical around the point where weightsafety factor 0 5 threshold cbod5 value 87 5 mgo2 l and l 0 33 when the weightsafety factor is relatively low the l decreases with increasing threshold cbod5 value and the lowest l value occurs at a relatively high threshold cbod5 value in contrast at higher values of weightsafety factor the l increases with increasing threshold cbod5 value and the shortest l occurs at a relatively low threshold cbod5 value when the weightsafety factor is between these two extreme values the change of l value similar to the information presented previously exhibits a v shape with different minimum l values at different values of weightsafety factor if the local dm believes that the safety factor is more important it is clear that a small threshold cbod5 value should be used as a result in addition to high cbod5 concentrations many median to high concentrations are also included in the overestimation this approach may be more appropriate in cases where the local energy cost is relatively low or the effluent permit limit is relatively strict in contrast a low safety factor weight seems more suitable if the occurrence probability of days with high influent cbod5 concentration especially extreme high concentration is low based on the local historical data 4 conclusions because our previous conventional soft sensor approach did not provide acceptable predictions for relatively high cbod5 concentrations we developed a hierarchical hybrid ismlr ann and mlr method to separately manage predictions of lower and higher influent cbod5 concentrations based on cp decision making results from this study can be summarized as follows when equal weights 0 5 were used for both safety factor and prediction accuracy the optimum option for the threshold cbod5 value was 87 5 mg o2 l based on the training dataset compared to the training dataset the testing dataset has relatively lower values of prediction accuracy and a wider range for the safety factor however the two datasets both lead to the same optimum threshold cbod5 value supporting the decision process compared to an individual ann approach the hybrid approach can significantly reduce the underestimation percentage for example from about 90 to 30 for concentrations larger than 110 mg o2 l with respect to relatively high cbod5 concentration with only a relatively small increase in the prediction error the hybrid model is flexible it can be modified to use different confidence limits or include other advanced algorithm s for predicting different constituents as well as to adapt to local conditions such as permit requirements energy costs process conditions weather conditions and control flexibility by adjusting the weights of the safety factor or prediction accuracy the dm can obtain a more compatible and practical local model in future work we hope to use a wrp process model to evaluate differences between a conventional ann approach and our hybrid soft sensor approach for balancing the energy savings and risk management the evaluation will be based on simulation results which include aeration consumption costs and effluent quality zhu 2015 demonstrated that pid controls based on simple d o set points can improve the energy efficiency therefore as part of the future work we will also investigate integration among soft sensors process simulation and process controls acknowledgement this study is part of project funded by the national science foundation nsf award
