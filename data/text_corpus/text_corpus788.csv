3940,as an important part of lake ecosystems sediments play a key role in the carbon cycle in lakes due to the complex sources of organic matter in sediments the link between sequestration and transformation of humic substance is largely unknown therefore it is essential to understand the characteristics of humic substance in lake sediments in this study the relationship between the characteristics of humic substance and environmental conditions was found in sediment samples from six typical lakes of northeast china the structure of humic substance hs fulvic acid fa and humic acid ha tended to be simplified with decreasing lake depth pearson analysis indicated that characteristics of humic substances in deep lake sediments were dominantly determined by nutrient factors e g no3 n no2 n nh4 n and physicochemical factors e g ph water temperature dissolved oxygen while the changes of hs in shallow lake sediments were dominantly determined by physicochemical factors e g ph water temperature dissolved oxygen variation partitioning results also indicated that nutrient factors and physicochemical factors explained 64 and 24 2 of the variations of hs content in boreal deep lakes in comparison physicochemical factors explained most of the variation 35 6 of hs composition while nutrient factors only explained 3 4 of the variation in shallow lakes structural equation models further confirmed that complex components were transformed into simple components by nutrient and physicochemical factors with decreasing lake depth this study suggests that changes in environmental conditions with lake depth may result in changes in the quality of hs in lake sediments keywords humic substance lake sediment depth nutrient factor physicochemical factor 1 introduction carbon sequestration is the transformation of atmosphere co2 into long lived pools and storing it securely lal et al 2004 with the purported intensification of global warming the carbon sequestration in aquatic environment has been attracting increasing attentions kerri et al 2015 yang et al 2014 lakes play an important role in the global carbon cycle cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 which receive a large quantity of organic matters from catchment areas a large amount of refractory organic carbon is buried in lake sediments but in this anaerobic environment 50 of the carbon can still be mineralized by microorganisms jonsson and meili 2001 lake sediments were estimated to contain 820 pg of organic carbon cole et al 2007 which far exceeded that in ocean dean and gorham 1998 therefore exploring the mechanism and influence factors of carbon transformation in lake sediments is very important and has a long term significance for carbon cycle lake sediments are the sink of environmental material transport which collect watershed erosion atmospheric deposition and artificial release from various sources hu et al 2018 merhaby et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 humic substance hs is a major form of carbon in lake sediments hs is a type of complex organic macromolecule aggregate that gets reconstructed by various actions such as biological degradation abiotic degradation and polymerization according to the solubility of humic substance in acidic and basic aqueous solution it can be divided into fulvic acid fa humic acid ha and humin koivula and hanninen 2001 powell and fenton 1996 fa is a kind of hs that gets dissolved in acid solution and alkali solution the molecular weight of fa is usually lower than that of ha and is characterized by strong mobility ha is a brown to dark brown fraction of hs which is only soluble in dilute alkalis ha usually has high molecular weights high aromaticity and low dissociation ability it has strong stability and colloidal properties rebecca and garrison 2005 humin is difficult to dissolve in acid and alkali which has a relatively large molecular weight and a high degree of polymerization and often lacks ionizable functional groups gao et al 2019 simpson et al 2007 xie et al 2019 therefore humin is stable and is difficult to be converted and utilized the main roles of hs in the environment are 1 promoting microbial oxidation of organic acid salts and toxic organics 2 acting as an electron shuttle between microorganisms and contaminants such as reducing heavy metals and organic pollutants he et al 2015 smilek et al 2015 wu et al 2017 there are significant differences in the environmental conditions of lakes in different catchments the depth of lakes is an important factor affecting climate environmental conditions and biogeochemical cycles thus depth may affect the hs characteristics through changing environmental conditions in lake sediments a number of recent studies in northern canada shallow lakes water column indicated trends of increasing air temperature or atmospheric co2 content freeman et al 2004 spencer et al 2008 shallow lakes are extremely vulnerable to human activities and climate change sagrario et al 2020 in addition many environmental factors are reported to affect hs such as temperature ph light oxygen conditions redox potential benzhink and brune 1998 kappler and haderlein 2003 the relationship between environmental conditions and the composition and content of hs is still unclear in different lake sediments therefore investigating the effects of nutrient conditions and physicochemical factors on decomposition and transformation of hs is of great significance to understand the variation of the characteristics of hs in shallow and deep lake sediments lake dahuofang d 20 m lake songhua s 22 m lake jingpo j 40 m lake taoshan t 8 m lake hongqi h 4 m and lake lianhuan l 5 m in northeast china were selected to explore the properties of hs in sediments the main feature of lakes in northeast china is that shallow lakes are rich in nutrients organic matter and humus while deep lakes have better water quality and longer water retention time at present most of studies are concentrated on the fate and structure of dissolved organic matter which has high mobility and availability hansen et al 2016 majumdar et al 2017 however there are few reports on the composition and transformation of hs in lake sediments the aims of this study were to 1 investigate the variation of hs fa and ha contents in different lake sediments 2 explore the shift in hs composition from deep lakes to shallow lakes 3 identify key physicochemical factors affecting hs transformation in different lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling the sediment samples were collected using peterson columnar mud collectors from lake dahuofang d 20 m lake songhua s 22 m lake jingpo j 40 m lake taoshan t 8 m lake hongqi h 4 m and lake lianhuan l 5 m at 2011 the six lakes are located at different latitudes ranging from 41 88 n to 46 79 n five different sampling sites were selected from each lake after collection the sediment samples were carried to the laboratory in acid rinsed polyethylene bags in ice box jaiswal and pandey 2019 the details of the sampling sites are shown in table s1 2 2 physicochemical analyses the water temperature tem and dissolved oxygen do in situ for each sample were determined using a ysi 95 m model 95 25 ft a sensorex combination ph electrode 450c with a rex ph meter model phb 4 was used for all ph measurements conductivity was measured with the method described in rhoades et al 1982 titration with acidic potassium permanganate was used for the determination of codmn which is the equivalent amount of oxygen needed to decompose organic substances present in a sample when treated with acidic potassium permanganate the measurement of codmn was all based on the procedures from monitoring and analytical method of water and waste water cui et al 2016 state environment protection administration of china 2002 biochemical oxygen demand bod5 was analyzed according to the state environment administration of china 2002 total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and total phosphorus tp were measured using standard methods state environment administration of china 2002 qiu et al 2016 sediment organic carbon concentration per unit dry mass was estimated by loss on ignition downing et al 2008 the detail physicochemical characteristics of each sampling site were described in our previous study the physicochemical data were only used to analyze the relationship between physicochemical factors and hs components in the present study 2 3 hs extraction and separation air dried samples were extracted with a mixed solution of 0 1 mol l na2p2o7 naoh at a ratio of 1 10 w v shaking at 200 rpm at room temperature for 24 h the supernatant samples containing soluble hs were collected after centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min humins were eliminated as insoluble fraction and the soluble fraction was separated into fa and ha the procedure was repeated three times and all the extracts were mixed together zhou et al 2014 the ph of the extracted hs was adjusted to 7 0 with 0 5 m hcl the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore membrane to obtain hs the separation of ha and fa was as follows the ph of the extracted solution was adjusted to 1 5 with 3 m hcl then it was stored at 4 c for 12 h the extraction solution was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was fa and the precipitate was ha in addition ha needs to be washed alternately with 0 1 m hcl and deionized water several times and the precipitate was dissolved with 0 05 m nahco3 finally the concentrations of hs fa and ha were measured in triplicate by shimadzu toc v cph analyzer 2 4 fluorescence spectroscopy analysis fluorescence excitation emission matrix eems combined with parallel factor analysis parafac was used to investigate the changes of hs components in sediments at different lakes stedmon and bro 2008 the eems were measured using a hitachi f 7000fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi high technologies japan with a clear quartz cuvette at room temperature 20 2 c wei et al 2007 prior to scanning the doc concentration was uniformly diluted to 10 mg l in order to eliminate the effect of concentration on fluorescence intensity and inner filter effects yu et al 2010 the separated liquid samples were irradiated with excitation wavelengths from 220 to 490 nm at 10 nm intervals emission wavelengths were recorded from 250 to 550 nm at 2 nm intervals and the scan speed was adjusted to 1200 nm min 1 zhao et al 2017a milli q water was subtracted from the eems of all samples in order to eliminate raman scattering and rayleigh scattering pan et al 2018 3 methodology as an important component of organic carbon in lake sediments hs has an important impact on the lake environment due to the large forests and rich black soil in northeastern china the main characteristic of the lakes in this region is that the sediments are rich in organic matter and hs due to the special geographical location and climatic characteristics lakes in the northeast are richer in water replenishment and have longer freezing periods which are conducive to the formation of hs in sediments the extraction of hs from the sediments of different lakes and the determination of the content of different fractions organic matter hs fa and ha in the sediments were used to reveal the changing patterns of hs in different lakes in this study fluorescence spectroscopy technique and parallel factor analysis model were used to study the spatial variation pattern of hs in sediments of typical lakes in northeast china to compare the differences in hs composition between the deep lakes j s and d and shallow lakes t l and h lakes all samples were divided into two groups for analysis in the subsequent analysis nutrient factors included tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tp physicochemical factors included tem do cod bod5 ph and conductivity and fluorescence variables included fa c1 fa c2 fa c3 ha c1 ha c2 and ha c3 parallel factor analysis parafac was used for the decomposition analysis of eem fluorescence spectra it is based on the principle of alternating least squares iterations which can analyze and decompose matrices composed of multiple eem data sets the parafac equation is as follows x ijk f f c if b jf a kf σ ijk i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k f represents the number of fluorescent groups in the model and f 1 xijk represents the fluorescence intensity of the kth sample eem matrix at excitation wavelength i and emission wavelength j in the whole eem data set cif is the element i n in the eem spectral matrix a that is proportional to the absorption coefficient at excitation wavelength i bjf is the element at excitation wavelength j j n in the eem spectral matrix associated with the fluorescence quantum yield of the nth sample analyzed akf is the relative concentration of element k n in the eem matrix which is proportional to the concentration of the nth component of the kth sample σijk is the error term in the model which represents the value that cannot be revealed by the model parafac can maximize the characterization of all fluorescence information and decompose the overlapping parts eem parafac was analyzed by the hs fluor toolbox www models life ku dk in matlab r2013a math works natick ma guo et al 2018 wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 fa and ha samples from deep and shallow lakes were separated for parafac analysis due to fluctuations in the random data excitation wavelengths from 200 to 220 nm were removed from each eem to build the parafac model to eliminate the internal filter effect the absorbance of the eem is corrected by multiplying each value in the eem with a correction factor the correction factor is half the length of the cuvette based on the average path length of the premise excitation and absorption the correction is mathematically expressed as fife fcorr 10 aex aem 2 fife represents the corrected fluorescence intensity and fcorr represents the uncorrected fluorescence intensity aex represents the absorbance value at the current excitation wavelength and aem represents the absorbance value at the current emission wavelength cui et al 2016 the difference of hs concentrations was compared using the least significant difference lsd all pairwise comparisons test in spss 22 0 statistics ibm corp usa shi et al 2018 relationships between environmental factors and hs fluorescent components were evaluated using pearson s correlation analysis correlation analysis was performed by the software origin2021 ρ x y c o v x y σ x σ y e x μ x y μ y σ x σ y the value of pearson s correlation coefficient is expressed by the above formula with cov being the covariance of the two variables and the denominator being the product of the standard deviations of the two variables μ x and μ y represent the mean of data x and y respectively and e represents the expected value the pearson correlation coefficient is a linear correlation coefficient that usually reflects the degree of linear correlation between two variables variation partitioning analysis vpa were utilized to investigate the influencing factors of hs in lakes vpa model is commonly used to determine the common and unique contributions of influencing factors to component variation wu et al 2018 the canonical correspondence analysis cca redundancy analysis rda ranking analysis method was used to obtain the proportion of component changes explained by all the influencing factors involved in the analysis when vpa analysis was performed a classification of these impact factors was made and then a ranking analysis of a certain class of impact factors was performed while constraining other impact factors after analyzing each type of influence factor the contribution of each influence factor individually and the interaction of different influence factors to the change of component content can be calculated the factors that have an effect on hs were divided into physicochemical e g ph temperature dissolved oxygen and nutrient factors e g no3 n no2 n nh4 n for analysis variation partitioning analysis was performed by canoco 5 0 to explore the contribution of different environmental factors on hs transformation structural equation models sems were utilized to investigate the influencing factors and transformation processes of hs in lakes sem is an a priori approach allowing for an intuitive graphical representation of complex networks of relationships eisenhauer et al 2015 hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 sem can analyze the direct or indirect effects among the factor indicators by assuming the overall quality of the constructs and the particular parameters that make up the model sem allows one variable to correspond to multiple dependent variables thus estimating precisely the logical relationship of each variable structural equation models were constructed to evaluate the direct or indirect effects of environmental factors on the transformation of hs at different lakes the theoretical model assumptions were as follows 1 changes in hs composition driven by nutrient factors and physicochemical factors in deep lakes 2 physicochemical factors are the main drivers of hs composition in shallow lakes high goodness of fit gfi index 0 90 low akaike information criteria aic non significant chi square test p 0 05 and low root mean square errors of approximation rmsea 0 05 was used to indicate the overall goodness of fit for sems hu et al 2017 sems were performed using amos 20 0 software ibm corporation software group somers ny with a maximum likelihood estimation method 4 results and discussion 4 1 changes in hs sequestration in sediments from different lakes the contents of organic carbon oc hs fa and ha in sediments at different lakes are shown in fig 1 the contents of oc hs fa and ha in the sediments of the six lakes ranged from 14 20 g kg to 48 90 g kg from 8 98 g kg to 18 57 g kg from 3 55 g kg to 6 13 g kg and from 5 44 g kg to 12 86 g kg respectively the trend of hs content in sediments and the changing trend of oc content were very similar with the increasing depth of lakes hs are formed during the degradation of microbial and plant precursors which makes up a significant fraction of natural organic matter in the sediments the trend of fa change in sediments of different lakes was not significant this result may be due to the fact that the decomposition and synthesis of fa reached a dynamic equilibrium so the content of fa in the sediments was relatively stable fa usually has lower molecular weights and contains less carbon and more oxygen meanwhile there are more simple functional groups in fa e g cooh oh hansen et al 1990 therefore compared to ha fa was easily produced and utilized metabolically the changing trend of ha content in sediments was consistent with the trend of hs content this result indicated that ha was the main form of hs sequestration because ha had a relatively stable structure and was not easily converted and utilized in addition human activities also have an important impact on the input of terrestrial organic matter into lakes thereby affecting the composition of oc in sediments thus the variation of hs content may be influenced by several factors 4 2 flourescence characteristics of hs in sediments eem parafac was used to obtain more details on the fluorescence characteristics of hs in lake sediments at different depths based on split half analysis fig s1 s4 he et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 yuan et al 2017 in order to compare the differences between the deep lakes and shallow lakes fluorescent components all samples were analyzed by dividing into two groups the results of the split half analysis just proved a significant difference in the fluorescence components in shallow and deep lakes fig s1 s4 the fluorescence characteristics of fa and ha in the sediments of different lakes are shown in fig 2 three fluorescence components c1 c2 and c3 were identified by parafac in deep lakes the component 1 fa c1 of fa had a primary and secondary fluorescence peak at an excitation emission wavelength pair of 320 240 434 nm which was characterized as representing terrestrial fulvic acid like substances component 1 may be associated with anthropogenic activities and agriculture osburn et al 2012 the component 2 of fa fa c2 was composed of two excitation maxima at 380 nm and 350 nm both with emission maxima at 454 nm this component was also similar to the traditional terrestrial fulvic like peak which may be associated with soil fulvic acid zhang et al 2009 the fluorescence peaks of component 3 of fa fa c3 centered at 400 nm for excitation wavelength and 512 nm for emission wavelength fa c3 was categorized as the combination of previously defined terrestrial and ubiquitous fulvic like fluorophores chen and jin 2015 by contrast the fluorescence peaks of fa c1 fa c2 and fa c3 in shallow lakes showed a significant blue shift than those in deep lakes suggesting that the structure of fa tended to be simple from deep lakes to shallow lakes in deep lakes the component 1 of ha ha c1 had a primary fluorescence peak at an excitation emission wavelength of 330 nm 482 nm which resembled a combination of previously defined terrestrial humic acid peak zhang et al 2009 the peaks of c2 of ha ha c2 centered at 440 nm for excitation wavelength and 492 nm for emission wavelength ha c2 was categorized as the combination of previously defined terrestrial anthropogenic and agricultural humic like fluorophores he et al 2016 c3 of ha ha c3 was composed of single excitation maxima at 470 nm with emission maxima at 530 nm this component was similar to the traditional terrestrial and autochthonous humic like peak wang et al 2015 in shallow lakes the peaks of all the components of ha showed a significant blue shift which were similar to the trends of fa this result indicated that the structure of ha also tended to be simple with the decrease in the depth of the lake the study of the relative contents of the different lake components in fig 3 contributes to understanding the mechanisms of hs sequestration and transformation the relative concentration of fa c1 increased from 47 to 48 and the relative concentration of fa c2 increased from 30 to 34 with the decrease in the depth of the lake while the relative concentration of fa c3 decreased from 23 to 18 from deep to shallow lakes these results demonstrated that fa c3 was more distributed while fa c1 and fa c2 were less distributed in deep lake sediments the above results indicated that c3 was gradually degraded and transformed to c1 and c2 from deep to shallow lakes so in the deep lake sediments c3 was the main form of fa while c1 and c2 were the main forms of fa in the shallow lake sediments comparing the relative distribution of the components of fa it may be found that only the relative content of ha c1 increased from 14 to 23 from deep to shallow lakes the relative content of ha c2 decreased from 32 to 27 and the relative content of ha c3 decreased from 54 to 50 with the decrease in the depth of the lake these results suggested that ha c2 and ha c3 were degraded and converted into ha c1 so in the deep lake sediments c2 and c3 were the main forms of ha sequestration while c1 was the main form of ha sequestration in shallow lake sediments from deep lakes to shallow lakes both fa and ha exhibited a phenomenon in which complex components were converted into relatively labile components this conversion led to the accumulation of labile components labile components were easily decomposed and metabolized by biological processes and photochemical processes thus the transformation of hs in sediments has stronger effects on co2 emission and greenhouse effect in lake sediments compared with deep water lakes the material exchange between water and sediments in shallow lakes was more frequent and the deposition process of hs was relatively slower based on the above results it is important to further identify the factors influencing the forms of carbon sequestration in different lake sediments 4 3 factors affecting the variation of hs in the sediments of different lakes pearson analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting hs fractions in different lake sediments in fig 4 in deep lake sediments a significant effect of tp on fa c1 was observed meanwhile in deep lake sediments nh4 n had a significant effect on fa c2 fa c3 ha c1 and ha c2 no2 n had a significant effect on ha had a significant effect and no3 n had a significant effect on fa c2 was observed in summary nutrient factors such as nitrogen and phosphorus had significant effects on fa and ha components in comparison these effects were absent in shallow lake sediments do was significantly associated with fa c2 and fa c3 in deep lake sediments however in shallow lake sediments do was significantly correlated with ha c1 these results indicating that the ha high molecular components ha c2 ha c3 may be decomposed and converted into low molecular components ha c1 by microorganisms e g humus reducing bacteria zhao et al 2017b 2019 the concentration of do was lower in deep lakes than that in shallow lakes this was consistent with the changes of hs components from deep to shallow lakes as shown in fig 4 ph and temperature are important environmental factors that significantly affect the variation of fa and ha components in sediments nevertheless the trend of ha correlation with temperature and ph in shallow lake sediments was completely opposite compared to that in deep lakes this result suggested that hs components may be more sensitive to temperature and ph in shallow lake sediments it is noteworthy that the temperature showed a significant positive trend with the simpler structure of fa c1 and ha c1 the high molecular components of fa and ha were converted to low molecular components by the influence of temperature this was also consistent with the fact that the relative content of the high molecular components described above gradually decreased and the relative content of the low molecule components gradually increased with the decrease in the depth of the lake in addition nitrogen and phosphorus in deep lakes were rich in nutrients so the growth of plants and microorganisms led to more plants and microbial residues which was also an important source of fa and ha in deep lake sediments this was consistent with the above results that the fa and ha contents gradually decrease with the decrease in the depth of the lake in deep lake sediments nutrient factors and physicochemical factors worked together on the composition and source of hs however hs components in shallow lake sediments were dominantly affected by physicochemical factors such as ph and temperature furthermore variance partitioning was performed to identify the contribution of the influence factors to hs composition in lake sediments at different lakes in fig 5 zhou et al 2018 variance partitioning results suggested nutrient factors explained most of the variance 64 on the composition of hs while physicochemical factors only explained 24 2 of the variance in deep lake sediments in addition nutrient factors together with physicochemical factors explained 2 of the variance on the composition of hs in shallow lake sediments physicochemical factors explained most of the variance 35 6 on the composition of hs while nutrient factors only explained 3 4 of the variance in shallow lake sediments it can be seen that the composition of hs in deep lake sediments was dominantly caused by nutrient factors and physicochemical factors in shallow lake sediments the composition of hs was dominantly caused by physicochemical factors and less influenced by the nutrient factors these results were consistent with the pearson analysis 4 4 possible sequestration and transformation mechanisms of hs in lake sediments in different lakes based on the results of pearson analysis nutrient factors and physicochemical factors significantly associated with the fa components and the ha components were selected for sem analysis in fig 6 from this figure no3 n and do were found to have significantly positive influences on fa c2 in deep lake sediments do and temperature were significantly related to the accumulation of fa c3 which had a direct influence on fa c1 fa c1 was primarily regulated by c3 and indirectly influenced by do and temperature suggesting that there may be transformation between fa c1 and fa c3 this is consistent with the decrease of the relative content of fa c3 and the increase of the relative content of fa c1 the composition and accumulation of fa in deep lake sediments were dominantly affected by physicochemical factors and nutrient factors the temperature was found to have a significant negative correlation with fa c2 in shallow lake sediments because the shallow lakes were more sensitive to temperature it was not conducive to the accumulation of fa c2 with global warming the ph had significantly negative impact on fa c1 and fa c3 fa c3 had a significant positive impact on fa c2 while fa c3 had a negative correlation with fa c1 this result indicated that the decomposition of fa c3 was conducive to the accumulation of fa c2 in addition this result indicated that c3 was converted to c2 instead of to c1 comparing to deep lake sediments the accumulation and transformation of fa in shallow lake sediments were dominantly affected by physicochemical factors e g ph temperature temperature and no2 n were found to have significantly positive impact on ha c2 in deep lake sediments there was a significant positive correlation between nh4 n and ha c1 the ph was significantly related to the accumulation of ha c3 which had a direct influence on ha c1 and ha c2 in addition it was found that ha c3 will be converted to ha c2 and ha c1 in deep lake sediments this was consistent with the decrease of the relative content of ha c3 and the increase of the relative content of ha c1 and ha c2 do and ph were negatively correlated with of ha c3 which had a direct influence on ha c1 significantly positive effect of ha c2 on ha c1 was also observed in shallow lake sediments ha components were dominantly regulated by physicochemical factors e g do ph at the same time both ha c3 and ha c2 were transformed to ha c1 comparing the results of sems at different lakes fa and ha were dominantly influenced by nutrient factors and physicochemical factors in deep lake sediments and fa and ha were dominantly influenced by physicochemical factors in shallow lake sediments in addition it was found the phenomenon that the complex components were converted to simple components occurred at different lakes the environmental factors of the lake are highly variable at different depths the content and structural composition of hs in sediments are influenced by environmental factors compared with deep water lakes the material exchange between water and sediments in shallow lakes was more frequent and biotic and abiotic transformation processes were more intense this is consistent with the result that the hs structure in the sediments of shallow lakes is simpler compared to deep lakes physicochemical and nutrient factors are key drivers of these biotic and abiotic activities therefore the differences in the characteristics of hs in lakes of different depths are significant meanwhile the fluorescence peak positions of both fa and ha showed a significant blue shift fig 2 and the relative contents of both fa and ha fluorescence components showed a decrease in the content of complex components and an increase in the content of simple components from deep to shallow lakes fig 3 these results are consistent with the conversion of complex components into simple components according to the above results the form of hs fixation in deep lake sediments is dominated by complex components and the form of hs fixation in shallow lakes is dominated by components with simpler structures from deep to shallow lakes the degree of humification of lake sediments gradually decreased the hs sequestered forms in the sediment tended to be simplified from deep to shallow lakes 5 conclusion this study revealed the sequestration characteristics of hs in different lake sediments the structure of hs fa and ha in sediments tended to be simplified with the increasing depth of lakes pearson analysis and variance partitioning results indicated that hs was dominantly influenced by nutrient factors and physicochemical factors in deep lake sediments while hs was dominantly influenced by physicochemical factors in shallow lake sediments furthermore structural equation models confirmed that complex components were transformed into simple components with the increasing depth of lakes in conclusion this study fills in a gap in hs transformation and sequestration in lake sediments in shallow and deep lakes and it is important to

functional groups gao et al 2019 simpson et al 2007 xie et al 2019 therefore humin is stable and is difficult to be converted and utilized the main roles of hs in the environment are 1 promoting microbial oxidation of organic acid salts and toxic organics 2 acting as an electron shuttle between microorganisms and contaminants such as reducing heavy metals and organic pollutants he et al 2015 smilek et al 2015 wu et al 2017 there are significant differences in the environmental conditions of lakes in different catchments the depth of lakes is an important factor affecting climate

sediments lake dahuofang d 20 m lake songhua s 22 m lake jingpo j 40 m lake taoshan t 8 m lake hongqi h 4 m and lake lianhuan l 5 m in northeast china were selected to explore the properties of hs in sediments the main feature of lakes in northeast china is that shallow lakes are rich in nutrients organic matter and humus while deep lakes have better water quality and longer water retention time at present most of studies are concentrated on the fate and structure of dissolved organic matter which has high mobility and availability hansen et al 2016 majumdar et al 2017 however there are few reports on the composition and transformation of hs in lake sediments the aims of this study were to 1 investigate the variation of hs fa and ha contents in different lake sediments 2 explore the shift in hs composition from deep lakes to shallow lakes 3 identify key physicochemical factors affecting hs transformation in different lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling the sediment samples were collected using peterson columnar mud collectors from lake dahuofang d 20 m lake songhua s 22 m lake jingpo j 40 m lake taoshan t 8 m lake hongqi h 4 m and lake lianhuan l 5 m at 2011 the six lakes are located at different latitudes ranging from 41 88 n to 46 79 n five different sampling sites were selected from each lake after collection the sediment samples were carried to the laboratory in acid rinsed polyethylene bags in ice box jaiswal and pandey 2019 the details of the sampling sites are shown in table s1 2 2 physicochemical analyses the water temperature tem and dissolved oxygen do in situ for each sample were determined using a ysi 95 m model 95 25 ft a sensorex combination ph electrode 450c with a rex ph meter model phb 4 was used for all ph measurements conductivity was measured with the method described in rhoades et al 1982 titration with acidic potassium permanganate was used for the determination of codmn which is the equivalent amount of oxygen needed to decompose organic substances present in a sample when treated with acidic potassium permanganate the measurement of codmn was all based on the procedures from monitoring and analytical method of water and waste water cui et al 2016 state environment protection administration of china 2002 biochemical oxygen demand bod5 was analyzed according to the state environment administration of china 2002 total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and total phosphorus tp were measured using standard methods state environment administration of china 2002 qiu et al 2016 sediment organic carbon concentration per unit dry mass was estimated by loss on ignition downing et al 2008 the detail physicochemical characteristics of each sampling site were described in our previous study the physicochemical data were only used to analyze the relationship between physicochemical factors and hs components in the present study 2 3 hs extraction and separation air dried samples were extracted with a mixed solution of 0 1 mol l na2p2o7 naoh at a ratio of 1 10 w v shaking at 200 rpm at room temperature for 24 h the supernatant samples containing soluble hs were collected after centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 15 min humins were eliminated as insoluble fraction and the soluble fraction was separated into fa and ha the procedure was repeated three times and all the extracts were mixed together zhou et al 2014 the ph of the extracted hs was adjusted to 7 0 with 0 5 m hcl the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore membrane to obtain hs the separation of ha and fa was as follows the ph of the extracted solution was adjusted to 1 5 with 3 m hcl then it was stored at 4 c for 12 h the extraction solution was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant was fa and the precipitate was ha in addition ha needs to be washed alternately with 0 1 m hcl and deionized water several times and the precipitate was dissolved with 0 05 m nahco3 finally the concentrations of hs fa and ha were measured in triplicate by shimadzu toc v cph analyzer 2 4 fluorescence spectroscopy analysis fluorescence excitation emission matrix eems combined with parallel factor analysis parafac was used to investigate the changes of hs components in sediments at different lakes stedmon and bro 2008 the eems were measured using a hitachi f 7000fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi high technologies japan with a clear quartz cuvette at room temperature 20 2 c wei et al 2007 prior to scanning the doc concentration was uniformly diluted to 10 mg l in order to eliminate the effect of concentration on fluorescence intensity and inner filter effects yu et al 2010 the separated liquid samples were irradiated with excitation wavelengths from 220 to 490 nm at 10 nm intervals emission wavelengths were recorded from 250 to 550 nm at 2 nm intervals and the scan speed was adjusted to 1200 nm min 1 zhao et al 2017a milli q water was subtracted from the eems of all samples in order to eliminate raman scattering and rayleigh scattering pan et al 2018 3 methodology as an important component of organic carbon in lake sediments hs has an important impact on the lake environment due to the large forests and rich black soil in northeastern china the main characteristic of the lakes in this region is that the sediments are rich in organic matter and hs due to the special geographical location and climatic characteristics lakes in the northeast are richer in water replenishment and have longer freezing periods which are conducive to the formation of hs in sediments the extraction of hs from the sediments of different lakes and the determination of the content of different fractions organic matter hs fa and ha in the sediments were used to reveal the changing patterns of hs in different lakes in this study fluorescence spectroscopy technique and parallel factor analysis model were used to study the spatial variation pattern of hs in sediments of typical lakes in northeast china to compare the differences in hs composition between the deep lakes j s and d and shallow lakes t l and h lakes all samples were divided into two groups for analysis in the subsequent analysis nutrient factors included tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and tp physicochemical factors included tem do cod bod5 ph and conductivity and fluorescence variables included fa c1 fa c2 fa c3 ha c1 ha c2 and ha c3 parallel factor analysis parafac was used for the decomposition analysis of eem fluorescence spectra it is based on the principle of alternating least squares iterations which can analyze and decompose matrices composed of multiple eem data sets the parafac equation is as follows x ijk f f c if b jf a kf σ ijk i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k f represents the number of fluorescent groups in the model and f 1 xijk represents the fluorescence intensity of the kth sample eem matrix at excitation wavelength i and emission wavelength

wavelength j j n in the eem spectral matrix associated with the fluorescence quantum yield of the nth sample analyzed akf is the relative concentration of element k n in the eem matrix which is proportional to the concentration of the nth component of the kth sample σijk is the error term in the model which represents the value that cannot be revealed by the model parafac can maximize the characterization of all fluorescence information and decompose the overlapping parts eem parafac was analyzed by the hs fluor toolbox www models life ku dk in matlab r2013a math works natick ma guo et al 2018 wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 fa and ha samples from deep and shallow lakes were separated for parafac analysis due to fluctuations in the random data excitation wavelengths from 200 to 220 nm were removed from each eem to build the parafac model to eliminate the internal filter effect the absorbance of the eem is corrected by multiplying each value in the eem with a correction factor the correction factor is half the length of the cuvette based on the average path length of the premise excitation and absorption the correction is mathematically expressed as fife fcorr 10 aex aem 2 fife represents the corrected fluorescence intensity and fcorr represents the uncorrected fluorescence intensity aex represents the absorbance value at the current excitation wavelength and aem represents the absorbance value at the current emission wavelength cui et al 2016 the difference of hs concentrations was compared using the least significant difference lsd all pairwise comparisons test in spss 22 0 statistics ibm corp usa shi et al 2018 relationships between environmental factors and hs fluorescent components were evaluated using pearson s correlation analysis correlation analysis was performed by the software origin2021 ρ x y c o v x y σ x σ y e x μ x y μ y σ x σ y the value of pearson s correlation coefficient is expressed by the above formula with cov being the covariance of the two variables and the denominator being the product of the standard deviations of the two variables μ x and μ y represent the mean of data x and y respectively and e represents the expected value the pearson correlation coefficient is a linear correlation coefficient that usually reflects the degree of linear correlation between two variables variation partitioning analysis vpa were utilized to investigate the influencing factors of hs in lakes vpa model is commonly used to determine the common and unique contributions of influencing factors to component variation wu et al 2018 the canonical correspondence analysis cca redundancy analysis rda ranking analysis method was used to obtain the proportion of component changes explained by all the influencing factors involved in the analysis when vpa analysis was performed a classification of these impact factors was made and then a ranking analysis of a certain class of impact factors was performed while constraining other impact factors after analyzing each type of influence factor the contribution of each influence factor individually and the interaction of different influence factors to the change of component content can be calculated the factors that have an effect on hs were divided into physicochemical e g ph temperature dissolved oxygen and nutrient factors e g no3 n no2 n nh4 n for analysis variation partitioning analysis was performed by canoco 5 0 to explore the contribution of different environmental factors on hs transformation structural equation models sems were utilized to investigate the influencing factors and transformation processes of hs in lakes sem is an a priori approach allowing for an intuitive graphical representation of complex networks of relationships eisenhauer et al 2015 hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 sem can analyze the direct or indirect effects among the factor indicators by assuming the overall quality of the constructs and the particular parameters that make up the model sem allows one variable to correspond to multiple dependent variables thus estimating precisely the logical relationship of each variable structural equation models were constructed to evaluate the direct or indirect effects of environmental factors on the transformation of hs at different lakes the theoretical model assumptions were as follows 1 changes in hs composition driven by nutrient factors and physicochemical factors in deep lakes 2 physicochemical factors are the main drivers of hs composition in shallow lakes high goodness of fit gfi index 0 90 low akaike information criteria aic non significant chi square test p 0 05 and low root mean square errors of approximation rmsea 0 05 was used to indicate the overall goodness of fit for sems hu et al 2017 sems were performed using amos 20 0 software ibm corporation software group somers ny with a maximum likelihood estimation method 4 results and discussion 4 1 changes in hs sequestration in sediments from different lakes the contents of organic carbon oc hs fa and ha in sediments at different lakes are shown in fig 1 the contents of oc hs fa and ha in the sediments of the six lakes ranged from 14 20 g kg to 48 90 g kg from 8 98 g kg to 18 57 g kg from 3 55 g kg to 6 13 g kg and from 5 44 g kg to 12 86 g kg respectively the trend of hs content in sediments and the changing trend of oc content were very similar with the increasing depth of lakes hs are formed during the degradation of microbial and plant precursors which makes up a significant fraction of natural organic matter in the sediments the trend of fa change in sediments of different lakes was not significant this result may be due to the fact that the decomposition and synthesis of fa reached a dynamic equilibrium so the content of fa in the sediments was relatively stable fa usually has lower molecular weights and contains less carbon and more oxygen meanwhile there are more simple functional groups in fa e g cooh oh hansen et al 1990 therefore compared to ha fa was easily produced and utilized metabolically the changing trend of ha content in sediments was consistent with the trend of hs content this result indicated that ha was the main form of hs sequestration because ha had a relatively stable structure and was not easily converted and utilized in addition human activities also have an important impact on the input of terrestrial organic matter into lakes thereby affecting the composition of oc in sediments thus the variation of hs content may be influenced by several factors 4 2 flourescence characteristics of hs in sediments eem parafac was used to obtain more details on the fluorescence characteristics of hs in lake sediments at different depths based on split half analysis fig s1 s4 he et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 yuan et al 2017 in order to compare the differences between the deep lakes and shallow lakes fluorescent components all samples were analyzed by dividing into two groups the results of the split half analysis just proved a significant difference in the fluorescence components in shallow and deep lakes fig s1 s4 the fluorescence characteristics of fa and ha in the sediments of different lakes are shown in fig 2 three fluorescence components c1 c2 and c3 were identified by parafac in deep lakes the component 1 fa c1 of fa had a primary and secondary fluorescence peak at an excitation emission wavelength pair of 320 240 434 nm which was characterized as representing terrestrial fulvic acid like substances component 1 may be associated with anthropogenic activities and agriculture osburn et al 2012 the component 2 of fa fa c2 was composed of two excitation maxima at 380 nm and 350 nm both with emission maxima at 454 nm this component was also similar to the traditional terrestrial fulvic like peak which may be associated with soil fulvic acid zhang et al 2009 the fluorescence peaks of component 3 of fa fa c3 centered at 400 nm for excitation wavelength and 512 nm for emission wavelength fa c3 was categorized as the combination of previously defined terrestrial and ubiquitous fulvic like fluorophores chen and jin 2015 by contrast the fluorescence peaks of fa c1 fa c2 and fa c3 in shallow lakes showed a significant blue shift than those in deep lakes suggesting that the structure of fa tended to be simple from deep lakes to shallow lakes in deep lakes the component 1 of ha ha c1 had a primary fluorescence peak at an excitation emission wavelength of 330 nm 482 nm which resembled a combination of previously defined terrestrial humic acid peak zhang et al 2009 the peaks of c2 of ha ha c2 centered at 440 nm for excitation wavelength and 492 nm for emission wavelength ha c2 was categorized as the combination of previously defined terrestrial anthropogenic and agricultural humic like fluorophores he et al 2016 c3 of ha ha c3 was composed of single excitation maxima at 470 nm with emission maxima at 530 nm this component was similar to the traditional terrestrial and autochthonous humic like peak wang et al 2015 in shallow lakes the peaks of all the components of ha showed a significant blue shift which were similar to the trends of fa this result indicated that the structure of ha also tended to be simple with the decrease in the depth of the lake the study of the relative contents of the different lake components in fig 3 contributes to understanding the mechanisms of hs sequestration and transformation the relative concentration of fa c1 increased from 47 to 48 and the relative concentration of fa c2 increased from 30 to 34 with the decrease in the depth of the lake while the relative concentration of fa c3 decreased from 23 to 18 from deep to shallow lakes these results demonstrated that fa c3 was more distributed while fa c1 and fa c2 were less distributed in deep lake sediments the above results indicated that c3 was gradually degraded and transformed to c1 and c2 from deep to shallow lakes so in the deep lake sediments c3 was the main form of fa while c1 and c2 were the main forms of fa in the shallow lake sediments comparing the relative distribution of the components of fa it may be found that only the relative content of ha c1 increased from 14 to 23 from deep to shallow lakes the relative content of ha c2 decreased from 32 to 27 and the relative content of ha c3 decreased from 54 to 50 with the decrease in the depth of the lake these results suggested that ha c2 and ha c3 were degraded and converted into ha c1 so in the deep lake sediments c2 and c3 were the main forms of ha sequestration while c1 was the main form of ha sequestration in shallow lake sediments from deep lakes to shallow lakes both fa and ha exhibited a phenomenon in which complex components were converted into relatively labile components this conversion led to the accumulation of labile components labile components were easily decomposed and metabolized by biological processes and photochemical processes thus the transformation of hs in sediments has stronger effects on co2 emission and greenhouse effect in lake sediments compared with deep water lakes the material exchange between water and sediments in shallow lakes was more frequent and the deposition process of hs was relatively slower based on the above results it is important to further identify the factors influencing the forms of carbon sequestration in different lake sediments 4 3 factors affecting the variation of hs in the sediments of different lakes pearson analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting hs fractions in different lake sediments in fig 4 in deep lake sediments a significant effect of tp on fa c1 was observed meanwhile in deep lake sediments nh4 n had a significant effect on fa c2 fa c3 ha c1 and ha c2 no2 n had a significant effect on ha had a significant effect and no3 n had a significant effect on fa c2 was observed in summary nutrient factors such as nitrogen and phosphorus had significant effects on fa and ha components in comparison these effects were absent in shallow lake sediments do was significantly associated with fa c2 and fa c3 in deep lake sediments however in shallow lake sediments do was significantly correlated with ha c1 these results indicating that the ha high molecular components ha c2 ha c3 may be decomposed and converted into low molecular components ha c1 by microorganisms e g humus reducing bacteria zhao et al 2017b 2019 the concentration of do was lower in deep lakes than that in shallow lakes this was consistent with the changes of hs components from deep to shallow lakes as shown in fig 4 ph and temperature are important environmental factors that significantly affect the variation of fa and ha components in sediments nevertheless the trend of ha correlation with temperature and ph in shallow lake sediments was completely opposite compared to that in deep lakes this result suggested that hs components may be more sensitive to temperature and ph in shallow lake sediments it is noteworthy that the temperature showed a significant positive trend with the simpler structure of fa c1 and ha c1 the high molecular components of fa and ha were converted to low molecular components by the influence of temperature this was also consistent with the fact that the relative content of the high molecular components described above gradually decreased and the relative content of the low molecule components gradually increased with the decrease in the depth of the lake in addition nitrogen and phosphorus in deep lakes were rich in nutrients so the growth of plants and microorganisms led to more plants and microbial residues which was also an important source of fa and ha in deep lake sediments this was consistent with the above results that the fa and ha contents gradually decrease with the decrease in the depth of the lake in deep lake sediments nutrient factors and physicochemical factors worked together on the composition and source of hs however hs components in shallow lake sediments were dominantly affected by physicochemical factors such as ph and temperature furthermore variance partitioning was performed to identify the contribution of the influence factors to hs composition in lake sediments at different lakes in fig 5 zhou et al 2018 variance partitioning results suggested nutrient factors explained most of the variance 64 on the composition of hs while physicochemical factors only explained 24 2 of the variance in deep lake sediments in addition nutrient factors together with physicochemical factors explained 2 of the variance on the composition of hs in shallow lake sediments physicochemical factors explained most of the variance 35 6 on the composition of hs while nutrient factors only explained 3 4 of the variance in shallow lake sediments it can be seen that the composition of hs in deep lake sediments was dominantly caused by nutrient factors and physicochemical factors in shallow lake sediments the composition of hs was dominantly caused by physicochemical factors and less influenced by the nutrient factors these results were consistent with the pearson analysis 4 4 possible sequestration and transformation mechanisms of hs in lake sediments in different lakes based on the results of pearson analysis nutrient factors and physicochemical factors significantly associated with the fa components and the ha components were selected for sem analysis in fig 6 from this figure no3 n and do were found to have significantly positive influences on fa c2 in deep lake sediments do and temperature were significantly related to the accumulation of fa c3 which had a direct influence on fa c1 fa c1 was primarily regulated by c3 and indirectly influenced by do and temperature suggesting that there may be transformation between fa c1 and fa c3 this is consistent with the decrease of the relative content of fa c3 and the increase of the relative content of fa c1 the composition and accumulation of fa in deep lake sediments were dominantly affected by physicochemical factors and nutrient factors the temperature was found to have a significant negative correlation with fa c2 in shallow lake sediments because the shallow lakes were more sensitive to temperature it was not conducive to the accumulation of fa c2 with global warming the ph had significantly negative impact on fa c1 and fa c3 fa c3 had a significant positive impact on fa c2 while fa c3 had a negative correlation with fa c1 this result indicated that the decomposition of fa c3 was conducive to the accumulation of fa c2 in addition this result indicated that c3 was converted to c2 instead of to c1 comparing to deep lake sediments the accumulation and transformation of fa in shallow lake sediments were dominantly affected by physicochemical factors e g ph temperature temperature and no2 n were found to have significantly positive impact on ha c2 in deep lake sediments there was a significant positive correlation between nh4 n and ha c1 the ph was significantly related to the accumulation of ha c3 which had a direct influence on ha c1 and ha c2 in addition it was found that ha c3 will be converted to ha c2 and ha c1 in deep lake sediments this was consistent with the decrease of the relative content of ha c3 and the increase of the relative content of ha c1 and ha c2 do and ph were negatively correlated with of ha c3 which had a direct influence on ha c1 significantly positive effect of ha c2 on ha c1 was also observed in shallow lake sediments ha components were dominantly regulated by physicochemical factors e g do ph at the same time both ha c3 and ha c2 were transformed to ha c1 comparing the results of sems at different lakes fa and ha were dominantly influenced by nutrient factors and physicochemical factors in deep lake sediments and fa and ha were dominantly influenced by physicochemical factors in shallow lake sediments in addition it was found the phenomenon that the complex components were converted to simple components occurred at different lakes the environmental factors of the lake are highly variable at different depths the content and structural composition of hs in sediments are influenced by environmental factors compared with deep water lakes the material exchange between water and sediments in shallow lakes was more frequent and biotic and abiotic transformation processes were more intense this is consistent with the result that the hs structure in the sediments of shallow lakes is simpler compared to deep lakes physicochemical and nutrient factors are key drivers of these biotic and abiotic activities therefore the differences in the characteristics of hs in lakes of different depths are significant meanwhile the fluorescence peak positions of both fa and ha showed a significant blue shift fig 2 and the relative contents of both fa and ha fluorescence components showed a decrease in the content of complex components and an increase in the content of simple components from deep to shallow lakes fig 3 these results are consistent with the conversion of complex components into simple components according to the above results the form of hs fixation in deep lake sediments is dominated by complex components and the form of hs fixation in shallow lakes is dominated by components with simpler structures from deep to shallow lakes the degree of humification of lake sediments gradually decreased the hs sequestered forms in the sediment tended to be simplified from deep to shallow lakes 5 conclusion this study revealed the sequestration characteristics of hs in different lake sediments the structure of hs fa and ha in sediments tended to be simplified with the increasing depth of lakes pearson analysis and variance partitioning results indicated that hs was dominantly influenced by nutrient factors and physicochemical factors in deep lake sediments while hs was dominantly influenced by physicochemical factors in shallow lake sediments furthermore structural equation models confirmed that complex components were transformed into simple components with the increasing depth of lakes in conclusion this study fills in a gap in hs transformation and sequestration in lake sediments in shallow and deep lakes and it is important to understand the carbon cycle in lake ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement xinyu song conceptualization writing original draft chunhao zhang software data curation visualization xinya su

3941,this paper proposes a trivariate methodology for flood frequency estimation it combines the flood peak storm magnitude and initial soil moisture condition ismc as the main flood related statistical variables to be considered the semi arid mediterranean rambla del poyo catchment has been used as a representative case study where the influence of the spatio temporal variability of the storms and the ismc on floods can lead to differences of up to two orders of magnitude in quantiles when the most commonly used methods are applied in order to incorporate the main flood generating mechanisms the integrated use of a multidimensional storm generator with distributed hydrological modelling is proposed flood quantiles are then estimated by combining the maximum flows with the storm magnitude and ismc in a trivariate probability distribution function through the application of bayes theorem and lagrange s mean value theorem although the methodology proposed in this paper has been applied and tested in only one case study it can be extended to other case studies due to its process based orientation keywords flood frequency trivariate distribution function flood generating processes flash floods storm generator distributed hydrological model 1 introduction flash floods common events in the mediterranean hydro climatic region exert major socio economic impacts gaume et al 2009 such events are preponderant in this area due to the convergence of relevant factors such as high mountain ranges close to the sea high intensity convective storms especially in autumn small catchments with sharply differentiated steep slopes sparse vegetation thin soils and permeable rocks marco 1995 in the western mediterranean recent studies have revealed a positive trend for extraordinary flash flood events for the 1900 2011 period llasat et al 2016 in fact according to the em dat database https www emdat be in the spanish mediterranean area there have occurred 4 of the 10 largest catastrophic flash floods events registered in that country for the period 1960 2019 in addition an intensification of torrential rain events in autumn is to be expected for this region due to climate change millán 2014 for this reason a process understanding is required for flash flood risk management because the dominant processes of the generation of runoff may change with the increase of storm severity borga et al 2011 within the framework of flood risk management one of the main studies supporting flood hazard assessment is that of flood frequency analysis it is related to the so called design flood estimation and can be defined as the value of the peak flow rate corresponding to an assigned non exceedance probability usually expressed in terms of return period stedinger et al 1993 in several cases the requirements are high return period flood quantiles to ensure maximum safety levels or a socially acceptable level of risk for example the flood directive european union 2007 establishes that the scenario of medium probability of flooding should have a return period greater than or equal to 100 years and higher for that of low probability of flooding spanish legislation establishes that the scenario for this low probability of flooding should correspond to a return period of 500 years españa 2010 in order to estimate high return period flood quantiles there are many methods that can be roughly grouped into the following 3 categories statistical or probabilistic deterministic and hybrid or mixed probabilistic methods are based on the existence of recorded data that characterises flooding at the point of interest its standard approach is based on the adjustment of a mathematical distribution function of probability to the sequence of maximum flows recorded at the site of interest and on the extrapolation of this function tail for very low exceedance probabilities klemeš 1993 within the deterministic group the most widely applied method is based on the use of event based rainfall runoff models where the return period of extreme precipitation design events is equivalent to those of the extreme flows generated by those events this is called the iso frequency hypothesis the hybrid or mixed group is based on the use of the above groups of methods either through their combination or by adding sources of information or techniques and they are generally referred to as derived flood frequency approaches despite the widespread use in engineering and mathematical refinements of the standard approach of the probabilistic methods there remains extensive debate regarding its high degree of uncertainty francés 1998 poses that this approach can give rise to highly variable results due to the uncertainty of the statistical model the data recording errors principally on large floods the high variance and asymmetry of the maximum flows and the length of the time series the latter constitutes the major issue since the extrapolation of short time series to estimate high return period flood quantiles may lead to major errors klemeš 1993 indeed flash floods very often occur in poorly instrumented or ungauged basins gaume et al 2009 which directly influences the method to be used in fact the length of the time series and the low density of monitoring stations constitute the main source of uncertainty and one of the main challenges to be faced in flood frequency analysis in arid semi arid regions metzger et al 2020 in the case of the standard approach of the deterministic methods there are among others three critical hypotheses according to rogger et al 2012 the choice of the design rainfall hyetograph the iso frequency hypothesis and the selection of initial soil moisture conditions ismc hereinafter previous to the flood generating storm among the so called hybrid or mixed methods is the pioneer work given by eagleson 1972 who introduced the concept of the derived frequency curve based on a simple outline of understanding the hydrological processes that generate a certain frequency of events using precipitation records and rainfall runoff models within this typology certain authors suggest that for flood frequency analysis continuous simulation approaches are preferable to those that are event based verhoest et al 2010 grimaldi et al 2012 lamb et al 2016 grimaldi et al 2021 as emphasised by grimaldi and petroselli 2015 event based approaches take advantage of the digital information and the computational power currently available which has positioned these approaches as an effective way to sidestep the problems inherent in widely used methods such as the rational formula however one of the main drawbacks of this approach involves the need to select the ismc prior to the storm which is one of the reasons that gives the continuous frameworks an advantage over those that are event based winter et al 2019 nevertheless as pointed out by astagneau et al 2021 common failure in predicting floods is still encountered due to seasonal model bias furthermore this approach cannot be generalised to all types of hydrological regimes such as ephemeral systems in mediterranean areas in which there are no flows for most of the year marco 1995 metzger et al 2020 and floods are sporadic boughton and droop 2003 in our experience moreover the current practical difficulties involved in implementing such weather generators should be considered beneyto et al 2020 beven 2021 as should to a lesser extent the computational time required for the long continuous sub daily simulations yu et al 2019 a way to reduce this computational time is given in grimaldi et al 2021 given the disadvantages of the aforementioned hydrological modelling practices for flood frequency analysis in mediterranean areas this paper proposes a hybrid approach following the combinatorial approach reasoning as laid out by klemeš 1993 the idea is to involve the main flood generation factors see section 3 1 in the probability through an innovative trivariate methodology see section 3 2 as grimaldi et al 2021 have underlined it could be a contradiction to use a complex approach in case studies without sufficient data for calibration and validation however the contribution of a process based approach such as the one in this paper is that frequency estimation is supported by the generation of pieces of information that take full advantage of the available digital information of the catchment scientific knowledge of the hydrological cycle and modelling tools existing today recent studies highlight both the potential and the challenges of process based approaches perez et al 2019 proposed an estimation of peak flow quantiles in iowa usa using representations of regional peak flow distributions derived from a combined framework of stochastic storm transposition radar rainfall observations and distributed hydrological modelling these authors point out that one of the aspects to be considered in future studies involves the development of representations of seasonally varying hydrological processes of a more realistic nature and their interaction within synthetic peak flow simulations in the same vein yu et al 2019 emphasise the advantages of using process based approaches for frequency analysis they draw attention however to the need to properly consider the effect of seasonality in two ways input variables and process variation within the modelling the effect of the structure of the hydrological model on flood analysis should also be borne in mind as has been pointed out in several studies zhu et al 2018 sun et al 2018 tarasova et al 2020 the spatial interaction between rainfall structure and soil moisture exerts significant impacts on the hydrological response to floods the use of lumped models may therefore introduce a limiting factor in the prediction in fact such an effect has been pointed out by astagneau et al 2021 as one of the possible reasons for the deficiencies found in their study of a large set of catchments in france in light of the above challenges identified in the literature this study presents an innovative contribution based on the identification of the main processes to be considered and a way to combine them statistically through a trivariate methodology see section 3 this is based on the exploitation of information generated from a multidimensional stochastic storm model and hybrid distributed hydrological modelling a continuous daily model to identify the predominant ismcs of registered flood events that considers their seasonality and an event based sub daily model to generate flood events using synthetic storms and the predominant ismcs in order to verify the validity of the proposed trivariate methodology it was applied in a representative case study in spain where a catastrophic flood occurred in the autumn of 2000 and where hydrometeorological data are available for the validation of the initial hypotheses see section 2 the rest of the paper is organised as follows the fourth section summarises the results obtained from the applied methodology the fifth section presents a discussion considering the findings achieved finally the sixth section presents the main conclusions 2 case study the rambla del poyo catchment is part of the jucar river basin authority confederación hidrográfica del júcar chj hereinafter this catchment is located in the region of valencia spain near the coast its principal channel flows in a northwest southeast direction into lake albufera see fig 1 for approximately 43 5 km as can be seen in fig 1 the lower part of the catchment is very close to the western side of the city of valencia where part of its metropolitan area including its international airport lies within the rambla del poyo floodplain the catchment area up to its mouth at lake albufera measures 430 km2 at the headwaters the slope is greater than 16 4 and in the floodplain the slope is less than 2 7 according to the lithostratigraphic and hydrogeological map of spain igme 2010 the catchment has the following characteristics i in the headwaters there are predominant carbonate formations of moderate to high permeability ii in the central part detritic formations of low permeability exist iii in the lower part there are quaternary detritic formations of moderate to low permeability and to a lesser extent carbonate formations of moderate to high permeability iv the principal channel flows from the head to the lower part through quaternary detritic formations of very high permeability according to the soil maps of the valencian region generalitat valenciana 1996 there is a variety of taxonomic units which can be grouped in accordance with level one of the fao legend in the following main categories leptosols and luvisols at the head calcisols in the central part and fluvisols luvisols and regosols on the floodplain according to the corine land cover map eea 2019 the catchment had the following coverage 10 urban areas 63 agricultural areas 23 shrubland 1 pine forests and 3 water bodies the climate in rambla del poyo is semi arid mediterranean with a mean annual rainfall of less than 500 mm and mean annual reference evapotranspiration of approximately 1 100 mm which results in an ephemeral river according to francés 1998 in the spanish mediterranean catchments there are two kinds of floods ordinary and extraordinary the ordinary floods are generated by the most frequent types of rainfall with low or medium convectivity which produces minor floods the extraordinary floods are less frequent but larger and are generated by heavy convective rainfall events occurring mainly during the autumn regarding the hydrometeorological data available for this catchment there are two sources of information one of these is from the network of the spanish meteorological agency agencia estatal de meteorología aemet http www aemet es with daily data available for the period 1951 2019 the other network is the automatic hydrological information system of the chj saih chj hereinafter http saih chj es chj saih with daily data available on flow and precipitation from 1988 to 2019 at the poyo station which has a sub catchment area of 184 km2 observed hydrographs of the maximum events that occurred in the period 1988 2012 are available in five minute time discretization 9 events with complete hydrometeorological data given the differences in spatial and temporal coverage of the available data the period to be considered for the hydrological modelling see section 3 2 2 is 1951 2012 for the daily resolution and 1988 2012 for the sub daily resolution 3 methodological framework in this paper a methodological framework is proposed based on the physically possible combinations of the principal characteristics involved in the behaviour of flash floods at the catchment scale and their integration using a multivariate statistical approach following klemeš 1993 this framework has two parts estimation of the magnitude of an event and estimation of its probability to this end the following flood generating processes and methods are considered in order to obtain the flood quantiles in the catchment under study 3 1 main factors affecting the hydrological response to flash floods floods are the result of numerous hydrological processes characterised by significant levels of spatial and temporal variability where the generating factors mainly depend on hydro climatic characteristics of the study area merz and blöschl 2008 the case study analysed herein rambla del poyo typically represents the predominant hydrological processes in small semi arid mediterranean catchments flash floods frequently take place in these types of catchments mainly during the autumn season merheb et al 2016 resulting from heavy precipitation events developed in mesoscale convective systems romero et al 1998 pastor et al 2010 as reported by peñarrocha et al 2002 several daily precipitation values over 800 mm have been recorded in the region where the case study is located runoff is mainly overland flow generated by infiltration excess however mixed generation mechanisms of runoff can also occur depending on the water retention capacity of the hillslopes and the ismc calvo cases et al 2003 it is particularly important to take this last issue into account in the modelling process in fact as highlighted by perrin and tournoud 2009 subsurface flow is sometimes ignored in flash flood analysis although flow registers show that hydrograph can continue for several hours or several days after the rain has actually stopped one of the key characteristics for the correct modelling of flash flood events in mediterranean regions is the space time variability of convective storm intensities as suggested by sangati et al 2009 an incorrect representation of the spatial variability of rainfall intensities can yield errors of up to 35 in peak flow predictions likewise these authors also found that such errors could be even larger in the case of dry ismc indeed ismc plays a fundamental role in the runoff generation processes since this condition controls infiltration capacity at the beginning of the storm several studies refer to the key influence of ismc on the flood processes in the mediterranean catchments e g marchi et al 2010 efstratiadis et al 2014 merheb et al 2016 mateo lázaro et al 2014 place the ismc as the most influential factor in the magnitude of flash floods produced by the same amount of rainfall these authors also remarked on the crucial role played by the temporal distribution of rainfall intensities on the hydrograph shape and magnitude of the flash floods in the valencian region of spain camarasa belmonte and segura beltrán 2001 found that the runoff coefficients in the ephemeral streams are highly variable and mainly depend on the rainfall intensity and the ismc finally the spatial variability of the geomorphological characteristics and the river channel network connectivity of the catchment have also been identified in the literature as decisive factors to suitably model flash flood response marchi et al 2010 mateo lázaro et al 2014 3 2 proposed trivariate methodology fig 2 shows a diagram of the sequence to follow in the methodological framework proposed in this paper solid lines indicate input data dashed lines are results which in turn serve as input in another task accordingly the proposed trivariate methodology needs the implementation of two models i a stochastic multidimensional sub daily model for the generation in space and time of convective storms ii a distributed rainfall runoff model to reproduce the existing spatial variability at two different temporal scales the first is a continuous model at daily time scale for the identification of the predominant ismcs of registered flood events while the second is an event based model at sub daily time scale to generate flood events using the synthetic storms and the predominant ismcs the trivariate methodology is made up of the following tasks a a storm frequency analysis based on regional records of the annual maximum of daily point precipitation in order to assign probabilities regarding the magnitude of the synthetic storms represented by the continuous random variable r the point rainfall daily equivalent b an ismc frequency analysis based on the results of the continuous model which is a discrete random variable denoted by h and finally c the estimation of the flood quantiles based on a trivariate statistical approach that takes into account the generated peak flows called x obtained in synthetic flood generation and the probability distribution function of both r and h 3 2 1 storm generator blazkov and beven 1997 pointed out the practical interest of using stochastic models to generate representative ensembles of storm events the aim is to obtain a wide range of storms suitably defined with a fine space time resolution in fact a significant number of major storms large return period t are required by the proposed methodology indeed such requirement is not possible to fulfil using only recorded historical events as there are only a few or none of such events available that can be associated to large t values therefore the strategy adopted in this research involves the generation of high resolution space time rainfall scenarios from a suitable stochastic rainfall model whereby certain internal features and statistics observed in the most intense rainfall events recorded in the study region are reproduced to this end the multidimensional stochastic model proposed by salsón and garcia bartual 2003 has been used the model proposed herein was specifically conceived to reproduce structural properties of torrential convective storms characteristic of the mediterranean regime consequently the rainfall field is conceptualised based on the description of convective cells which are known to be the most relevant features of these types of rainfall events moreover a suitable representation of these cells is crucial for the reproduction of the observed spatio temporal rainfall variability following previous modelling research lines rainfall intensity field results from the observed cellular structure associated with ensembles of rain cells waymire et al 1984 sivapalan and wood 1987 willems 2001 this family of poisson cluster based rainfall models which also include popular temporal rainfall models e g rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 cowpertwait 1991 velghe et al 1994 have been successfully applied in a wide range of practices for hydrological risk assessments for example in kim et al 2014 the identification parametrisation and shape description of rain cells has received major attention in a variety of experimental studies rigo and llasat 2004 peleg and morin 2012 in the proposed model the spatial location of the cell the time of birth and cell centre rainfall intensity are random variables while the individual cell intensities have a deterministic description accounting for the rain cell phases of growing maturing and gradual decay the maximum intensities occur in the centre of cells and are assumed to follow an exponential distribution rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 the validity of this hypothesis has also been proved in recent experimental studies goudenhoofdt et al 2017 for the case of the mediterranean coastal area where our case study is located the sample of maximum intensities corresponding to the 73 rainstorms reported in garcía bartual and andrés domenech 2017 is analysed fig 3 shows the frequency histogram of maximum intensities of the sample of rainstorms the exponential distribution shows a satisfactory agreement with the data further details of the model including analytical expressions for the covariance function for both the rainfall intensity and cumulative rainfall process can be found in salsón and garcia bartual 2003 3 2 2 distributed hydrological modelling büchele et al 2006 recommend the combined use of statistical theory with the knowledge of the characteristics of the hydrological processes resulting from the use of rainfall runoff models to reduce the levels of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of extreme values and to achieve reliable results in the case of mediterranean catchments the use of distributed hydrological models is convenient since it is possible to consider both the effect of the high spatial temporal variability of storms and the spatial variability of the catchment attributes that together shape the hydrological response in this paper the conceptual and distributed hydrological model tetis francés et al 2007 has been used for the establishment of the catchment water cycle this has proved to be robust for the representation of the main hydrological processes in the catchment under study bussi et al 2013 salazar et al 2012 tetis represents the spatial heterogeneity of the physical characteristics of a catchment by means of regular grid cells and their related model parameters the conceptualisation of the model is an interconnected three dimensional grid representing the main hydrological processes the basis of the calculation involves the estimation of the water balance for each cell and assumes that the water is distributed across six interconnected conceptual storage tanks plus a seventh tank representing the river channel when it exists in the cell in this way tetis considers the principal mechanisms of streamflow generation infiltration excess and saturation excess overland flow interflow and base flow resulting from groundwater discharge for the case study this paper proposes the following modelling strategy while keeping the continuous modelling advantages for ismc estimation with a broad temporal discretization a daily resolution the event based modelling approach is used with a much finer discretization ten minute resolution to reflect the high spatio temporal variability of flood generating storms in both cases the spatial discretization used in tetis is 100 m 3 2 3 flood quantile estimation through a trivariate statistical approach the problem to be solved involves the quantification of the marginal probabilities of the random variables of the flood generating processes storm magnitude and ismc represented by r and h respectively and subsequently its combination with the flood peak x based on a multivariate statistical approach as explained below 3 2 3 1 estimating the probabilities of synthetic storms this task refers to the estimation of the frequency of occurrence of each synthetic storm expressed in terms of return period it is clearly impossible to assign a single probability to the entire storm due to its intrinsic multivariate characteristics a practical procedure is therefore proposed for the reduction of a multidimensional synthetic storm to a single point rainfall daily equivalent r the exceedance probability of r and hence the corresponding return period can be obtained with an extreme value distribution previously adjusted to the observed annual maximum daily precipitation within the catchment of course in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with estimating probabilities the use of a regional frequency analysis is recommended a discussion of methods is given in svensson and jones 2010 3 2 3 2 estimating the probability of ismcs given that floods in mediterranean ephemeral systems are sporadic and mainly occur in autumn the ismc has been considered as a random variable h with a discrete probability distribution see an analysis into the influence of ismcs on flood frequency distribution in de michele and salvadori 2002 the results obtained from the implementation of the continuous hydrological model form the basis of the estimation of the frequency of h given a threshold for the daily discharge to select the flood events in this task it is also necessary to verify whether a statistically significant correlation exists between r and h in the case of rambla del poyo there is independence between these two random variables see section 4 4 for this reason this paper assumes independence between h and r in the trivariate flood frequency analysis 3 2 3 3 flood quantile estimation the methodology for the frequency analysis of the maximum flows x is based on the existence of a joint probability distribution function of x r the point rainfall daily equivalent of the synthetic storms and h the predominant ismc for significant floods as explained in the previous paragraphs it is possible to estimate the marginal distribution functions of r and h therefore the objective is to determine the marginal distribution function of x from a sample of each of which is conditional on given values of storm magnitude r and ismc h obtained with the simulations of the sub daily event based hydrological model by application of bayes theorem and if h and r are independent then the joint density function of the trivariate model can be expressed as 1 f x r h x r h j f x r h x r h j f r r π j where πj is the probability of h hj with j 1 m from the previous equation the marginal distribution of x is given by 2 f x x j 1 m π j 0 f x r h x u h j f r u d u the latter can be rewritten to be evaluated by intervals ri ri 1 as follows 3 f x x j 1 m π j i 0 r i r i 1 f x r h x u h j f r u d u according to lagrange s mean value theorem an approximation of the previous integral can be carried out in this way 4 f x x j 1 m π j i 0 f x r h x r i h j f r r i 1 f r r i where r is an intermediate point in the interval of integration finally the value of the continuous distribution function can in turn be approximated by a plotting position obtained from the sample of x values 5 f x x j 1 m π j i 0 n ij x n ij f r r i 1 f r r i where nij x is the number of observations less than or equal to x within the range ri ri 1 for the ismc hj and nij is the total number of observations under the same conditions 4 application of the methodology and results 4 1 synthetic storm generation thanks to the model formulation it is possible to verify its capability to reproduce observed empirical statistics of the historical records such as mean variance spatial correlation point rainfall temporal autocorrelation duration of the event maximum intensities distribution normalised mean function and total cumulative rainfall other statistics were also computed after the synthetic generation in order to verify the credibility of the generated events for instance derived synthetic intensity duration curves for every point of the spatial grid being essentially event oriented the outcome of the model consists of a number of independent synthetic rainfall events each of which is a continuous space time random field with rainfall intensity values defined with time resolution of 10 min and spatial resolution of 1 km2 this choice follows previous research on hydrological modelling in the studied catchment that considers the effect of the spatio temporal variability of storms on hydrological response guichard romero et al 2009 the estimation of model parameters follows the procedure proposed in salsón and garcia bartual 2003 at the regional scale in particular the method of moments is applied whereby the mean and variance of the accumulated total rainfall the spatial correlation function the temporal autocorrelation in selected rain gauges and the normalised mean function temporal evolution of cumulated rainfall normalised by total cumulative rainfall are all considered high resolution rainfall data from the regional automatic hydrological information system saih chj is used for parameter estimation fig 4 shows both the autocorrelation of the temporally averaged intensity process and the correlation of total depth based on the event that occurred in october 2000 which is the most extreme event recorded to date by the saih chj the stochastic rainfall model was employed for the generation of 100 synthetic storms this ensemble provides a wide range of space time rainfall intensity fields each of the synthetic events was carefully analysed to check its feasibility to this end several derived quantitative properties were checked including point and areal derived hyetographs intensity duration curves maximum intensities reached and maximum cumulative rainfall quantities consequently each of the generated synthetic events can provide an animation showing the evolution of the space time rainfall intensity field fig a1 in appendix a shows an example of the spatial evolution of the intensity field for the most intense 6 hour period in this example there are 4 storms with a similar r with its relative hydrological response at the gauging station see fig a2 as supplementary supporting material the animation sequence of the whole storm duration of appendix a is presented in appendix b thus the result of this modelling step was a representative and realistic collection of space time storms which serve as input for both synthetic flood generation and trivariate frequency analysis for the generated family the ten minute maximum cell intensity ranged from 26 to 95 mm h the spatial density of rain cell occurrence varied between 0 002 and 0 06 cells km2 the duration of the storms exhibited a large variation ranging from 1 5 h to 262 h finally the areal average rainfall depth among the different events generated also presented a significant variation ranging from 37 to 868 mm 4 2 implementation of the distributed hydrological model the effective parameters of the model were obtained following a separate structure see details in francés et al 2007 consisting of i maps of parameters estimated a priori based on all available spatial information and ii a correction factor for each parameter map in the calibration process only the correction factors were adjusted the suggestions of klemeš 1986 were followed for the calibration validation of the model in a split sample test a distinction between the modelling objectives of the different implemented temporal resolutions was made in order to accept each hydrological model the aim of the continuous model daily resolution is to obtain the ismc prior to flood events for this reason the acceptability criteria used were bias in volume pbias v the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr the aim of the event based model ten minute resolution is to obtain the hydrograph at the point of interest for each combination of synthetic storm and ismc in this case the acceptability criteria used were the nse and the rsr in addition the bias in peak flow pbias pf and time to peak bias tpmin were employed to check the behaviour of the hydrograph at its maximum value daily data on rainfall and maximum and minimum temperatures from the aemet network allowed the establishment of a continuous hydrological model for the period 1951 2012 however there has been only one flow gauge station located in the central part of the catchment since 1988 the data from october 1990 to september 2003 was used for automatic calibration with a short warm up period aquifer is not connected while the remaining data was used for validation october 2003 september 2012 the calibration showed a pbias v of 4 5 the nse was 0 85 and the rsr was 0 14 within the validation period the pbias v was 19 the nse was 0 64 and the rsr was 0 75 according to moriasi et al 2015 these results should be considered suitable to achieve their purpose the sample of ismcs the range of maximum annual events recorded at sub daily resolution by the saih chj was considered for the establishment of the event based model in all the events the ismc was taken from the proper date in the continuous modelling for the calibration the maximum recorded event of the available data the october 2000 event was used for this event the nse was 0 85 and the rsr 0 39 see fig 5 with a pbias pf of 9 and a pbias tpmin of 10 min the results of the model validation considering the remaining events with sub daily data for the 1988 2012 period 9 events in total considering the quality of the hydrometeorological records showed values of the nse index between 0 55 and 0 68 and between 0 57 and 0 69 for the rsr the pbias pf were between 18 and 35 and the bias tpmin were between 20 and 40 min considering the reference values suggested by moriasi et al 2015 the results in terms of nse and rsr in calibration and validation showed that the catchment model is acceptable for the established objective the sample of peak flows in all the simulated events the results showed that the predominating runoff generation mechanism is the infiltration excess overland flow rainfall exceeds infiltration capacity however in the case of large events such as the calibration event mixed generation mechanisms of runoff were found with additional mechanisms such as saturation excess overland flow and interflow 4 3 estimation of the exceedance probability of the magnitude of synthetic storms the magnitude of each multidimensional synthetic storm was represented by a single point rainfall daily equivalent r which can be obtained as the areal averaged maximum daily precipitation of the storm divided by the areal reduction factor of the catchment the magnitude of the synthetic storms r ranged from 37 to 670 mm a regional study at a national scale of the annual maximum daily precipitation recommended by the spanish authorities ministerio de fomento 2016 has been used to assign exceedance probabilities to the generated rs in this regional study the probability distribution function is the square root exponential type extreme distribution sqrt et max proposed by etoh et al 1987 see salas and fernández 2007 for a discussion on the relevance of the use of the sqrt et max distribution in the spanish mediterranean region from a regional frequency analysis point of view this distribution has two parameters which were obtained using i the coefficient of variation of the homogeneous region from the original regional study ferrer and ardiles 1995 and ii the local mean value obtained for this research from aemet data 1951 2012 period 4 4 estimation of the probability of ismc the predominant ismcs were obtained from the continuous hydrological modelling to this end the maximum annual flood events were located and their corresponding ismcs were then selected the ismc prior to each event was obtained from the tetis model state variable called relative soil moisture content which represents the quantity of capillary water contained in the upper part of the soil from wilting point 0 to field capacity 100 this variable has provided valuable information on the statistical behaviour of the iscms of floods over a long period of time see fig 6 fig 6 shows that for events occurring outside autumn ismcs must be greater than 40 this result is consistent with expected higher correlations between flood producing storms r outside autumn typically of low and medium convective nature and their ismcs h in contrast in autumn when flood generating storms generally occur with heavy convective rainfall events there is a high dispersion in the r and h relationship two rank correlation methods spearman spearman 1904 and kendall kendall 1938 were applied to verify whether a statistically significant correlation exists between r and h to consider the behaviour of the maximum storms observed during the seasons of the year these tests were carried out i for all events without seasonal distinction and ii by making a distinction between those events occurring in autumn and those occurring in other seasons it was established as a null hypothesis that rainfall is independent of the ismc this was verified to a 95 confidence interval if the entire sample is analysed without seasonal distinction the null hypothesis is rejected in both tests however making the seasonal distinction the independence between rainfall and the ismc is accepted in both correlation methods for autumn the focus in this case study a dry ismc and a wet ismc were established using the 40 needed for a significant flood out of autumn as the threshold the representative sample mean soil moisture content for these two states are 10 for dry and 70 for wet and their probability is 0 4 and 0 6 respectively horizontal lines in fig 6 4 5 flood quantiles estimation two hundred synthetic hydrographs were generated using the event based hydrological model with a combination of the one hundred synthetic storms and the two representative ismcs dry and wet as input data fig 7 shows the application of the trivariate plotting position given by eq 5 which refers to the location of the flow gauge station the quantiles are plotted with an empty red circle which is filled by two different colours to visualise dry orange filled and wet brown filled events the method has been validated by comparison with the standard statistical approach using all the observed annual maximum floods period from 1988 to 2019 in two ways with the plotting position of the observations following the compromise formula suggested by cunnane 1978 and the parametric best fit flood frequency distribution log pearson type iii lpiii using the maximum likelihood method for parameter estimation with its respective 90 confidence interval due to the relatively short length of the observations 42 years these comparisons are nonsensical for high return periods 5 discussion 5 1 on the limitations of the statistical approach as was previously explained in the introduction the standard approach of the statistical methods can lead to major errors among others due to the sample length as can be seen in fig 7 the plotting position of the observations show a plateau and a step change in slope because there is one extraordinary flood observed in the period 1988 2019 which also conditions the fitted lpiii distribution function fig 7 shows that for low return periods quantiles less than 10 years the slopes of the frequency curve of the statistical methods and the trivariate method are similar for flood quantiles between 10 and 100 years the lpiii smooths the actual behaviour of the catchment represented by a plateau followed by a step change in the observed plotting position probabilities and a lower slope in the trivariate method for the estimation of floods with a high return period the use of the best distribution function adjusted to the observed data results in a wide range of uncertainty grey dashed line in fig 7 this result reflects the limitations of using a standard statistical method when extrapolating extreme values outside the length of the observed period in fact in the case of catchments with flash flood regimes with high sample variability such as those in the mediterranean this is the main limitation as these are usually ungauged or have short time series and poor spatial representativeness gaume et al 2009 metzger et al 2020 as in our case study the plateau followed by a step change in the plotting position of the observations and the lower slope in the trivariate method is likely to be reflecting the threshold effect and the non linear behaviour typical of mediterranean catchments salinas et al 2013 where there are two types of flood populations ordinary and extraordinary according to francés 1998 in the ordinary floods the main runoff type is overland flow in the extraordinary floods there are mixed processes of runoff generation for the extraordinary flood recorded in the case study october 2000 shown in fig 5 hydrological modelling has shown that the peak flow was produced by mixed runoff generation mechanisms as has also been found in other studies see calvo cases et al 2003 these characteristics non linearity threshold effect two flood populations which cannot be properly considered with the statistical method can be integrated with a method based on the understanding of the main factors affecting floods such as that proposed in this paper in fig 7 it can be observed that with the trivariate plotting position the step change of the observed plotting positions is replaced by a curve with a change of slope that could be reflecting the different combinations of flood generation processes 5 2 on the critical hypotheses of the deterministic approach as was also previously mentioned the standard approach of the deterministic methods has three critical hypotheses related to the storm spatio temporal characteristics its ismc and the iso frequency assumption the combination of different spatio temporal characteristics of the storms with a similar magnitude represented as point rainfall daily equivalent r and their ismc in the hydrological response to floods represented as maximum flow x is illustrated in fig 8 in this figure the maximum peak discharge obtained with a totally dry ismc at wilting point can be up to four times higher for other storms with similar magnitude but with different spatio temporal characteristics even for those with the same ismc such variability considered in stochastic storm modelling can only be exploited with a distributed hydrological model as proposed in this paper this variability is therefore likely to influence the favouring of one or more runoff generation mechanisms the total or partial saturation of the drainage area and or the contribution to the magnification of the maximum peak discharge by the synchronisation of the tributary response as has been pointed out in other studies see perez et al 2019 a combination of tools such as those used in the present study has a high value in frequency analysis since it has the ability to explicitly incorporate the physical interaction between rainfall land surface subsoil and drainage network in contrast approaches using lumped models have shown that this can constitute a limiting factor for a suitable representation of flood behaviour astagneau et al 2021 by considering the entire physically feasible range of ismcs from wilting point to field capacity there is an increase in the dispersion of the r x relationship as can be observed in fig 8 for storms with a similar depth it is possible to obtain maximum flows with differences ranging from one time up to one order of magnitude see in section 5 3 how this effect is transferred in the flood frequency curve for example note that for a value of r of approximately 80 mm 5 mm it is possible to obtain a range of maximum flows between 4 and 51 m3 s while for a value of r of approximately 205 mm 5 mm there is a range of maximum flows between 89 and 880 m3 s see the example of the spatio temporal variability of these storms and their hydrological response in appendix a and see the animated sequence for these storms in appendix b the spatio temporal variability of the storm characteristics combined with different ismc therefore clearly influence the response of the catchment and cannot be neglected in a hydrological analysis that supports flood frequency estimations concerning the iso frequency hypothesis fig 9 compares the storm magnitude r return period and its related flood peak x return period obtained with the trivariate analysis for each extreme ismc wilting point and field capacity fig 9 shows a very high dispersion log scale with differences up to two orders of magnitude between the rainfall and flood return periods for example note that for a storm magnitude with a return period of approximately 100 years 10 years it is possible to obtain a range of flood return periods between 6 and almost 420 years conversely for floods with return periods of approximately 100 years 10 years there are associated storm return periods between 15 and more than 1000 years as viglione et al 2009 analytically demonstrated the relationship between the return period of both the maximum flow and its generating storm depends strongly on the ismc and can reach a difference of between two to three orders of magnitude as bocchiola and rosso 2009 stated the iso frequency hypothesis is non realistic because no univocal relationship exists between a given flood return period and the generating storm as was demonstrated in fig 9 again this relationship depends on the convergence of factors considered in this paper such as the influence of the spatio temporal characteristics of the storm and its ismc on the hydrological response by considering these results in relation with the fundamental hypotheses of the standard deterministic approach in frequency estimations it has been demonstrated that its use would be inappropriate in the analysed case study and also probably in all catchments similar to those found in the mediterranean in this respect an alternative method based on the main mechanisms that generate floods as proposed in this paper is justified 5 3 sensitivity of the trivariate approach to ismc in order to quantify the effect of the initial soil moisture on the behaviour of the flood quantiles the two extreme states of ismc wilting point and field capacity have been considered as approximate lower and upper bounds of the trivariate plotting position in fig 10 the plotting positions for each state were estimated following eq 5 these bounds reflect the physical limits imposed by the extreme ismc on the hydrological response that is it is a way to introduce information regarding the feasible range of flood quantiles that consider the effect of ismc the same approach can be used if other sources of uncertainty are known e g storm characteristic representations storm return period assignment input data and both the structure and parametrisation of the hydrological model since these form the basis for the estimation of the associated uncertainty to the frequency analysis this last issue was not considered since it falls outside the scope of this paper however other similar process based approaches to that proposed by perez et al 2019 have already made progress in the quantification of error components stemming from epistemic assumptions the parameter estimation method the sample size and in the regional approaches the number of pooled sites for the specific case of uncertainty in hydrological models see moges et al 2020 5 4 practical considerations in this paper the advantages of continuous modelling were maintained to describe the ismc prior to maximum flows at a daily scale for a long period and subsequently to lend support to its frequency analysis with a physical basis at the same time event based distributed modelling was established to reflect the predominant hydrological processes associated with the typology of flash floods as boughton and droop 2003 mentioned due to the existence of isolated extreme events in ephemeral systems which are typical of semi arid areas as in the case study of this paper sub daily continuous modelling is not the most advantageous if we consider the computational cost of hydrological modelling in the aforementioned systems where high temporal and spatial resolutions need to be considered to properly capture flash flood processes the applicability of such modelling strategy may be restrictive for practical purposes li et al 2014 showed that a hybrid approach based on both event based and continuous hydrological models provides estimates of the flood frequency distribution with an accuracy similar to that of the continuous simulation approach but with a dramatically reduced computational time in both cases continuous and event based modelling the challenge is to improve the performance of the model by reducing uncertainty in the input data model structure and parametrisation garavaglia et al 2017 bárdossy et al 2020 moges et al 2021 as well as improving the strategies used for the validation of the initial hypotheses arsenault et al 2018 in the present study the model has been shown to be robust given the performance in the validation process in particular the model is able to reproduce the peak flows as a synthesis of the main dominant processes however for the evaluation of the model performance it was only possible to consider 9 events out of the total number of events for the period 1988 2012 given the quality of the sub daily hydrometeorological records for these events the pbias pf were less than 35 and the bias tpmin were less than 40 min in any case considering that this is a real case it can be stated that the sub daily model will suitably reproduce the flood generation mechanisms the results of the 200 hydrological simulations were obtained from one hundred synthetic storms with two representative ismcs in the set of 200 simulated events we include the entire range of observed rainfall quantities as well as the predominant iscm values as was previously mentioned r ranges from 37 to 670 mm which is in line with what is observed in the region for convective storms see peñarrocha et al 2002 furthermore the ten minute maximum cell intensity of this family of storms ranging from 26 to 95 mm h is in the most observed ranges of historical storms as shown in the histogram in fig 3 in the case of predominant ismcs these were obtained from a continuous hydrological catchment model validated with observed daily data this case study used two predominant ismcs although eq 5 does allow any number thereof in this vein it is possible to obtain relevant information on the physics of the phenomena involved by considering the flood generating mechanisms in the catchment of interest klemeš 1993 and by following an integrated storm and hydrological modelling strategy as proposed in this paper although there are studies suggesting the use of copulas in multivariate event based analysis candela et al 2014 that approach can have practical limitations due to its need for large temporal series of discharges this is the case of flash floods which often occur in poorly instrumented or ungauged basins gaume et al 2009 as found in the case study presented in this paper as tong et al 2015 concluded the accuracy of copula models depends on the data length and this also exerts a negative effect on the marginals which is an important factor when using a copula model to perform bivariate analysis therefore a multivariate approach such as that presented herein has a high potential for application in the case of ungauged catchments or catchments with short flow records it should be underlined that the proposed approach in this paper is a way to advance in a flood frequency hydrology framework by expanding causal information through the incorporation of the principal dominant hydrological processes in flood generation merz and blöschl 2008 this paper does not combine independent data sources such as systematic at site records and maximum flows obtained from hydrological modelling that information however could be integrated through bayesian approaches such as that proposed by viglione et al 2013 when it is necessary to estimate high return flood quantiles in ungauged catchments or in changing conditions e g storm severity or land use the present methodology is useful thanks to the use of a multidimensional storm generator which can incorporate changes in the severity of storms and a distributed hydrological model which can incorporate changes in both the storm characteristics and land uses this kind of process based approach provides a meaningful pathway towards understanding current and future flood frequency in non stationary conditions and can therefore be valuable in supplementing existing practices yu et al 2019 for these cases the hydrological model can be established using one of the methods proposed by rosbjerg et al 2013 and its evaluation is made possible by applying a proxy basin test or a differential split sample test following klemeš 1986 recalling rogger et al 2012 the selection of the appropriate method for estimating flood quantiles should consider the strengths and weaknesses of the different applicable methods in the present study it has been shown that the widely used standard probabilistic and deterministic methods contain a series of weaknesses that would be transferable into results with high uncertainty for decision making e g a flood risk management plan ultimately changes in the flood frequency curve are a consequence of the changes in the runoff generation processes sivapalan et al 1990 which cannot be adequately reflected by means of the standard approaches of frequency analysis indeed it poses a major challenge when the availability of hydrometeorological records is a limiting factor in understanding the underlying processes associated with flash floods as is the case of the mediterranean area in the trivariate methodology proposed in this paper it is possible to explicitly consider the influence in the upper tail of the distribution function of physical characteristics that impose upper limits such as the spatio temporal variability of storms soil saturation of the whole catchment and the activation of mixed runoff generation processes as was concluded by klemeš 1993 6 conclusions the integrated use of stochastic modelling of convective storms with distributed hydrological modelling at different time resolutions has enabled high return period flood quantiles to be estimated by considering the main flood generating processes involved the rambla del poyo has been used as a representative case study of the hydrological response in semi arid mediterranean catchments on this basis it has been possible to consider the principal flood generation mechanisms and their probability distribution functions through a trivariate flood frequency analysis this approach is based on the consideration of the spatio temporal behaviour of the typical storms of the region studied through the multidimensional stochastic generation of storms of a convective nature the statistical analysis of their magnitude should be carried out through the selection of an appropriate random variable point rainfall daily equivalent and the application of a regional annual maximum daily rainfall frequency study the trivariate methodology also considers the spatial heterogeneity of the catchment physical support through a distributed hydrological model and the effect of the ismc on the processes of flood generation where the ismc has been contemplated as a random variable with a discrete probability distribution with this approach it is possible to reduce computational cost using a catchment distributed hydrological model for two reasons continuous simulation at daily time step for ismc analysis and event based simulation at sub daily time step for hydrograph generation using a wide range in magnitude and spatio temporal characteristics but limited in number of synthetic storms this paper has demonstrated that the use of probabilistic as well as deterministic standard approaches for flood quantile estimations of high return periods are not suitable in semi arid mediterranean catchments such as the rambla del poyo in the hydro climatic region of the case study there are determinant factors that must be considered these factors include the high intrinsic non linearity existing in the rainfall runoff relationship the effect of the ismc on the response of the catchment in an extreme event the spatial heterogeneity of the physical characteristics of the catchment and the high spatio temporal variability of the flood generating storms hence the joint use of stochastic modelling of storms with distributed hydrological modelling on different temporal scales has been shown to possess great potential to support flood frequency analysis using the proposed trivariate methodology with this approach it is also possible to integrate various pieces of information obtained with a physical basis considering the inherent characteristics of the flash floods in the spanish mediterranean area although the methodology proposed in this paper has been tested in one case study as a proof of concept it can be extended to other cases for at least the following four main reasons first it is based on the analysis of the predominant flood generation mechanisms of the catchment under study but also considers its regional hydro climatic context second it is useful for high return period flood quantile estimations especially in practical applications where it is necessary to generate information due to the lack or poor availability of hydro climatic data or to changing conditions the trivariate methodology provides an expansion of information based on the causes of the phenomenon under analysis third in the case of the existence of a flow gauge station at any point of the catchment it is possible to validate this methodology for low return periods at this station thereby increasing its feasibility in the extrapolation for high return periods moreover if a hydrological distributed model is used then it is possible to obtain flood quantiles at any point of interest within the catchment or modelling area by always considering the spatial variability of storms and catchment attributes finally the use of a hybrid hydrological modelling strategy based on both continuous and event based models limits the computational cost while allowing a better representation of the high spatial temporal

3941,this paper proposes a trivariate methodology for flood frequency estimation it combines the flood peak storm magnitude and initial soil moisture condition ismc as the main flood related statistical variables to be considered the semi arid mediterranean rambla del poyo catchment has been used as a representative case study where the influence of the spatio temporal variability of the storms and the ismc on floods can lead to differences of up to two orders of magnitude in quantiles when the most commonly used methods are applied in order to incorporate the main flood generating mechanisms the integrated use of a multidimensional storm generator with distributed hydrological modelling is proposed flood quantiles are then estimated by combining the maximum flows with the storm magnitude and ismc in a trivariate probability distribution function through the application of bayes theorem and lagrange s mean value theorem although the methodology proposed in this paper has been applied and tested in only one case study it can be extended to other case studies due to its process based orientation keywords flood frequency trivariate distribution function flood generating processes flash floods storm generator distributed hydrological model 1 introduction flash floods common events in the mediterranean hydro climatic region exert major socio economic impacts gaume et al 2009 such events are preponderant in this area due to the convergence of relevant factors such as high mountain ranges close to the sea high intensity convective storms especially in autumn small catchments with sharply differentiated steep slopes sparse vegetation thin soils and permeable rocks marco 1995 in the western mediterranean recent studies have revealed a positive trend for extraordinary flash flood events for the 1900 2011 period llasat et al 2016 in fact according to the em dat database https www emdat be in the spanish mediterranean area there have occurred 4 of the 10 largest catastrophic flash floods events registered in that country for the period 1960 2019 in addition an intensification of torrential rain events in autumn is to be expected for this region due to climate change millán 2014 for this reason a process understanding is required for flash flood risk management because the dominant processes of the generation of runoff may change with the increase of storm severity borga et al 2011 within the framework of flood risk management one of the main studies supporting flood hazard assessment is that of flood frequency analysis it is related to the so called design flood estimation and can be defined as the value of the peak flow rate corresponding to an assigned non exceedance probability usually expressed in terms of return period stedinger et al 1993 in several cases the requirements are high return period flood quantiles to ensure maximum safety levels or a socially acceptable level of risk for example the flood directive european union 2007 establishes that the scenario of medium probability of flooding should have a return period greater than or equal to 100 years and higher for that of low probability of flooding spanish legislation establishes that the scenario for this low probability of flooding should correspond to a return period of 500 years españa 2010 in order to estimate high return period flood quantiles there are many methods that can be roughly grouped into the following 3 categories statistical or probabilistic deterministic and hybrid or mixed probabilistic methods are based on the existence of recorded data that characterises flooding at the point of interest its standard approach is based on the adjustment of a mathematical distribution function of probability to the sequence of maximum flows recorded at the site of interest and on the extrapolation of this function tail for very low exceedance probabilities klemeš 1993 within the deterministic group the most widely applied method is based on the use of event based rainfall runoff models where the return period of extreme precipitation design events is equivalent to those of the extreme flows generated by those events this is called the iso frequency hypothesis the hybrid or mixed group is based on the use of the above groups of methods either through their combination or by adding sources of information or techniques and they are generally referred to as derived flood frequency approaches despite the widespread use in engineering and mathematical refinements of the standard approach of the probabilistic methods there remains extensive debate regarding its high degree of uncertainty francés 1998 poses that this approach can give rise to highly variable results due to the uncertainty of the statistical model the data recording errors principally on large floods the high variance and asymmetry of the maximum flows and the length of the time series the latter constitutes the major issue since the extrapolation of short time series to estimate high return period flood quantiles may lead to major errors klemeš 1993 indeed flash floods very often occur in poorly instrumented or ungauged basins gaume et al 2009 which directly influences the method to be used in fact the length of the time series and the low density of monitoring stations constitute the main source of uncertainty and one of the main challenges to be faced in flood frequency analysis in arid semi arid regions metzger et al 2020 in the case of the standard approach of the deterministic methods there are among others three critical hypotheses according to rogger et al 2012 the choice of the design rainfall hyetograph the iso frequency hypothesis and the selection of initial soil moisture conditions ismc hereinafter previous to the flood generating storm among the so called hybrid or mixed methods is the pioneer work given by eagleson 1972 who introduced the concept of the derived frequency curve based on a simple outline of understanding the hydrological processes that generate a certain frequency of events using precipitation records and rainfall runoff models within this typology certain authors suggest that for flood frequency analysis continuous simulation approaches are preferable to those that are event based verhoest et al 2010 grimaldi et al 2012 lamb et al 2016 grimaldi et al 2021 as emphasised by grimaldi and petroselli 2015 event based approaches take advantage of the digital information and the computational power currently available which has positioned these approaches as an effective way to sidestep the problems inherent in widely used methods such as the rational formula however one of the main drawbacks of this approach involves the need to select the ismc prior to the storm which is one of the reasons that gives the continuous frameworks an advantage over those that are event based winter et al 2019 nevertheless as pointed out by astagneau et al 2021 common failure in predicting floods is still encountered due to seasonal model bias furthermore this approach cannot be generalised to all types of hydrological regimes such as ephemeral systems in mediterranean areas in which there are no flows for most of the year marco 1995 metzger et al 2020 and floods are sporadic boughton and droop 2003 in our experience moreover the current practical difficulties involved in implementing such weather generators should be considered beneyto et al 2020 beven 2021 as should to a lesser extent the computational time required for the long continuous sub daily simulations yu et al 2019 a way to reduce this computational time is given in grimaldi et al 2021 given the disadvantages of the aforementioned hydrological modelling practices for flood frequency analysis in mediterranean areas this paper proposes a hybrid approach following the combinatorial approach reasoning as laid out by klemeš 1993 the idea is to involve the main flood generation factors see section 3 1 in the probability through an innovative trivariate methodology see section 3 2 as grimaldi et al 2021 have underlined it could be a contradiction to use a complex approach in case studies without sufficient data for calibration and validation however the contribution of a process based approach such as the one in this paper is that frequency estimation is supported by the generation of pieces of information that take full advantage of the available digital information of the catchment scientific knowledge of the hydrological cycle and modelling tools existing today recent studies highlight both the potential and the challenges of process based approaches perez et al 2019 proposed an estimation of peak flow quantiles in iowa usa using representations of regional peak flow distributions derived from a combined framework of stochastic storm transposition radar rainfall observations and distributed hydrological modelling these authors point out that one of the aspects to be considered in future studies involves the development of representations of seasonally varying hydrological processes of a more realistic nature and their interaction within synthetic peak flow simulations in the same vein yu et al 2019 emphasise the advantages of using process based approaches for frequency analysis they draw attention however to the need to properly consider the effect of seasonality in two ways input variables and process variation within the modelling the effect of the structure of the hydrological model on flood analysis should also be borne in mind as has been pointed out in several studies zhu et al 2018 sun et al 2018 tarasova et al 2020 the spatial interaction between rainfall structure and soil moisture exerts significant impacts on the hydrological response to floods the use of lumped models may therefore introduce a limiting factor in the prediction in fact such an effect has been pointed out by astagneau et al 2021 as one of the possible reasons for the deficiencies found in their study of a large set of catchments in france in light of the above challenges identified in the literature this study presents an innovative contribution based on the identification of the main processes to be considered and a way to combine them statistically through a trivariate methodology see section 3 this is based on the exploitation of information generated from a multidimensional stochastic storm model and hybrid distributed hydrological modelling a continuous daily model to identify the predominant ismcs of registered flood events that considers their seasonality and an event based sub daily model to generate flood events using synthetic storms and the predominant ismcs in order to verify the validity of the proposed trivariate methodology it was applied in a representative case study in spain where a catastrophic flood occurred in the autumn of 2000 and where hydrometeorological data are available for the validation of the initial hypotheses see section 2 the rest of the paper is organised as follows the fourth section summarises the results obtained from the applied methodology the fifth section presents a discussion considering the findings achieved finally the sixth section presents the main conclusions 2 case study the rambla del poyo catchment is part of the jucar river basin authority confederación hidrográfica del júcar chj hereinafter this catchment is located in the region of valencia spain near the coast its principal channel flows in a northwest southeast direction into lake albufera see fig 1 for approximately 43 5 km as can be seen in fig 1 the lower part of the catchment is very close to the western side of the city of valencia where part of its metropolitan area including its international airport lies within the rambla del poyo floodplain the catchment area up to its mouth at lake albufera measures 430 km2 at the headwaters the slope is greater than 16 4 and in the floodplain the slope is less than 2 7 according to the lithostratigraphic and hydrogeological map of spain igme 2010 the catchment has the following characteristics i in the headwaters there are predominant carbonate formations of moderate to high permeability ii in the central part detritic formations of low permeability exist iii in the lower part there are quaternary detritic formations of moderate to low permeability and to a lesser extent carbonate formations of moderate to high permeability iv the principal channel flows from the head to the lower part through quaternary detritic formations of very high permeability according to the soil maps of the valencian region generalitat valenciana 1996 there is a variety of taxonomic units which can be grouped in accordance with level one of the fao legend in the following main categories leptosols and luvisols at the head calcisols in the central part and fluvisols luvisols and regosols on the floodplain according to the corine land cover map eea 2019 the catchment had the following coverage 10 urban areas 63 agricultural areas 23 shrubland 1 pine forests and 3 water bodies the climate in rambla del poyo is semi arid mediterranean with a mean annual rainfall of less than 500 mm and mean annual reference evapotranspiration of approximately 1 100 mm which results in an ephemeral river according to francés 1998 in the spanish mediterranean catchments there are two kinds of floods ordinary and extraordinary the ordinary floods are generated by the most frequent types of rainfall with low or medium convectivity which produces minor floods the extraordinary floods are less frequent but larger and are generated by heavy convective rainfall events occurring mainly during the autumn regarding the hydrometeorological data available for this catchment there are two sources of information one of these is from the network of the spanish meteorological agency agencia estatal de meteorología aemet http www aemet es with daily data available for the period 1951 2019 the other network is the automatic hydrological information system of the chj saih chj hereinafter http saih chj es chj saih with daily data available on flow and precipitation from 1988 to 2019 at the poyo station which has a sub catchment area of 184 km2 observed hydrographs of the maximum events that occurred in the period 1988 2012 are available in five minute time discretization 9 events with complete hydrometeorological data given the differences in spatial and temporal coverage of the available data the period to be considered for the hydrological modelling see section 3 2 2 is 1951 2012 for the daily resolution and 1988 2012 for the sub daily resolution 3 methodological framework in this paper a methodological framework is proposed based on the physically possible combinations of the principal characteristics involved in the behaviour of flash floods at the catchment scale and their integration using a multivariate statistical approach following klemeš 1993 this framework has two parts estimation of the magnitude of an event and estimation of its probability to this end the following flood generating processes and methods are considered in order to obtain the flood quantiles in the catchment under study 3 1 main factors affecting the hydrological response to flash floods floods are the result of numerous hydrological processes characterised by significant levels of spatial and temporal variability where the generating factors mainly depend on hydro climatic characteristics of the study area merz and blöschl 2008 the case study analysed herein rambla del poyo typically represents the predominant hydrological processes in small semi arid mediterranean catchments flash floods frequently take place in these types of catchments mainly during the autumn season merheb et al 2016 resulting from heavy precipitation events developed in mesoscale convective systems romero et al 1998 pastor et al 2010 as reported by peñarrocha et al 2002 several daily precipitation values over 800 mm have been recorded in the region where the case study is located runoff is mainly overland flow generated by infiltration excess however mixed generation mechanisms of runoff can also occur depending on the water retention capacity of the hillslopes and the ismc calvo cases et al 2003 it is particularly important to take this last issue into account in the modelling process in fact as highlighted by perrin and tournoud 2009 subsurface flow is sometimes ignored in flash flood analysis although flow registers show that hydrograph can continue for several hours or several days after the rain has actually stopped one of the key characteristics for the correct modelling of flash flood events in mediterranean regions is the space time variability of convective storm intensities as suggested by sangati et al 2009 an incorrect representation of the spatial variability of rainfall intensities can yield errors of up to 35 in peak flow predictions likewise these authors also found that such errors could be even larger in the case of dry ismc indeed ismc plays a fundamental role in the runoff generation processes since this condition controls infiltration capacity at the beginning of the storm several studies refer to the key influence of ismc on the flood processes in the mediterranean catchments e g marchi et al 2010 efstratiadis et al 2014 merheb et al 2016 mateo lázaro et al 2014 place the ismc as the most influential factor in the magnitude of flash floods produced by the same amount of rainfall these authors also remarked on the crucial role played by the temporal distribution of rainfall intensities on the hydrograph shape and magnitude of the flash floods in the valencian region of spain camarasa belmonte and segura beltrán 2001 found that the runoff coefficients in the ephemeral streams are highly variable and mainly depend on the rainfall intensity and the ismc finally the spatial variability of the geomorphological characteristics and the river channel network connectivity of the catchment have also been identified in the literature as decisive factors to suitably model flash flood response marchi et al 2010 mateo lázaro et al 2014 3 2 proposed trivariate methodology fig 2 shows a diagram of the sequence to follow in the methodological framework proposed in this paper solid lines indicate input data dashed lines are results which in turn serve as input in another task accordingly the proposed trivariate methodology needs the implementation of two models i a stochastic multidimensional sub daily model for the generation in space and time of convective storms ii a distributed rainfall runoff model to reproduce the existing spatial variability at two different temporal scales the first is a continuous model at daily time scale for the identification of the predominant ismcs of registered flood events while the second is an event based model at sub daily time scale to generate flood events using the synthetic storms and the predominant ismcs the trivariate methodology is made up of the following tasks a a storm frequency analysis based on regional records of the annual maximum of daily point precipitation in order to assign probabilities regarding the magnitude of the synthetic storms represented by the continuous random variable r the point rainfall daily equivalent b an ismc frequency analysis based on the results of the continuous model which is a discrete random variable denoted by h and finally c the estimation of the flood quantiles based on a trivariate statistical approach that takes into account the generated peak flows called x obtained in synthetic flood generation and the probability distribution function of both r and h 3 2 1 storm generator blazkov and beven 1997 pointed out the practical interest of using stochastic models to generate representative ensembles of storm events the aim is to obtain a wide range of storms suitably defined with a fine space time resolution in fact a significant number of major storms large return period t are required by the proposed methodology indeed such requirement is not possible to fulfil using only recorded historical events as there are only a few or none of such events available that can be associated to large t values therefore the strategy adopted in this research involves the generation of high resolution space time rainfall scenarios from a suitable stochastic rainfall model whereby certain internal features and statistics observed in the most intense rainfall events recorded in the study region are reproduced to this end the multidimensional stochastic model proposed by salsón and garcia bartual 2003 has been used the model proposed herein was specifically conceived to reproduce structural properties of torrential convective storms characteristic of the mediterranean regime consequently the rainfall field is conceptualised based on the description of convective cells which are known to be the most relevant features of these types of rainfall events moreover a suitable representation of these cells is crucial for the reproduction of the observed spatio temporal rainfall variability following previous modelling research lines rainfall intensity field results from the observed cellular structure associated with ensembles of rain cells waymire et al 1984 sivapalan and wood 1987 willems 2001 this family of poisson cluster based rainfall models which also include popular temporal rainfall models e g rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 cowpertwait 1991 velghe et al 1994 have been successfully applied in a wide range of practices for hydrological risk assessments for example in kim et al 2014 the identification parametrisation and shape description of rain cells has received major attention in a variety of experimental studies rigo and llasat 2004 peleg and morin 2012 in the proposed model the spatial location of the cell the time of birth and cell centre rainfall intensity are random variables while the individual cell intensities have a deterministic description accounting for the rain cell phases of growing maturing and gradual decay the maximum intensities occur in the centre of cells and are assumed to follow an exponential distribution rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 the validity of this hypothesis has also been proved in recent experimental studies goudenhoofdt et al 2017 for the case of the mediterranean coastal area where our case study is located the sample of maximum intensities corresponding to the 73 rainstorms reported in garcía bartual and andrés domenech 2017 is analysed fig 3 shows the frequency histogram of maximum intensities of the sample of rainstorms the exponential distribution shows a satisfactory agreement with the data further details of the model including analytical expressions for the covariance function for both the rainfall intensity and cumulative rainfall process can be found in salsón and garcia bartual 2003 3 2 2 distributed hydrological modelling büchele et al 2006 recommend the combined use of statistical theory with the knowledge of the characteristics of the hydrological processes resulting from the use of rainfall runoff models to reduce the levels of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of extreme values and to achieve reliable results in the case of mediterranean catchments the use of distributed hydrological models is convenient since it is possible to consider both the effect of the high spatial temporal variability of storms and the spatial variability of the catchment attributes that together shape the hydrological response in this paper the conceptual and distributed hydrological model tetis francés et al 2007 has been used for the establishment of the catchment water cycle this has proved to be robust for the representation of the main hydrological processes in the catchment under study bussi et al 2013 salazar et al 2012 tetis represents the spatial heterogeneity of the physical characteristics of a catchment by means of regular grid cells and their related model parameters the conceptualisation of the model is an interconnected three dimensional grid representing the main hydrological processes the basis of the calculation involves the estimation of the water balance for each cell and assumes that the water is distributed across six interconnected conceptual storage tanks plus a seventh tank representing the river channel when it exists in the cell in this way tetis considers the principal mechanisms of streamflow generation infiltration excess and saturation excess overland flow interflow and base flow resulting from groundwater discharge for the case study this paper proposes the following modelling strategy while keeping the continuous modelling advantages for ismc estimation with a broad temporal discretization a daily resolution the event based modelling approach is used with a much finer discretization ten minute resolution to reflect the high spatio temporal variability of flood generating storms in both cases the spatial discretization used in tetis is 100 m 3 2 3 flood quantile estimation through a trivariate statistical approach the problem to be solved involves the quantification of the marginal probabilities of the random variables of the flood generating processes storm magnitude and ismc represented by r and h respectively and subsequently its combination with the flood peak x based on a multivariate statistical approach as explained below 3 2 3 1 estimating the probabilities of synthetic storms this task refers to the estimation of the frequency of occurrence of each synthetic storm expressed in terms of return period it is clearly impossible to assign a single probability to the entire storm due to its intrinsic multivariate characteristics a practical procedure is therefore proposed for the reduction of a multidimensional synthetic storm to a single point rainfall daily equivalent r the exceedance probability of r and hence the corresponding return period can be obtained with an extreme value distribution previously adjusted to the observed annual maximum daily precipitation within the catchment of course in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with estimating probabilities the use of a regional frequency analysis is recommended a discussion of methods is given in svensson and jones 2010 3 2 3 2 estimating the probability of ismcs given that floods in mediterranean ephemeral systems are sporadic and mainly occur in autumn the ismc has been considered as a random variable h with a discrete probability distribution see an analysis into the influence of ismcs on flood frequency distribution in de michele and salvadori 2002 the results obtained from the implementation of the continuous hydrological model form the basis of the estimation of the frequency of h given a threshold for the daily discharge to select the flood events in this task it is also necessary to verify whether a statistically significant correlation exists between r and h in the case of rambla del poyo there is independence between these two random variables see section 4 4 for this reason this paper assumes independence between h and r in the trivariate flood frequency analysis 3 2 3 3 flood quantile estimation the methodology for the frequency analysis of the maximum flows x is based on the existence of a joint probability distribution function of x r the point rainfall daily equivalent of the synthetic storms and h the predominant ismc for significant floods as explained in the previous paragraphs it is possible to estimate the marginal distribution functions of r and h therefore the objective is to determine the marginal distribution function of x from a sample of each of which is conditional on given values of storm magnitude r and ismc h obtained with the simulations of the sub daily event based hydrological model by application of bayes theorem and if h and r are independent then the joint density function of the trivariate model can be expressed as 1 f x r h x r h j f x r h x r h j f r r π j where πj is the probability of h hj with j 1 m from the previous equation the marginal distribution of x is given by 2 f x x j 1 m π j 0 f x r h x u h j f r u d u the latter can be rewritten to be evaluated by intervals ri ri 1 as follows 3 f x x j 1 m π j i 0 r i r i 1 f x r h x u h j f r u d u according to lagrange s mean value theorem an approximation of the previous integral can be carried out in this way 4 f x x j 1 m π j i 0 f x r h x r i h j f r r i 1 f r r i where r is an intermediate point in the interval of integration finally the value of the continuous distribution function can in turn be approximated by a plotting position obtained from the sample of x values 5 f x x j 1 m π j i 0 n ij x n ij f r r i 1 f r r i where nij x is the number of observations less than or equal to x within the range ri ri 1 for the ismc hj and nij is the total number of observations under the same conditions 4 application of the methodology and results 4 1 synthetic storm generation thanks to the model formulation it is possible to verify its capability to reproduce observed empirical statistics of the historical records such as mean variance spatial correlation point rainfall temporal autocorrelation duration of the event maximum intensities distribution normalised mean function and total cumulative rainfall other statistics were also computed after the synthetic generation in order to verify the credibility of the generated events for instance derived synthetic intensity duration curves for every point of the spatial grid being essentially event oriented the outcome of the model consists of a number of independent synthetic rainfall events each of which is a continuous space time random field with rainfall intensity values defined with time resolution of 10 min and spatial resolution of 1 km2 this choice follows previous research on hydrological modelling in the studied catchment that considers the effect of the spatio temporal variability of storms on hydrological response guichard romero et al 2009 the estimation of model parameters follows the procedure proposed in salsón and garcia bartual 2003 at the regional scale in particular the method of moments is applied whereby the mean and variance of the accumulated total rainfall the spatial correlation function the temporal autocorrelation in selected rain gauges and the normalised mean function temporal evolution of cumulated rainfall normalised by total cumulative rainfall are all considered high resolution rainfall data from the regional automatic hydrological information system saih chj is used for parameter estimation fig 4 shows both the autocorrelation of the temporally averaged intensity process and the correlation of total depth based on the event that occurred in october 2000 which is the most extreme event recorded to date by the saih chj the stochastic rainfall model was employed for the generation of 100 synthetic storms this ensemble provides a wide range of space time rainfall intensity fields each of the synthetic events was carefully analysed to check its feasibility to this end several derived quantitative properties were checked including point and areal derived hyetographs intensity duration curves maximum intensities reached and maximum cumulative rainfall quantities consequently each of the generated synthetic events can provide an animation showing the evolution of the space time rainfall intensity field fig a1 in appendix a shows an example of the spatial evolution of the intensity field for the most intense 6 hour period in this example there are 4 storms with a similar r with its relative hydrological response at the gauging station see fig a2 as supplementary supporting material the animation sequence of the whole storm duration of appendix a is presented in appendix b thus the result of this modelling step was a representative and realistic collection of space time storms which serve as input for both synthetic flood generation and trivariate frequency analysis for the generated family the ten minute maximum cell intensity ranged from 26 to 95 mm h the spatial density of rain cell occurrence varied between 0 002 and 0 06 cells km2 the duration of the storms exhibited a large variation ranging from 1 5 h to 262 h finally the areal average rainfall depth among the different events generated also presented a significant variation ranging from 37 to 868 mm 4 2 implementation of the distributed hydrological model the effective parameters of the model were obtained following a separate structure see details in francés et al 2007 consisting of i maps of parameters estimated a priori based on all available spatial information and ii a correction factor for each parameter map in the calibration process only the correction factors were adjusted the suggestions of klemeš 1986 were followed for the calibration validation of the model in a split sample test a distinction between the modelling objectives of the different implemented temporal resolutions was made in order to accept each hydrological model the aim of the continuous model daily resolution is to obtain the ismc prior to flood events for this reason the acceptability criteria used were bias in volume pbias v the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr the aim of the event based model ten minute resolution is to obtain the hydrograph at the point of interest for each combination of synthetic storm and ismc in this case the acceptability criteria used were the nse and the rsr in addition the bias in peak flow pbias pf and time to peak bias tpmin were employed to check the behaviour of the hydrograph at its maximum value daily data on rainfall and maximum and minimum temperatures from the aemet network allowed the establishment of a continuous hydrological model for the period 1951 2012 however there has been only one flow gauge station located in the central part of the catchment since 1988 the data from october 1990 to september 2003 was used for automatic calibration with a short warm up period aquifer is not connected while the remaining data was used for validation october 2003 september 2012 the calibration showed a pbias v of 4 5 the nse was 0 85 and the rsr was 0 14 within the validation period the pbias v was 19 the nse was 0 64 and the rsr was 0 75 according to moriasi et al 2015 these results should be considered suitable to achieve their purpose the sample of ismcs the range of maximum annual events recorded at sub daily resolution by the saih chj was considered for the establishment of the event based model in all the events the ismc was taken from the proper date in the continuous modelling for the calibration the maximum recorded event of the available data the october 2000 event was used for this event the nse was 0 85 and the rsr 0 39 see fig 5 with a pbias pf of 9 and a pbias tpmin of 10 min the results of the model validation considering the remaining events with sub daily data for the 1988 2012 period 9 events in total considering the quality of the hydrometeorological records showed values of the nse index between 0 55 and 0 68 and between 0 57 and 0 69 for the rsr the pbias pf were between 18 and 35 and the bias tpmin were between 20 and 40 min considering the reference values suggested by moriasi et al 2015 the results in terms of nse and rsr in calibration and validation showed that the catchment model is acceptable for the established objective the sample of peak flows in all the simulated events the results showed that the predominating runoff generation mechanism is the infiltration excess overland flow rainfall exceeds infiltration capacity however in the case of large events such as the calibration event mixed generation mechanisms of runoff were found with additional mechanisms such as saturation excess overland flow and interflow 4 3 estimation of the exceedance probability of the magnitude of synthetic storms the magnitude of each multidimensional synthetic storm was represented by a single point rainfall daily equivalent r which can be obtained as the areal averaged maximum daily precipitation of the storm divided by the areal reduction factor of the catchment the magnitude of the synthetic storms r ranged from 37 to 670 mm a regional study at a national scale of the annual maximum daily precipitation recommended by the spanish authorities ministerio de fomento 2016 has been used to assign exceedance probabilities to the generated rs in this regional study the probability distribution function is the square root exponential type extreme distribution sqrt et max proposed by etoh et al 1987 see salas and fernández 2007 for a discussion on the relevance of the use of the sqrt et max distribution in the spanish mediterranean region from a regional frequency analysis point of view this distribution has two parameters which were obtained using i the coefficient of variation of the homogeneous region from the original regional study ferrer and ardiles 1995 and ii the local mean value obtained for this research from aemet data 1951 2012 period 4 4 estimation of the probability of ismc the predominant ismcs were obtained from the continuous hydrological modelling to this end the maximum annual flood events were located and their corresponding ismcs were then selected the ismc prior to each event was obtained from the tetis model state variable called relative soil moisture content which represents the quantity of capillary water contained in the upper part of the soil from wilting point 0 to field capacity 100 this variable has provided valuable information on the statistical behaviour of the iscms of floods over a long period of time see fig 6 fig 6 shows that for events occurring outside autumn ismcs must be greater than 40 this result is consistent with expected higher correlations between flood producing storms r outside autumn typically of low and medium convective nature and their ismcs h in contrast in autumn when flood generating storms generally occur with heavy convective rainfall events there is a high dispersion in the r and h relationship two rank correlation methods spearman spearman 1904 and kendall kendall 1938 were applied to verify whether a statistically significant correlation exists between r and h to consider the behaviour of the maximum storms observed during the seasons of the year these tests were carried out i for all events without seasonal distinction and ii by making a distinction between those events occurring in autumn and those occurring in other seasons it was established as a null hypothesis that rainfall is independent of the ismc this was verified to a 95 confidence interval if the entire sample is analysed without seasonal distinction the null hypothesis is rejected in both tests however making the seasonal distinction the independence between rainfall and the ismc is accepted in both correlation methods for autumn the focus in this case study a dry ismc and a wet ismc were established using the 40 needed for a significant flood out of autumn as the threshold the representative sample mean soil moisture content for these two states are 10 for dry and 70 for wet and their probability is 0 4 and 0 6 respectively horizontal lines in fig 6 4 5 flood quantiles estimation two hundred synthetic hydrographs were generated using the event based hydrological model with a combination of the one hundred synthetic storms and the two representative ismcs dry and wet as input data fig 7 shows the application of the trivariate plotting position given by eq 5 which refers to the location of the flow gauge station the quantiles are plotted with an empty red circle which is filled by two different colours to visualise dry orange filled and wet brown filled events the method has been validated by comparison with the standard statistical approach using all the observed annual maximum floods period from 1988 to 2019 in two ways with the plotting position of the observations following the compromise formula suggested by cunnane 1978 and the parametric best fit flood frequency distribution log pearson type iii lpiii using the maximum likelihood method for parameter estimation with its respective 90 confidence interval due to the relatively short length of the observations 42 years these comparisons are nonsensical for high return periods 5 discussion 5 1 on the limitations of the statistical approach as was previously explained in the introduction the standard approach of the statistical methods can lead to major errors among others due to the sample length as can be seen in fig 7 the plotting position of the observations show a plateau and a step change in slope because there is one extraordinary flood observed in the period 1988 2019 which also conditions the fitted lpiii distribution function fig 7 shows that for low return periods quantiles less than 10 years the slopes of the frequency curve of the statistical methods and the trivariate method are similar for flood quantiles between 10 and 100 years the lpiii smooths the actual behaviour of the catchment represented by a plateau followed by a step change in the observed plotting position probabilities and a lower slope in the trivariate method for the estimation of floods with a high return period the use of the best distribution function adjusted to the observed data results in a wide range of uncertainty grey dashed line in fig 7 this result reflects the limitations of using a standard statistical method when extrapolating extreme values outside the length of the observed period in fact in the case of catchments with flash flood regimes with high sample variability such as those in the mediterranean this is the main limitation as these are usually ungauged or have short time series and poor spatial representativeness gaume et al 2009 metzger et al 2020 as in our case study the plateau followed by a step change in the plotting position of the observations and the lower slope in the trivariate method is likely to be reflecting the threshold effect and the non linear behaviour typical of mediterranean catchments salinas et al 2013 where there are two types of flood populations ordinary and extraordinary according to francés 1998 in the ordinary floods the main runoff type is overland flow in the extraordinary floods there are mixed processes of runoff generation for the extraordinary flood recorded in the case study october 2000 shown in fig 5 hydrological modelling has shown that the peak flow was produced by mixed runoff generation mechanisms as has also been found in other studies see calvo cases et al 2003 these characteristics non linearity threshold effect two flood populations which cannot be properly considered with the statistical method can be integrated with a method based on the understanding of the main factors affecting floods such as that proposed in this paper in fig 7 it can be observed that with the trivariate plotting position the step change of the observed plotting positions is replaced by a curve with a change of slope that could be reflecting the different combinations of flood generation processes 5 2 on the critical hypotheses of the deterministic approach as was also previously mentioned the standard approach of the deterministic methods has three critical hypotheses related to the storm spatio temporal characteristics its ismc and the iso frequency assumption the combination of different spatio temporal characteristics of the storms with a similar magnitude represented as point rainfall daily equivalent r and their ismc in the hydrological response to floods represented as maximum flow x is illustrated in fig 8 in this figure the maximum peak discharge obtained with a totally dry ismc at wilting point can be up to four times higher for other storms with similar magnitude but with different spatio temporal characteristics even for those with the same ismc such variability considered in stochastic storm modelling can only be exploited with a distributed hydrological model as proposed in this paper this variability is therefore likely to influence the favouring of one or more runoff generation mechanisms the total or partial saturation of the drainage area and or the contribution to the magnification of the maximum peak discharge by the synchronisation of the tributary response as has been pointed out in other studies see perez et al 2019 a combination of tools such as those used in the present study has a high value in frequency analysis since it has the ability to explicitly incorporate the physical interaction between rainfall land surface subsoil and drainage network in contrast approaches using lumped models have shown that this can constitute a limiting factor for a suitable representation of flood behaviour astagneau et al 2021 by considering the entire physically feasible range of ismcs from wilting point to field capacity there is an increase in the dispersion of the r x relationship as can be observed in fig 8 for storms with a similar depth it is possible to obtain maximum flows with differences ranging from one time up to one order of magnitude see in section 5 3 how this effect is transferred in the flood frequency curve for example note that for a value of r of approximately 80 mm 5 mm it is possible to obtain a range of maximum flows between 4 and 51 m3 s while for a value of r of approximately 205 mm 5 mm there is a range of maximum flows between 89 and 880 m3 s see the example of the spatio temporal variability of these storms and their hydrological response in appendix a and see the animated sequence for these storms in appendix b the spatio temporal variability of the storm characteristics combined with different ismc therefore clearly influence the response of the catchment and cannot be neglected in a hydrological analysis that supports flood frequency estimations concerning the iso frequency hypothesis fig 9 compares the storm magnitude r return period and its related flood peak x return period obtained with the trivariate analysis for each extreme ismc wilting point and field capacity fig 9 shows a very high dispersion log scale with differences up to two orders of magnitude between the rainfall and flood return periods for example note that for a storm magnitude with a return period of approximately 100 years 10 years it is possible to obtain a range of flood return periods between 6 and almost 420 years conversely for floods with return periods of approximately 100 years 10 years there are associated storm return periods between 15 and more than 1000 years as viglione et al 2009 analytically demonstrated the relationship between the return period of both the maximum flow and its generating storm depends strongly on the ismc and can reach a difference of between two to three orders of magnitude as bocchiola and rosso 2009 stated the iso frequency hypothesis is non realistic because no univocal relationship exists between a given flood return period and the generating storm as was demonstrated in fig 9 again this relationship depends on the convergence of factors considered in this paper such as the influence of the spatio temporal characteristics of the storm and its ismc on the hydrological response by considering these results in relation with the fundamental hypotheses of the standard deterministic approach in frequency estimations it has been demonstrated that its use would be inappropriate in the analysed case study and also probably in all catchments similar to those found in the mediterranean in this respect an alternative method based on the main mechanisms that generate floods as proposed in this paper is justified 5 3 sensitivity of the trivariate approach to ismc in order to quantify the effect of the initial soil moisture on the behaviour of the flood quantiles the two extreme states of ismc wilting point and field capacity have been considered as approximate lower and upper bounds of the trivariate plotting position in fig 10 the plotting positions for each state were estimated following eq 5 these bounds reflect the physical limits imposed by the extreme ismc on the hydrological response that is it is a way to introduce information regarding the feasible range of flood quantiles that consider the effect of ismc the same approach can be used if other sources of uncertainty are known e g storm characteristic representations storm return period assignment input data and both the structure and parametrisation of the hydrological model since these form the basis for the estimation of the associated uncertainty to the frequency analysis this last issue was not considered since it falls outside the scope of this paper however other similar process based approaches to that proposed by perez et al 2019 have already made progress in the quantification of error components stemming from epistemic assumptions the parameter estimation method the sample size and in the regional approaches the number of pooled sites for the specific case of uncertainty in hydrological models see moges et al 2020 5 4 practical considerations in this paper the advantages of continuous modelling were maintained to describe the ismc prior to maximum flows at a daily scale for a long period and subsequently to lend support to its frequency analysis with a physical basis at the same time event based distributed modelling was established to reflect the predominant hydrological processes associated with the typology of flash floods as boughton and droop 2003 mentioned due to the existence of isolated extreme events in ephemeral systems which are typical of semi arid areas as in the case study of this paper sub daily continuous modelling is not the most advantageous if we consider the computational cost of hydrological modelling in the aforementioned systems where high temporal and spatial resolutions need to be considered to properly capture flash flood processes the applicability of such modelling strategy may be restrictive for practical purposes li et al 2014 showed that a hybrid approach based on both event based and continuous hydrological models provides estimates of the flood frequency distribution with an accuracy similar to that of the continuous simulation approach but with a dramatically reduced computational time in both cases continuous and event based modelling the challenge is to improve the performance of the model by reducing uncertainty in the input data model structure and parametrisation garavaglia et al 2017 bárdossy et al 2020 moges et al 2021 as well as improving the strategies used for the validation of the initial hypotheses arsenault et al 2018 in the present study the model has been shown to be robust given the performance in the validation process in particular the model is able to reproduce the peak flows as a synthesis of the main dominant processes however for the evaluation of the model performance it was only possible to consider 9 events out of the total number of events for the period 1988 2012 given the quality of the sub daily hydrometeorological records for these events the pbias pf were less than 35 and the bias tpmin were less than 40 min in any case considering that this is a real case it can be stated that the sub daily model will suitably reproduce the flood generation mechanisms the results of the 200 hydrological simulations were obtained from one hundred synthetic storms with two representative ismcs in the set of 200 simulated events we include the entire range of observed rainfall quantities as well as the predominant iscm values as was previously mentioned r ranges from 37 to 670 mm which is in line with what is observed in the region for convective storms see peñarrocha et al 2002 furthermore the ten minute maximum cell intensity of this family of storms ranging from 26 to 95 mm h is in the most observed ranges of historical storms as shown in the histogram in fig 3 in the case of predominant ismcs these were obtained from a continuous hydrological catchment model validated with observed daily data this case study used two predominant ismcs although eq 5 does allow any number thereof in this vein it is possible to obtain relevant information on the physics of the phenomena involved by considering the flood generating mechanisms in the catchment of interest klemeš 1993 and by following an integrated storm and hydrological modelling strategy as proposed in this paper although there are studies suggesting the use of copulas in multivariate event based analysis candela et al 2014 that approach can have practical limitations due to its need for large temporal series of discharges this is the case of flash floods which often occur in poorly instrumented or ungauged basins gaume et al 2009 as found in the case study presented in this paper as tong et al 2015 concluded the accuracy of copula models depends on the data length and this also exerts a negative effect on the marginals which is an important factor when using a copula model to perform bivariate analysis therefore a multivariate approach such as that presented herein has a high potential for application in the case of ungauged catchments or catchments with short flow records it should be underlined that the proposed approach in this paper is a way to advance in a flood frequency hydrology framework by expanding causal information through the incorporation of the principal dominant hydrological processes in flood generation merz and blöschl 2008 this paper does not combine independent data sources such as systematic at site records and maximum flows obtained from hydrological modelling that information however could be integrated through bayesian approaches such as that proposed by viglione et al 2013 when it is necessary to estimate high return flood quantiles in ungauged catchments or in changing conditions e g storm severity or land use the present methodology is useful thanks to the use of a multidimensional storm generator which can incorporate changes in the severity of storms and a distributed hydrological model which can incorporate changes in both the storm characteristics and land uses this kind of process based approach provides a meaningful pathway towards understanding current and future flood frequency in non stationary conditions and can therefore be valuable in supplementing existing practices yu et al 2019 for these cases the hydrological model can be established using one of the methods proposed by rosbjerg et al 2013 and its evaluation is made possible by applying a proxy basin test or a differential split sample test following klemeš 1986 recalling rogger et al 2012 the selection of the appropriate method for estimating flood quantiles should consider the strengths and weaknesses of the different applicable methods in the present study it has been shown that the widely used standard probabilistic and deterministic methods contain a series of weaknesses that would be transferable into results with high uncertainty for decision making e g a flood risk management plan ultimately changes in the flood frequency curve are a consequence of the changes in the runoff generation processes sivapalan et al 1990 which cannot be adequately reflected by means of the standard approaches of frequency analysis indeed it poses a major challenge when the availability of hydrometeorological records is a limiting factor in understanding the underlying processes associated with flash floods as is the case of the mediterranean area in the trivariate methodology proposed in this paper it is possible to explicitly consider the influence in the upper tail of the distribution function of physical characteristics that impose upper limits such as the spatio temporal variability of storms soil saturation of the whole catchment and the activation of mixed runoff generation processes as was concluded by klemeš 1993 6 conclusions the integrated use of stochastic modelling of convective storms with distributed hydrological modelling at different time resolutions has enabled high return period flood quantiles to be estimated by considering the main flood generating processes involved the rambla del poyo has been used as a representative case study of the hydrological response in semi arid mediterranean catchments on this basis it has been possible to consider the principal flood generation mechanisms and their probability distribution functions through a trivariate flood frequency analysis this approach is based on the consideration of the spatio temporal behaviour of the typical storms of the region studied through the multidimensional stochastic generation of storms of a convective nature the statistical analysis of their magnitude should be carried out through the selection of an appropriate random variable point rainfall daily equivalent and the application of a regional annual maximum daily rainfall frequency study the trivariate methodology also considers the spatial heterogeneity of the catchment physical support through a distributed hydrological model and the effect of the ismc on the processes of flood generation where the ismc has been contemplated as a random variable with a discrete probability distribution with this approach it is possible to reduce computational cost using a catchment distributed hydrological model for two reasons continuous simulation at daily time step for ismc analysis and event based simulation at sub daily time step for hydrograph generation using a wide range in magnitude and spatio temporal characteristics but limited in number of synthetic storms this paper has demonstrated that the use of probabilistic as well as deterministic standard approaches for flood quantile estimations of high return periods are not suitable in semi arid mediterranean catchments such as the rambla del poyo in the hydro climatic region of the case study there are determinant factors that must be considered these factors include the high intrinsic non linearity existing in the rainfall runoff relationship the effect of the ismc on the response of the catchment in an extreme event the spatial heterogeneity of the physical characteristics of the catchment and the high spatio temporal variability of the flood generating storms hence the joint use of stochastic modelling of storms with distributed hydrological modelling on different temporal scales has been shown to possess great potential to support flood frequency analysis using the proposed trivariate methodology with this approach it is also possible to integrate various pieces of information obtained with a physical basis considering the inherent characteristics of the flash floods in the spanish mediterranean area although the methodology proposed in this paper has been tested in one case study as a proof of concept it can be extended to other cases for at least the following four main reasons first it is based on the analysis of the predominant flood generation mechanisms of the catchment under study but also considers its regional hydro climatic context second it is useful for high return period flood quantile estimations especially in practical applications where it is necessary to generate information due to the lack or poor availability of hydro climatic data or to changing conditions the trivariate methodology provides an expansion of information based on the causes of the phenomenon under analysis third in the case of the existence of a flow gauge station at any point of the catchment it is possible to validate this methodology for low return periods at this station thereby increasing its feasibility in the extrapolation for high return periods moreover if a hydrological distributed model is used then it is possible to obtain flood quantiles at any point of interest within the catchment or modelling area by always considering the spatial variability of storms and catchment attributes finally the use of a hybrid hydrological modelling strategy based on both continuous and event based models limits the computational cost while allowing a better representation of the high spatial temporal

3942,an efficient underground reservoir management requires reliable hydrogeological parameters such as infiltration coefficient percolation rate and specific yield sy values the cross well pumping test is a well known method for determining sy but different unsaturated flow models can lead to various sy results heterogeneity in unsaturated and saturated zones can restrict well dependent methods in estimating these parameters on a regional scale for which an alternative gravity based method is attempted in this study we established an absolute gravity site at the wanlong primary school wlps near a recharge lake an artificial lake in the pingtung plain and collected 1 5 years of gravity data in 2019 2020 around a monsoonal rain event in late may 2020 gravity values underwent three stages of changes the first stage experienced a rapid gravity rise of 18 μgal from infiltrated rain followed by stable gravity values in the second stage when the infiltrated rain recharged the aquifer and the third stage showed a persistent gravity increase with rising groundwater level the gravity based estimate of infiltration coefficient is 0 84 0 14 and the percolation rate is about 15 m day suggesting that wlps is over a high infiltration region a depth dependent sy profile up to 30 m depth was constructed using gravity and groundwater data in the dry season it was found that sy values are higher at the aquifer depths of 22 28 m than in the shallow part however some sy values determined in the wet seasons are overestimated due to high soil water content swc changes which induced particularly large gravity changes in the 30 m unsaturated zone of wlps when the wet season started this study confirms the advantage of using high precise gravity measurements at one μgal level and hydrology records for regional hydrogeological parameter estimation keywords gravity change infiltration coefficient percolation rate pingtung specific yield unsaturated zone 1 introduction taiwan often suffers from water shortage due to its rugged topography uneven rain distributions and short rivers that cannot hold surface water for a sufficiently long time the agriculture and semiconductor industries in taiwan require a large amount of water supplying enough water for industries and municipal uses has been a constant attention and study issue in taiwan constructing a new surface reservoir in taiwan is increasingly difficult due to its unfavorable environmental and social impacts instead an underground reservoir can substitute a dam for water supply and is a more cost effective water resource than a surface dam hung et al 2021 an ideal underground reservoir can be perched in a flood plain composed of unconsolidated sand and gravel with highly fluctuating water tables that signal abundant groundwater the excess groundwater in rainy seasons in such a reservoir compensates for the water shortage in dry seasons if this reservoir is connected to the aquifer below a land subsidence hit region raising its groundwater level can reduce land subsidence and seawater intrusion for example the pingtung plain in southern taiwan contains a large aquifer system stretching from pingtung s interior to its coastal area which has been experiencing land subsidence caused by excessive pumping for uses in agriculture and aquaculture shih et al 2019 tran and wang 2020 vu et al 2021 in response to the threat of land subsidence the water resource agency wra of taiwan launched the artificial recharge of groundwater project argp to construct a recharge lake at the flood plain of the linbian river which is part of the pingtung plain the objective of argp is to raise the groundwater level at the distal plain of the linbian river where land subsidence is the most severe ting et al 2020 in may 2018 the first phase of argp was completed and part of the recharge lake was constructed and operational in the subsequent phases the recharge lake will be extended to surrounding areas with a high infiltration potential however it is time consuming to gain the whole picture over a kilometer scale region using infiltration tests that can reach only several meters below the ground surface izbicki et al 2008 the spatial scaling problem in an unsaturated zone is the same as that of specific yields sy determined by cross well pumping tests in a saturated zone for instance chen et al 2010 showed that sy values could vary with orientations and depths over an area of 100 100 m2 around the pumping test site around the cape cod pumping test site the sy values from the 20 observation wells were quite different moench 1994 yeh and huang 2009 these studies suggested that the heterogeneity in unsaturated and saturated zones can introduce large uncertainties in the results from infiltration and pumping tests using point data a sy value can also be dependent on the well actually used in a test as an alternative ground based gravimetry can be used to investigate regional hydrogeology gravity changes at a site reflect mass changes at a relatively large areal scale than a pumping test satellite based gravimetry such as gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its follow on mission can also be used for hydrogeological investigation but it reflects water storage change in hundreds of km feng et al 2013 frappart and ramillien 2018 scanlon et al 2012 specifically ground based gravimetry meets regional water management requirements on a scale of several hundreds of m chen et al 2020 pool 2008 van camp et al 2017 montgomery 1971 first demonstrated estimating water storage change using a ground based gravimeter several ensuing studies have shown that the gravity based method can determine regional sy values chen et al 2020 christiansen et al 2011 gehman et al 2009 howle et al 2003 leirião et al 2009 pool and eychaner 1995 different types of gravimeters have been used in various hydrological studies depending on expected gravity changes superconducting gravimeters the most precise relative gravimeter with a nominal resolution of 0 1 μgal are often used to detect gravity changes with magnitudes of a few μgals induced by soil moisture changes creutzfeldt et al 2010a kazama and okubo 2009 krause et al 2009 naujoks et al 2010 reich et al 2019 absolute gravimeters with 1 μgal resolution are suitable for detecting gravity changes with magnitudes of several to tens of μgals such as determining a high precision sy estimation in a regional aquifer chen et al 2018 chen et al 2020 both absolute and relative gravimeters have been used to detect gravity changes due to artificial recharge and flash flows kennedy et al 2016 kennedy et al 2017 watlet et al 2020 a precise estimation of underground reservoir storage relies on precise sy values for the entire reservoir it is often assumed that sy is a constant value at a specific depth range of an unconfined aquifer in reality sy values might vary with the grain sizes in the sediments and therefore vary with depths to acquire the sy values at different depths around a pumping test site one could collect data at nearby wells that have different ranges of depths however the variations in the estimated sy can be caused by differences in the unsaturated models used in the pumping test or by the depth dependent heterogeneity of the underlying aquifer or both lin et al 2019 malama 2011 moench 1997 neuman 1974 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 yeh and huang 2009 most transient sy studies focus on thin unsaturated zones with water table fluctuations of less than 2 m cheng et al 2020 in comparison there are few studies on sy over aquifers with highly fluctuating water tables on the other hand gravity changes associated with groundwater level changes over different ranges of depths can be used to determine depth dependent sy values over the aquifer where the gravity measurements are made in addition to the need of depth dependent sy values for estimating precise reservoir storage an extended recharge lake in argp also requires that the lake is over a region with a high infiltration potential this requirement can be examined by absolute gravimetry because a heavy rain will create a rapid gravity change in a high infiltration rate region that is gravimetry can be a tool to assess a candidate site for a recharge lake before it is constructed this study aims to show that gravity measurements from a fg 5 absolute gravimeter can be used to determine regional depth dependent sy values and validate the high infiltration rate region near the existing argp recharge lake we set up an absolute gravity site at a spare room at the wanlong elementary school near the lake to measure time lapse absolute gravity values and continuous soil moisture for 1 5 years a large rain event at the end of the dry season in may 2020 allowed us to investigate the process of infiltration using hourly gravity measurements abundant gravity measurements in 1 5 years result in many sy values that allow us to determine sy values as a function of depth we eventually discuss the sy values determined in the wet seasons compared to those in the dry seasons 2 the hydrogeology at the gravity site and around the recharge lake the gravity site is located at the wanlong primary school wlps in the wanlong village near the linbian river in southern pingtung plain taiwan fig 1 a the hydrogeological profile across the wlps and the linbian plain suggests that the linbian plain is composed mainly of gravel and sand fig 1b in 1995 the wra of taiwan constructed two groundwater monitoring wells screened at the depths of 42 66 m and 144 168 m on the campus of wlps fig 2 a the coordinates and elevation of the two wlps monitoring wells are about 22 508 n 120 588 e and 46 38 m the wra has been maintaining the monitoring wells and collecting hourly water levels since 1993 generally monthly groundwater levels in the two monitoring wells fluctuated from 16 to 31 m below land surface the highly coherent water level changes at the two wells indicate that the thickness of the unconfined aquifer at wanlong is larger than 168 m at a nearby weather station xinpi which is 4 5 km south of wlps annual precipitation ranges from 1693 to 3584 mm from 2013 to 2020 on average 90 of rain occurred between may and september from october to the next april rain decreases steadily along with groundwater levels to verify the groundwater storage potential of the aquifer around wanlong the central geological survey of taiwan conducted a cross well pumping test at wlps on 27 may 2012 at the depths of 42 66 m the results are sy 0 124 and transmissivity t 16 63 m2 min as shown in fig 2b another pumping test was conducted on 16 july 2019 at the silin primary school located 4 5 km north of wlps both tests obtain similar sy values 0 124 and 0 110 the large sy and transmissivity values along with highly fluctuating groundwater levels indicate that the aquifer at the linbian plain has a large storage potential before constructing the arpg recharge lake several infiltration tests were conducted around the linbian plain simulations of an infiltration pond showed that groundwater levels observed in the nearby wells to the pond became stable after 47 h of consistent infiltration but the results in different wells were affected by local permeabilities hsieh et al 2010 at the same site of hsieh et al 2010 field tests showed that the average infiltration rates range from 7 15 to 22 76 m day under different scenarios tu et al 2010 more details about argp were shown in ting et al 2020 the high infiltration rate and high storage potential from these studies suggest that the region near wanlong is an ideal site for establishing an artificial recharge lake however it was recommended that a regional scale hydrogeological investigation around the current recharge lake needs to be expanded in coverage and location before extending the current recharge lake this study uses a gravity based method for such regional investigations 3 gravimeter setup and operation considering groundwater induced gravity changes the high groundwater level fluctuations at wlps provide us with the opportunity to establish a vertical profile of sy using measured changes in gravity and water level the annual change of the water levels at the wells could exceed 15 m spanning from the late wet season to the dry season which corresponds to a gravity change of 78 μgal using the bouguer plate model chen et al 2020 pool 2008 and a sy value of 0 124 a 78 μgal gravity change is 5 20 times larger than those recorded in the choushui river alluvial fan where annual groundwater level changes are typically between 0 5 and 5 m chen et al 2020 and at the gravity sites where gravity changes were used to study the geodynamic process around taiwan and its offshore islands kao et al 2017 the high groundwater level fluctuations at wlps motivate us to establish a vertical profile of sy using measured changes in gravity and water level as such we used a spare room at wlps to set up a temporary gravity observatory fig 3 a where a fg5 gravimeter serial no 231 was installed to collect absolute gravity values for 1 5 years in addition we installed four soil moisture meters to acquire the volumetric soil water content swc at 10 m from the fg5 at the depths of 5 20 40 60 cm the raw swc was recorded at 15 min intervals by the em50 data logger fig 3b and 3c the wlps site is quiet with a stable power supply for the gravimeter and the air conditioning system at a quiet site like wlps mean absolute gravity values can have a precision of 1 μgal if appropriate environmental gravity corrections are applied to the raw fg5 measurements in this study the raw gravity measurements were corrected for the effects of solid earth tides ocean tide and its loading polar motion and atmospheric pressure change using the computer programs and models in our previous studies hwang et al 2009 kao et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the continuous gps measurements at njou fig 1a located 1 8 km west of wlps show that the average rate of vertical displacements at wlps was 0 6 mm yr corresponding to a 0 1 μgal yr gravity change rate which is negligible in this study it is known that ground vibrations high temperatures and humidity changes will affect the stability of fg5 measurements chen et al 2018 van camp et al 2017 wlps is located in a tropical area and the temperature could reach 40 c in the summer thus we installed an air conditioner to maintain the room temperature at 25 c and humidity at 60 at the wlps gravity site using the internet we remotely controlled the fg5 gravimeter from hsinchu where the research team is located and is 260 km away from wlps this remote control reduced the cost of traveling and man made vibrations during gravity measurements in addition we adjusted and maintained the fg 5 gravimeter manually two times a month and right after a major earthquake significant tilts were corrected when maintaining the fg 5 we used different gravity measurement intervals to acquire absolute gravity values depending on the precision requirement and expected groundwater change rate the intervals range from hours to days typically the fg5 gravimeter finishes 100 repeated free falling drops gravity measurements in 10 min we then averaged the 100 gravity measurements to obtain a gravity value in a set we determined daily gravity values averaged over 15 20 h of set values from the raw gravity measurements at regular times however daily gravity values were not measured every day for example only about 8 to 10 gravity values were measured in a month in the two dry seasons in this study in principle at least one daily value was acquired for a week except during the periods when the gravimeter was moved elsewhere to collect data we determined hourly gravity values for some of the particular heavy rain events each based on the average of 2 6 sets of gravity values the historical data at wlps monitoring wells show that the rates of groundwater level change reached 60 80 cm day after heavy rains corresponding to rates of gravity change of 3 4 μgal day sy 0 124 thus hourly absolute gravity values are necessary for capturing the gravity signals caused by the rapid mass changes around a rain event however the standard deviations precisions from 100 drops a set of the hourly gravity values are about 2 3 μgal compared to a typical 1 μgal standard deviation for daily gravity values this arrangement of measuring frequencies during heavy rain events and regular times helped to minimize wear on the fg5 gravimeter while obtaining gravity values with best possible precisions 4 results 4 1 gravity changes and hydrology records at wlps in 1 5 years the ag observations groundwater levels and swc records collected at wlps lasted for 1 5 years since may 2019 fig 4 the first absolute gravity value is 978777882 0 9 μgal at wlps measured on 9 may 2019 and all the gravity changes are relative to this first measurement fig 4 in total we measured 160 daily absolute gravity values and numerous hourly gravity values during heavy rain events the highest absolute gravity value was measured on 25 august 2019 during a heavy rain event and the lowest absolute gravity value was measured on 4 may 2019 before the monsoonal rain started on 20 may 2020 the range of gravity values was 135 μgal and gravity values mainly fluctuated with groundwater level changes typically gravity changes were about 5 to 30 μgal for groundwater level variations of 1 to 5 m for an average sy of 0 15 in an unconfined aquifer on the contrary gravity changes associated with groundwater changes in a confined aquifer usually are less than 3 μgal annually in our experiences in taiwan hence the groundwater induced gravity changes recorded at wlps were the largest among the gravity values we have recorded in taiwan since 2004 fig 4 suggests that precipitations dominate the trends in the four depths of swc and groundwater levels the wet season from may to september experienced several significant rain events and typhoons at wlps typically few days of rain in mid may can reverse the declining trend of groundwater level the elevation relative to sea level of groundwater level was the lowest at 15 75 m depth 30 63 m on 21 may 2020 and the level started to increase because of a heavy rain furthermore the rates of rising groundwater levels depend on the intensities and sustaining times of rains the groundwater level reached a maximum of 38 40 m on 26 august 2019 due to a cumulative precipitation of 1859 mm from may to august 2019 fig 4 in comparison the highest groundwater level was 33 14 m on 12 september 2020 because the cumulative precipitation was only 943 mm from may to september 2020 there were several data gaps in the swc records due to technical problems such as power shortages or malfunctions of the meters because of a budget problem we removed the soil meters on 26 august 2020 despite the problems in the swc records the usable records show that swc at all depths changed immediately with rain infiltrations more discussions about the influences of swc on our results will be presented in later sections 4 2 infiltration coefficient and percolation rate to achieve the best effectiveness of artificial recharge by a surface dam since the 1990 s the wra of taiwan has been looking for a region around the pingtung plain where the infiltration coefficient and percolation rate are high in this study a rain event in late may 2020 allows us to estimate a preliminary infiltration coefficient and percolation rate using gravity measurements and hydrology records in 2020 the first monsoonal rain event around wlps occurred on 21 may after a 6 month dry period on 21 may 2020 alone the cumulative precipitation was 72 mm fig 5 starting from 3 00 on 22 may 2020 a persistent rain lasted for 21 h at an average precipitation rate of 20 mm hr the most intensive precipitation rate was 55 mm hr and the cumulative precipitation was 397 mm in 24 hr since 3 00 on 22 may 2020 after this persistent rain there was no rain for 3 5 days followed by another intensive rain that occurred since 23 00 on 26 may 2020 and lasted for 10 h resulting in a cumulative precipitation of 178 mm the data from the soil moisture meters show that the fluctuations of swc at the depths of 5 40 and 60 cm almost coincided with rainfalls on average swc was between 0 19 and 0 25 at the depth of 5 cm the largest swc changes occurred at the depth of 40 cm ranging from 0 18 to 0 32 at the lowest depth of 60 cm the variations in swc are relatively small ranging from 0 20 to 0 24 because our swc data are only up to the depth of 60 cm it is not clear how swc varied between the depths of 60 cm and 30 62 m the water table in the unsaturated zone fig 5a shows that the groundwater levels stayed almost at 15 76 m from 19 to 22 may 2020 despite the heavy rain on 22 may 2020 on 23 may 2020 the groundwater levels increased at a rate of 0 5 cm hr before 12 00 and at 1 0 cm hr from 12 00 to 24 00 since 24 may 2020 the groundwater levels increased at an average rate of 56 cm day through 28 may 2020 there was another heavy rain on 27 may 2020 which increased the rising rate of groundwater level to 77 cm day and the rate was decelerated to 65 cm day from 31 may 2020 onward as shown in fig 4 and fig 5a the groundwater level at wlps increased rapidly for another ten days due to this monsoonal rain event the gravity values increased by 45 μgal from 20 may to 1 june 2020 during this period we used the gravity measurements at 30 minute intervals to identify the rapid gravity changes during the rain events unlike the steady increase of groundwater levels the gravity values during the monsoonal rain in late may 2020 underwent three stages of changes a rapid rise rising stage followed by nearly zero changes for 2 days steady stage and finally a gentle rise consistent with the rise of groundwater level growing stage before the monsoonal rain event we measured the gravity values from 19 to 20 may 2020 to obtain a base gravity value which is 978777864 2 1 3 μgal obtained by averaging the hourly measurements in this period during the rapid rising stage from 08 00 21 may to 08 00 23 may 2020 the gravity values increased by 18 3 μgal relative to the base value at a rate of 9 μgal day in this stage the heavy rain on 21 may 2020 induced a 3 μgal gravity change and the maximum rain on 22 may 2020 induced a change of 15 μgal compared to the rapid fluctuations in swc groundwater levels experienced little changes and rose by only 7 cm at 08 00 on 23 may 2020 relative to the water level of 15 76 m before the rising stage the relation between gravity change and groundwater change in an unconfined aquifer can be approximated using the bouguer plate model horizontal infinite slab approximation as chen et al 2018 1 δ g 41 9 s y δ h where δ g is gravity change in µgal and δ h is groundwater change in m thus if sy 0 14 and the groundwater level change is 0 07 m the resulting gravity change is δ g 0 4 μgal which is smaller than a typical standard deviation of gravity measurement one μgal therefore the 18 μgal gravity increase in the rising stage is mainly due to the infiltrated rain in the unsaturated zone fig 5b shows the potential soil water movements and recharges of groundwater in the three stages the measured gravity changes in the three stages can be used to estimate a preliminary infiltration coefficient and percolation rate around the unsaturated zone near wlps as follows 1 infiltration coefficient the rapid gravity rise in the rising stage was caused by the fast and steadily accumulated infiltrated rainfall held in the unsaturated zone at the end of the dry season the gravity change and the cumulative rainfall collected from 10 00 19 may to 08 00 23 may 2020 are used to estimate the infiltration coefficient over a period as 2 q c r where q is the infiltrated rainfall c is the infiltration coefficient and r is the total rainfall from the rain gauge the infiltrated rainfall can be determined from gravity change also using the bouguer plate model as 3 q δ g 2 π g ρ w 23 86 δ g where q is in mm δ g is gravity change in µgal g is the gravitational constant and ρ w is the density of water in fact q in eq 3 is the equivalent water height ewh due to the mass of the retained water in the unsaturated zone without the contribution from the saturated zone as explained earlier the low fluctuation in groundwater level before 08 00 23 may 2020 suggests no groundwater contribution to the gravity change the 18 3 µgal gravity change corresponds to an ewh q of 429 72 mm the cumulative rainfall r from 10 00 19 may to 08 00 23 may 2020 is 510 5 mm thus the infiltration coefficient is 0 84 0 14 that is the gravity based infiltration coefficients can range from 0 70 to 0 98 at a 68 confidence level around wlps note that rainfall intensities can affect infiltration coefficients langhans et al 2011 in addition blocking by the fine grains in the porous media of the unsaturated zone around wlps can also alter infiltration coefficients in conclusion our gravity observations yielded a high filtration coefficient of 0 84 0 14 at the beginning of the rainy season in may 2020 but the coefficient may vary with time 2 percolation rate the data in the steady stage from 08 00 23 may to 20 00 25 may 2020 can be explored to estimate a vertical hydraulic conductivity in the steady stage the gravity values were nearly constant but the groundwater levels rose by 1 26 m corresponding to an increase of 6 5 μgal in gravity for sy 0 124 from the pumping test a rising groundwater level can be attributed to water from the unsaturated zone and the nearby rivers around wlps using the groundwater level observations from 7 nearby wells hsieh et al 2019 showed that groundwater level variations near the argp recharge lake were more sensitive to precipitation than recharges from the linbian river furthermore the wlps gravity site is about 1 5 km from the linbian river thus the aquifer below wlps may receive little recharge from the river in two days because of little gravity changes in the steady stage the source of recharge to the 1 26 m increase in groundwater level in this stage should come from the infiltrated rainfall from 10 00 19 may to 08 00 23 may 2020 that is the aquifer below wlps the saturated zone received infiltered rainfall starting from 08 00 23 may the beginning time of the steady stage through 20 00 25 may 2020 note that gravity changes associated with soil water movement during percolation are independent of depth in the horizontal infinite slab approximation therefore the infiltered rainfall exerted similar gravitational forces on the gravimeter as it traveled through the unsaturated zone thus little gravity changes were observed however the infiltered rainfall steadily recharged the saturated zone to cause the 1 26 m groundwater rise thus the infiltered rainfall has traveled through the entire unsaturated zone about 30 m in two days starting from 08 00 21 may the beginning time of the heavy rain through 08 00 23 may 2020 the 2 day traveling time and the 30 m traveling distance result in a percolation rate of about 15 m day which is close to the estimated infiltration rates of 10 33 15 2 m day by hsieh et al 2019 following the steady stage is the growing stage starting from 20 00 25 may 2020 in this stage the average rate of gravity change is 4 μgal day with gravity increases that could originate from the infiltrated water and groundwater from the nearby saturated zones around wlps the growing stage lasted for more than a week as shown in figs 4 and 5a fig 5a shows that the rains on 27 may and 28 may 2020 significantly increased swc but the rains did not increase the gravity values as rapidly as in the rising and steady stages reductions in porosity may have caused smaller gravity changes after the rising stage which marks the end of the 2019 2020 dry season the persistent increases of gravity values in the growing stage could be attributed to sources from the unsaturated and saturated zone but our gravity and groundwater data cannot separate these sources 4 3 sy values at varying depths the observed time lapse gravity values at wlps reflect the mass changes nearby this gravity site after removing the temporal gravity effects such as polar motion air pressure solid and ocean tides and surface deformation we assume that the gravity changes are caused only by groundwater changes and the effects from the unsaturated zone see below we then determine sy values using the bouguer plate model as chen et al 2020 4 s y 0 0239 δ g z 2 z 1 where z 2 z 1 is the difference between groundwater level z 1 and z 2 in meters at times t1 and t2 and δ g in μgal is the observed gravity change note that a gravity change in eq 4 includes the effect of swc from the unsaturated zone around wlps in theory one can model the swc induced gravity effect at a given time if the swc in the entire unsaturated zone is known hector et al 2015 kazama et al 2015 besides the umbrella rainshadow effect of several μgals can be possibly quantified if soil meters are installed at several locations and depths and the geometry of the building for the gravimeter is well understood reich et al 2019 however the thicknesses of this zone varied from 9 to 30 m during the time of this study our soil moisture meters were installed only at a single site in the depths of 5 20 40 and 60 cm fig 3 full knowledge of swc is not available as such the swc gravity effects will increase the uncertainties in the gravity based sy values presented in this paper especially for those sy values estimated with gravity values collected right after rains the issue of swc will be discussed in section 5 1 using the 160 absolute gravity values and groundwater levels measured in this study we determined 12 720 sy values from all possible combinations of two gravity water level values c 2 160 12720 fig 6 a c show the distribution of the sy values and the distributions of the gravity changes and groundwater level differences the most probable sy value is 0 14 and about 80 of the sy values are distributed between 0 12 and 0 15 in section 4 4 we will examine the dependence of the estimated sy values on depths for comparison the sy value determined by the wlps pumping test the hydraulic method is 0 124 fig 2b therefore the most probable sy value derived from our gravity measurements is close to the value from the hydraulic method although the representative region of the gravity based sy is several hundred times larger than hydraulic based sy the two kinds of sy values are consistent suggesting that the fg5 gravimeter can sense the average water storage capacity of the underlying aquifer around wlps that is similar to that implied by the pumping test fig 6a shows that some sy values significantly differ from 0 14 the most probable value from gravimetry such sy values are due to small groundwater level changes or small gravity changes that result in large uncertainties for sy explained below the uncertainty of a measured gravity change σ δ g and that of a gravity based sy σ s y can be expressed as chen et al 2020 5 σ g σ g t 1 2 σ g t 2 2 1 2 6 σ s y 0 0239 σ δ g z 2 z 1 where σ g t 1 and σ g t 2 are the standard errors of absolute gravity values at times t 1 and t 2 eq 6 suggests that a small groundwater level change z 2 z 1 or a large σ δ g will lead to a large σ s y typically the gravity difference is considered significant in terms of hydrological signal if it is 2 5 times greater than the uncertainty of the gravity difference in this study the standard errors of the observed absolute gravity values range from 0 5 to 2 5 μgal depending on the environmental and instrumental conditions the average standard error of our absolute gravity measurements is 1 1 μgal thus the average standard error of gravity difference is 1 6 μgal from eq 5 therefore a reliable gravity based sy value should be determined from a gravity change difference that is 2 5 times larger than the average standard error i e 4 μgal according to eq 6 and with the most probable sy value of 0 14 a groundwater level change smaller than 0 68 m is considered too small to distinguish between gravity signal and gravity noise at the 4 μgal level equation 4 suggests that the gravity based method can determine a sy representing an overall average value where groundwater levels fluctuate over a specific depth range i e from z 1 to z 2 gravity changes and natural groundwater level fluctuations can be combined to infer a vertical profile of sy which can also be obtained by a drainage test using core samples chen et al 2010 hence the distribution pattern of sy values in fig 6 is likely due to the use of all gravity changes collected at all possible depth ranges plus the uncertainties introduced by the uncorrected swc effects see the reason above on why we did not apply this correction a potential correlation of sy with depth will be analyzed in the next section using data in the dry season and wet season separately taking advantage of the large range of groundwater levels that span from 7 98 m to 30 63 m below the ground surface during the 1 5 years in this study 4 4 sy values from the wet and dry seasons to examine if sy values are correlated with depths we also determined sy values over two cases in case 1 sy values were determined only during groundwater declines while case 2 is based on data during groundwater rises in both cases only reliable gravity based sy values were estimated based on the criteria described in section 4 3 i e gravity change is larger than 4 μgal and groundwater level change is larger than 0 68 m and the empirical selection criteria of chen et al 2020 fig 7 a shows the sy values estimated in case 1 using the data from 3 september 2019 depth 9 11 m to 10 may 2020 depth 30 31 m at an average water level difference of 2 m for each sy in case 1 the sy values range from 0 11 to 0 20 excluding the sy value of 0 17 obtained in the depth range of 11 19 to 13 48 m see section 5 the sy values fall between 0 11 and 0 12 at the depths of 9 11 24 00 m in case 1 the sy values are nearly a constant before the depth of 24 m but increase rapidly with depth from 21 88 to 28 29 m in fig 7a we also show a likely sy depth relation the thick red line to acquire a representative sy in case 1 over the groundwater level fluctuating zone at wlps we use the gravity change associated with the lowest and highest groundwater levels to determine the overall sy and its uncertainty in fig 7a the blue dashed line corresponds to a sy of 0 14 0 001 determined in this way in this case the water level difference is 9 11 m and the two measured gravity values are 978777992 6 0 9μgal and 30 31 m and 978777865 6 0 9 μgal at the times of the highest and lowest water levels fig 7b shows the sy values in case 2 using the data from two periods spanning from 11 july 2019 depth 20 25 m to 24 august 2019 depth 9 41 m and from 10 may 2020 depth 30 31 m to 26 august 2020 depth 20 00 m the sy values in case 2 range from 0 09 to 0 31 and show no significant correlations with depths however the representative sy value in case 2 is 0 15 0 002 using depth 30 31 m with gravity 978777865 6 0 9μgal and depth 9 41 m with gravity 978777995 9 1 24μgal compared to the representative value of sy 0 14 0 001 in case 1 fig 7a the two representative sy values differ by 0 01 0 14 vs 0 15 the most significant difference between the sy values in cases 1 and 2 fig 7a and fig 7b occurred at the lowest depth range of 28 29 to 30 31 m over which the sy value was 0 14 from the declining water levels and was 0 31 from the rising water levels the sy value of 0 31 was determined after a heavy rain and could suffer from a large uncertainty induced by a large swc see section 4 3 we notice that gravity changes due to rain induced swc changes can reach 18 μgal thus such effects should be modeled with great care or they should not be modeled and are regarded as a source of uncertainty as in this study because the sy values determined in case 2 are based on data in the wet season with more rains they contain larger uncertainties than the sy values do in case 1 5 discussion 5 1 overestimated sy values in section 4 4 the estimated sy values in the dry period show a potential relation between sy and depth fig 7a but there is no such relation in the two wet periods fig 7b thus the results in fig 7a and 7b fail to show a potential hysteresis in sy which would show a difference in the sy values at the same depth using data from the drying and wetting processes this failure can be partly attributed to the larger uncertainties in the estimated sy values in the wet season caused by large swc in fact the swc induced uncertainties on sy are similar to those experienced in pumping tests whose outcomes are affected by the contributions of the flows in the adapted unsaturated region above the water table during pumping cheng et al 2020 lin et al 2019 during a pumping test declining groundwater levels due to pumping will cause pore water drainages originating from the unsaturated zone above the transient water table thus several unsaturated flow models have been proposed to improve the hydraulic based sy estimation cheng et al 2020 liang et al 2017 lin et al 2019 mishra and neuman 2010 the gravity based sy values are also affected by flows in unsaturated zones especially in wet seasons typically we can regard regional declining groundwater levels in dry seasons as the result of a natural pumping test gravity changes are primarily associated with water loss in a saturated zone δ g s and contribution from an unsaturated zone δ g u is minor however the mechanism of rising groundwater levels in a wet season is not equal to that of a manual injection where groundwater is directly injected into a saturated zone natural groundwater changes mostly occur in a saturated zone in a wet season the long term rising trend of groundwater levels is caused by recharge directly from the aquifer system saturated zone and percolation through the unsaturated zone that finally recharges the local aquifer usually δ g u ranges from 0 1 to 3 μgal in an unconfined aquifer with a shallow groundwater level or in the case that the groundwater level fluctuates by only a few m chen et al 2020 creutzfeldt et al 2010b kazama et al 2012 krause et al 2009 therefore δ g u is usually neglected in most cases because in general δ g u is about ten times smaller than the gravity change induced by groundwater change in a saturated zone δ g s to reduce the effect of δ g u when estimating sy we recommend avoiding gravity measurements right after heavy rains as shown in fig 5a the unsaturated zone was 30 62 m thick at the end of the 2019 2020 dry season and a heavy rain event reversed the declining trend of groundwater level a thick unsaturated zone as that at wlps makes the dynamics of swc unpredictable the hydrodynamics from the ground surface to water tables and the interaction between saturated and unsaturated zones in the field are still two unresolved issues in fig 7b sy 0 31 was determined at the deepest depth range using groundwater depth of 30 31 m and gravity value of 978777865 6 μgal on 10 may 2020 and depth 28 34 m and gravity 978777891 5 μgal on 27 may 2020 a monsoonal rain occurred on 20 may 2020 and lasted for 8 days with cumulative precipitation of 740 mm before 20 may 2020 the dry season lasted for 8 months starting from 16 september 2019 hence sy 0 31 was an overestimated value because the gravity change used may be exaggerated by the infiltrated water that increased swc another example is the inconsistent sy values at the shallow part of the aquifer around wlps fig 7a the absolute gravity value and groundwater level measured on 20 and 30 september 2019 are used for estimating sy which is 0 17 at the depth range of 11 19 to 13 48 m although there is no precipitation from 20 to 30 september 2019 and the groundwater levels declined since 3 september 2019 depth 9 11 m the cumulative precipitation was 1195 mm from 1 august to 15 september 2019 in this case sy 0 17 is overestimated similar to the overestimated sy 0 31 in fig 7b in addition sy 0 11 determined from the data on 3 september 2019 depth 9 11 m and 20 september 2019 depth 11 19 is a special case in the dry period fig 7a in this case two weeks of intermittent rains before 3 september 2019 resulted in a cumulative precipitation of 333 mm for two weeks since 3 september 2019 there was a cumulative precipitation of 296 mm the gravity effects of swc on 3 september and 20 september 2019 might be close and are thus canceled out when differencing the gravity values on these two days as a result the effect of δ g u was small in this case and only slightly contaminated the estimated sy value in summary and for caution a gravity based sy value can be larger than the true value if the swc effect enlarges the gravity difference used in eq 4 as seen in many of the sy values in fig 7b and one case in fig 7a in addition the uncertainties of daily gravity measurements and the resulting sy values tend to be larger in the wet season than those in the dry season owing to rapid groundwater level changes in a day a final remark is given to the sy values estimated from mid february to mid may 2020 fig 4 in this period the rates of gravity change gradually overtook the rates of groundwater level change resulting in increases of sy at the depths of 21 88 28 99 m seen in fig 7a the larger sy values at these greater depths could be due to the more porous deposits here where the swc effects are the least in this dry period of 2020 and should not affect the estimated sy values 5 2 limitation and prospect of estimating infiltration coefficient and percolation rate this study used data collected in a monsoonal rain in late may 2020 to estimate a preliminary infiltration coefficient and percolation rate in the unsaturated zone around wlps these two values are close to the values derived from an independent method see section 4 2 we attribute this initial success to the thick unsaturated zone 30 m at the end of the 2020 dry season and the sudden 2 day downpour of rain that can easily penetrate the unsaturated zone the nearly constant gravity values in the steady stage fig 5 show that the source of recharge to the underlying aquifer at wlps is only from the unsaturated zone hence our preliminary estimations of infiltration coefficient and percolation rate are based on the fact that there was no mass change originating from the saturated zone and nearby rivers however we cannot obtain convincing estimates of infiltration coefficient and percolation rate using data during other rain events in this study this difficulty is explained below in our gravity based method a successful estimation of infiltration coefficient and percolation rate relies on high precision set gravity measurements which are determined by averaging over individual measurements from the free fall drops in the fg5 gravimeter this study took several hours of drops to reach a 1 µgal level gravity precision which corresponds to a 23 86 mm infiltrated water see section 4 2 in several hours there could be rapid variations in rainfall intensity evaporation swc and groundwater level that introduce uncertainties in defining an averaged gravity value besides there could also be water exchange between the unsaturated and saturated zone making it difficult to distinguish between the sources of gravity change from these two zones a solution will be to shorten the gravity measurement time using atomic gravimeters bidel et al 2018 chen et al 2020 ménoret et al 2018 on the other hand if we can estimate the infiltration coefficient unsaturated hydraulic conductivity related to percolation rate and specific yield at a gravity site they can be used to remove the hydrological gravity effects to enhance the gravity signals for seismic and volcanic studies kazama et al 2015 mouyen et al 2016 tanaka et al 2018 6 conclusions this study used absolute gravity measurements groundwater level changes and rain records in 1 5 years at wlps to estimate infiltration coefficient percolation rate and specific yields near the argp recharge lake this study confirms that wlps is a highly permeable region with precipitation being the major source of recharge to a regional aquifer like the one near wlps the gravity based method can estimate a range of sy values and identify the vertical differences of storage capacity making the groundwater storage evaluation around wlps more efficient on the regional scale we show that sy values increased from 0 13 to 0 20 at depths 22 to 28 m inferring that the lower part of the aquifer around wlps can store more groundwater than the shallow part however some gravity based sy values could be overestimated due to the uncorrected contributions of infiltrated water after heavy rains as demonstrated by the data during the monsoonal rain in late may 2020 the 30 m unsaturated zone near wlps can store infiltrated rain to increase the gravity by 18 μgal before the saturated zone was recharged the detection of rain infiltration at wlps by precision gravimetry may be applicable to other aquifers with thick unsaturated zones and quantify infiltrated water at the depths where soil moisture meters are hard to install the fg5 gravimeter used in this study is now installed at a gravity site over the choushui river alluvial fan in central taiwan to repeat the same experiment as that conducted at wlps this new experiment is to assess the infiltration potential of this site for a recharge lake that will supply groundwater to the aquifer below an area in yunlin county where severe land subsidence could affect the safety of the taiwan high speed rail hung et al 2021 credit authorship

3942,an efficient underground reservoir management requires reliable hydrogeological parameters such as infiltration coefficient percolation rate and specific yield sy values the cross well pumping test is a well known method for determining sy but different unsaturated flow models can lead to various sy results heterogeneity in unsaturated and saturated zones can restrict well dependent methods in estimating these parameters on a regional scale for which an alternative gravity based method is attempted in this study we established an absolute gravity site at the wanlong primary school wlps near a recharge lake an artificial lake in the pingtung plain and collected 1 5 years of gravity data in 2019 2020 around a monsoonal rain event in late may 2020 gravity values underwent three stages of changes the first stage experienced a rapid gravity rise of 18 μgal from infiltrated rain followed by stable gravity values in the second stage when the infiltrated rain recharged the aquifer and the third stage showed a persistent gravity increase with rising groundwater level the gravity based estimate of infiltration coefficient is 0 84 0 14 and the percolation rate is about 15 m day suggesting that wlps is over a high infiltration region a depth dependent sy profile up to 30 m depth was constructed using gravity and groundwater data in the dry season it was found that sy values are higher at the aquifer depths of 22 28 m than in the shallow part however some sy values determined in the wet seasons are overestimated due to high soil water content swc changes which induced particularly large gravity changes in the 30 m unsaturated zone of wlps when the wet season started this study confirms the advantage of using high precise gravity measurements at one μgal level and hydrology records for regional hydrogeological parameter estimation keywords gravity change infiltration coefficient percolation rate pingtung specific yield unsaturated zone 1 introduction taiwan often suffers from water shortage due to its rugged topography uneven rain distributions and short rivers that cannot hold surface water for a sufficiently long time the agriculture and semiconductor industries in taiwan require a large amount of water supplying enough water for industries and municipal uses has been a constant attention and study issue in taiwan constructing a new surface reservoir in taiwan is increasingly difficult due to its unfavorable environmental and social impacts instead an underground reservoir can substitute a dam for water supply and is a more cost effective water resource than a surface dam hung et al 2021 an ideal underground reservoir can be perched in a flood plain composed of unconsolidated sand and gravel with highly fluctuating water tables that signal abundant groundwater the excess groundwater in rainy seasons in such a reservoir compensates for the water shortage in dry seasons if this reservoir is connected to the aquifer below a land subsidence hit region raising its groundwater level can reduce land subsidence and seawater intrusion for example the pingtung plain in southern taiwan contains a large aquifer system stretching from pingtung s interior to its coastal area which has been experiencing land subsidence caused by excessive pumping for uses in agriculture and aquaculture shih et al 2019 tran and wang 2020 vu et al 2021 in response to the threat of land subsidence the water resource agency wra of taiwan launched the artificial recharge of groundwater project argp to construct a recharge lake at the flood plain of the linbian river which is part of the pingtung plain the objective of argp is to raise the groundwater level at the distal plain of the linbian river where land subsidence is the most severe ting et al 2020 in may 2018 the first phase of argp was completed and part of the recharge lake was constructed and operational in the subsequent phases the recharge lake will be extended to surrounding areas with a high infiltration potential however it is time consuming to gain the whole picture over a kilometer scale region using infiltration tests that can reach only several meters below the ground surface izbicki et al 2008 the spatial scaling problem in an unsaturated zone is the same as that of specific yields sy determined by cross well pumping tests in a saturated zone for instance chen et al 2010 showed that sy values could vary with orientations and depths over an area of 100 100 m2 around the pumping test site around the cape cod pumping test site the sy values from the 20 observation wells were quite different moench 1994 yeh and huang 2009 these studies suggested that the heterogeneity in unsaturated and saturated zones can introduce large uncertainties in the results from infiltration and pumping tests using point data a sy value can also be dependent on the well actually used in a test as an alternative ground based gravimetry can be used to investigate regional hydrogeology gravity changes at a site reflect mass changes at a relatively large areal scale than a pumping test satellite based gravimetry such as gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its follow on mission can also be used for hydrogeological investigation but it reflects water storage change in hundreds of km feng et al 2013 frappart and ramillien 2018 scanlon et al 2012 specifically ground based gravimetry meets regional water management requirements on a scale of several hundreds of m chen et al 2020 pool 2008 van camp et al 2017 montgomery 1971 first demonstrated estimating water storage change using a ground based gravimeter several ensuing studies have shown that the gravity based method can determine regional sy values chen et al 2020 christiansen et al 2011 gehman et al 2009 howle et al 2003 leirião et al 2009 pool and eychaner 1995 different types of gravimeters have been used in various hydrological studies depending on expected gravity changes superconducting gravimeters the most precise relative gravimeter with a nominal resolution of 0 1 μgal are often used to detect gravity changes with magnitudes of a few μgals induced by soil moisture changes creutzfeldt et al 2010a kazama and okubo 2009 krause et al 2009 naujoks et al 2010 reich et al 2019 absolute gravimeters with 1 μgal resolution are suitable for detecting gravity changes with magnitudes of several to tens of μgals such as determining a high precision sy estimation in a regional aquifer chen et al 2018 chen et al 2020 both absolute and relative gravimeters have been used to detect gravity changes due to artificial recharge and flash flows kennedy et al 2016 kennedy et al 2017 watlet et al 2020 a precise estimation of underground reservoir storage relies on precise sy values for the entire reservoir it is often assumed that sy is a constant value at a specific depth range of an unconfined aquifer in reality sy values might vary with the grain sizes in the sediments and therefore vary with depths to acquire the sy values at different depths around a pumping test site one could collect data at nearby wells that have different ranges of depths however the variations in the estimated sy can be caused by differences in the unsaturated models used in the pumping test or by the depth dependent heterogeneity of the underlying aquifer or both lin et al 2019 malama 2011 moench 1997 neuman 1974 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 yeh and huang 2009 most transient sy studies focus on thin unsaturated zones with water table fluctuations of less than 2 m cheng et al 2020 in comparison there are few studies on sy over aquifers with highly fluctuating water tables on the other hand gravity changes associated with groundwater level changes over different ranges of depths can be used to determine depth dependent sy values over the aquifer where the gravity measurements are made in addition to the need of depth dependent sy values for estimating precise reservoir storage an extended recharge lake in argp also requires that the lake is over a region with a high infiltration potential this requirement can be examined by absolute gravimetry because a heavy rain will create a rapid gravity change in a high infiltration rate region that is gravimetry can be a tool to assess a candidate site for a recharge lake before it is constructed this study aims to show that gravity measurements from a fg 5 absolute gravimeter can be used to determine regional depth dependent sy values and validate the high infiltration rate region near the existing argp recharge lake we set up an absolute gravity site at a spare room at the wanlong elementary school near the lake to measure time lapse absolute gravity values and continuous soil moisture for 1 5 years a large rain event at the end of the dry season in may 2020 allowed us to investigate the process of infiltration using hourly gravity measurements abundant gravity measurements in 1 5 years result in many sy values that allow us to determine sy values as a function of depth we eventually discuss the sy values determined in the wet seasons compared to those in the dry seasons 2 the hydrogeology at the gravity site and around the recharge lake the gravity site is located at the wanlong primary school wlps in the wanlong village near the linbian river in southern pingtung plain taiwan fig 1 a the hydrogeological profile across the wlps and the linbian plain suggests that the linbian plain is composed mainly of gravel and sand fig 1b in 1995 the wra of taiwan constructed two groundwater monitoring wells screened at the depths of 42 66 m and 144 168 m on the campus of wlps fig 2 a the coordinates and elevation of the two wlps monitoring wells are about 22 508 n 120 588 e and 46 38 m the wra has been maintaining the monitoring wells and collecting hourly water levels since 1993 generally monthly groundwater levels in the two monitoring wells fluctuated from 16 to 31 m below land surface the highly coherent water level changes at the two wells indicate that the thickness of the unconfined aquifer at wanlong is larger than 168 m at a nearby weather station xinpi which is 4 5 km south of wlps annual precipitation ranges from 1693 to 3584 mm from 2013 to 2020 on average 90 of rain occurred between may and september from october to the next april rain decreases steadily along with groundwater levels to verify the groundwater storage potential of the aquifer around wanlong the central geological survey of taiwan conducted a cross well pumping test at wlps on 27 may 2012 at the depths of 42 66 m the results are sy 0 124 and transmissivity t 16 63 m2 min as shown in fig 2b another pumping test was conducted on 16 july 2019 at the silin primary school located 4 5 km north of wlps both tests obtain similar sy values 0 124 and 0 110 the large sy and transmissivity values along with highly fluctuating groundwater levels indicate that the aquifer at the linbian plain has a large storage potential before constructing the arpg recharge lake several infiltration tests were conducted around the linbian plain simulations of an infiltration pond showed that groundwater levels observed in the nearby wells to the pond became stable after 47 h of consistent infiltration but the results in different wells were affected by local permeabilities hsieh et al 2010 at the same site of hsieh et al 2010 field tests showed that the average infiltration rates range from 7 15 to 22 76 m day under different scenarios tu et al 2010 more details about argp were shown in ting et al 2020 the high infiltration rate and high storage potential from these studies suggest that the region near wanlong is an ideal site for establishing an artificial recharge lake however it was recommended that a regional scale hydrogeological investigation around the current recharge lake needs to be expanded in coverage and location before extending the current recharge lake this study uses a gravity based method for such regional investigations 3 gravimeter setup and operation considering groundwater induced gravity changes the high groundwater level fluctuations at wlps provide us with the opportunity to establish a vertical profile of sy using measured changes in gravity and water level the annual change of the water levels at the wells could exceed 15 m spanning from the late wet season to the dry season which corresponds to a gravity change of 78 μgal using the bouguer plate model chen et al 2020 pool 2008 and a sy value of 0 124 a 78 μgal gravity change is 5 20 times larger than those recorded in the choushui river alluvial fan where annual groundwater level changes are typically between 0 5 and 5 m chen et al 2020 and at the gravity sites where gravity changes were used to study the geodynamic process around taiwan and its offshore islands kao et al 2017 the high groundwater level fluctuations at wlps motivate us to establish a vertical profile of sy using measured changes in gravity and water level as such we used a spare room at wlps to set up a temporary gravity observatory fig 3 a where a fg5 gravimeter serial no 231 was installed to collect absolute gravity values for 1 5 years in addition we installed four soil moisture meters to acquire the volumetric soil water content swc at 10 m from the fg5 at the depths of 5 20 40 60 cm the raw swc was recorded at 15 min intervals by the em50 data logger fig 3b and 3c the wlps site is quiet with a stable power supply for the gravimeter and the air conditioning system at a quiet site like wlps mean absolute gravity values can have a precision of 1 μgal if appropriate environmental gravity corrections are applied to the raw fg5 measurements in this study the raw gravity measurements were corrected for the effects of solid earth tides ocean tide and its loading polar motion and atmospheric pressure change using the computer programs and models in our previous studies hwang et al 2009 kao et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the continuous gps measurements at njou fig 1a located 1 8 km west of wlps show that the average rate of vertical displacements at wlps was 0 6 mm yr corresponding to a 0 1 μgal yr gravity change rate which is negligible in this study it is known that ground vibrations high temperatures and humidity changes will affect the stability of fg5 measurements chen et al 2018 van camp et al 2017 wlps is located in a tropical area and the temperature could reach 40 c in the summer thus we installed an air conditioner to maintain the room temperature at 25 c and humidity at 60 at the wlps gravity site using the internet we remotely controlled the fg5 gravimeter from hsinchu where the research team is located and is 260 km away from wlps this remote control reduced the cost of traveling and man made vibrations during gravity measurements in addition we adjusted and maintained the fg 5 gravimeter manually two times a month and right after a major earthquake significant tilts were corrected when maintaining the fg 5 we used different gravity measurement intervals to acquire absolute gravity values depending on the precision requirement and expected groundwater change rate the intervals range from hours to days typically the fg5 gravimeter finishes 100 repeated free falling drops gravity measurements in 10 min we then averaged the 100 gravity measurements to obtain a gravity value in a set we determined daily gravity values averaged over 15 20 h of set values from the raw gravity measurements at regular times however daily gravity values were not measured every day for example only about 8 to 10 gravity values were measured in a month in the two dry seasons in this study in principle at least one daily value was acquired for a week except during the periods when the gravimeter was moved elsewhere to collect data we determined hourly gravity values for some of the particular heavy rain events each based on the average of 2 6 sets of gravity values the historical data at wlps monitoring wells show that the rates of groundwater level change reached 60 80 cm day after heavy rains corresponding to rates of gravity change of 3 4 μgal day sy 0 124 thus hourly absolute gravity values are necessary for capturing the gravity signals caused by the rapid mass changes around a rain event however the standard deviations precisions from 100 drops a set of the hourly gravity values are about 2 3 μgal compared to a typical 1 μgal standard deviation for daily gravity values this arrangement of measuring frequencies during heavy rain events and regular times helped to minimize wear on the fg5 gravimeter while obtaining gravity values with best possible precisions 4 results 4 1 gravity changes and hydrology records at wlps in 1 5 years the ag observations groundwater levels and swc records collected at wlps lasted for 1 5 years since may 2019 fig 4 the first absolute gravity value is 978777882 0 9 μgal at wlps measured on 9 may 2019 and all the gravity changes are relative to this first measurement fig 4 in total we measured 160 daily absolute gravity values and numerous hourly gravity values during heavy rain events the highest absolute gravity value was measured on 25 august 2019 during a heavy rain event and the lowest absolute gravity value was measured on 4 may 2019 before the monsoonal rain started on 20 may 2020 the range of gravity values was 135 μgal and gravity values mainly fluctuated with groundwater level changes typically gravity changes were about 5 to 30 μgal for groundwater level variations of 1 to 5 m for an average sy of 0 15 in an unconfined aquifer on the contrary gravity changes associated with groundwater changes in a confined aquifer usually are less than 3 μgal annually in our experiences in taiwan hence the groundwater induced gravity changes recorded at wlps were the largest among the gravity values we have recorded in taiwan since 2004 fig 4 suggests that precipitations dominate the trends in the four depths of swc and groundwater levels the wet season from may to september experienced several significant rain events and typhoons at wlps typically few days of rain in mid may can reverse the declining trend of groundwater level the elevation relative to sea level of groundwater level was the lowest at 15 75 m depth 30 63 m on 21 may 2020 and the level started to increase because of a heavy rain furthermore the rates of rising groundwater levels depend on the intensities and sustaining times of rains the groundwater level reached a maximum of 38 40 m on 26 august 2019 due to a cumulative precipitation of 1859 mm from may to august 2019 fig 4 in comparison the highest groundwater level was 33 14 m on 12 september 2020 because the cumulative precipitation was only 943 mm from may to september 2020 there were several data gaps in the swc records due to technical problems such as power shortages or malfunctions of the meters because of a budget problem we removed the soil meters on 26 august 2020 despite the problems in the swc records the usable records show that swc at all depths changed immediately with rain infiltrations more discussions about the influences of swc on our results will be presented in later sections 4 2 infiltration coefficient and percolation rate to achieve the best effectiveness of artificial recharge by a surface dam since the 1990 s the wra of taiwan has been looking for a region around the pingtung plain where the infiltration coefficient and percolation rate are high in this study a rain event in late may 2020 allows us to estimate a preliminary infiltration coefficient and percolation rate using gravity measurements and hydrology records in 2020 the first monsoonal rain event around wlps occurred on 21 may after a 6 month dry period on 21 may 2020 alone the cumulative precipitation was 72 mm fig 5 starting from 3 00 on 22 may 2020 a persistent rain lasted for 21 h at an average precipitation rate of 20 mm hr the most intensive precipitation rate was 55 mm hr and the cumulative precipitation was 397 mm in 24 hr since 3 00 on 22 may 2020 after this persistent rain there was no rain for 3 5 days followed by another intensive rain that occurred since 23 00 on 26 may 2020 and lasted for 10 h resulting in a cumulative precipitation of 178 mm the data from the soil moisture meters show that the fluctuations of swc at the depths of 5 40 and 60 cm almost coincided with rainfalls on average swc was between 0 19 and 0 25 at the depth of 5 cm the largest swc changes occurred at the depth of 40 cm ranging from 0 18 to 0 32 at the lowest depth of 60 cm the variations in swc are relatively small ranging from 0 20 to 0 24 because our swc data are only up to the depth of 60 cm it is not clear how swc varied between the depths of 60 cm and 30 62 m the water table in the unsaturated zone fig 5a shows that the groundwater levels stayed almost at 15 76 m from 19 to 22 may 2020 despite the heavy rain on 22 may 2020 on 23 may 2020 the groundwater levels increased at a rate of 0 5 cm hr before 12 00 and at 1 0 cm hr from 12 00 to 24 00 since 24 may 2020 the groundwater levels increased at an average rate of 56 cm day through 28 may 2020 there was another heavy rain on 27 may 2020 which increased the rising rate of groundwater level to 77 cm day and the rate was decelerated to 65 cm day from 31 may 2020 onward as shown in fig 4 and fig 5a the groundwater level at wlps increased rapidly for another ten days due to this monsoonal rain event the gravity values increased by 45 μgal from 20 may to 1 june 2020 during this period we used the gravity measurements at 30 minute intervals to identify the rapid gravity changes during the rain events unlike the steady increase of groundwater levels the gravity values during the monsoonal rain in late may 2020 underwent three stages of changes a rapid rise rising stage followed by nearly zero changes for 2 days steady stage and finally a gentle rise consistent with the rise of groundwater level growing stage before the monsoonal rain event we measured the gravity values from 19 to 20 may 2020 to obtain a base gravity value which is 978777864 2 1 3 μgal obtained by averaging the hourly measurements in this period during the rapid rising stage from 08 00 21 may to 08 00 23 may 2020 the gravity values increased by 18 3 μgal relative to the base value at a rate of 9 μgal day in this stage the heavy rain on 21 may 2020 induced a 3 μgal gravity change and the maximum rain on 22 may 2020 induced a change of 15 μgal compared to the rapid fluctuations in swc groundwater levels experienced little changes and rose by only 7 cm at 08 00 on 23 may 2020 relative to the water level of 15 76 m before the rising stage the relation between gravity change and groundwater change in an unconfined aquifer can be approximated using the bouguer plate model horizontal infinite slab approximation as chen et al 2018 1 δ g 41 9 s y δ h where δ g is gravity change in µgal and δ h is groundwater change in m thus if sy 0 14 and the groundwater level change is 0 07 m the resulting gravity change is δ g 0 4 μgal which is smaller than a typical standard deviation of gravity measurement one μgal therefore the 18 μgal gravity increase in the rising stage is mainly due to the infiltrated rain in the unsaturated zone fig 5b shows the potential soil water movements and recharges of groundwater in the three stages the measured gravity changes in the three stages can be used to estimate a preliminary infiltration coefficient and percolation rate around the unsaturated zone near wlps as follows 1 infiltration coefficient the rapid gravity rise in the rising stage was caused by the fast and steadily accumulated infiltrated rainfall held in the unsaturated zone at the end of the dry season the gravity change and the cumulative rainfall collected from 10 00 19 may to 08 00 23 may 2020 are used to estimate the infiltration coefficient over a period as 2 q c r where q is the infiltrated rainfall c is the infiltration coefficient and r is the total rainfall from the rain gauge the infiltrated rainfall can be determined from gravity change also using the bouguer plate model as 3 q δ g 2 π g ρ w 23 86 δ g where q is in mm δ g is gravity change in µgal g is the gravitational constant and ρ w is the density of water in fact q in eq 3 is the equivalent water height ewh due to the mass of the retained water in the unsaturated zone without the contribution from the saturated zone as explained earlier the low fluctuation in groundwater level before 08 00 23 may 2020 suggests no groundwater contribution to the gravity change the 18 3 µgal gravity change corresponds to an ewh q of 429 72 mm the cumulative rainfall r from 10 00 19 may to 08 00 23 may 2020 is 510 5 mm thus the infiltration coefficient is 0 84 0 14 that is the gravity based infiltration coefficients can range from 0 70 to 0 98 at a 68 confidence level around wlps note that rainfall intensities can affect infiltration coefficients langhans et al 2011 in addition blocking by the fine grains in the porous media of the unsaturated zone around wlps can also alter infiltration coefficients in conclusion our gravity observations yielded a high filtration coefficient of 0 84 0 14 at the beginning of the rainy season in may 2020 but the coefficient may vary with time 2 percolation rate the data in the steady stage from 08 00 23 may to 20 00 25 may 2020 can be explored to estimate a vertical hydraulic conductivity in the steady stage the gravity values were nearly constant but the groundwater levels rose by 1 26 m corresponding to an increase of 6 5 μgal in gravity for sy 0 124 from the pumping test a rising groundwater level can be attributed to water from the unsaturated zone and the nearby rivers around wlps using the groundwater level observations from 7 nearby wells hsieh et al 2019 showed that groundwater level variations near the argp recharge lake were more sensitive to precipitation than recharges from the linbian river furthermore the wlps gravity site is about 1 5 km from the linbian river thus the aquifer below wlps may receive little recharge from the river in two days because of little gravity changes in the steady stage the source of recharge to the 1 26 m increase in groundwater level in this stage should come from the infiltrated rainfall from 10 00 19 may to 08 00 23 may 2020 that is the aquifer below wlps the saturated zone received infiltered rainfall starting from 08 00 23 may the beginning time of the steady stage through 20 00 25 may 2020 note that gravity changes associated with soil water movement during percolation are independent of depth in the horizontal infinite slab approximation therefore the infiltered rainfall exerted similar gravitational forces on the gravimeter as it traveled through the unsaturated zone thus little gravity changes were observed however the infiltered rainfall steadily recharged the saturated zone to cause the 1 26 m groundwater rise thus the infiltered rainfall has traveled through the entire unsaturated zone about 30 m in two days starting from 08 00 21 may the beginning time of the heavy rain through 08 00 23 may 2020 the 2 day traveling time and the 30 m traveling distance result in a percolation rate of about 15 m day which is close to the estimated infiltration rates of 10 33 15 2 m day by hsieh et al 2019 following the steady stage is the growing stage starting from 20 00 25 may 2020 in this stage the average rate of gravity change is 4 μgal day with gravity increases that could originate from the infiltrated water and groundwater from the nearby saturated zones around wlps the growing stage lasted for more than a week as shown in figs 4 and 5a fig 5a shows that the rains on 27 may and 28 may 2020 significantly increased swc but the rains did not increase the gravity values as rapidly as in the rising and steady stages reductions in porosity may have caused smaller gravity changes after the rising stage which marks the end of the 2019 2020 dry season the persistent increases of gravity values in the growing stage could be attributed to sources from the unsaturated and saturated zone but our gravity and groundwater data cannot separate these sources 4 3 sy values at varying depths the observed time lapse gravity values at wlps reflect the mass changes nearby this gravity site after removing the temporal gravity effects such as polar motion air pressure solid and ocean tides and surface deformation we assume that the gravity changes are caused only by groundwater changes and the effects from the unsaturated zone see below we then determine sy values using the bouguer plate model as chen et al 2020 4 s y 0 0239 δ g z 2 z 1 where z 2 z 1 is the difference between groundwater level z 1 and z 2 in meters at times t1 and t2 and δ g in μgal is the observed gravity change note that a gravity change in eq 4 includes the effect of swc from the unsaturated zone around wlps in theory one can model the swc induced gravity effect at a given time if the swc in the entire unsaturated zone is known hector et al 2015 kazama et al 2015 besides the umbrella rainshadow effect of several μgals can be possibly quantified if soil meters are installed at several locations and depths and the geometry of the building for the gravimeter is well understood reich et al 2019 however the thicknesses of this zone varied from 9 to 30 m during the time of this study our soil moisture meters were installed only at a single site in the depths of 5 20 40 and 60 cm fig 3 full knowledge of swc is not available as such the swc gravity effects will increase the uncertainties in the gravity based sy values presented in this paper especially for those sy values estimated with gravity values collected right after rains the issue of swc will be discussed in section 5 1 using the 160 absolute gravity values and groundwater levels measured in this study we determined 12 720 sy values from all possible combinations of two gravity water level values c 2 160 12720 fig 6 a c show the distribution of the sy values and the distributions of the gravity changes and groundwater level differences the most probable sy value is 0 14 and about 80 of the sy values are distributed between 0 12 and 0 15 in section 4 4 we will examine the dependence of the estimated sy values on depths for comparison the sy value determined by the wlps pumping test the hydraulic method is 0 124 fig 2b therefore the most probable sy value derived from our gravity measurements is close to the value from the hydraulic method although the representative region of the gravity based sy is several hundred times larger than hydraulic based sy the two kinds of sy values are consistent suggesting that the fg5 gravimeter can sense the average water storage capacity of the underlying aquifer around wlps that is similar to that implied by the pumping test fig 6a shows that some sy values significantly differ from 0 14 the most probable value from gravimetry such sy values are due to small groundwater level changes or small gravity changes that result in large uncertainties for sy explained below the uncertainty of a measured gravity change σ δ g and that of a gravity based sy σ s y can be expressed as chen et al 2020 5 σ g σ g t 1 2 σ g t 2 2 1 2 6 σ s y 0 0239 σ δ g z 2 z 1 where σ g t 1 and σ g t 2 are the standard errors of absolute gravity values at times t 1 and t 2 eq 6 suggests that a small groundwater level change z 2 z 1 or a large σ δ g will lead to a large σ s y typically the gravity difference is considered significant in terms of hydrological signal if it is 2 5 times greater than the uncertainty of the gravity difference in this study the standard errors of the observed absolute gravity values range from 0 5 to 2 5 μgal depending on the environmental and instrumental conditions the average standard error of our absolute gravity measurements is 1 1 μgal thus the average standard error of gravity difference is 1 6 μgal from eq 5 therefore a reliable gravity based sy value should be determined from a gravity change difference that is 2 5 times larger than the average standard error i e 4 μgal according to eq 6 and with the most probable sy value of 0 14 a groundwater level change smaller than 0 68 m is considered too small to distinguish between gravity signal and gravity noise at the 4 μgal level equation 4 suggests that the gravity based method can determine a sy representing an overall average value where groundwater levels fluctuate over a specific depth range i e from z 1 to z 2 gravity changes and natural groundwater level fluctuations can be combined to infer a vertical profile of sy which can also be obtained by a drainage test using core samples chen et al 2010 hence the distribution pattern of sy values in fig 6 is likely due to the use of all gravity changes collected at all possible depth ranges plus the uncertainties introduced by the uncorrected swc effects see the reason above on why we did not apply this correction a potential correlation of sy with depth will be analyzed in the next section using data in the dry season and wet season separately taking advantage of the large range of groundwater levels that span from 7 98 m to 30 63 m below the ground surface during the 1 5 years in this study 4 4 sy values from the wet and dry seasons to examine if sy values are correlated with depths we also determined sy values over two cases in case 1 sy values were determined only during groundwater declines while case 2 is based on data during groundwater rises in both cases only reliable gravity based sy values were estimated based on the criteria described in section 4 3 i e gravity change is larger than 4 μgal and groundwater level change is larger than 0 68 m and the empirical selection criteria of chen et al 2020 fig 7 a shows the sy values estimated in case 1 using the data from 3 september 2019 depth 9 11 m to 10 may 2020 depth 30 31 m at an average water level difference of 2 m for each sy in case 1 the sy values range from 0 11 to 0 20 excluding the sy value of 0 17 obtained in the depth range of 11 19 to 13 48 m see section 5 the sy values fall between 0 11 and 0 12 at the depths of 9 11 24 00 m in case 1 the sy values are nearly a constant before the depth of 24 m but increase rapidly with depth from 21 88 to 28 29 m in fig 7a we also show a likely sy depth relation the thick red line to acquire a representative sy in case 1 over the groundwater level fluctuating zone at wlps we use the gravity change associated with the lowest and highest groundwater levels to determine the overall sy and its uncertainty in fig 7a the blue dashed line corresponds to a sy of 0 14 0 001 determined in this way in this case the water level difference is 9 11 m and the two measured gravity values are 978777992 6 0 9μgal and 30 31 m and 978777865 6 0 9 μgal at the times of the highest and lowest water levels fig 7b shows the sy values in case 2 using the data from two periods spanning from 11 july 2019 depth 20 25 m to 24 august 2019 depth 9 41 m and from 10 may 2020 depth 30 31 m to 26 august 2020 depth 20 00 m the sy values in case 2 range from 0 09 to 0 31 and show no significant correlations with depths however the representative sy value in case 2 is 0 15 0 002 using depth 30 31 m with gravity 978777865 6 0 9μgal and depth 9 41 m with gravity 978777995 9 1 24μgal compared to the representative value of sy 0 14 0 001 in case 1 fig 7a the two representative sy values differ by 0 01 0 14 vs 0 15 the most significant difference between the sy values in cases 1 and 2 fig 7a and fig 7b occurred at the lowest depth range of 28 29 to 30 31 m over which the sy value was 0 14 from the declining water levels and was 0 31 from the rising water levels the sy value of 0 31 was determined after a heavy rain and could suffer from a large uncertainty induced by a large swc see section 4 3 we notice that gravity changes due to rain induced swc changes can reach 18 μgal thus such effects should be modeled with great care or they should not be modeled and are regarded as a source of uncertainty as in this study because the sy values determined in case 2 are based on data in the wet season with more rains they contain larger uncertainties than the sy values do in case 1 5 discussion 5 1 overestimated sy values in section 4 4 the estimated sy values in the dry period show a potential relation between sy and depth fig 7a but there is no such relation in the two wet periods fig 7b thus the results in fig 7a and 7b fail to show a potential hysteresis in sy which would show a difference in the sy values at the same depth using data from the drying and wetting processes this failure can be partly attributed to the larger uncertainties in the estimated sy values in the wet season caused by large swc in fact the swc induced uncertainties on sy are similar to those experienced in pumping tests whose outcomes are affected by the contributions of the flows in the adapted unsaturated region above the water table during pumping cheng et al 2020 lin et al 2019 during a pumping test declining groundwater levels due to pumping will cause pore water drainages originating from the unsaturated zone above the transient water table thus several unsaturated flow models have been proposed to improve the hydraulic based sy estimation cheng et al 2020 liang et al 2017 lin et al 2019 mishra and neuman 2010 the gravity based sy values are also affected by flows in unsaturated zones especially in wet seasons typically we can regard regional declining groundwater levels in dry seasons as the result of a natural pumping test gravity changes are primarily associated with water loss in a saturated zone δ g s and contribution from an unsaturated zone δ g u is minor however the mechanism of rising groundwater levels in a wet season is not equal to that of a manual injection where groundwater is directly injected into a saturated zone natural groundwater changes mostly occur in a saturated zone in a wet season the long term rising trend of groundwater levels is caused by recharge directly from the aquifer system saturated zone and percolation through the unsaturated zone that finally recharges the local aquifer usually δ g u ranges from 0 1 to 3 μgal in an unconfined aquifer with a shallow groundwater level or in the case that the groundwater level fluctuates by only a few m chen et al 2020 creutzfeldt et al 2010b kazama et al 2012 krause et al 2009 therefore δ g u is usually neglected in most cases because in general δ g u is about ten times smaller than the gravity change induced by groundwater change in a saturated zone δ g s to reduce the effect of δ g u when estimating sy we recommend avoiding gravity measurements right after heavy rains as shown in fig 5a the unsaturated zone was 30 62 m thick at the end of the 2019 2020 dry season and a heavy rain event reversed the declining trend of groundwater level a thick unsaturated zone as that at wlps makes the dynamics of swc unpredictable the hydrodynamics from the ground surface to water tables and the interaction between saturated and unsaturated zones in the field are still two unresolved issues in fig 7b sy 0 31 was determined at the deepest depth range using groundwater depth of 30 31 m and gravity value of 978777865 6 μgal on 10 may 2020 and depth 28 34 m and gravity 978777891 5 μgal on 27 may 2020 a monsoonal rain occurred on 20 may 2020 and lasted for 8 days with cumulative precipitation of 740 mm before 20 may 2020 the dry season lasted for 8 months starting from 16 september 2019 hence sy 0 31 was an overestimated value because the gravity change used may be exaggerated by the infiltrated water that increased swc another example is the inconsistent sy values at the shallow part of the aquifer around wlps fig 7a the absolute gravity value and groundwater level measured on 20 and 30 september 2019 are used for estimating sy which is 0 17 at the depth range of 11 19 to 13 48 m although there is no precipitation from 20 to 30 september 2019 and the groundwater levels declined since 3 september 2019 depth 9 11 m the cumulative precipitation was 1195 mm from 1 august to 15 september 2019 in this case sy 0 17 is overestimated similar to the overestimated sy 0 31 in fig 7b in addition sy 0 11 determined from the data on 3 september 2019 depth 9 11 m and 20 september 2019 depth 11 19 is a special case in the dry period fig 7a in this case two weeks of intermittent rains before 3 september 2019 resulted in a cumulative precipitation of 333 mm for two weeks since 3 september 2019 there was a cumulative precipitation of 296 mm the gravity effects of swc on 3 september and 20 september 2019 might be close and are thus canceled out when differencing the gravity values on these two days as a result the effect of δ g u was small in this case and only slightly contaminated the estimated sy value in summary and for caution a gravity based sy value can be larger than the true value if the swc effect enlarges the gravity difference used in eq 4 as seen in many of the sy values in fig 7b and one case in fig 7a in addition the uncertainties of daily gravity measurements and the resulting sy values tend to be larger in the wet season than those in the dry season owing to rapid groundwater level changes in a day a final remark is given to the sy values estimated from mid february to mid may 2020 fig 4 in this period the rates of gravity change gradually overtook the rates of groundwater level change resulting in increases of sy at the depths of 21 88 28 99 m seen in fig 7a the larger sy values at these greater depths could be due to the more porous deposits here where the swc effects are the least in this dry period of 2020 and should not affect the estimated sy values 5 2 limitation and prospect of estimating infiltration coefficient and percolation rate this study used data collected in a monsoonal rain in late may 2020 to estimate a preliminary infiltration coefficient and percolation rate in the unsaturated zone around wlps these two values are close to the values derived from an independent method see section 4 2 we attribute this initial success to the thick unsaturated zone 30 m at the end of the 2020 dry season and the sudden 2 day downpour of rain that can easily penetrate the unsaturated zone the nearly constant gravity values in the steady stage fig 5 show that the source of recharge to the underlying aquifer at wlps is only from the unsaturated zone hence our preliminary estimations of infiltration coefficient and percolation rate are based on the fact that there was no mass change originating from the saturated zone and nearby rivers however we cannot obtain convincing estimates of infiltration coefficient and percolation rate using data during other rain events in this study this difficulty is explained below in our gravity based method a successful estimation of infiltration coefficient and percolation rate relies on high precision set gravity measurements which are determined by averaging over individual measurements from the free fall drops in the fg5 gravimeter this study took several hours of drops to reach a 1 µgal level gravity precision which corresponds to a 23 86 mm infiltrated water see section 4 2 in several hours there could be rapid variations in rainfall intensity evaporation swc and groundwater level that introduce uncertainties in defining an averaged gravity value besides there could also be water exchange between the unsaturated and saturated zone making it difficult to distinguish between the sources of gravity change from these two zones a solution will be to shorten the gravity measurement time using atomic gravimeters bidel et al 2018 chen et al 2020 ménoret et al 2018 on the other hand if we can estimate the infiltration coefficient unsaturated hydraulic conductivity related to percolation rate and specific yield at a gravity site they can be used to remove the hydrological gravity effects to enhance the gravity signals for seismic and volcanic studies kazama et al 2015 mouyen et al 2016 tanaka et al 2018 6 conclusions this study used absolute gravity measurements groundwater level changes and rain records in 1 5 years at wlps to estimate infiltration coefficient percolation rate and specific yields near the argp recharge lake this study confirms that wlps is a highly permeable region with precipitation being the major source of recharge to a regional aquifer like the one near wlps the gravity based method can estimate a range of sy values and identify the vertical differences of storage capacity making the groundwater storage evaluation around wlps more efficient on the regional scale we show that sy values increased from 0 13 to 0 20 at depths 22 to 28 m inferring that the lower part of the aquifer around wlps can store more groundwater than the shallow part however some gravity based sy values could be overestimated due to the uncorrected contributions of infiltrated water after heavy rains as demonstrated by the data during the monsoonal rain in late may 2020 the 30 m unsaturated zone near wlps can store infiltrated rain to increase the gravity by 18 μgal before the saturated zone was recharged the detection of rain infiltration at wlps by precision gravimetry may be applicable to other aquifers with thick unsaturated zones and quantify infiltrated water at the depths where soil moisture meters are hard to install the fg5 gravimeter used in this study is now installed at a gravity site over the choushui river alluvial fan in central taiwan to repeat the same experiment as that conducted at wlps this new experiment is to assess the infiltration potential of this site for a recharge lake that will supply groundwater to the aquifer below an area in yunlin county where severe land subsidence could affect the safety of the taiwan high speed rail hung et al 2021 credit authorship

3943,nutrient loss caused by runoff reduces the fertility of cultivated land and pollutes the environment accurate prediction of such nutrient loss can inform prevention and control measures to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution and promote sustainable agriculture particularly in vulnerable habitats such as the loess plateau china and for high quality development projects such as those in the yellow river basin china in this study a time varying mixing layer was established to improve the nutrient transfer models already in use 36 sets of empirical data on nutrient loss k po4 3 p no3 n were compiled for the parameters α β and km another 45 sets of empirical data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the modified model the modified and previous models were compared and the modified model coefficient of determination 0 81 root mean square error 1 27 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient 0 77 was the most accurate the markov chain monte carlo method was used to estimate the parameters α β km under conditions of varying rainfall intensity p soil initial moisture content θ0 and slope degree s and as a result the mean value of parameter β 0 105 is recommended for the model the modified model successfully simulated the processes of nutrient loss with the greatest sensitivity for α followed by km and β this model can be used to improve the theoretical basis for developing runoff and erosion control methods keywords mixing layer depth nutrient loss overland flow mathematical model 1 introduction soil erosion and nutrient loss affect farmland ecosystems and cause agricultural nonpoint source nps pollution which in turn restricts the green development of agriculture and threatens national food security the food and agriculture organization fao reports that the majority of the world s soil resources are in fair poor or very poor condition indicating that soil erosion is a major environmental and agricultural perturbation issue worldwide borrelli et al 2020 fao 2015 soil erosion is influenced by fertilization methods and plant growth characteristics and large quantities of nutrients are often lost from surface soil as runoff tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b currently the global consumption of the three main fertilizer nutrients n p and k used to maintain or improve soil fertility is increasing at an average annual rate of 1 5 2 2 and 2 4 respectively borrelli et al 2020 the environmental pollution caused by the substantial use of fertilizers is a major limitation to development programs in the 21st century yang et al 2015 and china is one of the countries most severely affected by soil erosion and nutrient loss the loess plateau with the highest soil erosion rate in the world contributes 90 of the sediment and nutrients flowing into the yellow river wu et al 2021 where the average concentration of the total dissolved n and p is 2 6 mg l 1 and 0 09 mg l 1 respectively tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b nutrient transfer from surface soil into overland flow involves complex physical and chemical processes runoff and sediment as major carriers of nutrients are substantial drivers of nutrient loss shao et al 2020 while factors such as chemical soil properties rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content slope degree slope length soil texture soil bulk density and underlying surface conditions also have a considerable effect ao et al 2019 dong et al 2013 tong et al 2010 wang et al 1999 rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope in particular have been used to explore the process of nutrient loss under varying rainfall runoff conditions for example many studies have shown that rainfall intensity as a source of erosion energy has a substantial effect on the characteristics of nutrient loss dong et al 2013 yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b yang et al 2016c shao et al 2020 found that the peak rate of loss of no3 n at a rainfall intensity of 90 mm h 1 was 81 60 times higher than that at 30 mm h 1 higher initial soil moisture content reduces the onset time of runoff generation and increases the nutrient concentration in runoff yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b yang et al 2016c zhang et al 2007 demonstrated that the rate of loss of po4 3 p k and br at an initial soil water content of 18 9 was 11 30 31 52 and 8 76 times higher respectively than that at an initial soil water content of 1 3 wu et al 2021 found that particulate p pp and total p tp had the same critical slope of 15 20 for bare loessial soil because of the dominance of pp in runoff p considerable effort has gone into developing theories and simulation models to predict solute transfer from the soil surface to overland flow shi et al 2011 based on their respective assumptions the current theories of solute transfer can be divided into three broad categories i mixing layer models which assume the existence of a very thin layer the mixing layer on the soil surface in which infiltration water runoff water and soil water mix instantaneously earlier versions of the model generally assumed that there was no solute transfer into the mixing layer from the soil below i e that convection and diffusion are negligible bruce et al 1975 donigian et al 1977 haith 1980 steenhuis and walter 1980 while more recent models vary the degree and the depth of mixing ahuja and lehman 1983 ahuja 1986 havis et al 1992 ii interfacial diffusion controlled and raindrop dispersion models in which the soil surface and overland flow act as a boundary the transfer of solute across the boundary is driven by diffusion and raindrop splash because of the concentration gradient between the soil surface and the surface water flow and the ejection of soil particles into the runoff water caused by raindrop splash gao et al 2004 wallach et al 1988 1997 2001 wallach and van genuchten 1990 walter et al 2007 iii empirical models which attempt to simplify the mathematical representation of nutrient loss by non linear regression of experimental data ahuja 1986 mclsaac et al 1991 teixeira and misra 2005 based on the mixing layer theory the agricultural chemical transport model actmo frere et al 1975 agricultural runoff management arm donigian et al 1977 and chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams knisel 1980 were developed to predict the transfer of agricultural pollutants from farmland soils into runoff water ahuja et al 1981 using 32p as a tracer subsequently revealed that the extent of the rainfall soil interaction reaches its maximum at the soil surface and decreased rapidly with increasing depth they therefore proposed the concept of effective depth of interaction edi where the mixing of rainfall water and soil water is instantaneous and complete but this model can only be applied under conditions of steady state water flow without surface ponding in practice the solute concentration in the thin zone of the soil surface is much higher than that in the overland flow near the end of rainfall events snyder and woolhiser 1985 ahuja and lehman 1983 then proposed the incomplete mixing model where runoff water and infiltration water mix incompletely with soil water in the mixing layer in this model the degree of mixing of runoff water infiltration water and soil water is characterized by a corresponding mixing coefficient however all of these models generally underestimate nutrient concentrations during the steady state runoff phase because the effective mixing depth in the model is defined as a constant to improve the prediction accuracy tong and ye 2020 revised the model developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 by adding a time varying effective mixing depth their model assumed a positive correlation between increasing mixing layer and runoff time but did not consider the effect of soil erosion on nutrient loss as a result this model cannot be applied to the chinese loess plateau where soil erosion is the main factor driving nutrient loss this study therefore investigated nutrient loss caused by raindrops in association with other interacting environmental factors the main objectives of the study were to 1 develop a new model for describing nutrient transfer into runoff taking into consideration the variation in mixing depth dm t with runoff time 2 quantify the relationship between model parameters and major driving factors e g rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope and 3 propose methods for estimating model parameters under variable conditions the resulting modified model and parameter estimation method provide a new and simple approach to data generation that can be used to help prevent and control agricultural nps pollution on the chinese loess plateau 2 theoretical analysis nutrients are partially transferred to soil layers in infiltration water and partially ejected into runoff during raindrop splash ahuja and lehman 1983 gao et al 2004 yang et al 2016a tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b this nutrient migration process can be described by a mixing layer model in which the water soil mixing system can be divided into three layers the runoff layer initial mixing layer and soil layer fig 1 the model assumes that rainwater and soil water in the mixing layer are mixed uniformly and instantaneously and that nutrients in the mixing layer have the same probability of being transferred to the runoff layer and soil below the mixing layer ahuja and lehman 1983 therefore the solute mass conservation equation in the mixing layer can be expressed as 1 d d m t c t θ s ρ s k dt p c t where dm t is the mixing depth m c t is the nutrient concentration of the mixing layer mg l 1 θs is the soil saturated water content cm3 cm 3 ρs is the soil bulk density g cm 3 k is the soil sorption coefficient cm3 g 1 k for k po4 3 p no3 n is 0 026 0 160 0 030 t is the rainfall time min and p is the rainfall intensity cm min 1 the complete mixing theory considers rainwater and soil water in the mixing layer to be completely mixed rendering the nutrient concentration in the runoff and soil layers equal to that in the mixing layer yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b yang et al 2016c however many studies have shown that the nutrient concentration in the runoff layer is considerably lower than that in the mixing layer ahuja and lehman 1983 yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b yang et al 2016c therefore ahuja and lehman 1983 established an incomplete mixing model which allows nutrients in the mixing layer to be transported to the runoff and soil layers at different ratios the nutrient mass conservation equation is 2 d d m t c t θ s ρ s k dt α q c t β i c t where i is the infiltration rate cm min 1 q is the runoff generation rate cm min 1 α is the ratio of nutrient concentration from the runoff water and mixing layer and β is the ratio of nutrient concentration in the soil below the mixing layer and the mixing layer the values for α and β range between 0 and 1 during a rainfall event soil aggregates disintegrate and disperse into soil particle units under raindrop splash and runoff scouring erosion causing the soluble nutrients attached to the soil particles to dissolve in the runoff water kinnell 2005 the runoff water carries the soil particles and nutrients and the hydraulic erosion is a sufficiently powerful to cause nutrient loss via the runoff martins et al 2013 meyer 1981 to improve the accuracy of the nutrient transfer model the effect of soil erosion on nutrient loss therefore needs to be considered mixing depth dm t was a constant in the model developed by ahuja and lehman yang et al 2016a and yang et al 2016b included an interaction between the steady state interrill erosion rate di and the mixing layer depth dm t was then a variable that increases with the increasing rainfall duration however the hydraulic erosion of an entire storm event is not represented accurately because runoff scouring is not considered in the calculation of di yang et al 2016a added a power function for rainfall time to reduce the error caused by di thereby improving the computational accuracy of the model we have redeveloped this functional relationship between the depth of the mixing layer and the interrill sediment delivery rate di in order to refine the model further assuming that the depth of the mixing layer is proportional to the thickness of the eroded soil the relationship between the depth of the time varying mixing layer and the dynamic interrill sediment delivery rate can be characterized by a linear relationship 3 dm t k c d i where kc is the mixing coefficient kg 1 s m3 and di is the interrill sediment delivery rate kg s 1 m 2 the surface soil particles are dispersed under raindrop splash and more nutrients are ejected into the runoff water when the slope length is 15 m the slope erosion process is mainly interrill erosion which enables processes of soil and nutrient loss to proceed simultaneously kinnell 2005 foster 1977 established the first mathematical model for predicting interrill erosion and using two factors energy of rainfall and slope steepness to represent this relationship 4 d i 1 k i p 2 s f where di 1 is the interrill sediment delivery rate before runoff initiation kg s 1 m 2 and ki is the interrill soil erodibility kg s m4 however eq 4 does not take runoff scouring into consideration when estimating the impact of raindrops after runoff occurs both runoff and infiltration exert substantial effects on the interrill erosion process therefore kinnell 1993 2005 2009 proposed an interrill erosion model that does consider the effect of runoff 5 d i 2 k i p q s f where di 2 is the interrill erosion rate after runoff generation kg s 1 m 2 and sf is the slope factor liebenow 1990 which can be expressed as 6 s f 1 05 0 85 exp 4 sin s where s is the slope angle as shown in fig 1 the depth of the mixing layer can be described using the initial depth dmim and increased depth δdm t the initial mixing depth is a defined depth under the influence of raindrop splash before runoff while the increased depth refers to the depth as the mixing layer moves down the soil layers after runoff hence the time varying mixing depth dm t can be expressed as 7 dm t d m im δ d m t where dmim is the initial mixing depth m and δdm t is the increased mixing depth m from the combination of eqs 3 7 the initial mixing depth dmim and the increased mixing depth δdm t can be expressed as 8 d m im k c d i 1 9 δ d m t k c d i 2 hence eq 7 can be rewritten as 10 dm t k c k i p 2 s f k i p q s f the infiltration process under rainfall conditions is usually divided into two stages a when the infiltration capacity is greater than the rainfall intensity the actual infiltration rate is equal to the rainfall intensity b when the infiltration capacity is less than the rainfall intensity the actual infiltration rate is equal to the infiltration capacity therefore philip s infiltration equation philip 1954 was revised by yang et al 2016 to describe the soil infiltration process under rainfall conditions 11 i p t t p i 1 2 s t t 0 0 5 t t p where s is the soil sorptivity cm min 0 5 t 0 is the time difference between the time when the infiltration capacity is equal to the rainfall intensity under the condition of ponding and the time when the infiltration capacity is equal to the rainfall intensity under the condition of rainfall min t 0 s 2 4p 2 and tp is the onset time of runoff generation min to simplify the computation of the runoff rate the ponding and depression filling processes are ignored when the slope is 5 with a relatively smooth surface therefore we assume that the runoff generation rate is equal to the rainfall intensity minus the infiltration rate the runoff generation rate can then be expressed as 12 q t p 1 2 s t t 0 0 5 by integrating eqs 10 12 into eq 2 the nutrient concentration of the runoff layer can be expressed as 13 α c t α c 0 exp α 2 β s 4 p t t 0 0 5 t p t 0 0 5 s ln s 4 p t t 0 0 5 s 4 p t p t 0 0 5 8 α p 2 t t p 16 k m θ s ρ s k p 2 ln 4 p s t t 0 0 5 2 p where αc t is the nutrient concentration of the runoff layer mg l 1 and km is the comprehensive transfer coefficient equal to kckipsf in eq 13 if α and β are equal to 1 the modified model becomes a complete mixing model 3 materials and methods 3 1

and soil texture a total of 81 data sets were used 36 of which 12 data sets each for k po4 3 p and no3 n were used to derive the model parameters yang et al 2016a and 45 of which 15 data sets for k 17 data sets for po4 3 p and 13 data sets for no3 n were used to validate the model gao et al 2020 wang et al 2007 wang et al 2008 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 the three main environmental factors tested were a rainfall intensity of 0 10 0 20 cm min 1 an initial soil moisture content of 0 092 0 246 cm3 cm 3 and a slope of 5 15 3 2 data analysis the consistency between the calculated and measured values was evaluated in terms of r2 rmse and nse which can be expressed as 14 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 15 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 16 nse 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where yi is the measured value at calculation point i y is the average value of the n measured values xi is the predicted value at calculation point i and n is the number of measurements 3 3 parameter estimation the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method koike and hofert 2020 van ravenzwaaij et al 2018 was used to estimate the parameters the basic calculation steps were as follows 1 a set of initial values a0 b0 c0 was defined and assigned to parameters a b and c the rmse 0 and r2 0 between the model s calculated values under the current parameters and the actual measured values were determined 2 random sampling was performed on the basis of the initial parameters a0 b0 and c0 and the newly generated random values a1 b1 c1 were assigned to a b and c two model calculation results under two assignments were obtained if rmse 1 rmse 0 and r2 1 r2 0 then the sample was accepted and considered to represent the new baseline otherwise it returned to the previous baseline 3 step 2 was repeated for a given number of iterations 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameter estimation and quantitative analysis 4 1 1 parameter analysis to explore the mechanisms behind the influence of the three crucial parameters α β and km three examples were used example 1 varying values of α example 2 varying values of β example 3 varying values of km to simulate the processes of nutrient loss under different conditions the parameter values are listed in table 2 and the simulation results are shown in fig 3 parameters α and β represent the proportion of nutrients transported from the mixing layer to the runoff layer and soil layer respectively when α is larger more nutrients from the mixing layer are transferred to the runoff layer the results revealed that the nutrient concentration increased with increasing α during the early runoff stage an increase in α also led to a faster relative rate of reduction in nutrient concentration at each time point during the rainfall runoff therefore a longer time period may be needed to reach a stable nutrient loss stage fig 3a parameter β had no significant effect on nutrient concentration during the early runoff stage and reduced the nutrient concentration during the stable stage fig 3b parameter km represents the depth of the mixing layer i e a larger km value corresponds to a greater mixing layer depth km enhanced the nutrient transfer capacity from soil to runoff and increased the nutrient concentration during the stable stage fig 3c 4 1 2 model comparison the models developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 and yang et al 2016a have been widely used to predict nutrient concentrations in runoff and their accuracy was compared with our modified model the model parameters are listed in table 3 and four sets of k loss data reported by yang et al 2016a under conditions of varying rainfall intensity p soil initial moisture content θ0 and slope degree s were used for the verification process evaluation indices for the four rainfall events generated values of r2 0 70 0 89 rmse 2 19 3 73 and nse 7 72 0 32 for the ahuja and lehman 1983 model r2 0 73 0 85 rmse 0 43 0 78 and nse 0 73 0 85 for the yang et al 2016a model and r2 0 81 0 94 rmse 0 28 1 27 and nse 0 77 0 94 for the modified model this indicated that the modified model had a higher simulation accuracy fig 4 shows that the model developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 can only usefully predict a change in concentration at the initial loss stage it had a significantly lower prediction rate with increasing rainfall duration compared with the observed data the accuracy of the ahuja and lehman 1983 model depends on the depth of the mixing layer which is defined as a constant thus the concentration continues to fall rapidly preventing the model from predicting the concentration of k accurately tong and ye 2020 yang et al 2016a as the depth of the mixing layer increases with increasing rainfall duration the model developed by yang et al 2016a captures the data points on both sides of the inflection point of the nutrient loss curve effectively improving the calculation accuracy however the process of rapid reduction during the initial loss stage is still not well described tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b tong and ye 2020 overall the modified model performed better than the other two models predicting the concentration in the stable loss phase accurately the increased accuracy can be attributed to the depth of the mixing layer which is defined in the modified model as a variable of the thickness of dynamically eroded soil which increases with time further independent tests were used to verify the performance of the modified model when applied to the chinese loess plateau as discussed in sections 4 1 4 and 4 2 4 1 3 parameter estimation the mcmc method was used to calibrate the model parameters α β and km and the soil sorptivity s was estimated using the method developed by yang et al 2015 based on the initial runoff time and runoff production process the simulation curves generated for the concentration of k po4 3 p and no3 n in runoff under varying conditions for rainfall intensity initial soil water content and slope are shown in fig 5 the fit of the curves in fig 5 and evaluation indices for model accuracy in table 4 indicate that the modified model accurately represented the loss of different nutrients than the yang et al 2016a model k r2 0 788 rmse 1 677 and nse 0 657 po4 3 p r2 0 640 rmse 0 072 and nse 0 444 no3 n r2 0 519 rmse 0 317 and nse 0 106 from fig 5 and table 4 the accuracy of the model for each of the nutrients is ranked as k po4 3 p no3 n further analysis of the processes behind the nutrient loss indicated that the modified model could effectively predict the attenuation of k concentration during the initial loss stage but after 50 min of runoff generation the simulated values were slightly lower than the observed data fig 5a c one possible explanation for this is that the modified model relies heavily on the concentration of nutrient loss during the initial stage which was overestimated to varying degrees within 10 30 min moreover the nutrient concentration in the runoff was controlled mainly by the rainfall and the concentration of the solution in the mixing zone in the first few minutes after runoff occurred greater mixing promotes more soil nutrients in runoff but once the nutrient concentration in the runoff becomes stabilized the nutrient concentration in the runoff is controlled mainly by diffusion between the mixing zone and the soil under the mixing zone yang et al 2015 diffusion was not included in the modified model and a decrease in the later runoff stage of the modified model appeared to skew the results for po4 3 p fig 5d f the modified model accurately captured changes in concentration but the results were affected by fluctuations in the observed data the degree of fit for the loss of the po4 3 p was slightly lower than that for k under varying conditions of initial soil moisture content and slope this is because more p is adsorbed by the soil particles and less p is transferred into the mixing layer and consequently less p is observed in the runoff yang et al 2016a at the same time the amount of p adsorbed on the surface of soil particles into runoff water is random which reduces the model s accuracy wu et al 2021 fluctuations in the observed data had a more obvious effect on the modelled loss of no3 n than on k and po4 3 p fig 5g i shows that the simulated curves could not be used to predict no3 n loss acccurately because of the effect exerted by fluctuations in the data these fluctuations were caused by the instability of nitrogen which allows no3 n to be converted into nh4 n and other nitrogen forms nutrient transfer is also affected by the dispersion desorption and adsorption of soil particles yang et al 2016a tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b however the transfer of nutrients in the mixing layer was only represented by the fixed transfer probabilities of α and β in the modified model without taking the transformation and dispersion of nitrogen into consideration 4 1 4 quantitative analysis of parameters changes in α β km k km p and km n under the influence of different factors are shown in fig 6 table 4 and fig 6 show that increases in parameter α fluctuated with increases in rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope however values for parameter β stayed within a narrow range of 0 09 0 13 we therefore recommend that the mean value β 0 105 is used for predicting nutrient loss with runoff the comprehensive transfer rates for the three nutrients km k km p and km n were positively correlated with rainfall intensity and slope but negatively correlated with initial soil moisture content to analyze the functional relationships of rainfall intensity p initial soil moisture content θ0 and slope gradient s with various parameters α β km k km p and km n in the modified model a nonlinear fitting tool based on the mcmc method was used as shown in eqs 17 20 with r2 0 832 17 α 0 275 p 0 2156 s 0 085 e 0 628 θ 0 r 2 0 83 0 18 k m k 453 076 s 0 490 e 3 73 p 5 58 θ 0 k r 2 0 872 19 k m p 17 51 s 0 670 e 3 07 p 3 38 θ 0 k r 2 0 887 20 k m n 52 33 s 0 434 e 10 91 p 5 88 θ 0 k r 2 0 913 4 1 5 parameter sensitivity analysis to determine the prediction accuracy of a model the model parameters must be estimated as accurately as possible to ascertain the contribution of the three parameters α β and km to the process of nutrient loss a single factor analysis method was used to analyze the modified model quantitatively the results could then be used to propose effective measures for preventing nutrient loss the optimal fit of parameters for the observed loss of k at a rainfall intensity of 0 20 cm min 1 yang et al 2016a was selected as a benchmark and each parameter was controlled for perturbation within 30 i e 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 of the best fitting parameter the rmses of the simulated and observed values are shown in fig 7 and the calculation formula is expressed in eq 15 overall with increasing parameter values the rmse values for all three parameters initially exhibited a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend when α increased from 0 1855 to 0 3445 the rmse value ranged between 0 532 and 1 822 the minimum value was obtained when α 0 265 fig 7a further analysis revealed that the rmse values were similar under both positive and negative perturbations of α moreover the maximum rmse value was 241 83 larger than the minimum value indicating that the modified model is highly sensitive to changes in α when β increased from 0 084 to 0 156 the rmse value ranged between 0 5320 and 0 5354 the minimum value was obtained when β 0 12 fig 7b and the maximum rmse value was 0 639 higher than the minimum value however in contrast to α positive perturbation of β had a slightly greater effect on rmse than negative perturbation and the maximum rmse value was 0 64 larger than the best fit value indicating weak sensitivity of the modified model to β similarly when km increased from 31 668 to 58 812 the rmse value ranged between 0 5320 and 0 6564 the minimum value was obtained when km 45 24 fig 7c the effect of km on rmse under positive perturbation was significantly smaller than under negative perturbation the maximum rmse value was 23 38 higher than the minimum value indicating that the modified model is only slightly sensitive to changes in km the ranking for the model s sensitivity to the three parameters was α km β indicating that the probability of nutrients in the mixing layer entering the runoff water significantly affected the amount of nutrients that could be lost field management measures such as the introduction of gravel vegetation and straw cover should be implemented to reduce the likelihood of surface nutrient exchange the variation in km also suggests that a smaller mixing layer depth could significantly reduce the nutrient concentration in runoff which concurs with shao et al 2020 4 2 model verification and evaluation section 4 1 4 detailed the parameter derivation for the modified model and established the functional relationship between the parameters and influencing factors however whether this functional relationship is equally valid under different initial conditions was unclear therefore other nutrient loss data including soil bulk density soil texture soil crust initial moisture content and slope obtained from related literature were used to verify the accuracy of the parameters and the applicability of the modified model 4 2 1 parameter verification for k the observed data and predicted curves for k under four sets of environmental conditions are shown in fig 8 overall the evaluation indices indicate that the model accurately described the loss of k r2 0 716 rmse 17 257 and nse 0 351 table 5 however except at a soil bulk density of 1 25 g cm 3 the concentration of k was overestimated to varying degrees for different soil bulk densities fig 8a because of the failure of the model to consider the effect of bulk density on the comprehensive transfer coefficient km soil bulk density changes the diffusion coefficient of soil and the arrangement of soil particles which in turn affects the transport channels and rates of soil water and nutrient flow tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b similarly the predicted results under conditions of silty clay were higher than the observed values during the stable stage whereas under loam and silty loam they were consistent with the observed data this is because the parameters do not accurately describe the nutrient loss process of silty clay fig 8b raindrop splash alters the soil bulk density and pore structure of surface soil and the model only provides feedback for the effects on soil crust by adjusting the soil sorptivity s consequently the model can only predict k loss accurately under conditions of heavy crust fig 8c however k loss was predicted accurately by the model parameters under different initial soil moisture content fig 8d overall eqs 17 and 18 can be used to predict model parameters successfully under different initial conditions 4 2 2 parameter verification for po4 3 p the prediction for po4 3 p under the influence of five different factors is shown in fig 9 the evaluation indices indicated that the modified model accurately predicted the changes in po4 3 p concentration in runoff r2 0 231 rmse 3 84 and nse 0 155 table 4 under different soil bulk densities the simulated results matched the observed po4 3 p data well during the initial runoff stage but concentrations of po4 3 p during the stable loss stage were underestimated to varying degrees fig 9a contrasting with the overestimations of k concentration under different soil textures soil crusts and soil initial moisture contents the differences between the predicted and observed values for po4 3 p were similar to those of k fig 9b d although the observed data fluctuated considerably the data points were distributed on both sides of the prediction curve this indicates that the model parameters calculated using eqs 17 and 19 have universal applicability in predicting the loss of po4 3 p 4 2 3 parameter verification for no3 n fig 10 shows the predicted concentration of no3 n under the influence of three factors the observed data points under different soil bulk densities were distributed on both sides of the prediction curve fig 10a the predictions for three different rainfall intensities revealed that the modified model accurately captured the trend during the initial runoff stage fig 10b d however during the stable runoff stage the model underestimated the loss at a rainfall intensity of 0 10 cm min 1 and overestimated the loss at rainfall intensities of 0 15 and 0 20 cm min 1 the model evaluation indices were r2 0 312 rmse 0 070 and nse 0 134 table 5 this could be because a heavy rainfall intensity can result in a large quantity of sediment loss however nitrogen in sediment causes an increase in dissolved nitrogen concentration in surface runoff during the early runoff stage wu et al 2021 in general the fitted results from the modified model matched the observed data well especially for the concentration of k in the runoff the parameter estimation method proposed in section 4 1 4 improves the computational efficiency of the modified model and the modified model has been applied successfully to 45 independent rainfall events figs 8 10 the success of the modified model in predicting the initial concentrations and subsequent decrease in nutrient concentration in runoff is encouraging and supports the postulated transport process of partial displacement of solute from a relatively small volume of mobile pore water in the near surface layer of the soil the displaced water is mixed with new water from rainfall pearce et al 1986 which is assumed to bypass the soil matrix completely yang et al 2016a the modified model solves the disadvantage of constant parameters α and β as used in the models developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 and yang et al 2016a although yang et al 2016a defined the mixing layer depth as a variable increasing with rainfall time this does not have a clear physical meaning the improved model provides a solution the new time varying mixing layer depth is equal to the sum of the initial depth and the increased depth which is similar to the application by tong and ye 2020 however when the improved model is used to study the nutrient loss from soil to overland flow we recommend using the parameter estimation formula we have established if the model is not able to simulate the loss of adsorbent chemicals other diffusion models or other mechanical models will have to be used in future studies more factors should be considered to improve the accuracy of the parameter calculations tong et al 2010 have demonstrated that the parameters α and β are variables that change over time however while improving the model s sensitivity to these changes may improve the accuracy of the model s predictions it may also increase the complexity of the calculations 5 conclusion a time varying mixing layer has been established to improve the performance of a nutrient transport model compared with the model developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 the modified model s simulations predicted the loss of k with a much higher degree of accuracy compared with the model developed by yang et al 2016a the modified model was more successful at predicting the initial nutrient concentration and nutrient loss curve during the stable runoff stage thirty six sets of observed nutrient loss data k po4 3 p and no3 n were used to obtain the parameters α β and km and another 45 sets of observed data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the modified model the modified model could accurately predict the nutrient loss process with a ranking of k po4 3 p no3 n accurate acquisition of the model parameters provided the basis for the accurate estimations and we applied the model using rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope however the modified model could not fully capture the nutrient loss process under variable conditions for soil texture and soil crust while future research needs to establish more accurate parameter calculations for factors other than rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope the current modified model in combination with the parameter equations provided is effective in predicting processes of nutrient loss this modified model can therefore be used to help reduce the rate of nutrient loss in runoff on

3943,nutrient loss caused by runoff reduces the fertility of cultivated land and pollutes the environment accurate prediction of such nutrient loss can inform prevention and control measures to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution and promote sustainable agriculture particularly in vulnerable habitats such as the loess plateau china and for high quality development projects such as those in the yellow river basin china in this study a time varying mixing layer was established to improve the nutrient transfer models already in use 36 sets of empirical data on nutrient loss k po4 3 p no3 n were compiled for the parameters α β and km another 45 sets of empirical data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the modified model the modified and previous models were compared and the modified model coefficient of determination 0 81 root mean square error 1 27 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient 0 77 was the most accurate the markov chain monte carlo method was used to estimate the parameters α β km under conditions of varying rainfall intensity p soil initial moisture content θ0 and slope degree s and as a result the mean value of parameter β 0 105 is recommended for the model the modified model successfully simulated the processes of nutrient loss with the greatest sensitivity for α followed by km and β this model can be used to improve the theoretical basis for developing runoff and erosion control methods keywords mixing layer depth nutrient loss overland flow mathematical model 1 introduction soil erosion and nutrient loss affect farmland ecosystems and cause agricultural nonpoint source nps pollution which in turn restricts the green development of agriculture and threatens national food security the food and agriculture organization fao reports that the majority of the world s soil resources are in fair poor or very poor condition indicating that soil erosion is a major environmental and agricultural perturbation issue worldwide borrelli et al 2020 fao 2015 soil erosion is influenced by fertilization methods and plant growth characteristics and large quantities of nutrients are often lost from surface soil as runoff tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b currently the global consumption of the three main fertilizer nutrients n p and k used to maintain or improve soil fertility is increasing at an average annual rate of 1 5 2 2 and 2 4 respectively borrelli et al 2020 the environmental pollution caused by the substantial use of fertilizers is a major limitation to development programs in the 21st century yang et al 2015 and china is one of the countries most severely affected by soil erosion and nutrient loss the loess plateau with the highest soil erosion rate in the world contributes 90 of the sediment and nutrients flowing into the yellow river wu et al 2021 where the average concentration of the total dissolved n and p is 2 6 mg l 1 and 0 09 mg l 1 respectively tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b nutrient transfer from surface soil into overland flow involves complex physical and chemical processes runoff and sediment as major carriers of nutrients are substantial drivers of nutrient loss shao et al 2020 while factors such as chemical soil properties rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content slope degree slope length soil texture soil bulk density and underlying surface conditions also have a considerable effect ao et al 2019 dong et al 2013 tong et al 2010 wang et al 1999 rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope in particular have been used to explore the process of nutrient loss under varying rainfall runoff conditions for example many studies have shown that rainfall intensity as a source of erosion energy has a substantial effect on the characteristics of nutrient loss dong et al 2013 yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b yang et al 2016c shao et al 2020 found that the peak rate of loss of no3 n at a rainfall intensity of 90 mm h 1 was 81 60 times higher than that at 30 mm h 1 higher initial soil moisture content reduces the onset time of runoff generation and increases the nutrient concentration in runoff yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b yang et al 2016c zhang et al 2007 demonstrated that the rate of loss of po4 3 p k and br at an initial soil water content of 18 9 was 11 30 31 52 and 8 76 times higher respectively than that at an initial soil water content of 1 3 wu et al 2021 found that particulate p pp and total p tp had the same critical slope of 15 20 for bare loessial soil because of the dominance of pp in runoff p considerable effort has gone into developing theories and simulation models to predict solute transfer from the soil surface to overland flow shi et al 2011 based on their respective assumptions the current theories of solute transfer can be divided into three broad categories i mixing layer models which assume the existence of a very thin layer the mixing layer on the soil surface in which infiltration water runoff water and soil water mix instantaneously earlier versions of the model generally assumed that there was no solute transfer into the mixing layer from the soil below i e that convection and diffusion are negligible bruce et al 1975 donigian et al 1977 haith 1980 steenhuis and walter 1980 while more recent models vary the degree and the depth of mixing ahuja and lehman 1983 ahuja 1986 havis et al 1992 ii interfacial diffusion controlled and raindrop dispersion models in which the soil surface and overland flow act as a boundary the transfer of solute across the boundary is driven by diffusion and raindrop splash because of the concentration gradient between the soil surface and the surface water flow and the ejection of soil particles into the runoff water caused by raindrop splash gao et al 2004 wallach et al 1988 1997 2001 wallach and van genuchten 1990 walter et al 2007 iii empirical models which attempt to simplify the mathematical representation of nutrient loss by non linear regression of experimental data ahuja 1986 mclsaac et al 1991 teixeira and misra 2005 based on the mixing layer theory the agricultural chemical transport model actmo frere et al 1975 agricultural runoff management arm donigian et al 1977 and chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams knisel 1980 were developed to predict the transfer of agricultural pollutants from farmland soils into runoff water ahuja et al 1981 using 32p as a tracer subsequently revealed that the extent of the rainfall soil interaction reaches its maximum at the soil surface and decreased rapidly with increasing depth they therefore proposed the concept of effective depth of interaction edi where the mixing of rainfall water and soil water is instantaneous and complete but this model can only be applied under conditions of steady state water flow without surface ponding in practice the solute concentration in the thin zone of the soil surface is much higher than that in the overland flow near the end of rainfall events snyder and woolhiser 1985 ahuja and lehman 1983 then proposed the incomplete mixing model where runoff water and infiltration water mix incompletely with soil water in the mixing layer in this model the degree of mixing of runoff water infiltration water and soil water is characterized by a corresponding mixing coefficient however all of these models generally underestimate nutrient concentrations during the steady state runoff phase because the effective mixing depth in the model is defined as a constant to improve the prediction accuracy tong and ye 2020 revised the model developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 by adding a time varying effective mixing depth their model assumed a positive correlation between increasing mixing layer and runoff time but did not consider the effect of soil erosion on nutrient loss as a result this model cannot be applied to the chinese loess plateau where soil erosion is the main factor driving nutrient loss this study therefore investigated nutrient loss caused by raindrops in association with other interacting environmental factors the main objectives of the study were to 1 develop a new model for describing nutrient transfer into runoff taking into consideration the variation in mixing depth dm t with runoff time 2 quantify the relationship between model parameters and major driving factors e g rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope and 3 propose methods for estimating model parameters under variable conditions the resulting modified model and parameter estimation method provide a new and simple approach to data generation that can be used to help prevent and control agricultural nps pollution on the chinese loess plateau 2 theoretical analysis nutrients are partially transferred to soil layers in infiltration water and partially ejected into runoff during raindrop splash ahuja and lehman 1983 gao et al 2004 yang et al 2016a tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b this nutrient migration process can be described by a mixing layer model in which the water soil mixing system can be divided into three layers the runoff layer initial mixing layer and soil layer fig 1 the model assumes that rainwater and soil water in the mixing layer are mixed uniformly and instantaneously and that nutrients in the mixing layer have the same probability of being transferred to the runoff layer and soil below the mixing layer ahuja and lehman 1983 therefore the solute mass conservation equation in the mixing layer can be expressed as 1 d d m t c t θ s ρ s k dt p c t where dm t is the mixing depth m c t is the nutrient concentration of the mixing layer mg l 1 θs is the soil saturated water content cm3 cm 3 ρs is the soil bulk density g cm 3 k is the soil sorption coefficient cm3 g 1 k for k po4 3 p no3 n is 0 026 0 160 0 030 t is the rainfall time min and p is the rainfall intensity cm min 1 the complete mixing theory considers rainwater and soil water in the mixing layer to be completely mixed rendering the nutrient concentration in the runoff and soil layers equal to that in the mixing layer yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b yang et al 2016c however many studies have shown that the nutrient concentration in the runoff layer is considerably lower than that in the mixing layer ahuja and lehman 1983 yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b yang et al 2016c therefore ahuja and lehman 1983 established an incomplete mixing model which allows nutrients in the mixing layer to be transported to the runoff and soil layers at different ratios the nutrient mass conservation equation is 2 d d m t c t θ s ρ s k dt α q c t β i c t where i is the infiltration rate cm min 1 q is the runoff generation rate cm min 1 α is the ratio of nutrient concentration from the runoff water and mixing layer and β is the ratio of nutrient concentration in the soil below the mixing layer and the mixing layer the values for α and β range between 0 and 1 during a rainfall event soil aggregates disintegrate and disperse into soil particle units under raindrop splash and runoff scouring erosion causing the soluble nutrients attached to the soil particles to dissolve in the runoff water kinnell 2005 the runoff water carries the soil particles and nutrients and the hydraulic erosion is a sufficiently powerful to cause nutrient loss via the runoff martins et al 2013 meyer 1981 to improve the accuracy of the nutrient transfer model the effect of soil erosion on nutrient loss therefore needs to be considered mixing depth dm t was a constant in the model developed by ahuja and lehman yang et al 2016a and yang et al 2016b included an interaction between the steady state interrill erosion rate di and the mixing layer depth dm t was then a variable that increases with the increasing rainfall duration however the hydraulic erosion of an entire storm event is not represented accurately because runoff scouring is not considered in the calculation of di yang et al 2016a added a power function for rainfall time to reduce the error caused by di thereby improving the computational accuracy of the model we have redeveloped this functional relationship between the depth of the mixing layer and the interrill sediment delivery rate di in order to refine the model further assuming that the depth of the mixing layer is proportional to the thickness of the eroded soil the relationship between the depth of the time varying mixing layer and the dynamic interrill sediment delivery rate can be characterized by a linear relationship 3 dm t k c d i where kc is the mixing coefficient kg 1 s m3 and di is the interrill sediment delivery rate kg s 1 m 2 the surface soil particles are dispersed under raindrop splash and more nutrients are ejected into the runoff water when the slope length is 15 m the slope erosion process is mainly interrill erosion which enables processes of soil and nutrient loss to proceed simultaneously kinnell 2005 foster 1977 established the first mathematical model for predicting interrill erosion and using two factors energy of rainfall and slope steepness to represent this relationship 4 d i 1 k i p 2 s f where di 1 is the interrill sediment delivery rate before runoff initiation kg s 1 m 2 and ki is the interrill soil erodibility kg s m4 however eq 4 does not take runoff scouring into consideration when estimating the impact of raindrops after runoff occurs both runoff and infiltration exert substantial effects on the interrill erosion process therefore kinnell 1993 2005 2009 proposed an interrill erosion model that does consider the effect of runoff 5 d i 2 k i p q s f where di 2 is the interrill erosion rate after runoff generation kg s 1 m 2 and sf is the slope factor liebenow 1990 which can be expressed as 6 s f 1 05 0 85 exp 4 sin s where s is the slope angle as shown in fig 1 the depth of the mixing layer can be described using the initial depth dmim and increased depth δdm t the initial mixing depth is a defined depth under the influence of raindrop splash before runoff while the increased depth refers to the depth as the mixing layer moves down the soil layers after runoff hence the time varying mixing depth dm t can be expressed as 7 dm t d m im δ d m t where dmim is the initial mixing depth m and δdm t is the increased mixing depth m from the combination of eqs 3 7 the initial mixing depth dmim and the increased mixing depth δdm t can be expressed as 8 d m im k c d i 1 9 δ d m t k c d i 2 hence eq 7 can be rewritten as 10 dm t k c k i p 2 s f k i p q s f the infiltration process under rainfall conditions is usually divided into two stages a when the infiltration capacity is greater than the rainfall intensity the actual infiltration rate is equal to the rainfall intensity b when the infiltration capacity is less than the rainfall intensity the actual infiltration rate is equal to the infiltration capacity therefore philip s infiltration equation philip 1954 was revised by yang et al 2016 to describe the soil infiltration process under rainfall conditions 11 i p t t p i 1 2 s t t 0 0 5 t t p where s is the soil sorptivity cm min 0 5 t 0 is the time difference between the time when the infiltration capacity is equal to the rainfall intensity under the condition of ponding and the time when the infiltration capacity is equal to the rainfall intensity under the condition of rainfall min t 0 s 2 4p 2 and tp is the onset time of runoff generation min to simplify the computation of the runoff rate the ponding and depression filling processes are ignored when the slope is 5 with a relatively smooth surface therefore we assume that the runoff generation rate is equal to the rainfall intensity minus the infiltration rate the runoff generation rate can then be expressed as 12 q t p 1 2 s t t 0 0 5 by integrating eqs 10 12 into eq 2 the nutrient concentration of the runoff layer can be expressed as 13 α c t α c 0 exp α 2 β s 4 p t t 0 0 5 t p t 0 0 5 s ln s 4 p t t 0 0 5 s 4 p t p t 0 0 5 8 α p 2 t t p 16 k m θ s ρ s k p 2 ln 4 p s t t 0 0 5 2 p where αc t is the nutrient concentration of the runoff layer mg l 1 and km is the comprehensive transfer coefficient equal to kckipsf in eq 13 if α and β are equal to 1 the modified model becomes a complete mixing model 3 materials and methods 3 1 data collection the loess plateau in northwestern china has one of the highest rates of nutrient loss in the world it has a semiarid continental monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 14 3 3 6 and an average precipitation of 700 200 mm in the southeast and 200 mm in the northwest precipitation occurs mainly from may to october and rainfall mostly comprises short duration rainstorms data were collected for four typical loess areas shenmu ansai changwu and yangling counties fig 2 nutrient loss data were collected from 41 artificial rainfall experiments as published in seven papers table 1 gao et al 2020 wang et al 2007 wang et al 2008 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2016a zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 these experiments had been performed in the rainfall simulation hall at the key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling the experimental factors included rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content slope soil bulk density soil crust and soil texture a total of 81 data sets were used 36 of which 12 data sets each for k po4 3 p and no3 n were used to derive the model parameters yang et al 2016a and 45 of which 15 data sets for k 17 data sets for po4 3 p and 13 data sets for no3 n were used to validate the model gao et al 2020 wang et al 2007 wang et al 2008 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 the three main environmental factors tested were a rainfall intensity of 0 10 0 20 cm min 1 an initial soil moisture content of 0 092 0 246 cm3 cm 3 and a slope of 5 15 3 2 data analysis the consistency between the calculated and measured values was evaluated in terms of r2 rmse and nse which can be expressed as 14 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 15 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 16 nse 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where yi is the measured value at calculation point i y is the average value of the n measured values xi is the predicted value at calculation point i and n is the number of measurements 3 3 parameter estimation the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method koike and hofert 2020 van ravenzwaaij et al 2018 was used to estimate the parameters the basic calculation steps were as follows 1 a set of initial values a0 b0 c0 was defined and assigned to parameters a b and c the rmse 0 and r2 0 between the model s calculated values under the current parameters and the actual measured values were determined 2 random sampling was performed on the basis of the initial parameters a0 b0 and c0 and the newly generated random values a1 b1 c1 were assigned to a b and c two model calculation results under two assignments were obtained if rmse 1 rmse 0 and r2 1 r2 0 then the sample was accepted and considered to represent the new baseline otherwise it returned to the previous baseline 3 step 2 was repeated for a given number of iterations 4 results and discussion 4 1 parameter estimation and quantitative analysis 4 1 1 parameter analysis to explore the mechanisms behind the influence of the three crucial parameters α β and km three examples were used example 1 varying values of α example 2 varying values of β example 3 varying values of km to simulate the processes of nutrient loss under different conditions the parameter values are listed in table 2 and the simulation results are shown in fig 3 parameters α and β represent the proportion of nutrients transported from the mixing layer to the runoff layer and soil layer respectively when α is larger more nutrients from the mixing layer are transferred to the runoff layer the results revealed that the nutrient concentration increased with increasing α during the early runoff stage an increase in α also led to a faster relative rate of reduction in nutrient concentration at each time point during the rainfall runoff therefore a longer time period may be needed to reach a stable nutrient loss stage fig 3a parameter β had no significant effect on nutrient concentration during the early runoff stage and reduced the nutrient concentration during the stable stage fig 3b parameter km represents the depth of the mixing layer i e a larger km value corresponds to a greater mixing layer depth km enhanced the nutrient transfer capacity from soil to runoff and increased the nutrient concentration during the stable stage fig 3c 4 1 2 model comparison the models developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 and yang et al 2016a have been widely used to predict nutrient concentrations in runoff and their accuracy was compared with our modified model the model parameters are listed in table 3 and four sets of k loss data reported by yang et al 2016a under conditions of varying rainfall intensity p soil initial moisture content θ0 and slope degree s were used for the verification process evaluation indices for the four rainfall events generated values of r2 0 70 0 89 rmse 2 19 3 73 and nse 7 72 0 32 for the ahuja and lehman 1983 model r2 0 73 0 85 rmse 0 43 0 78 and nse 0 73 0 85 for the yang et al 2016a model and r2 0 81 0 94 rmse 0 28 1 27 and nse 0 77 0 94 for the modified model this indicated that the modified model had a higher simulation accuracy fig 4 shows that the model developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 can only usefully predict a change in concentration at the initial loss stage it had a significantly lower prediction rate with increasing rainfall duration compared with the observed data the accuracy of the ahuja and lehman 1983 model depends on the depth of the mixing layer which is defined as a constant thus the concentration continues to fall rapidly preventing the model from predicting the concentration of k accurately tong and ye 2020 yang et al 2016a as the depth of the mixing layer increases with increasing rainfall duration the model developed by yang et al 2016a captures the data points on both sides of the inflection point of the nutrient loss curve effectively improving the calculation accuracy however the process of rapid reduction during the initial loss stage is still not well described tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b tong and ye 2020 overall the modified model performed better than the other two models predicting the concentration in the stable loss phase accurately the increased accuracy can be attributed to the depth of the mixing layer which is defined in the modified model as a variable of the thickness of dynamically eroded soil which increases with time further independent tests were used to verify the performance of the modified model when applied to the chinese loess plateau as discussed in sections 4 1 4 and 4 2 4 1 3 parameter estimation the mcmc method was used to calibrate the model parameters α β and km and the soil sorptivity s was estimated using the method developed by yang et al 2015 based on the initial runoff time and runoff production process the simulation curves generated for the concentration of k po4 3 p and no3 n in runoff under varying conditions for rainfall intensity initial soil water content and slope are shown in fig 5 the fit of the curves in fig 5 and evaluation indices for model accuracy in table 4 indicate that the modified model accurately represented the loss of different nutrients than the yang et al 2016a model k r2 0 788 rmse 1 677 and nse 0 657 po4 3 p r2 0 640 rmse 0 072 and nse 0 444 no3 n r2 0 519 rmse 0 317 and nse 0 106 from fig 5 and table 4 the accuracy of the model for each of the nutrients is ranked as k po4 3 p no3 n further analysis of the processes behind the nutrient loss indicated that the modified model could effectively predict the attenuation of k concentration during the initial loss stage but after 50 min of runoff generation the simulated values were slightly lower than the observed data fig 5a c one possible explanation for this is that the modified model relies heavily on the concentration of nutrient loss during the initial stage which was overestimated to varying degrees within 10 30 min moreover the nutrient concentration in the runoff was controlled mainly by the rainfall and the concentration of the solution in the mixing zone in the first few minutes after runoff occurred greater mixing promotes more soil nutrients in runoff but once the nutrient concentration in the runoff becomes stabilized the nutrient concentration in the runoff is controlled mainly by diffusion between the mixing zone and the soil under the mixing zone yang et al 2015 diffusion was not included in the modified model and a decrease in the later runoff stage of the modified model appeared to skew the results for po4 3 p fig 5d f the modified model accurately captured changes in concentration but the results were affected by fluctuations in the observed data the degree of fit for the loss of the po4 3 p was slightly lower than that for k under varying conditions of initial soil moisture content and slope this is because more p is adsorbed by the soil particles and less p is transferred into the mixing layer and consequently less p is observed in the runoff yang et al 2016a at the same time the amount of p adsorbed on the surface of soil particles into runoff water is random which reduces the model s accuracy wu et al 2021 fluctuations in the observed data had a more obvious effect on the modelled loss of no3 n than on k and po4 3 p fig 5g i shows that the simulated curves could not be used to predict no3 n loss acccurately because of the effect exerted by fluctuations in the data these fluctuations were caused by the instability of nitrogen which allows no3 n to be converted into nh4 n and other nitrogen forms nutrient transfer is also affected by the dispersion desorption and adsorption of soil particles yang et al 2016a tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b however the transfer of nutrients in the mixing layer was only represented by the fixed transfer probabilities of α and β in the modified model without taking the transformation and dispersion of nitrogen into consideration 4 1 4 quantitative analysis of parameters changes in α β km k km p and km n under the influence of different factors are shown in fig 6 table 4 and fig 6 show that increases in parameter α fluctuated with increases in rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope however values for parameter β stayed within a narrow range of 0 09 0 13 we therefore recommend that the mean value β 0 105 is used for predicting nutrient loss with runoff the comprehensive transfer rates for the three nutrients km k km p and km n were positively correlated with rainfall intensity and slope but negatively correlated with initial soil moisture content to analyze the functional relationships of rainfall intensity p initial soil moisture content θ0 and slope gradient s with various parameters α β km k km p and km n in the modified model a nonlinear fitting tool based on the mcmc method was used as shown in eqs 17 20 with r2 0 832 17 α 0 275 p 0 2156 s 0 085 e 0 628 θ 0 r 2 0 83 0 18 k m k 453 076 s 0 490 e 3 73 p 5 58 θ 0 k r 2 0 872 19 k m p 17 51 s 0 670 e 3 07 p 3 38 θ 0 k r 2 0 887 20 k m n 52 33 s 0 434 e 10 91 p 5 88 θ 0 k r 2 0 913 4 1 5 parameter sensitivity analysis to determine the prediction accuracy of a model the model parameters must be estimated as accurately as possible to ascertain the contribution of the three parameters α β and km to the process of nutrient loss a single factor analysis method was used to analyze the modified model quantitatively the results could then be used to propose effective measures for preventing nutrient loss the optimal fit of parameters for the observed loss of k at a rainfall intensity of 0 20 cm min 1 yang et al 2016a was selected as a benchmark and each parameter was controlled for perturbation within 30 i e 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 of the best fitting parameter the rmses of the simulated and observed values are shown in fig 7 and the calculation formula is expressed in eq 15 overall with increasing parameter values the rmse values for all three parameters initially exhibited a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend when α increased from 0 1855 to 0 3445 the rmse value ranged between 0 532 and 1 822 the minimum value was obtained when α 0 265 fig 7a further analysis revealed that the rmse values were similar under both positive and negative perturbations of α moreover the maximum rmse value was 241 83 larger than the minimum value indicating that the modified model is highly sensitive to changes in α when β increased from 0 084 to 0 156 the rmse value ranged between 0 5320 and 0 5354 the minimum value was obtained when β 0 12 fig 7b and the maximum rmse value was 0 639 higher than the minimum value however in contrast to α positive perturbation of β had a slightly greater effect on rmse than negative perturbation and the maximum rmse value was 0 64 larger than the best fit value indicating weak sensitivity of the modified model to β similarly when km increased from 31 668 to 58 812 the rmse value ranged between 0 5320 and 0 6564 the minimum value was obtained when km 45 24 fig 7c the effect of km on rmse under positive perturbation was significantly smaller than under negative perturbation the maximum rmse value was 23 38 higher than the minimum value indicating that the modified model is only slightly sensitive to changes in km the ranking for the model s sensitivity to the three parameters was α km β indicating that the probability of nutrients in the mixing layer entering the runoff water significantly affected the amount of nutrients that could be lost field management measures such as the introduction of gravel vegetation and straw cover should be implemented to reduce the likelihood of surface nutrient exchange the variation in km also suggests that a smaller mixing layer depth could significantly reduce the nutrient concentration in runoff which concurs with shao et al 2020 4 2 model verification and evaluation section 4 1 4 detailed the parameter derivation for the modified model and established the functional relationship between the parameters and influencing factors however whether this functional relationship is equally valid under different initial conditions was unclear therefore other nutrient loss data including soil bulk density soil texture soil crust initial moisture content and slope obtained from related literature were used to verify the accuracy of the parameters and the applicability of the modified model 4 2 1 parameter verification for k the observed data and predicted curves for k under four sets of environmental conditions are shown in fig 8 overall the evaluation indices indicate that the model accurately described the loss of k r2 0 716 rmse 17 257 and nse 0 351 table 5 however except at a soil bulk density of 1 25 g cm 3 the concentration of k was overestimated to varying degrees for different soil bulk densities fig 8a because of the failure of the model to consider the effect of bulk density on the comprehensive transfer coefficient km soil bulk density changes the diffusion coefficient of soil and the arrangement of soil particles which in turn affects the transport channels and rates of soil water and nutrient flow tao et al 2020a tao et al 2020b similarly the predicted results under conditions of silty clay were higher than the observed values during the stable stage whereas under loam and silty loam they were consistent with the observed data this is because the parameters do not accurately describe the nutrient loss process of silty clay fig 8b raindrop splash alters the soil bulk density and pore structure of surface soil and the model only provides feedback for the effects on soil crust by adjusting the soil sorptivity s consequently the model can only predict k loss accurately under conditions of heavy crust fig 8c however k loss was predicted accurately by the model parameters under different initial soil moisture content fig 8d overall eqs 17 and 18 can be used to predict model parameters successfully under different initial conditions 4 2 2 parameter verification for po4 3 p the prediction for po4 3 p under the influence of five different factors is shown in fig 9 the evaluation indices indicated that the modified model accurately predicted the changes in po4 3 p concentration in runoff r2 0 231 rmse 3 84 and nse 0 155 table 4 under different soil bulk densities the simulated results matched the observed po4 3 p data well during the initial runoff stage but concentrations of po4 3 p during the stable loss stage were underestimated to varying degrees fig 9a contrasting with the overestimations of k concentration under different soil textures soil crusts and soil initial moisture contents the differences between the predicted and observed values for po4 3 p were similar to those of k fig 9b d although the observed data fluctuated considerably the data points were distributed on both sides of the prediction curve this indicates that the model parameters calculated using eqs 17 and 19 have universal applicability in predicting the loss of po4 3 p 4 2 3 parameter verification for no3 n fig 10 shows the predicted concentration of no3 n under the influence of three factors the observed data points under different soil bulk densities were distributed on both sides of the prediction curve fig 10a the predictions for three different rainfall intensities revealed that the modified model accurately captured the trend during the initial runoff stage fig 10b d however during the stable runoff stage the model underestimated the loss at a rainfall intensity of 0 10 cm min 1 and overestimated the loss at rainfall intensities of 0 15 and 0 20 cm min 1 the model evaluation indices were r2 0 312 rmse 0 070 and nse 0 134 table 5 this could be because a heavy rainfall intensity can result in a large quantity of sediment loss however nitrogen in sediment causes an increase in dissolved nitrogen concentration in surface runoff during the early runoff stage wu et al 2021 in general the fitted results from the modified model matched the observed data well especially for the concentration of k in the runoff the parameter estimation method proposed in section 4 1 4 improves the computational efficiency of the modified model and the modified model has been applied successfully to 45 independent rainfall events figs 8 10 the success of the modified model in predicting the initial concentrations and subsequent decrease in nutrient concentration in runoff is encouraging and supports the postulated transport process of partial displacement of solute from a relatively small volume of mobile pore water in the near surface layer of the soil the displaced water is mixed with new water from rainfall pearce et al 1986 which is assumed to bypass the soil matrix completely yang et al 2016a the modified model solves the disadvantage of constant parameters α and β as used in the models developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 and yang et al 2016a although yang et al 2016a defined the mixing layer depth as a variable increasing with rainfall time this does not have a clear physical meaning the improved model provides a solution the new time varying mixing layer depth is equal to the sum of the initial depth and the increased depth which is similar to the application by tong and ye 2020 however when the improved model is used to study the nutrient loss from soil to overland flow we recommend using the parameter estimation formula we have established if the model is not able to simulate the loss of adsorbent chemicals other diffusion models or other mechanical models will have to be used in future studies more factors should be considered to improve the accuracy of the parameter calculations tong et al 2010 have demonstrated that the parameters α and β are variables that change over time however while improving the model s sensitivity to these changes may improve the accuracy of the model s predictions it may also increase the complexity of the calculations 5 conclusion a time varying mixing layer has been established to improve the performance of a nutrient transport model compared with the model developed by ahuja and lehman 1983 the modified model s simulations predicted the loss of k with a much higher degree of accuracy compared with the model developed by yang et al 2016a the modified model was more successful at predicting the initial nutrient concentration and nutrient loss curve during the stable runoff stage thirty six sets of observed nutrient loss data k po4 3 p and no3 n were used to obtain the parameters α β and km and another 45 sets of observed data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the modified model the modified model could accurately predict the nutrient loss process with a ranking of k po4 3 p no3 n accurate acquisition of the model parameters provided the basis for the accurate estimations and we applied the model using rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope however the modified model could not fully capture the nutrient loss process under variable conditions for soil texture and soil crust while future research needs to establish more accurate parameter calculations for factors other than rainfall intensity initial soil moisture content and slope the current modified model in combination with the parameter equations provided is effective in predicting processes of nutrient loss this modified model can therefore be used to help reduce the rate of nutrient loss in runoff on

3944,soil desertification and salinization are common in arid and semi arid regions and can result in roads being buried by quicksand or corroded by salts therefore it is important to investigate the salt transportation under evaporation in these regions to analyze the transport law of moisture heat gas and salt in unsaturated saline soil a series of evaporation tests were conducted based on these tests the novel mass and energy conservation equations suitable for medium transfer in unsaturated saline soil were then developed in the model the non equilibrium phase process between the liquid water and vapor was considered meanwhile the convective heat transfer caused by small temperature difference between the liquid pore water and soil grains was also considered validation of the model was illustrated by comparisons between the simulation and experimental results it is found that the evaporation of pore water is accompanied by the precipitation of solute the vapor condensation at low temperature zone can dilute the solute concentration in addition the permeability of surface has significant effect on the moisture heat gas salt migration the novel model can effectively describe the moisture heat gas salt interaction process and reveal the temperature difference between soil grains and pore fluid under the evaporation of pore water keywords unsaturated saline soil non equilibrium equation mixture theory moisture heat gas salt transport 1 introduction saline soil is widely distributed in china fig 1 a you et al 2020 salt precipitation and salt expansion under evaporation has been a key problem for engineering constructions built in unsaturated saline soil regions barica 1972 ma 2017 wu 2016 the salt migration and expansion results from the complex moisture heat gas salt mhgs interaction process within the unsaturated saline soil fang et al 2018 bergstad et al 2018 han and zhou 2018 sakai et al 2009 the components in unsaturated saline soil contain soil grains salts moisture including the liquid water and vapor and gas including the vapor and dry air evaporation under humidity difference between the pores and atmosphere can cause the migration of solution thus salts will precipitate into the soil pores when the solubility is reached with the increase of precipitated salts the evaporation rate of water will gradually decrease fujimaki et al 2006 zeidouni et al 2009 mohamed et al 2000 however once a salt crust is formed water will progressively accumulate under the salt crust due to the temperature gradient in seasonal frozen soil regions wang 2019 which causes the deliquescence and dissolution of the precipitated salts numerous works on the mhgs interaction within saline soil have been conducted for the experimental researches fujimaki et al 2006 explored the effects of salt crust on evaporation rate noborio and mcinnes 1993 investigated the thermal conductivity of salt affected soils sheng et al 2016 revealed the formation and development mechanism of salt crust on soil surface konukcu et al 2004 determined the water content in the transition zone rose et al 2005 studied the effects of water table depth on evaporation and salt accumulation from saline groundwater gran et al 2011a believed that the evaporation front is key to understand the moisture salt transport wu et al 2016 systematically investigated the dynamics of water heat and solute transport within saline soil these studies show that the moisture salt transport can be affected by soil types solute types water content water table depth and boundary conditions which indicates that the migration of mhgs in soils under evaporation and freezing thawing action is a complex process however few researches focus on the effect of the surface coverage conditions on the transport process e g the impermeable asphalt pavement and the permeable slope of an embankment in arid and semi arid regions fig 1b to comprehensively describe the moisture heat salt transport in theory several models have been established and developed by considering the effects of moisture heat and salt in transfer flux equations nassar and horton 1992 nassar et al 1997 gran et al 2011a gran et al 2011b koniorczyk 2012 smits et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 castellazzi et al 2016 jambhekar et al 2015 fernanda et al 2014 nassar and horton 1989 in these models an enhance vapor flux term named enhancement factor was proposed to consider the effect of the temperature difference between grains and fluids on vapor transfer cass et al 1984 campbell 1985 jiang et al 2006 however the enhancement factor is insufficient to reflect the thermo physical properties of fluid e g the relative humidity the water dynamic viscosity and the surface tension meanwhile these models neglected the effect of dry air on the moisture salt migration although the mixture theory can effectively describe the influence of dry air by mass fraction koniorczyk 2012 castellazzi et al 2016 jambhekar et al 2015 halder et al 2011 smits et al 2012 gran et al 2011a gran et al 2011b the temperature difference between soil grains and fluid was also neglected which can affect the migration of vapor in unsaturated soil under non isothermal philip and de vries 1957 in this study to further explore the moisture heat gas salt transport mechanism and solve the above limitations we firstly conducted a series of evaporation experiments for silty clay in an open system with water supply at the soil bottom among these tests the top for two soil samples were halfly covered with acrylic plate to simulate the impermeable surface and the top for other two samples were directly exposed to the environment to simulate the permeable surface then we developed a novel model with four liquid water vapor dry air solute mass conversion equations and two solid and fluid energy conservation equations to fully describe the mhgs transport behavior within unsaturated saline soil finally we verified the applicability of the model by comparing the predicted and measured values including the temperature concentration and water content 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the soil used in our experiments was silty clay from the qaidam basin in qinghai province china fig 1a to eliminate the effect of natural salinization the soil was desalted by distilled water the porosity of the soil sample is 0 34 and the bulk density is 1770 kg m3 the grain size distribution curve is shown in fig 2 according to the engineering practice three factors were considered in the experiments including the initial solute concentration the surface condition and the type of supply water correspondingly the sample preparation process was listed as follows 1 salt was firstly added into distilled water to make solution according to the initial concentration then the solution was mixed with dry soil to make saline samples according to the saturation 2 half of the mulch plate was placed on the top of the sample to simulate the impermeable surface such as the asphalt pavement in fig 1b and a plastic film 1 mm was placed between the mulch plate and sample top to prevent the water evaporation and 3 the concentration of supply solution was the same for two samples to clearly illustrate the effect of the three factors on the mhgs process four experimental cases were set in table 1 2 2 experimental method the testing apparatus for evaporation experiments is shown in fig 3 the sample was cylindrical with a diameter of 0 2 m and a height of 0 25 m fig 3 the sample was sealed with plastic membranes and kept at a constant temperature for 24 h the sample was then packed into an acrylic cylinder the outside wall of the acrylic cylinder was wrapped with 0 03 m thermal insulation material to avoid lateral heat exchange between the sample and the ambient the operating temperature of the chamber ranges from 243 15 k to 303 15 k with an error of 0 1 k the bottom temperature of the sample was controlled by a porous plate connected with a cold bath which can control the temperature range from 233 15 k to 313 15 k with an error of 0 5 k to simulate the water recharge the porous plate was hydraulically connected to a mariotte flask to supply solution or distilled water fig 3 a coarse sand layer with a thickness of 0 02 m was placed at the base of the sample to reduce the solution supplement rate and the final water content at the soil bottom was regarded as the water content boundary to analyze the effects of permeability characteristics on the moisture salt transport the water content and solute concentration in the same area under the mulched and un mulched boundaries were tested at the end of these experiments fig 4 a respectively water content was determined by the oven drying method solute concentration was calculated via the electrical conductivity measured by the 5te sensor the controlled temperatures at the bottom of the sample and the ambient were maintained unchanged during the whole test resistance thermometers with the accuracy of 0 05 k were inserted into the sample to measure temperature variations along the depth fig 4b the interval between two adjacent thermometers is 0 04 m the temperature data were automatically collected and stored by a data logger 2 3 experimental results and analyses to explore the regular of water migration and temperature change within samples the tested data for the 2nd and 4th samples are selected in fig 5 a the water content under the mulched surface is higher than that under the un mulched surface and the water content changes with height of the sample during the whole test the difference in water content under the surface reduces with height for the halfly mulched sample due to the effect of the evaporation resistance of the impermeable layer however the water content is uniformly distributed before the test and gradually decreases at the soil surface under evaporation in fig 4b which is obvious for the un mulched soil sample besides the evaporation rate is smaller than the supplying rate of water at the soil bottom which indicates that the coarse sand layer laid on the soil bottom is effective to reduce the solution supplement rate fig 6 shows that the temperature difference at the bottom section of the soil is smaller than that at the top section whether it is a semi closed or open top boundary the phenomenon for the soil sample with un mulched surface fig 6b is more obvious than that for the soil sample with halfly mulched surface fig 6a the difference in temperatures at different sections may be caused by the difference in thermal behavior of soil because the thermal conductivity usually decreases with the decreasing water content chung and horton 1987 zhang et al 2014 therefore the difference in temperature reduces in the 2nd soil sample because the bulk thermal conductivity increases with the increasing of water content in fig 7 the distribution of the solute concentration is also different under two surfaces during the evaporation the change rate of solute concentration in the uncovered area is larger than that in the covered area besides the change rate of solute concentration near the diving line in the uncovered area is smaller than that far from the diving line however it is reverse in the covered area the reason is that the water migrates from the covered area to the uncovered area the solute concentration at the bottom of the 4th soil sample slightly decreases which may be related to the low temperature the low temperature can promote vapor condensation when the dew point temperature is reached according to gran et al 2011a and gran et al 2011b 3 mathematic model complex mhgs interaction process occurs within the unsaturated saline soil numerical simulation is an effective method to further reveal the mhgs process to accurately describe the complex medium variation a novel mhgs transfer model is proposed in this study considering the water vapor phase change process and the convective heat transfer process between pore moisture and soil particles 3 1 mass conservation equations fig 8 shows the infinitesimal micro volume element the lengths of sides are dx dy dz respectively and the low volume element represents the mass and energy flux taking the x axis for example flux on the left cross section is qxdydz and flux on the right cross section is qx q x x dx dydz the increment between the left and right cross sections is q x x dxdydz similarly the flux of other cross section can be analogized by the same method anderson 1995 assuming that the direction of flux points to the positive axis the net outflow along x axis can be expressed as ρl0qw xdxdydz ρgqg xdxdydz and ρsaltqs xdxdydz respectively ρl0 ρg ρsalt kg m3 are the densities of freshwater air and salt respectively qw qg qs m s are the flux equation of liquid water air and salts respectively the total mass of the

tdxdydz θsρgsg tdxdydz and θsslwρl0 tdxdydz respectively the sum of each saturation in soil is equal to 1 1 s l s g s salt 1 θ l θ s θ g θ s θ salt θ s 1 the mass fraction of vapor and dry air in pore can be expressed as 2 w v w a 1 w v m v m g ρ v ρ g where θs θg θl and θsalt m3 m3 are the volumetric content of pores porosity air liquid water and precipitated salts respectively sl sg and ssalt are the saturation of liquid water air and precipitated salts respectively w wv and wa kg kg are the mass fraction of solute vapor and dry air respectively mv and mg kg are the mass of vapor and air respectively ρv kg m3 is the vapor density and t s is the time according to the law of mass conservation the governing equations of liquid water vapor dry air and solute can be obtained as follows 3a θ s ρ l 0 s l 1 w t q l w m eva 3b θ s ρ g s g w v t q g v m eva 3c θ s ρ g s g w a t q g a 0 3d w θ s ρ l 0 s l t q l s m pre where qw l qv g qa g and qs l kg m2 s are the total flux of the liquid water vapor air and solute respectively meva kg m3 s is the phase change rate between water and vapor due to the evaporation or condensation the mass of water transfered from one phase to another per unit volume per unit time and mpre kg m3 s is the precipitation rate of the solute under the action of evaporation water evaporated from the soil surface into the air while the solute remains in solution and then precipitates in soil pores when the solubility limit is reached the effect of the precipitated salts on the evaporation rate is considered in the relevant equations and the mass of precipitated salts per unit volume can be quantified as follows 4 s ρ l 0 θ s s l w w s w w s 0 w w s where s kg m3 is the mass of precipitated salts per unit volume which also can be expressed as s θsalt ρsalt and ws kg kg is the solubility of solute assuming that the precipitated salts don t migrate the governing equation for salt transport can be derived in eq 5 by combining eqs 3d and 4 5 s t w s θ s ρ l 0 s l t w ρ l 0 q w 0 3 2 energy conservation equations the soil grains salts liquid water vapor and dry air can transfer heat the liquid water and vapor cannot only conduct heat but also transfer sensible heat and the latent heat of the evaporation meanwhile the precipitated salts also have effect on the process of heat transfer existed studies have shown that there is a temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid cass et al 1984 philip and de vries 1957 jiang et al 2006 in this study the temperature difference is considered for the fluid including the liquid water vapor and dry air and soil grains heat flux equations the heat transport rates for liquid water and soil grains are different because the thermal conductivity of liquid water is larger than that of soil grains owing to the ionic electrostatic and molecular interaction derjaguin and churaev 1974 soil grains are always wrapped by film water fig 9 lebeau and konrad 2010 tokunaga 2009 therefore all the latent heat of the evaporation is firstly received by the liquid water and then transported to the soil grains the energy conservation equation for the soil grains can be defined as 6 t ρ s c s θ

λ a θ s s a w a t f ρ g c a w a t f t 0 q g where ca j kg k is the specific heat capacity of the air and λa j m s k is the bulk thermal conductivity of the air the thermo physical properties of soil are affected by the precipitated salts to avoid the non convergence during the calculation it is assumed that the temperature of the dissolved salts and precipitated salts is consistent with that of the soil grains the energy conservation equation of precipitated salts can then be written as 10 t ρ salt c salt θ salt t s t 0 θ salt λ salt t s where csalt j kg k is the specific heat capacity of the salts and λsalt j m s k is the bulk thermal conductivity of the salts therefore the summarized heat conservation equation for the solid terms is 11 t ρ salt c salt θ salt t t 0 ρ s c s θ soil t t

equations 4 1 flux equation for each component in this study it is assumed that the soil grains and precipitated salts are not moved therefore the components that can be transported in soil pores are moisture dry air and dissolved salts these pore components are mainly transported by means of convection and diffusion 4 1 1 flux equation of liquid water in reality the pore fluid consists of liquid water dissolved salts and air for simplicity the air dissolved in liquid water is not considered here from the definition of binary solutions the liquid water flux equation can be calculated as

obtained from fick law smits et al 2011 18 q v d i f f d va τ g θ a w v where dva m2 s is the molecular diffusivity of vapor in the air which can be written as dva 2 29 10 5 tf 273 15 1 75 kimball et al 1976 and τg is the tortuosity factor millington and quirk 1961 which can be written as τg θs θssl θsalt 7 3 θ the vapor density is closely related to the water content fluid temperature and solute concentration it is reasonable to use chain rule to extend eq 18 however for simplicity the effects of the fluid temperature and solute concentration are not considered in eq 18 4 1 3 flux equation for dry air based on the convection diffusion equation the total dry air flux equation can be written as halder et al 2011 19 q g a w a ρ g q g q v d i f f where qg represents the total gas flux which can be derived from fick s law 20 q g k s k rg μ g p g where krg is the relative permeability of pores gas pg pa is the gas pressure in the pore and μg kg m s is the dynamic viscosity of gas or dry

equilibrium theory the process of phase change between liquid water and vapor is instantaneous while it takes some time for the phase change in the non equilibrium theory the existing research has shown that the result calculated by the non equilibrium model is better than that by the equilibrium model smits et al 2011 therefore the non equilibrium model was adopted in this study to calculate the rate of phase change between liquid water and vapor eq 22 can be employed according to these studies bixler 1985 zhang and datta 2004 22 m eva b m θ l θ r r t f m w ρ vs r h ρ g w v where bm is an

et al 2011 mw kg mol is the molecular weight of water θr m3 m3 is the residual volumetric water content ρvs kg m3 is the saturated vapor density and rh is the relative humidity however eq 22 cannot be used if the saturation of gas phase decreases to be zero in any region as pressure cannot be determined in the region to deal with the above problem the gas saturation is forced to be a small value to prevent the gas phase from going to be zero during the numerical solving process according to halder et al 2011 4 1 4 flux equation for solute according to the previous research the transport of solute is totally reliant on liquid water the transport of solute with liquid water is defined as the convection transport and the transport of solute under solute concentration is defined as the diffusion transport it is assumed that salts cannot be transported with air thus the total solute flux equation can be expressed as castellazzi et al 2016 23 q l s w ρ l 0 q w q s d i f f where qs

to campbell and shiozawa 1992 26 θ f θ r 1 ln φ m ln φ dry where θ r is taken as 0 05 according to the regression analysis of the pressure plate test thus the entire range of the swcc can be obtained by eqs 25 and 26 according to the experimental data based on the mualem model mualem 1976 and the vg model the following relative permeability equation can be obtained 27 k rw s l s r 1 s r 0 5 1 1 s

caused by the electrical field and van der waals field and the gravitational potential lu and likos 2004 for simplicity the potentials caused by the electrical field and van der waals field are not considered here 28 φ tot φ m φ o z where φtot and φo m are the total matric head and the osmotic water potential respectively φm is the matric potential and z refers to the gravity head the combined potential can be directly estimated from the vapor pressure in the unsaturated soil the vapor pressure is lowered by the interaction with a soil matrix and by the solute it contains 29 rh r h m r h o

f 4 2 3 dry air transport properties to obtain the relative permeability of dry air the vapor content in the soil is not considered by referring to the derivation procedure for the relative permeability of liquid water the relative permeability of the dry air in soil is obtained the matric head can be written in the form of eq 33 by exchanging the location of the independent variable and dependent variable in the vg model 33 φ m s l 1 1 n 0 1 1 n 0 α it is assumed that the effect of precipitated salts on matric head can be neglected the relationship between the matric head and air saturation can be expressed by eq 34 34 φ m 1 s g 1 1 n 0 1 1 n 0 α the matric head and relative permeability of liquid water are connected by the mualem model 35 k rw s l s l 0 5 0 s w d s l φ m 0 1

convection heat transfer between solid and fluid occurs when there is a variable temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid it is assumed that the soil grains are spherical and that the entire surface contributes to the heat transfer then the volumetric heat coefficient can be calculated by 37 h v h sf a sf where hv w k m3 represents the volumetric heat coefficient the symbol asf directly determines the temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid when the value of asf is very large the temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid is not obvious because the energy can be quickly transported from the fluid to the soil grains conversely the temperature difference between them gradually increases because the time for energy transport is needed few studies have listed the calculation method for asf jiang et al 2006 however the value of asf calculated by the method is usually so large that the temperature between the soil grains and fluid is identical which is inconsistent with the research results cass et al 1984 campbell 1985 to reasonably determine the asf a new method is proposed in this study soil grains and fluid are the two parts of convective heat transfer according the existing literatures jiang et al 2006 the specific surface area is calculated by the ratio of surface area to the volume of soil grains to evaluate the temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid the specific surface area in this study is calculated by the ratio of surface area to the volume of capillary tubes as it is assumed that the soil grains are wrapped by liquid water therefore the asf can be calculated by the nearly saturated capillary tube 38 a sf 2 π r l π r 2 l 2 r where l m is the length of the capillary tube and r is the pore radius of soil grain based on the kelvin equation the pore radius in eq 38 can be transformed into the relationship between the surface tension and matric head 39 a sf 2 r 2 φ m 0 149 c m 2 if the matric head is equal to zero the convective heat transfer between the soil grains and fluid will stop meanwhile the temperature difference between them will be very large with the duration of the evaporation furthermore the saturated matric head is difficult to be obtained by the laboratory experiment thus the matric head is replaced by the air entry matric head to calculate the specific surface area tinjum and benson 1997 recognized the similarities of the fitting parameters between the vg and the brooks and corey bc model brooks and corey 1964 and proposed an empirical relationship to calculate the air entry matric head φ b for a series of compacted clay specimens eq 40 can be obtained when φ b ranges from about 1 kpa to 100 kpa 40 α 0 78 φ b 1 26 where φb m is the air entry matric head substituting the air matric head into eq 41 we can obtain 41 a sf 1 56 0 149 c m 2 α 1 1 26 5 solution conditions and key parameters to solve the partial differential equations eqs 2 3 and 11 the initial values and boundary conditions are key to obtain accurate results the initial values used in this model include the temperature solute concentration water content and air pressure in soil the boundary conditions are boundary temperature and atmospheric relative humidity etc 5 1 initial conditions the relevant initial conditions ic are listed as follows refer to tables 1 and 3 ic for eq 3a 42a s i sli ic for eq 3b 42b w i wvi ic for eq 3c 42c p g p amb ic for eq 3d 42d w i w 1i ic for eq 11 42e ts t0 ic for eq 12 42f tf t0 5 2 boundary conditions boundary conditions in the presented model include the dirichlet the first type neuman the second type and robin the third type boundary conditions the pressure at the boundary which is open to the air environment is taken as the ambient pressure 43 pg sur p amb where pg sur and pamb pa are the air pressures at the sample surface and the atmospheric pressure respectively it is necessary to convert liquid water into vapor for the liquid water evaporated into the air therefore the surface and lateral boundary conditions for eq 3a is taken as zero the surface boundary condition for eq 3b is defined as the difference between the atmosphere relative humidity and pore relative humidity at the soil surface daamen and simmonds 1996 with the evaporation the salts will be precipitated from the solution and fill the soil pores the filling effects of the precipitated salts on surface evaporation rate can refer to the effects of precipitated salts on the intrinsic permeability zeidouni et al 2009 44 n v t o t s u r ρ g w v ρ v a m b r a 1 θ salt θ s 3 1 θ s 1 θ s θ salt 2 where nv tot sur kg m2 s is the evaporation rate at the soil surface ra s m is the aerodynamic resistance and ρv amb kg m3 is the vapor density in air for the energy conservation equation eq 12 there is energy going out due to bulk flow heat lost due to surface evaporation and convective heat transfer with the air the heat transfer between the soil grains and air is 45 n h s s u r h sa t s s u r t a where nh s sur w m2 is the heat flux density between the soil grains and atmosphere hsa can be expressed as saito et al 2006 46 h sa c a r a p a m a r t a where ta k is the atmospheric temperature the evaporation rate is affected by the soil grains and aerodynamic resistance to directly determine the aerodynamic resistance is very difficult besides the resistance from soil grains is often larger than that of the aerodynamic therefore only the linear equation for the surface resistance camillo and gurney 1986 is considered in this study 47 r a 805 4140 θ s θ r the heat lost due to surface evaporation and convective with air is expressed as 48 n h f s u r n v t o t s u r l 0 c v t f n v t o t s u r 5 3 model geometry the dimension of the soil samples in this study is directly related to the surface mulch the un mulched samples can be regarded as the one dimensional model the halfly mulched samples should be regarded as a three dimensional model because there is horizontal transport of moisture and salts the geometry of the three dimensional model is shown in fig 10 5 4 model parameters six variables water content vapor content air pressure soil grains temperature fluid temperature and solute concentration need to be simultaneously solved the model parameters used in the calculation process are given in table 3 6 numerical simulation and model validation the objective of this section is to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model by comparing the predicted values with the tested data film transport can be neglected during the simulations due to the limited test time and water supplement at the sample bottom 6 1 water content comparison fig 11 shows a comparison between the predicted and measured water content for the semi mulched samples the simulated values at different depths and areas agree well with the measured values except for sample 1 with halfly mulched top surface fig 11a the slight deviation may be caused by the fact that the predicted values represent the value of a point on soil surface while the test data is the average value of water content at a certain depth according to the predicted curves of semi mulched samples we can know that there is an obvious transition zone caused by the horizontal water migration the water content in this area is larger than that in other un mulched area the phenomenon becomes obvious near the soil surface there also exists deviation for the one dimensional samples with un mulched top surface and the maximum mass water content deviation is 0 01 kg kg however the predicted water contents are highly consistent with the experimental values except that for sample 1 which illustrates that setting a coarse sand layer is essential to reduce the water supplying rate when the evaporation rate is smaller than the supplying rate of water in silty clay 6 2 temperature comparison fig 12 shows a comparison between the predicted temperature soil grains and pore fluid and the measured temperature at different time for sample 4 the predicted temperatures are basically smaller than the measured values the phenomenon might be caused by the imperfection of evaporation rate affected by the precipitated solute the predicted temperature of soil grains and fluid near soil surface is obviously different and the maximum deviation can reach 1 5 k in the upper section of the sample fig 12d this phenomenon is mainly caused by the evaporation heat transfer of pore water large amount of latent heat will accumulate in the upper section of samples due to the continuous evaporation the soil grains can directly receive the heat from the pore air thus the temperature difference between soil grains and pore fluid is significant in the upper section of samples for the laboratory experiments it is difficult to accurately analyze whether the measured transient temperature on the soil surface is closer to the fluid temperature or the soil grain temperature or their average temperature from the trends of the measured temperature the consistency between the predicted and measured temperatures of the first to the third soil samples and the contact area between the fluid or soil grains and the temperature sensors it can roughly be concluded that the measured temperature is mainly composed of the fluid temperature in the soil pores 6 3 solute concentration comparison in this study the supersaturation of solute was not considered under positive temperature and solute will precipitate from the solutions when the solubility limit is reached it can be seen from fig 13 a that some deviations appear in the simulation of soil surface salt concentration the maximum difference in salt concentration can reach 0 05 kg kg and 0 04 kg kg for the 2nd and 4th samples respectively the reason can be contributed to scraping too much salt near the soil surface during sampling however the predicted solute concentration is highly consistent with the experimental values owing to the transition zone of water a dilution area of solute concentration accordingly appears near the dividing line in un mulched area 7 conclusions to reasonably consider the non equilibrium phase change and temperature difference between the soil grain and fluid during the moisture heat gas salt transport a novel transport model was developed series of evaporation experiments were conducted in laboratory to validate the availability of the developed model according to the experiments and numerical simulation some conclusions were made as follows 1 the surface permeability can obviously affect the moisture transport under evaporation the loss rate of water under a mulch plate is smaller than that on uncovered area the liquid water can migrate from the covered area into the uncovered area under water gradient which leads to the phenomenon that the water content in uncovered area near the dividing line is higher than that in other areas and the lateral migration of water decreases with depth at a certain depth 2 the change regular of solute concentration is consistent with the transport regular of liquid water the impermeable surface can delay the precipitation time of solute near the diving line owing to the unsaturated solution migrated from cover area besides vapor condensation occurred at the soil bottom and led to the dilution of the solute concentration 3 the predicted values of the moisture heat gas salt transport model show a good agreement with the observed data which illustrates that the model is effective to predict the moisture heat gas salt transport in unsaturated saline soil under evaporation meanwhile the temperature difference between soil grains and pore fluid can reach 1 5 k in this study due to the effect of evaporation action thus it is key to consider the temperature difference between soil grains and pore fluid to describe the moisture heat gas salt transport the laboratory experiments indicate that the model in the study can effectively describe the moisture heat gas salt transport behavior in unsaturated saline soil under evaporation to improve the application of the model more large scale and long time simulations will be further conducted meanwhile the isotropy assumption is used in the model without considering the moisture heat gas salt transport difference in different direction the future research will explore the anisotropic transport behavior in addition the model in the study mainly focuses on the heat and mass transfer in soil by considering the non equilibrium phase change and temperature difference between the soil grain and fluid however complex thermo mechanical process occurs in soil therefore we will develop the current model to consider the mechanical behavior in our future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

3944,soil desertification and salinization are common in arid and semi arid regions and can result in roads being buried by quicksand or corroded by salts therefore it is important to investigate the salt transportation under evaporation in these regions to analyze the transport law of moisture heat gas and salt in unsaturated saline soil a series of evaporation tests were conducted based on these tests the novel mass and energy conservation equations suitable for medium transfer in unsaturated saline soil were then developed in the model the non equilibrium phase process between the liquid water and vapor was considered meanwhile the convective heat transfer caused by small temperature difference between the liquid pore water and soil grains was also considered validation of the model was illustrated by comparisons between the simulation and experimental results it is found that the evaporation of pore water is accompanied by the precipitation of solute the vapor condensation at low temperature zone can dilute the solute concentration in addition the permeability of surface has significant effect on the moisture heat gas salt migration the novel model can effectively describe the moisture heat gas salt interaction process and reveal the temperature difference between soil grains and pore fluid under the evaporation of pore water keywords unsaturated saline soil non equilibrium equation mixture theory moisture heat gas salt transport 1 introduction saline soil is widely distributed in china fig 1 a you et al 2020 salt precipitation and salt expansion under evaporation has been a key problem for engineering constructions built in unsaturated saline soil regions barica 1972 ma 2017 wu 2016 the salt migration and expansion results from the complex moisture heat gas salt mhgs interaction process within the unsaturated saline soil fang et al 2018 bergstad et al 2018 han and zhou 2018 sakai et al 2009 the components in unsaturated saline soil contain soil grains salts moisture including the liquid water and vapor and gas including the vapor and dry air evaporation under humidity difference between the pores and atmosphere can cause the migration of solution thus salts will precipitate into the soil pores when the solubility is reached with the increase of precipitated salts the evaporation rate of water will gradually decrease fujimaki et al 2006 zeidouni et al 2009 mohamed et al 2000 however once a salt crust is formed water will progressively accumulate under the salt crust due to the temperature gradient in seasonal frozen soil regions wang 2019 which causes the deliquescence and dissolution of the precipitated salts numerous works on the mhgs interaction within saline soil have been conducted for the experimental researches fujimaki et al 2006 explored the effects of salt crust on evaporation rate noborio and mcinnes 1993 investigated the thermal conductivity of salt affected soils sheng et al 2016 revealed the formation and development mechanism of salt crust on soil surface konukcu et al 2004 determined the water content in the transition zone rose et al 2005 studied the effects of water table depth on evaporation and salt accumulation from saline groundwater gran et al 2011a believed that the evaporation front is key to understand the moisture salt transport wu et al 2016 systematically investigated the dynamics of water heat and solute transport within saline soil these studies show that the moisture salt transport can be affected by soil types solute types water content water table depth and boundary conditions which indicates that the migration of mhgs in soils under evaporation and freezing thawing action is a complex process however few researches focus on the effect of the surface coverage conditions on the transport process e g the impermeable asphalt pavement and the permeable slope of an embankment in arid and semi arid regions fig 1b to comprehensively describe the moisture heat salt transport in theory several models have been established and developed by considering the effects of moisture heat and salt in transfer flux equations nassar and horton 1992 nassar et al 1997 gran et al 2011a gran et al 2011b koniorczyk 2012 smits et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 castellazzi et al 2016 jambhekar et al 2015 fernanda et al 2014 nassar and horton 1989 in these models an enhance vapor flux term named enhancement factor was proposed to consider the effect of the temperature difference between grains and fluids on vapor transfer cass et al 1984 campbell 1985 jiang et al 2006 however the enhancement factor is insufficient to reflect the thermo physical properties of fluid e g the relative humidity the water dynamic viscosity and the surface tension meanwhile these models neglected the effect of dry air on the moisture salt migration although the mixture theory can effectively describe the influence of dry air by mass fraction koniorczyk 2012 castellazzi et al 2016 jambhekar et al 2015 halder et al 2011 smits et al 2012 gran et al 2011a gran et al 2011b the temperature difference between soil grains and fluid was also neglected which can affect the migration of vapor in unsaturated soil under non isothermal philip and de vries 1957 in this study to further explore the moisture heat gas salt transport mechanism and solve the above limitations we firstly conducted a series of evaporation experiments for silty clay in an open system with water supply at the soil bottom among these tests the top for two soil samples were halfly covered with acrylic plate to simulate the impermeable surface and the top for other two samples were directly exposed to the environment to simulate the permeable surface then we developed a novel model with four liquid water vapor dry air solute mass conversion equations and two solid and fluid energy conservation equations to fully describe the mhgs transport behavior within unsaturated saline soil finally we verified the applicability of the model by comparing the predicted and measured values including the temperature concentration and water content 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the soil used in our experiments was silty clay from the qaidam basin in qinghai province china fig 1a to eliminate the effect of natural salinization the soil was desalted by distilled water the porosity of the soil sample is 0 34 and the bulk density is 1770 kg m3 the grain size distribution curve is shown in fig 2 according to the engineering practice three factors were considered in the experiments including the initial solute concentration the surface condition and the type of supply water correspondingly the sample preparation process was listed as follows 1 salt was firstly added into distilled water to make solution according to the initial concentration then the solution was mixed with dry soil to make saline samples according to the saturation 2 half of the mulch plate was placed on the top of the sample to simulate the impermeable surface such as the asphalt pavement in fig 1b and a plastic film 1 mm was placed between the mulch plate and sample top to prevent the water evaporation and 3 the concentration of supply solution was the same for two samples to clearly illustrate the effect of the three factors on the mhgs process four experimental cases were set in table 1 2 2 experimental method the testing apparatus for evaporation experiments is shown in fig 3 the sample was cylindrical with a diameter of 0 2 m and a height of 0 25 m fig 3 the sample was sealed with plastic membranes and kept at a constant temperature for 24 h the sample was then packed into an acrylic cylinder the outside wall of the acrylic cylinder was wrapped with 0 03 m thermal insulation material to avoid lateral heat exchange between the sample and the ambient the operating temperature of the chamber ranges from 243 15 k to 303 15 k with an error of 0 1 k the bottom temperature of the sample was controlled by a porous plate connected with a cold bath which can control the temperature range from 233 15 k to 313 15 k with an error of 0 5 k to simulate the water recharge the porous plate was hydraulically connected to a mariotte flask to supply solution or distilled water fig 3 a coarse sand layer with a thickness of 0 02 m was placed at the base of the sample to reduce the solution supplement rate and the final water content at the soil bottom was regarded as the water content boundary to analyze the effects of permeability characteristics on the moisture salt transport the water content and solute concentration in the same area under the mulched and un mulched boundaries were tested at the end of these experiments fig 4 a respectively water content was determined by the oven drying method solute concentration was calculated via the electrical conductivity measured by the 5te sensor the controlled temperatures at the bottom of the sample and the ambient were maintained unchanged during the whole test resistance thermometers with the accuracy of 0 05 k were inserted into the sample to measure temperature variations along the depth fig 4b the interval between two adjacent thermometers is 0 04 m the temperature data were automatically collected and stored by a data logger 2 3 experimental results and analyses to explore the regular of water migration and temperature change within samples the tested data for the 2nd and 4th samples are selected in fig 5 a the water content under the mulched surface is higher than that under the un mulched surface and the water content changes with height of the sample during the whole test the difference in water content under the surface reduces with height for the halfly mulched sample due to the effect of the evaporation resistance of the impermeable layer however the water content is uniformly distributed before the test and gradually decreases at the soil surface under evaporation in fig 4b which is obvious for the un mulched soil sample besides the evaporation rate is smaller than the supplying rate of water at the soil bottom which indicates that the coarse sand layer laid on the soil bottom is effective to reduce the solution supplement rate fig 6 shows that the temperature difference at the bottom section of the soil is smaller than that at the top section whether it is a semi closed or open top boundary the phenomenon for the soil sample with un mulched surface fig 6b is more obvious than that for the soil sample with halfly mulched surface fig 6a the difference in temperatures at different sections may be caused by the difference in thermal behavior of soil because the thermal conductivity usually decreases with the decreasing water content chung and horton 1987 zhang et al 2014 therefore the difference in temperature reduces in the 2nd soil sample because the bulk thermal conductivity increases with the increasing of water content in fig 7 the distribution of the solute concentration is also different under two surfaces during the evaporation the change rate of solute concentration in the uncovered area is larger than that in the covered area besides the change rate of solute concentration near the diving line in the uncovered area is smaller than that far from the diving line however it is reverse in the covered area the reason is that the water migrates from the covered area to the uncovered area the solute concentration at the bottom of the 4th soil sample slightly decreases which may be related to the low temperature the low temperature can promote vapor condensation when the dew point temperature is reached according to gran et al 2011a and gran et al 2011b 3 mathematic model complex mhgs interaction process occurs within the unsaturated saline soil numerical simulation is an effective method to further reveal the mhgs process to accurately describe the complex medium variation a novel mhgs transfer model is proposed in this study considering the water vapor phase change process and the convective heat transfer process between pore moisture and soil particles 3 1 mass conservation equations fig 8 shows the infinitesimal micro volume element the lengths of sides are dx dy dz respectively and the low volume element represents the mass and energy flux taking the x axis for example flux on the left cross section is qxdydz and flux on the right cross section is qx q x x dx dydz the increment between the left and right cross sections is q x x dxdydz similarly the flux of other cross section can be analogized by the same method anderson 1995 assuming that the direction of flux points to the positive axis the net outflow along x axis can be expressed as ρl0qw xdxdydz ρgqg xdxdydz and ρsaltqs xdxdydz respectively ρl0 ρg ρsalt kg m3 are the densities of freshwater air and salt respectively qw qg qs m s are the flux equation of liquid water air and salts respectively the total mass of the components liquid water gas and dissolved solutes in the volume element is θsρl0sl 1 w dxdydz θsρgsgdxdydz and θsρl0slwdxdydz respectively the time rate of mass increment of components is θssl 1 w tdxdydz θsρgsg tdxdydz and θsslwρl0 tdxdydz respectively the sum of each saturation in soil is equal to 1 1 s l s g s salt 1 θ l θ s θ g θ s θ salt θ s 1 the mass fraction of vapor and dry air in pore can be expressed as 2 w v w a 1 w v m v m g ρ v ρ g where θs θg θl and θsalt m3 m3 are the volumetric content of pores porosity air liquid water and precipitated salts respectively sl sg and ssalt are the saturation of liquid water air and precipitated salts respectively w wv and wa kg kg are the mass fraction of solute vapor and dry air respectively mv and mg kg are the mass of vapor and air respectively ρv kg m3 is the vapor density and t s is the time according to the law of mass conservation the governing equations of liquid water vapor dry air and solute can be obtained as follows 3a θ s ρ l 0 s l 1 w t q l w m eva 3b θ s ρ g s g w v t q g v m eva 3c θ s ρ g s g w a t q g a 0 3d w θ s ρ l 0 s l t q l s m pre where qw l qv g qa g and qs l kg m2 s are the total flux of the liquid water vapor air and solute respectively meva kg m3 s is the phase change rate between water and vapor due to the evaporation or condensation the mass of water transfered from one phase to another per unit volume per unit time and mpre kg m3 s is the precipitation rate of the solute under the action of evaporation water evaporated from the soil surface into the air while the solute remains in solution and then precipitates in soil pores when the solubility limit is reached the effect of the precipitated salts on the evaporation rate is considered in the relevant equations and the mass of precipitated salts per unit volume can be quantified as follows 4 s ρ l 0 θ s s l w w s w w s 0 w w s where s kg m3 is the mass of precipitated salts per unit volume which also can be expressed as s θsalt ρsalt and ws kg kg is the solubility of solute assuming that the precipitated salts don t migrate the governing equation for salt transport can be derived in eq 5 by combining eqs 3d and 4 5 s t w s θ s ρ l 0 s l t w ρ l 0 q w 0 3 2 energy conservation equations the soil grains salts liquid water vapor and dry air can transfer heat the liquid water and vapor cannot only conduct heat but also transfer sensible heat and the latent heat of the evaporation meanwhile the precipitated salts also have effect on the process of heat transfer existed studies have shown that there is a temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid cass et al 1984 philip and de vries 1957 jiang et al 2006 in this study the temperature difference is considered for the fluid including the liquid water vapor and dry air and soil grains heat flux equations the heat transport rates for liquid water and soil grains are different because the thermal conductivity of liquid water is larger than that of soil grains owing to the ionic electrostatic and molecular interaction derjaguin and churaev 1974 soil grains are always wrapped by film water fig 9 lebeau and konrad 2010 tokunaga 2009 therefore all the latent heat of the evaporation is firstly received by the liquid water and then transported to the soil grains the energy conservation equation for the soil grains can be defined as 6 t ρ s c s θ soil t s t 0 θ soil λ soil t s h sf a sf t s t f where ρs kg m3 is the density of the soil grain cs j kg k is the specific heat capacity of soil grain θsoil m3 m3 is the volumetric content of soil

heat transfer coefficient and asf 1 m is the specific surface area of capillary tube in this study the heat exchange between liquid water and soil grains includes the conductive and convective heat transfer the sensible heat of liquid water and the latent heat of moisture thus the energy conservation equation for the liquid water can be described as 7 t ρ l 0 c l s l t f t 0 θ s s l λ l t f ρ l

λ a θ s s a w a t f ρ g c a w a t f t 0 q g where ca j kg k is the specific heat capacity of the air and λa j m s k is the bulk thermal conductivity of the air the thermo physical properties of soil are affected by the precipitated salts to avoid the non convergence during the calculation it is assumed that the temperature of the dissolved salts and precipitated salts is consistent with that of the soil grains the energy conservation equation of precipitated salts can then be written as 10 t ρ salt c salt θ salt t s t 0 θ salt λ salt t s where csalt j kg k is the specific heat capacity of the salts and λsalt j m s k is the bulk thermal conductivity of the salts therefore the summarized heat conservation equation for the solid terms is 11 t ρ salt c salt θ salt t t 0 ρ s c s θ soil t t

equations 4 1 flux equation for each component in this study it is assumed that the soil grains and precipitated salts are not moved therefore the components that can be transported in soil pores are moisture dry air and dissolved salts these pore components are mainly transported by means of convection and diffusion 4 1 1 flux equation of liquid water in reality the pore fluid consists of liquid water dissolved salts and air for simplicity the air dissolved in liquid water is not considered here from the definition of binary solutions the liquid water flux equation can be calculated as

kelvin formula φm 2tsscosα0 ρl0gr r m is the pore radius α0 o is the contact angle between the soil grains and pores water and tss n m is the surface tension of liquid water sadeghi et al 2010 which can be written as 15 t ss affected by temperature and salt a b w m t f 273 15 n w t f 273 15 o w 2 p t f 273 15 2 76 325 0 171 t f 273 15 surface tension of freshwater the values for related parameters in eq 15 are listed in table 2 extending eq 14 by chain rule the new liquid water flux expression can be written in eq 16 considering the effect of salt sieve and increased density of the solution 16 q w k s k rw ρ l 0 g μ φ m s l s l φ m t ss d t ss d t f t f ϕ 1 φ m t ss d t ss dw w ρ ls ρ l 0 z where ϕ1 is the osmotic efficiency coefficient which can be expressed as ϕ1 rss rw bw rw

water which can be expressed as ρls ρl0 1 702 24 w hughes and sanford 2004 4 1 2 flux equation of vapor similar to liquid water convection and diffusion are the two main ways for vapor migration in soil pores 17 q g v w v ρ g q g q v d i f f where qv diff kg m2 s is the vapor diffusion flux density wvρgqg represents the convection term and qv diff represents the diffusion term which can be obtained from fick law smits et al 2011 18 q v d i f f d va τ g θ a w v where dva m2 s is the molecular diffusivity of vapor in the air which can be written as dva 2 29 10 5 tf 273 15 1 75 kimball et al 1976 and τg is the tortuosity factor millington and quirk 1961 which can be written as τg θs θssl θsalt 7 3 θ the vapor density is closely related to the water content fluid temperature and solute concentration it is reasonable to use chain rule to extend eq 18 however for simplicity the effects of the fluid temperature and solute concentration are not considered in eq 18 4 1 3 flux equation for dry air based on the convection diffusion equation the total dry air flux equation can be written as halder et al 2011 19 q g a w a ρ g q g q v d i f f where qg represents the total gas flux which can be derived from fick s law 20 q g k s k rg μ g p g where krg is the relative permeability of pores gas pg pa is the gas pressure in the pore and μg kg m s is the dynamic viscosity of gas or dry

equilibrium theory the process of phase change between liquid water and vapor is instantaneous while it takes some time for the phase change in the non equilibrium theory the existing research has shown that the result calculated by the non equilibrium model is better than that by the equilibrium model smits et al 2011 therefore the non equilibrium model was adopted in this study to calculate the rate of phase change between liquid water and vapor eq 22 can be employed according to these studies bixler 1985 zhang and datta 2004 22 m eva b m θ l θ r r t f m w ρ vs r h ρ g w v where bm is an empirical fitting parameter that is assumed to be a function of soil properties and is adjusted by comparison with the experimental data in this study the value of bm is assumed to be 0 000021 smits et al 2011 mw kg mol is the molecular weight of water θr m3 m3 is the residual volumetric water content ρvs kg m3 is the saturated vapor density and rh is the relative humidity however eq 22 cannot be used if the saturation of gas phase decreases to be zero in any region as pressure cannot be determined in the region to deal with the above problem the gas saturation is forced to be a small value to prevent the gas phase from going to be zero during the numerical solving process according to halder et al 2011 4 1 4 flux equation for solute according to the previous research the transport of solute is totally reliant on liquid water the transport of solute with liquid water is defined as the convection transport and the transport of solute under solute concentration is defined as the diffusion transport it is assumed that salts cannot be transported with air thus the total solute flux equation can be expressed as castellazzi et al 2016 23 q l s w ρ l 0 q w q s d i f f where qs diff kg m2 s is the solute diffusion flux density the first item on the right side of eq 23 represents the convection term the second item represents the diffusion term which can be written as bear

expressed as dm dcqw θs θsalt sl and dc m is the longitudinal dispersivity 4 2 transport properties the transport properties include hydraulic properties and thermo physical properties the hydraulic properties contain the characteristic curve and the permeability of the liquid water and gas the thermo physical properties include the thermal conductivity of soil grains moisture and air etc 4 2 1

caused by the electrical field and van der waals field and the gravitational potential lu and likos 2004 for simplicity the potentials caused by the electrical field and van der waals field are not considered here 28 φ tot φ m φ o z where φtot and φo m are the total matric head and the osmotic water potential respectively φm is the matric potential and z refers to the gravity head the combined potential can be directly estimated from the vapor pressure in the unsaturated soil the vapor pressure is lowered by the interaction with a soil matrix and by the solute it contains 29 rh r h m r h o

f 4 2 3 dry air transport properties to obtain the relative permeability of dry air the vapor content in the soil is not considered by referring to the derivation procedure for the relative permeability of liquid water the relative permeability of the dry air in soil is obtained the matric head can be written in the form of eq 33 by exchanging the location of the independent variable and dependent variable in the vg model 33 φ m s l 1 1 n 0 1 1 n 0 α it is assumed that the effect of precipitated salts on matric head can be neglected the relationship between the matric head and air saturation can be expressed by eq 34 34 φ m 1 s g 1 1 n 0 1 1 n 0 α the matric head and relative permeability of liquid water are connected by the mualem model 35 k rw s l s l 0 5 0 s w d s l φ m 0 1

convection heat transfer between solid and fluid occurs when there is a variable temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid it is assumed that the soil grains are spherical and that the entire surface contributes to the heat transfer then the volumetric heat coefficient can be calculated by 37 h v h sf a sf where hv w k m3 represents the volumetric heat coefficient the symbol asf directly determines the temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid when the value of asf is very large the temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid is not obvious because the energy can be quickly transported from the fluid to the soil grains conversely the temperature difference between them gradually increases because the time for energy transport is needed few studies have listed the calculation method for asf jiang et al 2006 however the value of asf calculated by the method is usually so large that the temperature between the soil grains and fluid is identical which is inconsistent with the research results cass et al 1984 campbell 1985 to reasonably determine the asf a new method is proposed in this study soil grains and fluid are the two parts of convective heat transfer according the existing literatures jiang et al 2006 the specific surface area is calculated by the ratio of surface area to the volume of soil grains to evaluate the temperature difference between the soil grains and fluid the specific surface area in this study is calculated by the ratio of surface area to the volume of capillary tubes as it is assumed that the soil grains are wrapped by liquid water therefore the asf can be calculated by the nearly saturated capillary tube 38 a sf 2 π r l π r 2 l 2 r where l m is the length of the capillary tube and r is the pore radius of soil grain based on the kelvin equation the pore radius in eq 38 can be transformed into the relationship between the surface tension and matric head 39 a sf 2 r 2 φ m 0 149 c m 2 if the matric head is equal to zero the convective heat transfer between the soil grains and fluid will stop meanwhile the temperature difference between them will be very large with the duration of the evaporation furthermore the saturated matric head is difficult to be obtained by the laboratory experiment thus the matric head is replaced by the air entry matric head to calculate the specific surface area tinjum and benson 1997 recognized the similarities of the fitting parameters between the vg and the brooks and corey bc model brooks and corey 1964 and proposed an empirical relationship to calculate the air entry matric head φ b for a series of compacted clay specimens eq 40 can be obtained when φ b ranges from about 1 kpa to 100 kpa 40 α 0 78 φ b 1 26 where φb m is the air entry matric head substituting the air matric head into eq 41 we can obtain 41 a sf 1 56 0 149 c m 2 α 1 1 26 5 solution conditions and key parameters to solve the partial differential equations eqs 2 3 and 11 the initial values and boundary conditions are key to obtain accurate results the initial values used in this model include the temperature solute concentration water content and air pressure in soil the boundary conditions are boundary temperature and atmospheric relative humidity etc 5 1 initial conditions the relevant initial conditions ic are listed as follows refer to tables 1 and 3 ic for eq 3a 42a s i sli ic for eq 3b 42b w i wvi ic for eq 3c 42c p g p amb ic for eq 3d 42d w i w 1i ic for eq 11 42e ts t0 ic for eq 12 42f tf t0 5 2 boundary conditions boundary conditions in the presented model include the dirichlet the first type neuman the second type and robin the third type boundary conditions the pressure at the boundary which is open to the air environment is taken as the ambient pressure 43 pg sur p amb where pg sur and pamb pa are the air pressures at the sample surface and the atmospheric pressure respectively it is necessary to convert liquid water into vapor for the liquid water evaporated into the air therefore the surface and lateral boundary conditions for eq 3a is taken as zero the surface boundary condition for eq 3b is defined as the difference between the atmosphere relative humidity and pore relative humidity at the soil surface daamen and simmonds 1996 with the evaporation the salts will be precipitated from the solution and fill the soil

air for the energy conservation equation eq 12 there is energy going out due to bulk flow heat lost due to surface evaporation and convective heat transfer with the air the heat transfer between the soil grains and air is 45 n h s s u r h sa t s s u r t a where nh s sur w m2 is the heat flux density between the soil grains and atmosphere hsa can be expressed as saito et al 2006 46 h sa c a r a p

besides the resistance from soil grains is often larger than that of the aerodynamic therefore only the linear equation for the surface resistance camillo and gurney 1986 is considered in this study

the soil samples in this study is directly related to the surface mulch the un mulched samples can be regarded as the one dimensional model the halfly mulched samples should be regarded as a three dimensional model because there is horizontal transport of moisture and salts the geometry of the three dimensional model is shown in fig 10 5 4 model parameters six variables water content vapor content air pressure soil grains temperature fluid temperature and solute concentration need to be simultaneously solved the model parameters used in the calculation process are given in table 3 6 numerical simulation and model validation the objective of this section is to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model by comparing the predicted values with the tested data film transport can be neglected during the simulations due to the limited test time and water supplement at the sample bottom 6 1 water content comparison fig 11 shows a comparison between the predicted and measured water content for the semi mulched samples the simulated values at different depths and areas agree well with the measured values except for sample 1 with halfly mulched top surface fig 11a the slight deviation may be caused by the fact that the predicted values represent the value of a point on soil surface while the test data is the average value of water content at a certain depth according to the predicted curves of semi mulched samples we can know that there is an obvious transition zone caused by the horizontal water migration the water content in this area is larger than that in other un mulched area the phenomenon becomes obvious near the soil surface there also exists deviation for the one dimensional samples with un mulched top surface and the maximum mass water content deviation is 0 01 kg kg however the predicted water contents are highly consistent with the experimental values except that for sample 1 which illustrates that setting a coarse sand layer is essential to reduce the water supplying rate when the evaporation rate is smaller than the supplying rate of water in silty clay 6 2 temperature comparison fig 12 shows a comparison between the predicted temperature soil grains and pore fluid and the measured temperature at different time for sample 4 the predicted temperatures are basically smaller than the measured values the phenomenon might be caused by the imperfection of evaporation rate affected by the precipitated solute the predicted temperature of soil grains and fluid near soil surface is obviously different and the maximum deviation can reach 1 5 k in the upper section of the sample fig 12d this phenomenon is mainly caused by the evaporation heat transfer of pore water large amount of latent heat will accumulate in the upper section of samples due to the continuous evaporation the soil grains can directly receive the heat from the pore air thus the temperature difference between soil grains and pore fluid is significant in the upper section of samples for the laboratory experiments it is difficult to accurately analyze whether the measured transient temperature on the soil surface is closer to the fluid temperature or the soil grain temperature or their average temperature from the trends of the measured temperature the consistency between the predicted and measured temperatures of the first to the third soil samples and the contact area between the fluid or soil grains and the temperature sensors it can roughly be concluded that the measured temperature is mainly composed of the fluid temperature in the soil pores 6 3 solute concentration comparison in this study the supersaturation of solute was not considered under positive temperature and solute will precipitate from the solutions when the solubility limit is reached it can be seen from fig 13 a that some deviations appear in the simulation of soil surface salt concentration the maximum difference in salt concentration can reach 0 05 kg kg and 0 04 kg kg for the 2nd and 4th samples respectively the reason can be contributed to scraping too much salt near the soil surface during sampling however the predicted solute concentration is highly consistent with the experimental values owing to the transition zone of water a dilution area of solute concentration accordingly appears near the dividing line in un mulched area 7 conclusions to reasonably consider the non equilibrium phase change and temperature difference between the soil grain and fluid during the moisture heat gas salt transport a novel transport model was developed series of evaporation experiments were conducted in laboratory to validate the availability of the developed model according to the experiments and numerical simulation some conclusions were made as follows 1 the surface permeability can obviously affect the moisture transport under evaporation the loss rate of water under a mulch plate is smaller than that on uncovered area the liquid water can migrate from the covered area into the uncovered area under water gradient which leads to the phenomenon that the water content in uncovered area near the dividing line is higher than that in other areas and the lateral migration of water decreases with depth at a certain depth 2 the change regular of solute concentration is consistent with the transport regular of liquid water the impermeable surface can delay the precipitation time of solute near the diving line owing to the unsaturated solution migrated from cover area besides vapor condensation occurred at the soil bottom and led to the dilution of the solute concentration 3 the predicted values of the moisture heat gas salt transport model show a good agreement with the observed data which illustrates that the model is effective to predict the moisture heat gas salt transport in unsaturated saline soil under evaporation meanwhile the temperature difference between soil grains and pore fluid can reach 1 5 k in this study due to the effect of evaporation action thus it is key to consider the temperature difference between soil grains and pore fluid to describe the moisture heat gas salt transport the laboratory experiments indicate that the model in the study can effectively describe the moisture heat gas salt transport behavior in unsaturated saline soil under evaporation to improve the application of the model more large scale and long time simulations will be further conducted meanwhile the isotropy assumption is used in the model without considering the moisture heat gas salt transport difference in different direction the future research will explore the anisotropic transport behavior in addition the model in the study mainly focuses on the heat and mass transfer in soil by considering the non equilibrium phase change and temperature difference between the soil grain and fluid however complex thermo mechanical process occurs in soil therefore we will develop the current model to consider the mechanical
