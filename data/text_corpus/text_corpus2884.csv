14420,a nitrogen budget for wastewater stabilisation ponds in tropical northern australia indicated a deficit between influent and effluent total nitrogen of 46 5 stable nitrogen isotope ratios in pond waters and gas emission measurements showed that the deficit was a result of loss of mainly dinitrogen gas while emissions of nitrous oxide and ammonia were minor we explored spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen cycling across the pond system by analysing diversity and function of denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa genes known to be responsible for nitrogen gas emission the relative gene abundance and activity supported the physicochemical evidence that the budgetary nitrogen deficit was largely due to dinitrogen gas emission contrary to expectation most of the dinitrogen gas emissions appeared to occur after the first facultative pond despite nosz genes being abundant and active this suggests that other barriers to effective denitrification existed in the facultative pond the dominant abundance and activity of hzsa genes in the final maturation pond indicated that dinitrogen gas emissions from this pond were likely associated with the anammox process keywords anammox denitrification gas emissions nitrogen cycle wastewater stabilisation ponds 1 introduction a key role for waste stabilisation ponds wsp is to remove nitrogen n from wastewater prior to release in a wsp there are several ways n can be removed from the system n can be emitted as n2o nh3 and n2 gases resident algae can also take up n and as the algae die the n is incorporated into settled pond sludge along with the dead algal biomass 1 2 wsp managers routinely rely on measurements of physicochemical tracers such as the concentrations of nutrients in the influent and effluent to monitor wsp performance and tn removal 1 3 however these data provide limited mechanistic or functional information for diagnostics and optimisation of pond performance 2 stable isotope ratios of nitrogen are now increasingly being employed to build a more comprehensive understanding of the source transport fate and impacts of nutrients in receiving water bodies as shown below isotope ratios are commonly reported as δ 15n values as a per mil difference in 15n 14n relative to a reference ratio in atmospheric air δ 15n 0 1 δ15n 15n 14n sample 15n 14n reference 1 1000 effluent derived n is typically more enriched in 15n than naturally occurring sources due to a preference for 14n by bacteria in wsps leading to preferential 14n gas emissions 4 an increasing sewage effluent load can also be detected in sediment which acts as a sink for sewage derived n through burial 5 δ 15n values in effluent are generally 10 compared to background δ 15n values of 2 to 2 in receiving water bodies 6 n isotopes fractionate significantly during microbially mediated n cycle transformations in systems that are not n limited 6 7 isotopic fractionation is especially pronounced in reactions where removal of n occurs through the release of gaseous n species e g nh3 n2o and n2 7 9 due to an enzymatic preference for 14n over 15n gaseous n species typically have low δ 15n values which drive residual n towards higher δ 15n values 8 10 11 δ 15n measurements throughout a multi pond wsp can provide valuable information about zones of likely active gas emission and microbial activity to confirm this additional data are needed such as continuous sampling of n2o and nh3 gas emission patterns over space and time and the activity of microbes specifically associated with n gas emission microbes drive the n cycle 12 10 and microbial functional genes are increasingly used in functional gene arrays to measure gene diversity relative abundance and activity 13 these data can be used in concert with other measures to provide insights into wsp function and are particularly useful for diagnosing underperformance in localised zones for a multi pond system both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria are involved in the n cycle so there is interplay between microbial activity and the oxygen status of the wsp 10 n removal in wsps worldwide are poorly characterised due to the influence of fluctuating temperature and climatic conditions i e rainfall intensity and duration further this is a complex system that relies on a healthy symbiotic relationship between aerobic bacteria and algae 14 aerobic bacteria catabolise organic waste and produce co2 that algae consume for photosynthesis during the day 1 dissolved oxygen do is produced as a by product of photosynthesis and favours the aerobic steps in the n cycle 14 these include ammonia and nitrite oxidation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra associated with the functional genes amoa b nxrb and nrfa at night algae respire and deplete do 1 thus the anaerobic steps anammox denitrification and nitrogen fixation associated with functional genes hzsa nosz and nifh tend to occur at night early morning 12 15 the two steps that are of critical importance in a functional wsp are denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa because they lead to n loss through n2 emission 11 16 in the northern territory pond hydraulics are designed such that the first facultative pond will remove n 3 to achieve this facultative ponds are over 2 m deep to promote stratified oxic and anoxic zones that will facilitate n cycle activity and n2 emission 3 the n reduced waters are then fed into a series of shallow maturation ponds for sanitation 1 based on the intended performance of a multi pond wsp most of the denitrification and anammox should occur in the first facultative pond the value of a wsp n budget is that it provides insight into n transport and loss this is useful information for managing a wsp particularly where the treated effluent will be released into the environment nutrient concentration data based on grab samples have limited value other than for compliance as they are a measure at a single moment in time in contrast stable isotopes gas emission and functional microbial gene assays together provide a powerful approach for understanding wsp function since denitrification nosz genes and anammox hzsa genes pathways lead to n2 production these two functional groups could be useful as surrogates for n2 production and tn budgets to determine whether a multiple angle approach to n assessment in wsps is helpful for understanding n transformation and loss we studied a wsp located in darwin a city in the tropical wet and dry savanna of northern australia a mass balance n budget for the darwin wsp 17 showed that 42 of tn was removed from treated effluent between 2013 14 however only 11 of this removed n settled into the sludge 17 this left a 46 5 tn 147 4 t yr deficit in the n budget which is likely lost through emission of gaseous n species we investigated how measurements of stable isotopes gas emissions physicochemistry n chemistry gene abundance and activity addressed the identified gap within the wsp budget since the budget was averaged over the year we designed our sampling regime to repeatedly measure the two seasons four times so that our averaged data was representative of the budget based on the munksgaard et al 17 budget our aim was to measure abundance and activity of microbial genes for the denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa pathways we also used diel variation in pond do nh3 and n2o emissions and n isotope analysis of pond water to gather evidence to address the suggestion that the 46 5 n deficit could be due mainly to n2 gas emission further aims were to determine if the first facultative pond 1 was in fact removing more n than the maturation ponds as it was designed to do our final aim was to determine whether there was a link between diel patterns of do levels in the ponds gas emission stable isotopes and functional genes 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site was a wsp in the wet dry tropics of northern australia which services the northern suburbs of darwin with an estimated population of 47 466 in 2013 the five pond system comprises one facultative and four maturation ponds fig 1 with a total volume of 336 600 m3 and an effective volume of 156 240 m3 accounting for the volume of settled sludge the system was designed to treat approximately 105 ml day during peak wet season flow conditions frequent vertical mixing from wind shearing across the water surface occurs in these ponds when the ponds have no sludge raw sewage influent has a retention time of 10 days in a facultative pond pond 1 facultative pond effluent then feeds into a maturation pond pond 2 and retained for seven days for sanitation fig 1 wastewaters are further sanitised in a smaller and increasingly shallower 3 pond maturation series before final release of treated effluent after five days retention pond 5 for this study the inlet and outlets of ponds 1 and 5 were selected for sampling after initial investigations showed no significant differences in physicochemical and bacterial signatures between ponds 4 and 5 the physicochemical and bacterial similarities between pond 4 and 5 suggested that sampling at the pond 5 inlet would not be subject to variable mixing effects 2 2 stable isotopes samples for stable isotope analysis were collected in one litre bottles at the outlets of ponds 1 and 5 fig 1 on 3 consecutive days in october 2014 samples were placed on ice but not frozen and transferred to the laboratory as soon as possible within a few hours where they were immediately centrifuged and filtered gf c 47 mm pre combusted particulates predominantly algal and bacterial matter were collected on filters and the filtered volume recorded the dry mass of solids on the filters was determined gravimetrically the filter was analysed for n isotope composition of total particulate n filtrate samples predominantly dissolved nh3 and minor organic n nox were acidified with hcl to ph 2 and evaporated to dryness on a freeze dryer the dried solids were analysed for n isotope composition of total dissolved n mass spectrometric analysis was carried out by ea sirms bulk solids analysis at southern cross university to scale to the air n2 standard three in house secondary standards and two certified standards protein b2155 elemental microanalysis usgs40 u s geological survey were analysed 2 3 gas emissions nitrous oxide n2o ammonia nh3 carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 emissions were measured in pond 1 and pond 5 fig 1 over two 24 h periods when stable isotope samples were collected emission was not measured in maturation ponds 2 4 a floating gas accumulation chamber was connected to a photo acoustic gas measuring system innova 1412 in a recirculating loop closed accumulation mode an auxiliary gas pump connected to a timer was used to automatically evacuate the accumulation chamber and repeat the measurement cycle every 30 min the flux of n2o and nh3 were calculated from the rate of increase in gas concentrations measured at 2 min intervals during the first 20 min of each measurement cycle instrumental concentration data were calibrated using certified gas standards scott speciality gasses before and after the field campaign emissions of n2 are not measurable using the innova 1412 instrument 2 4 physicochemistry in 2012 and 2013 wastewater samples were collected from ponds 1 and 5 on four occasions during the wet and dry seasons at each site the top 10 cm of the water column surface water and bottom 10 cm benthic water were sampled samples were collected in duplicate in the morning 6 a m 10 am and again in the afternoon 1 pm 5 pm these times will be referred to as morning and afternoon unfiltered one liter waters were collected from the pond 1 inlet and pond 5 inlet and outlet with a peristaltic pump and nalgene tubing in situ measurements of do temperature and ph were simultaneously recorded using the hydrolab quanta wastewater n chemistry was analysed by labmark pty ltd melbourne vic unfiltered one litre wastewater samples were kept on ice during collection fig 1 and stored at 20 c prior to nutrient analysis ammonia analysis includes nh3 and nh4 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were determined using flow injection analysis fia 18 fifteen ml of sample was filtered through polyethersulfone pes 0 45 μm minisart high flow syringe filters prior to analysis of the remaining unfiltered sample portion 10 ml was digested with alkaline potassium persulfate in the autoclave for 1 h at 121 c and analysed by fia for tn queensland health scientific services quality control analyses included blanks duplicates and samples spiked with analyte 2 5 dna and rna processing for denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa assays dna was extracted from filtered 100 ml effluent samples collected with the chemistry samples although we collected nitrogen gene and physicochemical data before the 2013 2014 n budget calculation a review of unpublished monitoring data showed that n mass removal between 2013 14 and 2014 15 only differed by 3 thus the effect of sample timing was likely minimal dna was extracted using the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad

was purified using a thermo scientific genejet pcr purification kit thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa according to the manufacturer s protocol dried cdna were sent to csiro hobart for fga analysis 2 6 functional gene microarray fga a high throughput fga was used to assess the relative abundance and diversity of both denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa bacteria in wsp water samples briefly the fga consists of a small solid substrate glass microscope slide to which a set of targeted oligonucleotide probes is attached the functional gene of interest nosz and hzsa is amplified from dna or cdna extracted from effluent samples a 453 bp fragment of the nitrous oxide reduction nosz gene for denitrification was amplified using the primers nosz f cgytgttcmtcgacagccag 19 and nosz 1622r t7 taatacgactcactatagcgsaccttsttgccstygcg 12 amplification reactions for nosz contained 10 nm of the corresponding reverse primers with a t7 rna polymerase promoter tag at the 5 end plus 30 nm of the t7 promoter as a second reverse primer the hydrazine synthase hzsa gene for anammox was detected with a nested pcr approach firstly the longer fragment of the gene 382 f 2390r 2 kb was amplified with primers hzsa 382 f ggyggdtgycagatatggg and hzsa 2390r atrttrtcccaytgygchcc followed by subsequent nested pcr using primers hzsa 526 f taytttgaaggdgactgg and hzsa 1857r t7 taatacgactcactatagaaabggygaatcatartggc 15 hzsa amplification reactions used with the same t7 promoter tag placement and concentrations as described for nosz amplicons were fluorescently labeled by in vitro transcription and labeled with cy3 utp and hybridised on an array with probes covering the nosz and hzsa genes of multiple bacterial and archaeal clades signals were normalised to a spike control set to 10 000 detailed information about the development and methods of the fga is provided in supplementary information 2 7 drifting sludge mat area estimation floating sludge mats covered the pond surface in the corners of the facultative and maturation ponds mat area was estimated from google earth historical satellite imagery version 7 1 5 1557 2015 google inc mountain view california using arcgis esri software redlands california to georeference images because satellite images were not available on our collection dates an average for pond 1 and 2 drifting sludge was calculated from the following 5 available images 22 10 12 24 11 12 26 06 13 7 10 13 and 09 09 14 satellite images were georeferenced using the wgs 1984 utm zone 52s coordinate system 2 8 statistical analysis physicochemical and fga data was analysed with primer e ltd v7 permanova primer e ltd plymouth uk and minitab v6 statistical software nosz and hzsa data sets were square root transformed and probes that occurred in at least 10 of samples selected the mean signal intensity in each sample was calculated by pooling the signals of the remaining probes data were visualised with minitab interval plots for both tn water chemistry and the fga nosz and hzsa dna and cdna in addition nosz and hzsa dna and cdna results were normalised and displayed in a heatmap using the genespring software where in essence a value of 100 means the signal was equal to that of the control probe hyabp60 whereas a value of 10 indicates that the signal was 10 of the control physicochemical data were normalised and a resemblance matrix generated based on euclidean distance while fga data was square root transformed and a resemblance matrix generated based on bray curtis similarity a permutational anova permanova with 9999 permutations was used to explore differences of fga or physicochemical data between groups of samples the permanova crossed design for both physicochemical and fga data excluding cdna included 5 fixed factors or groups of samples year season 4 levels pond 2 levels location 2 levels time 2 levels and depth 2 levels however the permanova for cdna was calculated using 3 fixed factors year season 4 levels pond 2 levels and location 2 levels a p value of 0 05 2 sided was considered significant for multiple comparisons the bonferroni correction was applied to p values to counteract the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis permdisp primer e ltd plymouth uk was used to check for homogeneity of variance between groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 stable isotopes and gas emissions we found that δ 15n values of dissolved and particulate n in pond 1 2 3 to 4 5 were low and close to background δ 15n values whereas pond 5 values were elevated 13 2 to 19 9 and typical for effluent 6 20 indicating that significant emission of gaseous n occurred after pond 1 gas emission estimates scaled to a full year based on the measurements in ponds 1 and 5 amounted to 0 27 t yr n2o n and 1 26 t yr nh3 n which accounted for less than 1 of the total annual tn removal from the wsp overall n2o and nh3 emissions in ponds 1 and 5 were low n2o 0 5 mg m 2 hr 1 nh3 4 mg m 2 hr 1 the highest n2o emission were at night when do levels were below 0 3 saturation fig 2 nh3 emission was highest during daylight hours in pond 1 coinciding with high do levels fig 2 ammonia volatilization as nh3 gas is more likely at higher temperature and ph 16 but more ammonia might be entering the system in the influent during the day so there would be concomitant increase in the volatilized ammonia component particularly in pond 1 21 since export of n2o and nh3 to the atmosphere was minimal the combined evidence from gas emission and n isotope data demonstrated that substantial emission of n2 must account for the majority of gaseous n removal from the pond system these data agree with mayo and abbas 16 who reported that gas emission was lowest in the facultative pond compared to the maturation pond and that n2 was the likely species emitted from the ponds interestingly in another study by wallace et al 27 nitrogen was removed mainly as no3 and not n2 however the difference in the form of n removal could be due to the geographic and climatic differences between the wallace et al 27 ponds in eastern ontario canada and our study site in tropical north australia 3 2 physicochemistry discrete measurements of do in the morning and afternoon during each field campaign demonstrated that do was lower in the morning mean 2 0 mg l and higher in the afternoon mean 9 0 mg l fig 3 however similar to the continuous do measurements fig 2 there were domains of anoxia in surface waters of pond 1 and 5 fig 3 in the afternoon 25 24 96 of measurements in pond 1 and 8 8 96 in pond 5 were below 20 do saturation fig 3 the do range was large and correlated with changing time of day during sampling where do concentration increased as the day progressed pearson r 0 55 there was a strong pearson correlation between ph and do r 0 74 with pond 1 ph rising from 7 3 in the morning to 7 7 by the afternoon similarly the ph in pond 5 rose from 7 6 to 8 6 by the afternoon as expected for a tropical pond system waters were above 20 c and 67 64 96 of the time temperatures were above 30 c temperatures were cooler mean 28 2 c in the morning and warmer mean 30 9 c in the afternoon the anoxic domains measured in ponds 1 and 5 may be associated with drifting sludge mats fig 4 22 mats accumulated in down wind pond corners and covered an average of 6 2758 m2 of pond 1 and 3 715 m2 of pond 5 the mats reflect the high abundance of suspended and volatile solids in the ponds on average pond 1 total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were 197 mg l range 108 310 mg l and 183 mg l range 116 280 mg l respectively pond 5 concentrations were lower at 162 mg l tss and 154 mg l vss these high concentrations of suspended solids can provide widespread micro domains for coupled nitrification denitrification 23 at the wsp site the first facultative pond is designed to remove n by promotion of suspended solid settlement and denitrification processes and the role of the subsequent maturation ponds is sanitation 3 however our pond data did not support these expected roles the combined isotopic gene and gas emission data suggested that the facultative pond 1 was not the major site of n removal in the wsp pond nutrient measurements supported the isotopic and emission trends because in pond 1 the tn decrease between the inlet 41 6 mg l and outlet 40 3 mg l range 25 170 mg l was only 1 3 mg l there was a 40 decrease in tn at the pond 5 outlet 29 7 mg l particularly in the morning fig 5 range 14 40 mg l nh3 was also higher in pond 1 21 9 mg l than pond 5 12 6 mg l fig 5 regardless of time of day pond 1 range 10 31 2 mg l pond 5 range 6 8 20 mg l however elevated pond 1 tn and nh3 in the morning is likely associated with increased raw inflow of sewage which mirrors the increased use of toilets during the early hours of each day 21 no3 and no2 were low in both ponds in pond 1 no3 was on average 0 1 mg l range 0 006 1 7 mg l and no2 was 0 3 mg l range 0 002 3 1 mg l similarly pond 5 no3 levels averaged 0 2 mg l range 0 002 0 45 mg l and 0 5 mg l range 3 1 0 97 mg l for no2 fig 5 in the afternoon concentrations of both species in pond 5 were twice no3 and 2 9 times no2 of those measured in pond 1 fig 5 3 3 functional gene microarray fga the possibility that n2 emission could account for n loss from this wsp was further assessed by measuring the abundance and activity of genes associated with denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa we chose these two genes because the nosz gene encodes an enzyme that converts n2o to n2 while the hzsa gene encodes an enzyme that converts no2 and nh3 to n2 both genes were abundant relative to probe number and active which supports the possibility that n loss is via n2 emission these genes also provided insight into potential pond performance more specifically although these ponds are biologically and chemically complex one explanation for the below design performance of pond 1 in terms of n2 loss n removal might be the different community structure of denitrifying and anammox communities in each pond 3 4 diurnal measurements of denitrification nosz gene abundance dna probes denitrification nosz gene abundance as determined by the average probe signal intensity was higher in facultative pond 1 in the morning as compared to the afternoon with an average intensity of 2 0 in the morning and 1 6 in the afternoon fig 6 in this study there were 182 nosz probes on the microarray of which 105 fluoresced i e had a signal intensity above 1 of the array control see methods for details fig 7 of these 182 24 probes fluoresced in the 32 pond 1 samples and 19 probes in the 64 pond 5 samples with 15 nosz probes fluorescing in more than 9 samples in both pond 1 and pond 5 samples figs 6 7 of the 16 pond 1 morning samples four probes i e nosz 079 activated sludge taxa emitted a stronger signal above 5 of the control in 5 samples from pond 1 inlet fig 7 these four probes had a mean intensity of just 3 in pond 5 32 in the afternoon the average signal was higher in pond 5 mainly based on probes nosz 070 azospirillum largimobile and nosz 077 agriculture soil clade 4 which had a mean intensity of 1 9 in 16 samples which compared to an average of 1 5 in the morning figs 6 7 denitrification gene abundance is positively correlated with denitrification rates 13 so if denitrification efficiency in pond 1 was less than in pond 5 this may be reflected in lower nosz gene abundance in fact nosz gene abundance was higher in pond 1 than in pond 5 during the morning when do levels were lowest these data therefore do not support the suggestion that denitrification as measured by nosz gene abundance was compromised in pond 1 compared to pond 5 3 5 diurnal measurements of anammox hzsa gene abundance dna probes an alternative explanation might be that denitrification was not the main process leading to n2 production and that the dominant process was anammox as measured by hzsa gene abundance and activity 15 13 in fact the abundance of this gene appeared low in pond 1 and high in pond 5 particularly during the day fig 6 in contrast to nosz of the 42 identified hzsa probes available only 14 had signals above 1 of the control and that occurred in at least 10 of samples most striking was the suggested greater abundance of hzsa in pond 5 during the afternoon figs 6 7 this strong signal was associated with 12 probes especially hzsa 035 hzsa 036 hzsa 010 and hzsa 011 in 28 of the 32 afternoon samples figs 6 7 3 6 denitrification and anammox gene activity cdna probes derived from rna a more direct measure of denitrification is gene activity as measured by cdna derived from rna 13 fga measurement of reverse transcribed pcr products indicated denitrification nosz genes were active in ponds 1 and 5 fig 7 there was a trend for more nosz activity in pond 1 compared to pond 5 fig 7 supported by the previous nosz gene abundance data fig 6 however nosz gene activity levels were not significantly different between the ponds fig 7 which suggests that higher gene abundance in pond 1 may not translate into significantly greater activity further gene abundance dna measurements were collected in both the morning and the afternoon whereas samples for rna cdna analysis were only collected in the afternoon taking abundance and activity together however the data suggest that denitrification as measured by the nosz gene was not compromised in pond 1 compared to pond 5 while there may be other blocks to effective denitrification other factors that accelerate denitrification rates in stabilisation ponds include elevated temperature and high rates of algal production 14 both of which are features of these tropical wsps anammox hzsa gene activity was more than six times higher in pond 5 although this was not statistically significant fig 7 due to the high standard error and low sample number it is not clear why anammox gene abundance was high in pond 5 during the day when do levels were generally high however both the continuous do measures of surface water and the surface water benthic water do measures indicated oxic and anoxic zones occurred at the surface possibly due to the presence of sludge mats that prevent light penetration and consume oxygen 22 24 which presumably provided appropriately anoxic conditions for anammox 15 additionally pond 5 anammox is promoted by high floc vss that creates micro domains of anoxia 23 these data suggest that in this system anammox may be an important component of n loss through n2 emission generally and might account for the relatively superior performance of pond 5 similar to camargo valero et al 2 and mayo abbas 16 no3 and no2 levels were generally low in ponds 1 and 5 14 however it is interesting to note that during the day no3 and no2 levels were significantly higher in pond 5 coinciding with higher anammox gene abundance relative to pond 1 since no2 and indirectly no3 are substrates for the hzsa anammox gene these elevated levels might represent a tipping point that supports anammox in pond 5 in contrast in pond 1 no3 and no2 levels might have been too low for effective anammox 15 in wsps n is removed from wastewater via a combination of settling and accumulation of pond sludge and emissions to the atmosphere of n2o nh3 and n2 however precise accounting of the wsp n budget is rarely feasible if based on routine monitoring data in this study we used several approaches to elucidate the processes associated with n cycling in a wsp located in the wet dry tropics of northern australia n budget calculations for this wsp fig 8 showed that discharged tn in effluent accounted for 42 of influent tn of the remaining 58 tn 11 n is removed in pond sludge leaving a deficit of 46 5 tn the budget indicated that there is significant emission of gaseous n from the pond system to the atmosphere our gas emission physicochemical and gene data support gaseous emission of n for example estimated annual emissions of n2o and nh3 accounted for less than 1 of the tn removal which suggests that the remaining 46 5 n deficit is due to n2 gas emission in addition the presence of denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa in ponds 1 and 2 indicate that these n gas removal pathways are likely the estimated tn removal by n2 emission as a percentage of tn inflow is within a previously reported range of emissions in wastewater treatment ponds wwtp 25 n2o emission values are also similar to the typical range of emissions from wwtps of 0 2 to 2 of produced sewage n 26 furthermore we found that our data and budget are still reflective of the current wsp conditions because a review of industry s unpublished n removal data showed that there was only a 3 difference between 2013 14 and 2017 18 4 conclusions in this study we showed the benefit of using a multidisciplinary approach to quantify n removal in a darwin wsp we showed that facultative pond 1 that was designed to remove most n was not doing this efficiently and that n2 emission occurred after pond 1 in addition the anoxic n cycle steps converting n species to n2 downstream of pond 1 were denitrification and anammox with pond 5 n removal likely associated with anammox rather than denitrification denitrification and annamox gene abundance and activity in the investigated ponds were consistent with the budgetary evidence of major n2 emissions from the wsp the array of physicochemical and biological measurement tools allowed us to resolve the n budget and improved our understanding of where and how nitrogen is removed from the pond system pond management could benefit from this approach because the process identifies wsp function in near real time and diagnoses underperformance in localised zones in a multi pond system identifying zones of poor n removal efficiency in a multi pond wsp helps managers understand where and how performance could be improved it also allows an evaluation of pond design options such as adding baffles desludging or changing the number of treatment ponds to directly address these performance issues funding details this work was

14420,a nitrogen budget for wastewater stabilisation ponds in tropical northern australia indicated a deficit between influent and effluent total nitrogen of 46 5 stable nitrogen isotope ratios in pond waters and gas emission measurements showed that the deficit was a result of loss of mainly dinitrogen gas while emissions of nitrous oxide and ammonia were minor we explored spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen cycling across the pond system by analysing diversity and function of denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa genes known to be responsible for nitrogen gas emission the relative gene abundance and activity supported the physicochemical evidence that the budgetary nitrogen deficit was largely due to dinitrogen gas emission contrary to expectation most of the dinitrogen gas emissions appeared to occur after the first facultative pond despite nosz genes being abundant and active this suggests that other barriers to effective denitrification existed in the facultative pond

performance and tn removal 1 3 however these data provide limited mechanistic or functional information for diagnostics and optimisation of pond performance 2 stable isotope ratios of nitrogen are now increasingly being employed to build a more comprehensive understanding of the source transport fate and impacts of nutrients in receiving water bodies as shown below isotope ratios are commonly reported as δ 15n values as a per mil difference in 15n 14n relative to a reference ratio in atmospheric air δ 15n 0 1 δ15n 15n 14n sample 15n 14n reference 1 1000 effluent derived n is typically more enriched in 15n than naturally occurring sources due to a preference for 14n by bacteria in wsps leading to preferential 14n gas emissions 4 an increasing sewage effluent load can also be detected in sediment which acts as a sink for sewage derived n through burial 5 δ 15n values in effluent are generally 10 compared to background δ 15n values of 2 to 2 in receiving water bodies 6 n isotopes fractionate significantly during microbially mediated n cycle transformations in systems that are not n limited 6 7 isotopic fractionation is especially pronounced in reactions where removal of n occurs through the release of gaseous n species e g nh3 n2o and n2 7 9 due to an enzymatic preference for 14n over 15n gaseous n species typically have low δ 15n values which drive residual n towards higher δ 15n values 8 10 11 δ 15n measurements throughout a multi pond wsp can provide valuable information about zones of likely active gas emission and microbial activity to confirm this additional data are needed such as continuous sampling of n2o and nh3 gas emission patterns over space and time and the activity of microbes specifically associated with n gas emission microbes drive the n cycle 12 10 and microbial functional genes are increasingly used in functional gene arrays to measure gene diversity relative abundance and activity 13 these data can be used in concert with other measures to provide insights into wsp function and are particularly useful for diagnosing underperformance in localised zones for a multi pond system both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria are involved in the n cycle so there is interplay between microbial activity and the oxygen status of the wsp 10 n removal in wsps worldwide are poorly characterised due to the influence of fluctuating temperature and climatic conditions i e rainfall intensity and duration further this is a complex system that relies on a healthy symbiotic relationship between aerobic bacteria and algae 14 aerobic bacteria catabolise organic waste and produce co2 that algae consume for photosynthesis during the day 1 dissolved oxygen do is produced as a by product of photosynthesis and favours the aerobic steps in the n cycle 14 these include ammonia and nitrite oxidation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra associated with the functional genes amoa b nxrb and nrfa at night algae respire and deplete do 1 thus the anaerobic steps anammox denitrification and nitrogen fixation associated with functional genes hzsa nosz and nifh tend to occur at night early morning 12 15 the two steps that are of critical importance in a functional wsp are denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa because they lead to n loss through n2 emission 11 16 in the northern territory pond hydraulics are designed such that the first facultative pond will remove n 3 to achieve this facultative ponds are over 2 m deep to promote stratified oxic and anoxic zones that will facilitate n cycle activity and n2 emission 3 the n reduced waters are then fed into a series of shallow maturation ponds for sanitation 1 based on the intended performance of a multi pond wsp most of the denitrification and anammox should occur in the first facultative pond the value of a wsp n budget is that it provides insight into n transport and loss this is useful information for managing a wsp particularly where the treated effluent will be released into the environment nutrient concentration data based on grab samples have limited value other than for compliance as they are a measure at a single moment in time in contrast stable isotopes gas emission and functional microbial gene assays together provide a powerful approach for understanding wsp function since denitrification nosz genes and anammox hzsa genes pathways lead to n2 production these two functional groups could be useful as surrogates for n2 production and tn budgets to determine whether a multiple angle approach to n assessment in wsps is helpful for understanding n transformation and loss we studied a wsp located in darwin a city in the tropical wet and dry savanna of northern australia a mass balance n budget for the darwin wsp 17 showed that 42 of tn was removed from treated effluent between 2013 14 however only 11 of this removed n settled into the sludge 17 this left a 46 5 tn 147 4 t yr deficit in the n budget which is likely lost through emission of gaseous n species we investigated how measurements of stable isotopes gas emissions physicochemistry n chemistry gene abundance and activity addressed the identified gap within the wsp budget since the budget was averaged over the year we designed our sampling regime to repeatedly measure the two seasons four times so that our averaged data was representative of the budget based on the munksgaard et al 17 budget our aim was to measure abundance and activity of microbial genes for the denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa pathways we also used diel variation in pond do nh3 and n2o emissions and n isotope analysis of pond water to gather evidence to address the suggestion that the 46 5 n deficit could be due mainly to n2 gas emission further aims were to determine if the first facultative pond 1 was in fact removing more n than the maturation ponds as it was designed to do our final aim was to determine whether there was a link between diel patterns of do levels in the ponds gas emission stable isotopes and functional genes 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site was a wsp in the wet dry tropics of northern australia which services the northern suburbs of darwin with an estimated population of 47 466 in 2013 the five pond system comprises one facultative and four maturation ponds fig 1 with a total volume of 336 600 m3 and an effective volume of 156 240 m3 accounting for the volume of settled sludge the system was designed to treat approximately 105 ml day during peak wet season flow conditions frequent vertical mixing from wind shearing across the water surface occurs in these ponds when the ponds have no sludge raw sewage influent has a retention time of 10 days in a facultative pond pond 1 facultative pond effluent then feeds into a maturation pond pond 2 and retained for seven days for sanitation fig 1 wastewaters are further sanitised in a smaller and increasingly shallower 3 pond maturation series before final release of treated effluent after five days retention pond 5 for this study the inlet and outlets of ponds 1 and 5 were selected for sampling after initial investigations showed no significant differences in physicochemical and bacterial signatures between ponds 4 and 5 the physicochemical and bacterial similarities between pond 4 and 5 suggested that sampling at the pond 5 inlet would not be subject to variable mixing effects 2 2 stable isotopes samples for stable isotope analysis were collected in one litre bottles at the outlets of ponds 1 and 5 fig 1 on 3 consecutive days in october 2014 samples were placed on ice but not frozen and transferred to the laboratory as soon as possible within a few hours where they were immediately centrifuged and filtered gf c 47 mm pre combusted particulates predominantly algal and bacterial matter were collected on filters and the filtered volume recorded the dry mass of solids on the filters was determined gravimetrically the filter was analysed for n isotope composition of total particulate n filtrate samples predominantly dissolved nh3 and minor organic n nox were acidified with hcl to ph 2 and evaporated to dryness on a freeze dryer the dried solids were analysed for n isotope composition of total dissolved n mass spectrometric analysis was carried out by ea sirms bulk solids analysis at southern cross university to scale to the air n2 standard three in house secondary standards and two certified standards protein b2155 elemental microanalysis usgs40 u s geological survey were analysed 2 3 gas emissions nitrous oxide n2o ammonia nh3 carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 emissions were measured in pond 1 and pond 5 fig 1 over two 24 h periods when stable isotope samples were collected emission was not measured in maturation ponds 2 4 a floating gas accumulation chamber was connected to a photo acoustic gas measuring system innova 1412 in a recirculating loop closed accumulation mode an auxiliary gas pump connected to a timer was used to automatically evacuate the accumulation chamber and repeat the measurement cycle every 30 min the flux of n2o and nh3 were calculated from the rate of increase in gas concentrations measured at 2 min intervals during the first 20 min of each measurement cycle instrumental concentration data were calibrated using certified gas standards scott speciality gasses before and after the field campaign emissions of n2 are not measurable using the innova 1412 instrument 2 4 physicochemistry in 2012 and 2013 wastewater samples were collected from ponds 1 and 5 on four occasions during the wet and dry seasons at each site the top 10 cm of the water column surface water and bottom 10 cm benthic water were sampled samples were collected in duplicate in the morning 6 a m 10 am and again in the afternoon 1 pm 5 pm these times will be referred to as morning and afternoon unfiltered one liter waters were collected from the pond 1 inlet and pond 5 inlet and outlet with a peristaltic pump and nalgene tubing in situ measurements of do temperature and ph were simultaneously recorded using the hydrolab quanta wastewater n chemistry was analysed by labmark pty ltd melbourne vic unfiltered one litre wastewater samples were kept on ice during collection fig 1 and stored at 20 c prior to nutrient analysis ammonia analysis includes nh3 and nh4 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were determined using flow injection analysis fia 18 fifteen ml of sample was filtered through polyethersulfone pes 0 45 μm minisart high flow syringe filters prior to analysis of the remaining unfiltered sample portion 10 ml was digested with alkaline potassium persulfate in the autoclave for 1 h at 121 c and analysed by fia for tn queensland health scientific services quality control analyses included blanks duplicates and samples spiked with analyte 2 5 dna and rna processing for denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa assays dna was extracted from filtered 100 ml effluent samples collected with the chemistry samples although we collected nitrogen gene and physicochemical data before the 2013 2014 n budget calculation a review of unpublished monitoring data showed that n mass removal between 2013 14 and 2014 15 only differed by 3 thus the effect of sample timing was likely minimal dna was extracted using the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad

analysis 2 6 functional gene microarray fga a high throughput fga was used to assess the relative abundance and diversity of both denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa bacteria in wsp water samples briefly the fga consists of a small solid substrate glass microscope slide to which a set of targeted oligonucleotide probes is attached the functional gene of interest nosz and hzsa is amplified from dna or cdna extracted from effluent samples a 453 bp fragment of the nitrous oxide reduction nosz gene for denitrification was amplified using the primers nosz f cgytgttcmtcgacagccag 19 and nosz 1622r t7 taatacgactcactatagcgsaccttsttgccstygcg 12 amplification reactions for nosz contained 10 nm of the corresponding reverse primers with a t7 rna polymerase promoter tag at the 5 end plus 30 nm of the

taatacgactcactatagaaabggygaatcatartggc 15 hzsa amplification reactions used with the same t7 promoter tag placement and concentrations as described for nosz amplicons were fluorescently labeled by in vitro transcription and labeled with cy3 utp and hybridised on an array with probes covering the nosz and hzsa genes of multiple bacterial and archaeal clades signals were normalised to a spike control set to 10 000 detailed information about the development and methods of the fga is provided in supplementary information 2 7 drifting sludge mat area estimation floating sludge mats covered the pond surface in the corners of the facultative and maturation ponds mat area was estimated from google earth historical satellite imagery version 7 1 5 1557 2015 google inc mountain view california using arcgis esri software redlands california to georeference images because satellite images were not available on our collection dates an average for pond 1 and 2 drifting sludge was calculated from the following 5 available images 22 10 12 24 11 12 26 06 13 7 10 13 and 09 09 14 satellite images were georeferenced using the wgs 1984 utm zone 52s coordinate system 2 8 statistical analysis physicochemical and fga data was analysed with primer e ltd v7 permanova primer e ltd plymouth uk and minitab v6 statistical software nosz and hzsa data sets were square root transformed and probes that occurred in at least 10 of samples selected the mean signal intensity in each sample was calculated by pooling the signals of the remaining probes data were visualised with minitab interval plots for both tn water chemistry and the fga nosz and hzsa dna and cdna in addition nosz and hzsa dna and cdna results were normalised and displayed in a heatmap using the genespring software where in essence a value of 100 means the signal was equal to that of the control probe hyabp60 whereas a value of 10 indicates that the signal was 10 of the control physicochemical data were normalised and a resemblance matrix generated based on euclidean distance while fga data was square root transformed and a resemblance matrix generated based on bray curtis similarity a permutational anova permanova with 9999 permutations was used to explore differences of fga or physicochemical data between groups of samples the permanova crossed design for both physicochemical and fga data excluding cdna included 5 fixed factors or groups of samples year season 4 levels pond 2 levels location 2 levels time 2 levels and depth 2 levels however the permanova for cdna was calculated using 3 fixed factors year season 4 levels pond 2 levels and location 2 levels a p value of 0 05 2 sided was considered significant for multiple comparisons the bonferroni correction was applied to p values to counteract the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis permdisp primer e ltd plymouth uk was used to check for homogeneity of variance between groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 stable isotopes and gas emissions we found that δ 15n values of dissolved and particulate n in pond 1 2 3 to 4 5 were low and close to background δ 15n values whereas pond 5 values were elevated 13 2 to 19 9 and typical for effluent 6 20 indicating that significant emission of gaseous n occurred after pond 1 gas emission estimates scaled to a full year based on the measurements in ponds 1 and 5 amounted to 0 27 t yr n2o n and 1 26 t yr nh3 n which accounted for less than 1 of the total annual tn removal from the wsp overall n2o and nh3 emissions in ponds 1 and 5 were low n2o 0 5 mg m 2 hr 1 nh3 4 mg m 2 hr 1 the highest n2o emission were at night when do levels were below 0 3 saturation fig 2 nh3 emission was highest during daylight hours in pond 1 coinciding with high do levels fig 2 ammonia volatilization as nh3 gas is more likely at higher temperature and ph 16 but more ammonia might be entering the system in the influent during the day so there would be concomitant increase in the volatilized ammonia component particularly in pond 1 21 since export of n2o and nh3 to the atmosphere was minimal the combined evidence from gas emission and n isotope data demonstrated that substantial emission of n2 must account for the majority of gaseous n removal from the pond system these data agree with mayo and abbas 16 who reported that gas emission was lowest in the facultative pond compared to the maturation pond and that n2 was the likely species emitted from the ponds interestingly in another study by wallace et al 27 nitrogen was removed mainly as no3 and not n2 however the difference in the form of n removal could be due to the geographic and climatic differences between the wallace et al 27 ponds in eastern ontario canada and our study site in tropical north australia 3 2 physicochemistry discrete measurements of do in the morning and afternoon during each field campaign demonstrated that do was lower in the morning mean 2 0 mg l and higher in the afternoon mean 9 0 mg l fig 3 however similar to the continuous do measurements fig 2 there were domains of anoxia in surface waters of pond 1 and 5 fig 3 in the afternoon 25 24 96 of measurements in pond 1 and 8 8 96 in pond 5 were below 20 do saturation fig 3 the do range was large and correlated with changing time of day during sampling where do concentration increased as the day progressed pearson r 0 55 there was a strong pearson correlation between ph and do r 0 74 with pond 1 ph rising from 7 3 in the morning to 7 7 by the afternoon similarly the ph in pond 5 rose from 7 6 to 8 6 by the afternoon as expected for a tropical pond system waters were above 20 c and 67 64 96 of the time temperatures were above 30 c temperatures were cooler mean 28 2 c in the morning and warmer mean 30 9 c in the afternoon the anoxic domains measured in ponds 1 and 5 may be associated with drifting sludge mats fig 4 22 mats accumulated in down wind pond corners and covered an average of 6 2758 m2 of pond 1 and 3 715 m2 of pond 5 the mats reflect the high abundance of suspended and volatile solids in the ponds on average pond 1 total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss were 197 mg l range 108 310 mg l and 183 mg l range 116 280 mg l respectively pond 5 concentrations were lower at 162 mg l tss and 154 mg l vss these high concentrations of suspended solids can provide widespread micro domains for coupled nitrification denitrification 23 at the wsp site the first facultative pond is designed to remove n by promotion of suspended solid settlement and denitrification processes and the role of the subsequent maturation ponds is sanitation 3 however our pond data did not support these expected roles the combined isotopic gene and gas emission data suggested that the facultative pond 1 was not the major site of n removal in the wsp pond nutrient measurements supported the isotopic and emission trends because in pond 1 the tn decrease between the inlet 41 6 mg l and outlet 40 3 mg l range 25 170 mg l was only 1 3 mg l there was a 40 decrease in tn at the pond 5 outlet 29 7 mg l particularly in the morning fig 5 range 14 40 mg l nh3 was also higher in pond 1 21 9 mg l than pond 5 12 6 mg l fig 5 regardless of time of day pond 1 range 10 31 2 mg l pond 5 range 6 8 20 mg l however elevated pond 1 tn and nh3 in the morning is likely associated with increased raw inflow of sewage which mirrors the increased use of toilets during the early hours of each day 21 no3 and no2 were low in both ponds in pond 1 no3 was on average 0 1 mg l range 0 006 1 7 mg l and no2 was 0 3 mg l range 0 002 3 1 mg l similarly pond 5 no3 levels averaged 0 2 mg l range 0 002 0 45 mg l and 0 5 mg l range 3 1 0 97 mg l for no2 fig 5 in the afternoon concentrations of both species in pond 5 were twice no3 and 2 9 times no2 of those measured in pond 1 fig 5 3 3 functional gene microarray fga the possibility that n2 emission could account for n loss from this wsp was further assessed by measuring the abundance and activity of genes associated with denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa we chose these two genes because the nosz gene encodes an enzyme that converts n2o to n2 while the hzsa gene encodes an enzyme that converts no2 and nh3 to n2 both genes were abundant relative to probe number and active which supports the possibility that n loss is via n2 emission these genes also provided insight into potential pond performance more specifically although these ponds are biologically and chemically complex one explanation for the below design performance of pond 1 in terms of n2 loss n removal might be the different community structure of denitrifying and anammox communities in each pond 3 4 diurnal measurements of denitrification nosz gene abundance dna probes denitrification nosz gene abundance as determined by the average probe signal intensity was higher in facultative pond 1 in the morning as compared to the afternoon with an average intensity of 2 0 in the morning and 1 6 in the afternoon fig 6 in this study there were 182 nosz probes on the microarray of which 105 fluoresced i e had a signal intensity above 1 of the array control see methods for details fig 7 of these 182 24 probes fluoresced in the 32 pond 1 samples and 19 probes in the 64 pond 5 samples with 15 nosz probes fluorescing in more than 9 samples in both pond 1 and pond 5 samples figs 6 7 of the 16 pond 1 morning samples four probes i e nosz 079 activated sludge taxa emitted a stronger signal above 5 of the control in 5 samples from pond 1 inlet fig 7 these four probes had a mean intensity of just 3 in pond 5 32 in the afternoon the average signal was higher in pond 5 mainly based on probes nosz 070 azospirillum largimobile and nosz 077 agriculture soil clade 4 which had a mean intensity of 1 9 in 16 samples which compared to an average of 1 5 in the morning figs 6 7 denitrification gene abundance is positively correlated with denitrification rates 13 so if denitrification efficiency in pond 1 was less than in pond 5 this may be reflected in lower nosz gene abundance in fact nosz gene abundance was higher in pond 1 than in pond 5 during the morning when do levels were lowest these data therefore do not support the suggestion that denitrification as measured by nosz gene abundance was compromised in pond 1 compared to pond 5 3 5 diurnal measurements of anammox hzsa gene abundance dna probes an alternative explanation might be that denitrification was not the main process leading to n2 production and that the dominant process was anammox as measured by hzsa gene abundance and activity 15 13 in fact the abundance of this gene appeared low in pond 1 and high in pond 5 particularly during the day fig 6 in contrast to nosz of the 42 identified hzsa probes available only 14 had signals above 1 of the control and that occurred in at least 10 of samples most striking was the suggested greater abundance of hzsa in pond 5 during the afternoon figs 6 7 this strong signal was associated with 12 probes especially hzsa 035 hzsa 036 hzsa 010 and hzsa 011 in 28 of the 32 afternoon samples figs 6 7 3 6 denitrification and anammox gene activity cdna probes derived from rna a more direct measure of denitrification is gene activity as measured by cdna derived from rna 13 fga measurement of reverse transcribed pcr products indicated denitrification nosz genes were active in ponds 1 and 5 fig 7 there was a trend for more nosz activity in pond 1 compared to pond 5 fig 7 supported by the previous nosz gene abundance data fig 6 however nosz gene activity levels were not significantly different between the ponds fig 7 which suggests that higher gene abundance in pond 1 may not translate into significantly greater activity further gene abundance dna measurements were collected in both the morning and the afternoon whereas samples for rna cdna analysis were only collected in the afternoon taking abundance and activity together however the data suggest that denitrification as measured by the nosz gene was not compromised in pond 1 compared to pond 5 while there may be other blocks to effective denitrification other factors that accelerate denitrification rates in stabilisation ponds include elevated temperature and high rates of algal production 14 both of which are features of these tropical wsps anammox hzsa gene activity was more than six times higher in pond 5 although this was not statistically significant fig 7 due to the high standard error and low sample number it is not clear why anammox gene abundance was high in pond 5 during the day when do levels were generally high however both the continuous do measures of surface water and the surface water benthic water do measures indicated oxic and anoxic zones occurred at the surface possibly due to the presence of sludge mats that prevent light penetration and consume oxygen 22 24 which presumably provided appropriately anoxic conditions for anammox 15 additionally pond 5 anammox is promoted by high floc vss that creates micro domains of anoxia 23 these data suggest that in this system anammox may be an important component of n loss through n2 emission generally and might account for the relatively superior performance of pond 5 similar to camargo valero et al 2 and mayo abbas 16 no3 and no2 levels were generally low in ponds 1 and 5 14 however it is interesting to note that during the day no3 and no2 levels were significantly higher in pond 5 coinciding with higher anammox gene abundance relative to pond 1 since no2 and indirectly no3 are substrates for the hzsa anammox gene these elevated levels might represent a tipping point that supports anammox in pond 5 in contrast in pond 1 no3 and no2 levels might have been too low for effective anammox 15 in wsps n is removed from wastewater via a combination of settling and accumulation of pond sludge and emissions to the atmosphere of n2o nh3 and n2 however precise accounting of the wsp n budget is rarely feasible if based on routine monitoring data in this study we used several approaches to elucidate the processes associated with n cycling in a wsp located in the wet dry tropics of northern australia n budget calculations for this wsp fig 8 showed that discharged tn in effluent accounted for 42 of influent tn of the remaining 58 tn 11 n is removed in pond sludge leaving a deficit of 46 5 tn the budget indicated that there is significant emission of gaseous n from the pond system to the atmosphere our gas emission physicochemical and gene data support gaseous emission of n for example estimated annual emissions of n2o and nh3 accounted for less than 1 of the tn removal which suggests that the remaining 46 5 n deficit is due to n2 gas emission in addition the presence of denitrification nosz and anammox hzsa in ponds 1 and 2 indicate that these n gas removal pathways are likely the estimated tn removal by n2 emission as a percentage of tn inflow is within a previously reported range of emissions in wastewater treatment ponds wwtp 25 n2o emission values are also similar to the typical range of emissions from wwtps of 0 2 to 2 of produced sewage n 26 furthermore we found that our data and budget are still reflective of the current wsp conditions because a review of industry s unpublished n removal data showed that there was only a 3 difference between 2013 14 and 2017 18 4 conclusions in this study we showed the benefit of using a multidisciplinary approach to quantify n removal in a darwin wsp we showed that facultative pond 1 that was designed to remove most n was not doing this efficiently and that n2 emission occurred after pond 1 in addition the anoxic n cycle steps converting n species to n2 downstream of pond 1 were denitrification and anammox with pond 5 n removal likely associated with anammox rather than denitrification denitrification and annamox gene abundance and activity in the investigated ponds were consistent with the budgetary evidence of major n2 emissions from the wsp the array of physicochemical and biological measurement tools allowed us to resolve the n budget and improved our understanding of where and how nitrogen is removed from the pond system pond management could benefit from this approach because the process identifies wsp function in near real time and diagnoses underperformance in localised zones in a multi pond system identifying zones of poor n removal efficiency in a multi pond wsp helps managers understand where and how performance could be improved it also allows an evaluation of pond design options such as adding baffles desludging or changing the number of treatment ponds to directly address these performance issues funding details this work was

14421,aerobic granular sludge can improve the efficacy of wastewater treatment in existing sequencing batch reactors sbrs compared to conventional floccular sludge despite the well known advantages of increased capacity reduced reactor footprint and enhanced nutrient removal many performance characteristics of granular and floccular sludges have not been directly compared in particular for sludges generated from treating the same sewage source in this study we investigated the microstructure microbial composition settling and dewatering properties of granular and floccular sludge generated from the same sewage sources cryo scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that the granular and floccular sludges had a significantly different internal network structure with flocs being much more open and porous than granules sulphur deposits were clearly visible on the surfaces of granules which was complemented by the enrichment of some sulphur oxidising bacterial species compared to floccular sludge as assessed by next generation sequencing ngs dewatering measurements showed as expected that the settling velocity of granules was much faster than flocs at solids concentrations below the gel point at at higher solids concentrations above the gel point however both flocs and granules form a similar gelled network structure with no significant difference in dewaterability we used the dewatering properties in process models to predict the impact of granulation on thickener and filter throughput overall this work highlights the biological structural and physical differences and similarities between granular and floccular sludges with the outcome being improved settling for granules but no significant difference in downstream dewatering properties that pertain to filtration processes keywords granular sludge cryo sem sequencing sedimentation filtration 1 introduction the most common approach to treat wastewater is through the activated sludge process which has been applied for well over a century 1 within this process microorganisms produce extracellular polymeric substances eps that bind cells into small amorphous flocs or aggregates 10 200 μm in size 2 common microbial organisms critical to the process include nitrifiers and denitrifiers to remove nitrogen phosphate accumulating organisms pao to remove phosphates and filamentous bacteria that break down a range of substrates and contribute mechanical strength to the flocs process performance is also affected by the physical properties of flocs including size density and overall shape as these properties affect the rate at which flocs settle during clarification 3 5 based on stokesian dynamics this settling rate will vary proportionally with the density difference between the settling particle and the fluid and with the square of the size for example li and ganczarczy report a linear relationship between floc size and settling velocity 6 over three decades ago anaerobic conditions maintained in sequencing batch reactors sbr were found to increase the size of activated sludge flocs by an order of magnitude to approximately 1 3 mm in effective diameter 7 this new type of aggregate termed granules or granular sludge was shown to settle much faster and could treat wastewater with above average levels of biological oxygen demand bod5 total suspended solids tss oils and greases compared to the conventional activated sludge process referred to here as floccular sludge granular sludge was found to have drawbacks however such as a low rate of nitrate and phosphate removal 7 the use of aerobic conditions was subsequently found to overcome many of the shortcomings of anaerobic granular sludge 8 faster settling granules could be selected in the recycled sludge while the slower settling flocs were washed out of the system rapid shifts between feast and famine conditions that favour microbes with the ability to store resources including polyphosphate and glycogen accumulating organisms gao which may be essential in the formation of granular sludge particles could also be selected 9 10 the advantages of aerobic sludge granules led to improvements in the effectiveness of existing sbr reactors without the disadvantages of anaerobic granular treatment and this process is used in numerous full scale treatment plants globally 11 12 5 the increased settling rate of granular sludge compared to floccular sludge has been established and confirmed by a series of independent studies 13 16 10 with granules settling between 1 3 5 7 times faster than sludge flocs 17 the internal granule structure has also been investigated with transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscopy sem which showed aerobic bacteria at the surface and anaerobic bacteria located in the interior of the granule 16 18 19 extensive sample preparation steps were applied in these studies including sample dehydration and fixation which can lead to artefacts in the microscope images this is especially important for flocs that may be sensitive to sample preparation 20 bacteria within the granular sludge have also been identified using molecular techniques including fluorescent in situ hybridization fish and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge whilst these techniques provide initial insights into the microbial communities within the granules including flavobacterium sp aquabacterium sp thauera sp accumulibacter spp and competibacter spp 21 23 they only target a handful of specific species or groups despite the widespread uptake of the aerobic granular sludge process in industry some structural biological and process characteristics remain unknown or have been inadequately characterised and compared to common floccular sludge no studies have performed direct comparisons between floccular and granular sludge produced from the same source of sewage comprehensive analysis of the diverse microbial composition using sequencing has also not been reported and only selected species have been analysed in past studies very few studies have also investigated the downstream impacts of granulation such as the dewaterability 17 7 even though this is highly relevant in an industrial setting whilst granulation may help with faster settling it has not been demonstrated whether granulation is beneficial or detrimental to filtration and centrifugation in particular wastewater treatment sludges are highly compressible 24 and it appears that quantitative material properties that properly characterise the dewaterability of granular sludge 25 have yet to be reported understanding the dewaterability of these materials via quantitative material properties is important as such data facilitates objective comparisons between samples and allows prediction and optimisation of the operational performance of sludge thickening i e during the settling phase of the sbr cycle or subsequent dewatering of the wasted sludge e g by centrifugation or filtration recently pilot plant trials in bolivar south australia compared floccular and granular sludges generated in an sbr from the same highly saline sewage source 9 here we expand on the study by van den akker et al 9 by comparing floccular sludge sampled from the full scale bolivar sbr and granular sludge sampled from a pilot plant sbr attached to the full scale plant to investigate i the effect of granulation on the microstructure by cryo scanning electron microscopy cryo sem with minimal sample preparation ii the microbial composition by ngs and iii the quantitative material properties pertaining to dewaterability we also compare the dewatering properties to sludge from a full scale sbr plant at altona victoria the dewatering properties of the three sludges are then used in validated models of thickening and filtration to predict the impact of granulation on these important wastewater treatment process operations none of the above characteristics have previously been measured and compared from granular and floccular sludges generated from the same sewage source 2 dewatering theory in this work we use the dewatering theory termed compressional rheology 26 for the purposes of material characterisation and thickener and filter modelling this approach is especially useful for extremely compressible suspensions such as wastewater treatment sludges 25 24 traditional approaches to solid liquid separation modelling and material characterisation usually do not consider compressibility 27 when they do they are only applicable to highly compressible suspensions 28 32 simple dewaterability measures such as specific resistance to filtration and capillary suction time are certainly not sufficient to satisfactorily predict plant performance as the solids volume fraction ϕ of a wastewater sludge is increased above a critical concentration termed the gel point ϕ g flocs form a continuous solids network 26 the solids network has a material strength known as the compressive yield stress p y ϕ which must be exceeded before the network fails and compresses to higher solids concentrations hence this material function quantifies the pressure required to reach a given equilibrium extent of dewatering for a sewage sludge sample the compressive yield stress is zero below ϕ g and increases for ϕ ϕ g approaching infinity as the solid phase approaches close packing the second dewatering material function is the hindered settling function ϕ by definition this is inversely proportional to the permeability of the material it represents the hydrodynamic drag between solid and liquid phases thus determining the rate is the density difference between the solid and liquid phases of dewatering r ϕ is equal to the stokes drag of an isolated settling particle at infinite dilution ϕ 0 and increases with ϕ 33 the settling rate u ϕ is also inversely related to the hindered settling function 26 1 u φ ρ g 1 φ 2 r φ where δ ρ is the density difference between the solid and liquid phases and g is gravitational acceleration unlike specific resistance to filtration capillary suction time or sludge volume index these material properties are independent of testing conditions such as initial concentration initial height or pressure this approach therefore allows a quantitative comparison between the dewaterability of sludges in settling and filtration processes 25 under the same conditions 3 materials and methods 3 1 sludge samples samples of sludge were sourced from the bolivar high salinity wastewater treatment plant wwtp south australia a screens and grit removal sbr with uv disinfection which serves a population of roughly 75 000 people stored at 4 c immediately upon collection and analysed within 1 2 days due to the unstable nature of sludges in general floccular sludge samples were taken from a full scale sbr while granular sludge was taken from a pilot scale sbr plant 80 l that was operated in parallel receiving the same sewage both sludge types were sampled at the same time and analysed in parallel flocculants were not added to the sample prior to characterising dewaterability the pilot scale granular sludge reactor and full scale sbr and their operating conditions were previously described in detail by van den akker et al 9 sludge samples were also sourced from the full scale sbr at altona wwtp victoria the dewaterability of this sample was presented previously 25 3 2 microscopy the sludge flocs were examined by light microscopy and images were captured using an olympus bx51 system microscope connected to a computer which allowed for a comparison of the sizes between granules and flocs cryo sem fei quanta field emission gun sem equipped with a gatan cryo stage supplied by oxford instruments analytical limited fei company and gatan inc was chosen to visualise the interior and exterior structures of the flocs and granules as it can be performed with minimal sample preparation thus reducing the possibility of introducing artefacts in the case of granular sludge 1 ml samples were allowed to settle under gravity for 5 10 min before the supernatant and excess liquid around the granules was removed for floccular sludge 1 ml samples were centrifuged at 13 500 g for 5 min before removing the supernatant and excess liquid individual granules measuring around 1 2 mm diameter or a small volume of the centrifuged floccular sludge were glued tissue tek oct compound proscitech onto a copper holder the sample preparation system alto 2500 gatan abingdon oxon uk employed in this study consists of two stages 1 a slushing station for snap freezing the samples in nitrogen at approximately 210 c and a sample preparation chamber directly mounted to the sem kept at 140 c and under vacuum less than 10 4 mbar after snap freezing the sample was quickly moved to the sample preparation chamber kept at 140 c using a vacuum transfer device using a chilled scalpel blade samples were fractured to expose the granule or floc interior and then heated to 95 c in vacuum for 20 30 min to sublime the ice the samples were then cooled and kept at 140 c for the duration of the experiment a subset of samples was sputter coated with gold and then imaged with sem under very high vacuum conditions less than 10 7 mbar the remaining samples were not coated and were imaged with the sem unit under high vacuum 10 4 mbar while pumping dry nitrogen gas through the chamber the nitrogen gas helped remove excessive charging of the uncoated sample caused by the electron beam sem was performed using a field emission gun quanta fei company hillsboro oregon usa at 10 15 kv the detectors used were a solid state detector ssd and large field detector lfd uncoated samples were further analysed with an energy dispersive x ray edx detector oxford inca eds detector by oxford instrument bucks uk mounted into the sem chamber to allow for detection and identification of the elemental composition 3 3 particle size analysis particle size measurements were conducted using a malvern mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle analyser this apparatus has a particle size measurement range of 0 01 3500 μm the sludge sample was slowly added to the wet dispersion unit of the equipment until the desired laser obscuration was achieved 3 4 physical characteristics the liquid and suspended solids densities of each sample were measured gravimetrically using a calibrated pycnometer and a density cup 34 the volatile suspended solids were determined using the standard method by drying 25 g of sample at 105 c in an oven and then further heating the dried sample in a chamber furnace at 550 c 35 experiments were performed in triplicate for the floccular sludge samples and in duplicate for the granular sludge samples 3 5 dewaterability the dewaterability of the sludge samples as a function of solids volume fraction was evaluated using the compressional rheology approach 36 24 characterisation of compressibility and permeability in terms of solids volume fraction means that sludges can be compared on a solids basis and the analysis is not limited to the test conditions gravity settling tests were performed using samples with known solids concentration the samples were added to a 1000 ml graduated cylinder and the solid liquid interface height was recorded over time until equilibrium height was reached filtration tests were performed using an automated piston driven filtration rig as described by de kretser et al 37 the sludge used in the filtration tests had a concentration near the gel point as the solids were allowed to settle and the supernatant decanted prior to use a known volume of sludge 50 ml at a known concentration was loaded into the filtration cell and a constant pressure 20 50 100 200 or 300 kpa was applied to force the filtrate through a semi permeable membrane the height of the piston was measured using a linear encoder and converted to specific volume of filtrate the tests were maintained at a constant pressure until there was no more change in piston height 1 of the initial filtration rate the solids concentration of the final filter cake was measured by oven drying 34 the dewatering material functions p y ϕ and r ϕ were extracted from the sedimentation and filtration results the gel point and the hindered settling function r ϕ at concentrations near the gel point were extracted from the batch settling tests 38 constant pressure filtration tests were performed at a range of pressures to give high concentration permeability and compressibility 36 the results from the sedimentation and filtration tests were combined to give continuous functions for p y ϕ and r ϕ across a large range of volume fractions these material functions were then validated by re predicting the results of the filtration tests using a one dimensional model of filtration with the initial height the initial solids volume fraction and the applied pressure of each test 39 a close agreement between the predicted and experimental results indicates the validity of the extracted material properties 36 25 the material properties were used as inputs to a thickener model 40 and a filter press model 41 the numerical outputs from these two models were used to directly compare the process performance of granular and floccular sludge at low solids concentrations relevant to thickening and high solids concentration relevant to filtration respectively 3 6 next generation sequencing ngs was performed on a granular sludge sample taken from the pilot plant and on floccular sludge sampled from the neighbouring full scale sbr dna extraction and ngs was performed in accordance with methods previously described by thwaites et al 42 4 results and discussion 4 1 light microscopy the biomass present in granular and floccular samples differed in size and morphology as can be observed by light microscopy fig 1 a d the granules within the aerobic granular sludge samples were approximately 1 3 mm in diameter typical of aerobic granulation processes 9 in the floccular sludge the more consolidated regions of the floc particles were approximately 50 300 μm in size typical of activated sludge flocs 43 few filaments were observed to protrude from the surface of the granules while filaments extended into the medium surrounding flocs in some instances forming bridges between them fig 1c such filaments would be expected to increase the hydrodynamic drag of floc particles slowing the settling of these particles 44 which are also expected to settle less readily due to their small size 4 2 particle size analysis the volume weighted mean diameter of the granular and floccular sludge particles were 340 μm and 220 μm respectively the size measurements of granules obtained via laser diffraction were considerably smaller than that observed by light microscopy this may be due to shearing in the mastersizer or other factors which make this approach in general unreliable for measuring sludge particles 45 the laser diffraction results are merely indicative that the granular particles are much larger than the floccular sludge particles and that the light microscopy results are more reliable in this instance 4 3 cryo sem the granules exhibited a different surface morphology and internal structure to the floccular samples when examined by cryo sem the surface of the granules featured filaments with segmentation as well as coccoid cells fig 2 a which are common morphologies for different species of wastewater bacteria 46 47 the interior of the granules was also dense tightly packed filamentous structures were arranged in a semi ordered pattern in the layers 200 300 μm just below the surface fig 2b presumably due to the outward growth of filamentous bacteria as these structures resemble those on the surface regions deeper within the interior consisted of a dense matrix with no discernible pattern or filamentous structures fig 2c past studies have indicated that the microbial distribution is layered inside granules with some studies reporting inner cores consisting of metabolically inactive bacteria 48 anoxic microbes 22 or even lacking microbes 49 while layers closer to the surface exhibit greater microbial activity this shift in composition is presumably due to oxygen diffusion which may be limited to about 200 400 μm below the surface leading to an anoxic zone deeper inside the interior 16 22 the highly compact matrix of the granules is likely a result of greater eps production which has been shown to play an essential role in the formation of microbial granules 49 in contrast the flocs had an open porous network structure which continued throughout the interior of the floc fig 3 also see supplementary figure s1 for a more comprehensive comparison at different length scales which is in agreement with a past study that produced comparable electron micrographs 50 the regular pores which spanned several micrometers in diameter would allow greater diffusion and movement within these flocs including the diffusion of oxygen potentially supporting cell growth within the interior the light microscopy images indicate the presence of filaments on the surface of flocs that extend out into the bulk wastewater the identification of these filamentous or other cellular structures within the interior using cryo sem was difficult the diameter of some structural components in the floc interior were similar however to the diameter of the protruding filaments suggesting these structures could be cells the difficulty in observing cells within these flocs is largely expected as these filaments and other bacteria are likely integrated within the highly branched network of the floc 51 20 interestingly a large number of bright spots were evident across the surface of the granular samples indicating a greater degree of charging by the electron beam than for the surrounding area fig 4 and supplementary figure s2 edx microanalysis of these bright spots indicated they were enriched in sulphur containing on average 10 mol sulphur compared to 4 2 mol sulphur in the surrounding surface material the spots were typically circular in appearance with a diameter of 0 5 μm and with up to 30 spots occurring heterogeneously across an area of 10 μm2 this finding also illustrates the advantage of using cryo sem for imaging as these spots were less visible in samples dehydrated during preparation data not shown the bright spots are indicative of sulphur oxidising bacteria sob the location of these bright spots on the outside of the granules is consistent with past studies which used microsensors to observe that oxidation of sulphide took place within an oxygen rich and narrow outer surface layer of aerobic biofilms leading to the formation of precipitates of s and potentially fes 52 53 the location of these bright spots also suggests these bacteria may be more metabolically active within the surface layer further supporting the idea that granules are highly layered structures the enrichment of sobs seen using cryo sem is supported by ngs analysis of samples collected from the neighbouring full scale sbr and pilot scale sbr which was performed to compare the ecology of the flocs and granules a closer review of this data found that the granules had an enrichment of the class gammaproteobacteria which includes many sob screening of potential sob candidates within gammaproteobacteria found that there was a large enrichment of chromatiales sp within the granules which represents 19 of all operational taxonomic units otu detected compared to only 5 4 within the floccular sample fig 5 a furthermore screening of potential sulphate reducing bacteria srb members fig 5b found that srbs such as desulfobacterales desulphuromonadales and syntrophobacterales were present in both floc and granular sludge samples while preliminary these results together with the cryo sem observations suggest a potential role for sob and possibly srb in aerobic granular sludge applied for the treatment of high saline sewage 5 3 6 1 g l of nacl where sulphate is present 9 the high sulphate concentrations measured within the saline sewage 0 6 1 0 g l combined with the use of an anaerobic feed phase in the granular sludge pilot plant may have created conditions favourable for sulphate reduction by srb thereby providing a source of sulphide for the development of the sob during the aeration phase sulphide may then be oxidised by sob under aerobic and or anoxic conditions i e autotrophic denitrification due to the existence of an oxygen gradient within the granules these processes have previously been applied for the treatment of high saline wastewater however via the use of separate reactor compartments to provide the required anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions 54 the role of sob and srb in aerobic granular sludge is unclear and warrants further investigation given that recent studies have shown that aerobic granular sludge is readily established 9 42 or accelerated 55 when treating wastewater impacted by seawater several of the bright spots observed on the surface of the granules were also found to be enriched in phosphorus or aluminium data not shown this finding indicated the complexity of the microbial community and metabolic activity occurring within the granular structure and suggests that further characterisation of this diversity will lead to new insights into the microbial community that exists within sludge granules 4 4 solids density and volatile solids the physical characteristics measured for the granular and floccular sludges are summarised in table 1 together with another previously characterized floccular sludge from altona sbr 25 allowing for comparisons across different sbr treatment plants the densities of the suspended solids i e densities of the dried solids fraction of the granules or floc particles in all three samples were high with both samples from the bolivar wwtp being exceptionally high this high density is potentially due to the high saline feed conditions for these samples compared to most wastewater treatment plants where solids densities usually range between 1100 1400 kg m3 36 there were statistically significant differences in solids density between all samples as the density of the granules was in between the density of the flocs from the altona and bolivar samples there was no clear indication that granulation is a major factor affecting solids density this observation may seem counterintuitive as the cryo sem analysis clearly shows that granules have a much denser network structure the suspended solids density measures the skeletal density however i e the density of the network structure itself as all water is dried during the measurements therefore the density is a different complementary measure to the observations made by cryo sem the volatile solids content of the granular sludge was similar to the floccular sludge from altona table 1 the volatile solids is of particular interest because it has been shown to be an indicator of the dewatering behaviour in floccular sewage sludges with higher volatile solids generally leading to reduced dewaterability 25 as there is no big difference in volatile solids concentration between the granular sludge from bolivar and the floccular sludge from altona big differences in dewaterability would not be expected between these two samples conversely as the floccular sludge from the bolivar wwtp has a lower volatile solids concentration than the granular sludge a small improvement in dewaterability is expected for the bolivar floccular sludge 4 5 dewatering characterisation sedimentation and filtration tests were performed on the granular and floccular sludges the sedimentation and 100 kpa filtration results for the three sludges are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively whilst direct comparison of these results is not recommended since the behaviour is highly dependent on the initial concentration which varied it is clear that the granular sludge settled much quicker than the floccular sludges also shown in fig 6 are predictions of sedimentation and filtration based on the extracted material properties the experimental data and predictions are in close agreement for the granular and floccular sludges this agreement indicates that the material properties can be used with confidence to predict the material dewatering behaviour of the granular and floccular samples 25 within the range of experimental data reported here analysis of the interfacial height as a function of time during sedimentation gives the gel point and low concentration rate information while analysis of the filtrate rate and solids content during filtration gives high solids content information the analysis results are presented as the dewatering material functions p y ϕ and r ϕ along with the settling velocity u ϕ figs 7 a c both granular and floccular sludges formed networked gels at similar concentrations of ϕ g 0 0033 v v and 0 0045 v v respectively i e the point of intercept with the x axis where p y ϕ g 0 in fig 7a the granular sludge had a similar gel point to the floccular samples fig 6 but reached a slightly higher solids content at high pressures 20 300 kpa compared to the floccular sludge the permeability of granular and floccular sludge samples was found to be similar at higher solids concentrations 0 1 v v solids fraction exhibiting a similar r ϕ at a given solids fraction fig 7b at concentrations below the gel point i e 0 0033 0 0045 the granular sludge showed higher permeability than the floccular sludge e g at 0 002 v v the r ϕ for the granular sludge was 1 5 10 7 while for the bolivar and altona floccular sludges it was 1 0 10 9 and 1 8 10 8 respectively fig 7b according to a previous study on floccular sludge 56 this difference in permeability can be explained by the larger size and fewer protruding filaments of the granules fig 1 the hindered settling function r ϕ also indicates that granules settle faster than flocs at the same low solids volume fractions ϕ g of 0 0033 0 0045 v v fig 7b the settling velocity for the granular sludge samples was significantly greater than for the two floccular samples across the range of solids volume fractions measured fig 7c consistent with the larger size of the granular particles fig 1 the granular sludge with larger suspended particles has a much smaller surface area per unit volume compared to flocs reducing the drag forces that slow the settling rate compared to floccular sludge of the same solids concentration moreover the higher number of filaments protruding from flocs that were observed by light microscopy may increase the hydrodynamic drag of the settling solids 56 57 in contrast to improvements to sedimentation granulation does not appear to offer any improvement for high concentration processes such as filtration or centrifugation at high solids concentrations corresponding to sludge cakes 0 1 v v solids fraction the hindered settling function r ϕ represents the fluid drag through a sludge cake rather than the drag on settling particles there is very little difference in r ϕ between the granular and floccular samples at these concentrations fig 7b in a sludge cake there are no longer any individual flocs but a continuous solids network with permeability dictated by the removal of interstitial fluid from the network the granular sludge appears to have lost any advantage over the floccular sludge at these high concentrations which means that granulation would not offer any improvement for high concentration processes such as filtration or centrifugation even though the fraction of volatile solids is significantly higher our results are surprising as the only past study that appears to have investigated dewaterability reported a fairly clear advantage for granular sludge 17 the vacuum filtration and analysis methods employed in this past study however have been shown to be inadequate for analysing dewaterability as they do not explore the conditions of high pressure relevant to wastewater treatment processes 25 the comprehensive analysis presented here allows the advantages and disadvantages of granular sludge to be explored under conditions typical for industrial operation the model illustrated by lines connecting the experimental data points in figs 7a and b fits the experimentally measured values for p y ϕ compressive yield stress and r ϕ hindered settling function well for all wastewater samples the model behavior in the intermediate range of solids volume fractions differs for the samples from the different treatment plants this is especially evident for the p y ϕ data fit for the granular sludge sample from bolivar wwtp in fig 6a which exhibits a curve at solids volume fractions of ϕ 10 2 v v the intermediate region between sedimentation and filtration is unknown but it can have large effects on the initial rate of filtration the variation in the interpolating functions in the intermediate region arises because of the iterative analysis method that is used a point of interpolation is incorporated into r φ and varied until filtration predictions give the experimental results see fig 6b this internal validation is a necessary part of the analysis i e the material properties are those necessary to predict the experiments 4 6 predictions of dewatering performance the impact of the dewaterability of the sludge samples on process performance can be predicted using p y ϕ and r ϕ as inputs to a steady state thickener model 40 and a fixed cavity plate and frame filter press model 41 the thickener model reflects processes taking place in secondary clarifiers or the decant stages of an sbr reactor and is used to demonstrate the relative performance of the sludge samples in a steady state thickener under comparable conditions where the feed concentration is fixed at 0 001 v v and the bed height is 5 m the filter press model reflects downstream dewatering processes where the applied pressure is 300 kpa the feed solids volume fraction is 0 01 v v and the cavity width is 1 0 cm in the thickener model simulations indicate that the granular sludge settles more effectively than the floccular sludge leading to a higher throughput q s o l i d s through thickener processes at low underflow solids concentrations ϕ u where the thickener performance is predominantly determined by the settling rate fig 8 a to illustrate this point when ϕ u 0 003 v v the thickener area required to clarify the granular sludge is approximately 50 times smaller than that required to clarify the floccular sludge the relative performance of the granular and floccular sludges however alters as the underflow concentration increases beyond the gel point 0 0033 0 0045 v v where the thickener performance becomes limited by sludge compressibility the flocs display superior performance under these conditions leading to higher solids throughput fig 7a also shows that the behaviour predicted for the floccular sbr sludge from the bolivar wwtp is somewhat similar to the sbr sludge from the altona wwtp consistent with the similar settling properties for these two samples fig 6 b and c the fixed cavity plate and frame filter press model is used to demonstrate the potential impact of granulation on the performance of post thickening dewatering operations the filter press model enables comparison of sludges under conditions of equivalent feed concentration and pressure in this case the filter model predicts the granular and floccular sludges to have similar dewatering behaviour in filtration at 300 kpa fig 8b at x f 0 15 which is a reasonable final cake solids concentration for this applied pressure the granular sludge is predicted to have a throughput roughly 20 greater than the floccular sludges alternatively when operating a filter with a throughput of 4 10 3 kg hr m2 a concentration of 0 15 v v average cake solids could be achieved for the granular sludge whereas the floccular sludge would reach 0 145 v v average cake solids these differences are not great and close to the accuracy of the material properties determined from the experimental data overall the model predictions indicate that granular sludge behaves fairly similar to the floccular sludge at concentrations above the gel point 0 0033 0 0045 v v during filtration processes the filtration model predictions for the two bolivar sludges are quite different to the prediction for the sbr sludge from the altona wwtp also shown in fig 8b at ϕ 0 15 v v average cake solids the altona sludge is predicted to have a 150 higher throughput than the granular sludge while a fixed throughput of 4 10 3 kg hr m2 would achieve a solids concentration of 0 185 v v average cake solids the combined results of both models further support the observation that granular sludge is mostly advantageous in secondary clarification and decanting stages of the sbr process where the solids concentration is below the gel point ϕ 0 0033 0 0045 v v but granulation offers no significant advantage at solids volume fractions above the gel point as illustrated schematically in fig 9 past studies have shown that there is an optimum solids concentration 0 03 ϕ 0 05 for floccular sludge where a maximum digestion efficiency is attained 58 59 as granular and floccular sludge exhibit similar properties under anaerobic digestion 60 the same optimum solids concentration can be expected for granular sludge this optimum concentration is an order of magnitude higher than the gel point and the model in fig 8a predicts this concentration cannot easily be attained with granular sludge in a thickener consequently a filter press process would be necessary to further concentrate the granular sludge under these conditions however the granular sludge particles offer no advantage over the floccular sludge 5 conclusion in this study the biological and physical properties of granular and floccular sludges obtained from the same sewage feed were compared granules and flocs were found to differ significantly in their shape structure and biological characteristics granules were larger with a denser internal microstructure a surface featuring regions enriched with sulphur and greater densities of specific sob and srb species than flocs at low solids concentrations below the gel point the settling rate of granules was much faster than that of flocs as the granular particles were large and had reduced drag from fewer protruding filaments the faster settling rate is advantageous during secondary clarification and decanting processes of sbrs modelling predicts a 50 times reduction in required thickener area for granules compared to flocs under the given conditions at solids concentrations greater than the gel point however both granules and flocs adopt a similar network structure and granulation offers no advantage to filtration processes overall the results highlight the significant structural and biological differences due to granulation the structural and microbial data contributes to our understanding of the facets that lead to the greater nutrient removal capacity and shock resistance of granular

14421,aerobic granular sludge can improve the efficacy of wastewater treatment in existing sequencing batch reactors sbrs compared to conventional floccular sludge despite the well known advantages of increased capacity reduced reactor footprint and enhanced nutrient removal many performance characteristics of granular and floccular sludges have not been directly compared in particular for sludges generated from treating the same sewage source in this study we investigated the microstructure microbial composition settling and dewatering properties of granular and floccular sludge generated from the same sewage sources cryo scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that the granular and floccular sludges had a significantly different internal network structure with flocs being much more open and porous than granules sulphur deposits were clearly visible on the surfaces of granules which was complemented by the enrichment of some sulphur oxidising bacterial species compared to floccular sludge as assessed by next generation sequencing ngs dewatering measurements showed as expected that the settling velocity of granules was much faster than flocs at solids concentrations below the gel point at at higher solids concentrations above the gel point however both flocs and granules form a similar gelled network structure with no significant difference in dewaterability we used the dewatering properties in process models to predict the impact of granulation on thickener and filter throughput overall this work highlights the biological structural and physical differences and similarities between granular and floccular sludges with the outcome being improved settling for granules but no significant difference in downstream dewatering properties that pertain to filtration processes keywords granular sludge cryo sem sequencing sedimentation filtration 1 introduction the most common approach to treat wastewater is through the activated sludge process which has been applied for well over a century 1 within this process microorganisms produce extracellular polymeric substances eps that bind cells into small amorphous flocs or aggregates 10 200 μm in size 2 common microbial organisms critical to the process include nitrifiers and denitrifiers to remove nitrogen phosphate accumulating organisms pao to remove phosphates and filamentous bacteria that break down a range of substrates and contribute mechanical strength to the flocs process performance is also affected by the physical properties of flocs including size density and overall shape as these properties affect the rate at which flocs settle during clarification 3 5 based on stokesian dynamics this settling rate will vary proportionally with the density difference between the settling particle and the fluid and with the square of the size for example li and ganczarczy report a linear relationship between floc size and settling velocity 6 over three decades ago anaerobic conditions maintained in sequencing batch reactors sbr were found to increase the size of activated sludge flocs by an order of magnitude to approximately 1 3 mm in effective diameter 7 this new type of aggregate termed granules or granular sludge was shown to settle much faster and could treat wastewater with above average levels of biological oxygen demand bod5 total suspended solids tss oils and greases compared to the conventional activated sludge process referred to here as floccular sludge granular sludge was found to have drawbacks however such as a low rate of nitrate and phosphate removal 7 the use of aerobic conditions was subsequently found to overcome many of the shortcomings of anaerobic granular sludge 8 faster settling granules could be selected in the recycled sludge while the slower settling flocs were washed out of the system rapid shifts between feast and famine conditions that favour microbes with the ability to store resources including polyphosphate and glycogen accumulating organisms gao which may be essential in the formation of granular sludge particles could also be selected 9 10 the advantages of aerobic sludge granules led to improvements in the effectiveness of existing sbr reactors without the disadvantages of anaerobic granular treatment and this process is used in numerous full scale treatment plants globally 11 12 5 the increased settling rate of granular sludge compared to floccular sludge has been established and confirmed by a series of independent studies 13 16 10 with granules settling between 1 3 5 7 times faster than sludge flocs 17 the internal granule structure has also been investigated with transmission electron microscopy tem and scanning electron microscopy sem which showed aerobic bacteria at the surface and anaerobic bacteria located in the interior of the granule 16 18 19 extensive sample preparation steps were applied in these studies including sample dehydration and fixation which can lead to artefacts in the microscope images this is especially important for flocs that may be sensitive to sample preparation 20 bacteria within the granular sludge have also been identified using molecular techniques including fluorescent in situ hybridization fish and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge whilst these techniques provide initial insights into the microbial communities within the granules including flavobacterium sp aquabacterium sp thauera sp accumulibacter spp and competibacter spp 21 23 they only target a handful of specific species or groups despite the widespread uptake of the aerobic granular sludge process in industry some structural biological and process characteristics remain unknown or have been inadequately characterised and compared to common floccular sludge no studies have performed direct comparisons between floccular and granular sludge produced from the same source of sewage comprehensive analysis of the diverse microbial composition using sequencing has also not been reported and only selected species have been analysed in past studies very few studies have also investigated the downstream impacts of granulation such as the dewaterability 17 7 even though this is highly relevant in an industrial setting whilst granulation may help with faster settling it has not been demonstrated whether granulation is beneficial or detrimental to filtration and centrifugation in particular wastewater treatment sludges are highly compressible 24 and it appears that quantitative material properties that properly characterise the dewaterability of granular sludge 25 have yet to be reported understanding the dewaterability of these materials via quantitative material properties is important as such data facilitates objective comparisons between samples and allows prediction and optimisation of the operational performance of sludge thickening i e during the settling phase of the sbr cycle or subsequent dewatering of the wasted sludge e g by centrifugation or filtration recently pilot plant trials in bolivar south australia compared floccular and granular sludges generated in an sbr from the same highly saline sewage source 9 here we expand on the study by van den akker et al 9 by comparing floccular sludge sampled from the full scale bolivar sbr and granular sludge sampled from a pilot plant sbr attached to the full scale plant to investigate i the effect of granulation on the microstructure by cryo scanning electron microscopy cryo sem with minimal sample preparation ii the microbial composition by ngs and iii the quantitative material properties pertaining to dewaterability we also compare the dewatering properties to sludge from a full scale sbr plant at altona victoria the dewatering properties of the three sludges are then used in validated models of thickening and filtration to predict the impact of granulation on these important wastewater treatment process operations none of the above characteristics have previously been measured and compared from granular and floccular sludges generated from the same sewage source 2 dewatering theory in this work we use the dewatering theory termed compressional rheology 26 for the purposes of material characterisation and thickener and filter modelling this approach is especially useful for extremely compressible suspensions such as wastewater treatment sludges 25 24 traditional approaches to solid liquid separation modelling and material characterisation usually do not consider compressibility 27 when they do they are only applicable to highly compressible suspensions 28 32 simple dewaterability measures such as specific resistance to filtration and capillary suction time are certainly not sufficient to satisfactorily predict plant performance as the solids volume fraction ϕ of a wastewater sludge is increased above a critical concentration termed the gel point ϕ g flocs form a continuous solids network 26 the solids network has a material strength known as the compressive yield stress p y ϕ which must be exceeded before the network fails and compresses to higher solids concentrations hence this material function quantifies the pressure required to reach a given equilibrium extent of dewatering for a sewage sludge sample the compressive yield stress is zero below ϕ g and increases for ϕ ϕ g approaching infinity as the solid phase approaches close packing the second dewatering material function is the hindered settling function ϕ by definition this is inversely proportional to the permeability of the material it represents the hydrodynamic drag between solid and liquid phases thus determining the rate is the density difference between the solid and liquid phases of dewatering r ϕ is equal to the stokes drag of an isolated settling particle at infinite dilution ϕ 0 and increases with ϕ 33 the settling rate u ϕ is also inversely related to the hindered settling function 26 1 u φ ρ g 1 φ 2 r φ where δ ρ is the density difference between the solid and liquid phases and g is gravitational acceleration unlike specific resistance to filtration capillary suction time or sludge volume index these material properties are independent of testing conditions such as initial concentration initial height or pressure this approach therefore allows a quantitative comparison between the dewaterability of sludges in settling and filtration processes 25 under the same conditions 3 materials and methods 3 1 sludge samples samples of sludge were sourced from the bolivar high salinity wastewater treatment plant wwtp south australia a screens and grit removal sbr with uv disinfection which serves a population of roughly 75 000 people stored at 4 c immediately upon collection and analysed within 1 2 days due to the unstable nature of sludges in general floccular sludge samples were taken from a full scale sbr while granular sludge was taken from a pilot scale sbr plant 80 l that was operated in parallel receiving the same sewage both sludge types were sampled at the same time and analysed in parallel flocculants were not added to the sample prior to characterising dewaterability the pilot scale granular sludge reactor and full scale sbr and their operating conditions were previously described in detail by van den akker et al 9 sludge samples were also sourced from the full scale sbr at altona wwtp victoria the dewaterability of this sample was presented previously 25 3 2 microscopy the sludge flocs were examined by light microscopy and images were captured using an olympus bx51 system microscope connected to a computer which allowed for a comparison of the sizes between granules and flocs cryo sem fei quanta field emission gun sem equipped with a gatan cryo stage supplied by oxford instruments analytical limited fei company and gatan inc was chosen to visualise the interior and exterior structures of the flocs and granules as it can be performed with minimal sample preparation thus reducing the possibility of introducing artefacts in the case of granular sludge 1 ml samples were allowed to settle under gravity for 5 10 min before the supernatant and excess liquid around the granules was removed for floccular sludge 1 ml samples were centrifuged at 13 500 g for 5 min before removing the supernatant and excess liquid individual granules measuring around 1 2 mm diameter or a small volume of the centrifuged floccular sludge were glued tissue tek oct compound proscitech onto a copper holder the sample preparation system alto 2500 gatan abingdon oxon uk employed in this study consists of two stages 1 a slushing station for snap freezing the samples in nitrogen at approximately 210 c and a sample preparation chamber directly mounted to the sem kept at 140 c and under vacuum less than 10 4 mbar after snap freezing the sample was quickly moved to the sample preparation chamber kept at 140 c using a vacuum transfer device using a chilled scalpel blade samples were fractured to expose the granule or floc interior and then heated to 95 c in vacuum for 20 30 min to sublime the ice the samples were then cooled and kept at 140 c for the duration of the experiment a subset of samples was sputter coated with gold and then imaged with sem under very high vacuum conditions less than 10 7 mbar the remaining samples were not coated and were imaged with the sem unit under high vacuum 10 4 mbar while pumping dry nitrogen gas through the chamber the nitrogen gas helped remove excessive charging of the uncoated sample caused by the electron beam sem was performed using a field emission gun quanta fei company hillsboro oregon usa at 10 15 kv the detectors used were a solid state detector ssd and large field detector lfd uncoated samples were further analysed with an energy dispersive x ray edx detector oxford inca eds detector by oxford instrument bucks uk mounted into the sem chamber to allow for detection and identification of the elemental composition 3 3 particle size analysis particle size measurements were conducted using a malvern mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle analyser this apparatus has a particle size measurement range of 0 01 3500 μm the sludge sample was slowly added to the wet dispersion unit of the equipment until the desired laser obscuration was achieved 3 4 physical characteristics the liquid and suspended solids densities of each sample were measured gravimetrically using a calibrated pycnometer and a density cup 34 the volatile suspended solids were determined using the standard method by drying 25 g of sample at 105 c in an oven and then further heating the dried sample in a chamber furnace at 550 c 35 experiments were performed in triplicate for the floccular sludge samples and in duplicate for the granular sludge samples 3 5 dewaterability the dewaterability of the sludge samples as a function of solids volume fraction was evaluated using the compressional rheology approach 36 24 characterisation of compressibility and permeability in terms of solids volume fraction means that sludges can be compared on a solids basis and the analysis is not limited to the test conditions gravity settling tests were performed using samples with known solids concentration the samples were added to a 1000 ml graduated cylinder and the solid liquid interface height was recorded over time until equilibrium height was reached filtration tests were performed using an automated piston driven filtration rig as described by de kretser et al 37 the sludge used in the filtration tests had a concentration near the gel point as the solids were allowed to settle and the supernatant decanted prior to use a known volume of sludge 50 ml at a known concentration was loaded into the filtration cell and a constant pressure 20 50 100 200 or 300 kpa was applied to force the filtrate through a semi permeable membrane the height of the piston was measured using a linear encoder and converted to specific volume of filtrate the tests were maintained at a constant pressure until there was no more change in piston height 1 of the initial filtration rate the solids concentration of the final filter cake was measured by oven drying 34 the dewatering material functions p y ϕ and r ϕ were extracted from the sedimentation and filtration results the gel point and the hindered settling function r ϕ at concentrations near the gel point were extracted from the batch settling tests 38 constant pressure filtration tests were performed at a range of pressures to give high concentration permeability and compressibility 36 the results from the sedimentation and filtration tests were combined to give continuous functions for p y ϕ and r ϕ across a large range of volume fractions these material functions were then validated by re predicting the results of the filtration tests using a one dimensional model of filtration with the initial height the initial solids volume fraction and the applied pressure of each test 39 a close agreement between the predicted and experimental results indicates the validity of the extracted material properties 36 25 the material properties were used as inputs to a thickener model 40 and a filter press model 41 the numerical outputs from these two models were used to directly compare the process performance of granular and floccular sludge at low solids concentrations relevant to thickening and high solids concentration relevant to filtration respectively 3 6 next generation sequencing ngs was performed on a granular sludge sample taken from the pilot plant and on floccular sludge sampled from the neighbouring full scale sbr dna extraction and ngs was performed in accordance with methods previously described by thwaites et al 42 4 results and discussion 4 1 light microscopy the biomass present in granular and floccular samples differed in size and morphology as can be observed by light microscopy fig 1 a d the granules within the aerobic granular sludge samples were approximately 1 3 mm in diameter typical of aerobic granulation processes 9 in the floccular sludge the more consolidated regions of the floc particles were approximately 50 300 μm in size typical of activated sludge flocs 43 few filaments were observed to protrude from the surface of the granules while filaments extended into the medium surrounding flocs in some instances forming bridges between them fig 1c such filaments would be expected to increase the hydrodynamic drag of floc particles slowing the settling of these particles 44 which are also expected to settle less readily due to their small size 4 2 particle size analysis the volume weighted mean diameter of the granular and floccular sludge particles were 340 μm and 220 μm respectively the size measurements of granules obtained via laser diffraction were considerably smaller than that observed by light microscopy this may be due to shearing in the mastersizer or other factors which make this approach in general unreliable for measuring sludge particles 45 the laser diffraction results are merely indicative that the granular particles are much larger than the floccular sludge particles and that the light microscopy results are more reliable in this instance 4 3 cryo sem the granules exhibited a different surface morphology and internal structure to the floccular samples when examined by cryo sem the surface of the granules featured filaments with segmentation as well as coccoid cells fig 2 a which are common morphologies for different species of wastewater bacteria 46 47 the interior of the granules was also dense tightly packed filamentous structures were arranged in a semi ordered pattern in the layers 200 300 μm just below the surface fig 2b presumably due to the outward growth of filamentous bacteria as these structures resemble those on the surface regions deeper within the interior consisted of a dense matrix with no discernible pattern or filamentous structures fig 2c past studies have indicated that the microbial distribution is layered inside granules with some studies reporting inner cores consisting of metabolically inactive bacteria 48 anoxic microbes 22 or even lacking microbes 49 while layers closer to the surface exhibit greater microbial activity this shift in composition is presumably due to oxygen diffusion which may be limited to about 200 400 μm below the surface leading to an anoxic zone deeper inside the interior 16 22 the highly compact matrix of the granules is likely a result of greater eps production which has been shown to play an essential role in the formation of microbial granules 49 in contrast the flocs had an open porous network structure which continued throughout the interior of the floc fig 3 also see supplementary figure s1 for a more comprehensive comparison at different length scales which is in agreement with a past study that produced comparable electron micrographs 50 the regular pores which spanned several micrometers in diameter would allow greater diffusion and movement within these flocs including the diffusion of oxygen potentially supporting cell growth within the interior the light microscopy images indicate the presence of filaments on the surface of flocs that extend out into the bulk wastewater the identification of these filamentous or other cellular structures within the interior using cryo sem was difficult the diameter of some structural components in the floc interior were similar however to the diameter of the protruding filaments suggesting these structures could be cells the difficulty in observing cells within these flocs is largely expected as these filaments and other bacteria are likely integrated within the highly branched network of the floc 51 20 interestingly a large number of bright spots were evident across the surface of the granular samples indicating a greater degree of charging by the electron beam than for the surrounding area fig 4 and supplementary figure s2 edx microanalysis of these bright spots indicated they were enriched in sulphur containing on average 10 mol sulphur compared to 4 2 mol sulphur in the surrounding surface material the spots were typically circular in appearance with a diameter of 0 5 μm and with up to 30 spots occurring heterogeneously across an area of 10 μm2 this finding also illustrates the advantage of using cryo sem for imaging as these spots were less visible in samples dehydrated during preparation data not shown the bright spots are indicative of sulphur oxidising bacteria sob the location of these bright spots on the outside of the granules is consistent with past studies which used microsensors to observe that oxidation of sulphide took place within an oxygen rich and narrow outer surface layer of aerobic biofilms leading to the formation of precipitates of s and potentially fes 52 53 the location of these bright spots also suggests these bacteria may be more metabolically active within the surface layer further supporting the idea that granules are highly layered structures the enrichment of sobs seen using cryo sem is supported by ngs analysis of samples collected from the neighbouring full scale sbr and pilot scale sbr which was performed to compare the ecology of the flocs and granules a closer review of this data found that the granules had an enrichment of the class gammaproteobacteria which includes many sob screening of potential sob candidates within gammaproteobacteria found that there was a large enrichment of chromatiales sp within the granules which represents 19 of all operational taxonomic units otu detected compared to only 5 4 within the floccular sample fig 5 a furthermore screening of potential sulphate reducing bacteria srb members fig 5b found that srbs such as desulfobacterales desulphuromonadales and syntrophobacterales were present in both floc and granular sludge samples while preliminary these results together with the cryo sem observations suggest a potential role for sob and possibly srb in aerobic granular sludge applied for the treatment of high saline sewage 5 3 6 1 g l of nacl where sulphate is present 9 the high sulphate concentrations measured within the saline sewage 0 6 1 0 g l combined with the use of an anaerobic feed phase in the granular sludge pilot plant may have created conditions favourable for sulphate reduction by srb thereby providing a source of sulphide for the development of the sob during the aeration phase sulphide may then be oxidised by sob under aerobic and or anoxic conditions i e autotrophic denitrification due to the existence of an oxygen gradient within the granules these processes have previously been applied for the treatment of high saline wastewater however via the use of separate reactor compartments to provide the required anaerobic anoxic and aerobic conditions 54 the role of sob and srb in aerobic granular sludge is unclear and warrants further investigation given that recent studies have shown that aerobic granular sludge is readily established 9 42 or accelerated 55 when treating wastewater impacted by seawater several of the bright spots observed on the surface of the granules were also found to be enriched in phosphorus or aluminium data not shown this finding indicated the complexity of the microbial community and metabolic activity occurring within the granular structure and suggests that further characterisation of this diversity will lead to new insights into the microbial community that exists within sludge granules 4 4 solids density and volatile solids the physical characteristics measured for the granular and floccular sludges are summarised in table 1 together with another previously characterized floccular sludge from altona sbr 25 allowing for comparisons across different sbr treatment plants the densities of the suspended solids i e densities of the dried solids fraction of the granules or floc particles in all three samples were high with both samples from the bolivar wwtp being exceptionally high this high density is potentially due to the high saline feed conditions for these samples compared to most wastewater treatment plants where solids densities usually range between 1100 1400 kg m3 36 there were statistically significant differences in solids density between all samples as the density of the granules was in between the density of the flocs from the altona and bolivar samples there was no clear indication that granulation is a major factor affecting solids density this observation may seem counterintuitive as the cryo sem analysis clearly shows that granules have a much denser network structure the suspended solids density measures the skeletal density however i e the density of the network structure itself as all water is dried during the measurements therefore the density is a different complementary measure to the observations made by cryo sem the volatile solids content of the granular sludge was similar to the floccular sludge from altona table 1 the volatile solids is of particular interest because it has been shown to be an indicator of the dewatering behaviour in floccular sewage sludges with higher volatile solids generally leading to reduced dewaterability 25 as there is no big difference in volatile solids concentration between the granular sludge from bolivar and the floccular sludge from altona big differences in dewaterability would not be expected between these two samples conversely as the floccular sludge from the bolivar wwtp has a lower volatile solids concentration than the granular sludge a small improvement in dewaterability is expected for the bolivar floccular sludge 4 5 dewatering characterisation sedimentation and filtration tests were performed on the granular and floccular sludges the sedimentation and 100 kpa filtration results for the three sludges are shown in fig 6 a and b respectively whilst direct comparison of these results is not recommended since the behaviour is highly dependent on the initial concentration which varied it is clear that the granular sludge settled much quicker than the floccular sludges also shown in fig 6 are predictions of sedimentation and filtration based on the extracted material properties the experimental data and predictions are in close agreement for the granular and floccular sludges this agreement indicates that the material properties can be used with confidence to predict the material dewatering behaviour of the granular and floccular samples 25 within the range of experimental data reported here analysis of the interfacial height as a function of time during sedimentation gives the gel point and low concentration rate information while analysis of the filtrate rate and solids content during filtration gives high solids content information the analysis results are presented as the dewatering material functions p y ϕ and r ϕ along with the settling velocity u ϕ figs 7 a c both granular and floccular sludges formed networked gels at similar concentrations of ϕ g 0 0033 v v and 0 0045 v v respectively i e the point of intercept with the x axis where p y ϕ g 0 in fig 7a the granular sludge had a similar gel point to the floccular samples fig 6 but reached a slightly higher solids content at high pressures 20 300 kpa compared to the floccular sludge the permeability of granular and floccular sludge samples was found to be similar at higher solids concentrations 0 1 v v solids fraction exhibiting a similar r ϕ at a given solids fraction fig 7b at concentrations below the gel point i e 0 0033 0 0045 the granular sludge showed higher permeability than the floccular sludge e g at 0 002 v v the r ϕ for the granular sludge was 1 5 10 7 while for the bolivar and altona floccular sludges it was 1 0 10 9 and 1 8 10 8 respectively fig 7b according to a previous study on floccular sludge 56 this difference in permeability can be explained by the larger size and fewer protruding filaments of the granules fig 1 the hindered settling function r ϕ also indicates that granules settle faster than flocs at the same low solids volume fractions ϕ g of 0 0033 0 0045 v v fig 7b the settling velocity for the granular sludge samples was significantly greater than for the two floccular samples across the range of solids volume fractions measured fig 7c consistent with the larger size of the granular particles fig 1 the granular sludge with larger suspended particles has a much smaller surface area per unit volume compared to flocs reducing the drag forces that slow the settling rate compared to floccular sludge of the same solids concentration moreover the higher number of filaments protruding from flocs that were observed by light microscopy may increase the hydrodynamic drag of the settling solids 56 57 in contrast to improvements to sedimentation granulation does not appear to offer any improvement for high concentration processes such as filtration or centrifugation at high solids concentrations corresponding to sludge cakes 0 1 v v solids fraction the hindered settling function r ϕ represents the fluid drag through a sludge cake rather than the drag on settling particles there is very little difference in r ϕ between the granular and floccular samples at these concentrations fig 7b in a sludge cake there are no longer any individual flocs but a continuous solids network with permeability dictated by the removal of interstitial fluid from the network the granular sludge appears to have lost any advantage over the floccular sludge at these high concentrations which means that granulation would not offer any improvement for high concentration processes such as filtration or centrifugation even though the fraction of volatile solids is significantly higher our results are surprising as the only past study that appears to have investigated dewaterability reported a fairly clear advantage for granular sludge 17 the vacuum filtration and analysis methods employed in this past study however have been shown to be inadequate for analysing dewaterability as they do not explore the conditions of high pressure relevant to wastewater treatment processes 25 the comprehensive analysis presented here allows the advantages and disadvantages of granular sludge to be explored under conditions typical for industrial operation the model illustrated by lines connecting the experimental data points in figs 7a and b fits the experimentally measured values for p y ϕ compressive yield stress and r ϕ hindered settling function well for all wastewater samples the model behavior in the intermediate range of solids volume fractions differs for the samples from the different treatment plants this is especially evident for the p y ϕ data fit for the granular sludge sample from bolivar wwtp in fig 6a which exhibits a curve at solids volume fractions of ϕ 10 2 v v the intermediate region between sedimentation and filtration is unknown but it can have large effects on the initial rate of filtration the variation in the interpolating functions in the intermediate region arises because of the iterative analysis method that is used a point of interpolation is incorporated into r φ and varied until filtration predictions give the experimental results see fig 6b this internal validation is a necessary part of the analysis i e the material properties are those necessary to predict the experiments 4 6 predictions of dewatering performance the impact of the dewaterability of the sludge samples on process performance can be predicted using p y ϕ and r ϕ as inputs to a steady state thickener model 40 and a fixed cavity plate and frame filter press model 41 the thickener model reflects processes taking place in secondary clarifiers or the decant stages of an sbr reactor and is used to demonstrate the relative performance of the sludge samples in a steady state thickener under comparable conditions where the feed concentration is fixed at 0 001 v v and the bed height is 5 m the filter press model reflects downstream dewatering processes where the applied pressure is 300 kpa the feed solids volume fraction is 0 01 v v and the cavity width is 1 0 cm in the thickener model simulations indicate that the granular sludge settles more effectively than the floccular sludge leading to a higher throughput q s o l i d s through thickener processes at low underflow solids concentrations ϕ u where the thickener performance is predominantly determined by the settling rate fig 8 a to illustrate this point when ϕ u 0 003 v v the thickener area required to clarify the granular sludge is approximately 50 times smaller than that required to clarify the floccular sludge the relative performance of the granular and floccular sludges however alters as the underflow concentration increases beyond the gel point 0 0033 0 0045 v v where the thickener performance becomes limited by sludge compressibility the flocs display superior performance under these conditions leading to higher solids throughput fig 7a also shows that the behaviour predicted for the floccular sbr sludge from the bolivar wwtp is somewhat similar to the sbr sludge from the altona wwtp consistent with the similar settling properties for these two samples fig 6 b and c the fixed cavity plate and frame filter press model is used to demonstrate the potential impact of granulation on the performance of post thickening dewatering operations the filter press model enables comparison of sludges under conditions of equivalent feed concentration and pressure in this case the filter model predicts the granular and floccular sludges to have similar dewatering behaviour in filtration at 300 kpa fig 8b at x f 0 15 which is a reasonable final cake solids concentration for this applied pressure the granular sludge is predicted to have a throughput roughly 20 greater than the floccular sludges alternatively when operating a filter with a throughput of 4 10 3 kg hr m2 a concentration of 0 15 v v average cake solids could be achieved for the granular sludge whereas the floccular sludge would reach 0 145 v v average cake solids these differences are not great and close to the accuracy of the material properties determined from the experimental data overall the model predictions indicate that granular sludge behaves fairly similar to the floccular sludge at concentrations above the gel point 0 0033 0 0045 v v during filtration processes the filtration model predictions for the two bolivar sludges are quite different to the prediction for the sbr sludge from the altona wwtp also shown in fig 8b at ϕ 0 15 v v average cake solids the altona sludge is predicted to have a 150 higher throughput than the granular sludge while a fixed throughput of 4 10 3 kg hr m2 would achieve a solids concentration of 0 185 v v average cake solids the combined results of both models further support the observation that granular sludge is mostly advantageous in secondary clarification and decanting stages of the sbr process where the solids concentration is below the gel point ϕ 0 0033 0 0045 v v but granulation offers no significant advantage at solids volume fractions above the gel point as illustrated schematically in fig 9 past studies have shown that there is an optimum solids concentration 0 03 ϕ 0 05 for floccular sludge where a maximum digestion efficiency is attained 58 59 as granular and floccular sludge exhibit similar properties under anaerobic digestion 60 the same optimum solids concentration can be expected for granular sludge this optimum concentration is an order of magnitude higher than the gel point and the model in fig 8a predicts this concentration cannot easily be attained with granular sludge in a thickener consequently a filter press process would be necessary to further concentrate the granular sludge under these conditions however the granular sludge particles offer no advantage over the floccular sludge 5 conclusion in this study the biological and physical properties of granular and floccular sludges obtained from the same sewage feed were compared granules and flocs were found to differ significantly in their shape structure and biological characteristics granules were larger with a denser internal microstructure a surface featuring regions enriched with sulphur and greater densities of specific sob and srb species than flocs at low solids concentrations below the gel point the settling rate of granules was much faster than that of flocs as the granular particles were large and had reduced drag from fewer protruding filaments the faster settling rate is advantageous during secondary clarification and decanting processes of sbrs modelling predicts a 50 times reduction in required thickener area for granules compared to flocs under the given conditions at solids concentrations greater than the gel point however both granules and flocs adopt a similar network structure and granulation offers no advantage to filtration processes overall the results highlight the significant structural and biological differences due to granulation the structural and microbial data contributes to our understanding of the facets that lead to the greater nutrient removal capacity and shock resistance of granular sludge as well as providing dewatering properties and performance predictions to allow for the implementation of sludge granulation processes grant numbers the australian research council linkage

14422,the presence in natural watercourses of different types of emerging contaminants including stimulants and antibiotics from different sources constitutes a serious environmental issue the problem is aggravated in regions where water is scarce and its reuse should form part of its integrated cycle the removal of these contaminants so that the water may be reused is currently one of the most widely studied issues in the field of wastewater treatment within this context the present paper addresses the removal of different contaminants caffeine theobromine theophylline amoxicillin and penicillin g the chosen treatment was the use of reverse osmosis membranes which were installed at the outlet of the secondary settling tank of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp in medina sidonia sw spain carrying out sampling in the feed reject and permeate streams over a period of 72 h dow filmtec bw30 2540 membranes were used for this purpose operating at a pressure of 15 bar the emerging contaminants were analysed by ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms the applied treatments allowed a contaminant free permeate to be obtained with the required quality for its reuse this technique achieved 100 removal of the contaminants without signs of membrane deterioration after running the 72 h test keywords drugs membrane wastewater treatment plant and reusing 1 introduction the use of certain substances such as pharmaceuticals and stimulants is rising in modern society these substances have been grouped under the term emerging pollutants 1 or emerging contaminants there is no legislation regarding them and therefore their removal from wastewater at municipal treatment plants is not mandatory this entire issue is gaining importance as these compounds have not been subjected to suitable assessment regarding the environmental risks and impacts they can have on ecosystems and living beings including their effects on human health 2 3 most of the emerging contaminats are not considered in the list of priority pollutants developed by the european union and allowable concentrations in surface waters are not made available for environmental impact assessment 4 these substances may be responsible for eco toxicological changes such as the feminization of organisms 5 6 and microbiological resistance among others an example of these changes is the environmental impact produced by the existence of antibiotics such as penicillin even at low concentrations which can cause resistance in bacteria and other microorganisms 7 these include streptococcus pneumoniae which is classified as penicillin non susceptible on the world health organization who list of priority pathogens to help in prioritizing the research and development r d of new and effective antibiotic treatments 8 caffeine theobromine and theophylline which belong to the family of stimulants have also been detected in quite significant concentrations in both wastewater and receiving waters 9 10 especially in some mediterranean river basins where wwtp effluents constitute a high percentage of the total river flow especially in periods of drought 11 conventional wwtps usually based on biological processes are unable to fully remove these contaminants or any of their intermediate degradation products in other terms the majority of wastewater treatment plants are designed primarily to remove organic nutrients such as carbonaceous nitrogenous and phosphorous organic substances they are not required to remove emerging contaminat in particular antibiotic and stimulant 12 it is therefore necessary to resort to new treatments for their removal the technologies currently being employed include membrane processes in particular nanofiltration and reverse osmosis both technologies have been very effective in the removal of different organic compounds 13 as they enable the respective separation of divalent and monovalent ions from wastewater studies have been reported for the removal of these contaminants through other technologies such solar photocatalytic oxidation intermittent sand or coke filters 14 15 the environmental concern especially in the mediterranean countries where there is a shortage of water not only focuses on the removal of these pollutants but also on the possibility of obtaining a final wwtp effluent with sufficient quality to be reused nevertheless although there is a european discharge regulation 16 that regulates the organic load that wwtp effluents should have there is still no specific legislation on the possible reuse of these effluents as a pioneer in the reuse of wastewater spain has been the first to legislate on the quality of reclaimed water through royal decree 1620 2007 of 7 december which establishes the legal framework for the reuse of treated water 17 in order to be able to reuse permeate water reclaimed water spanish legislation requires a different quality this quality will vary according to the final use for which the permeate water is intended however neither the legislation on discharges nor that on reuse takes emerging pollutants into consideration as they are not among the priority substances in the field of water policy 16 numerous authors have devoted themselves to the removal of contaminants by reverse osmosis 18 20 however this study presents the results of the elimination of 5 emerging contaminants with a full scale pilot plant with real wastewater and for a period of 72 h to avoid the problems of contamination and increased resistance of bacteria to certain emerging contaminants that are being encountered the present paper studies the removal of emerging contaminants belonging to the families of stimulants caffeine theobromine and theophylline and antibiotics amoxicillin and penicillin g in municipal wastewater via reverse osmosis as a tertiary treatment at a wwtp these compounds have been selected because they present a high risk to the environment and human health or because they are a chemical marker for surface water pollution by domestic wastewaters were assessed it is expected to find an effective elimination of these contaminants in the permeate water through the treatment of reverse osmosis and that in turn the water obtained can be reused for other uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 equipment used 2 1 1 medina sidonia wwtp medina sidonia is a municipality in the province of cádiz in southern spain according to the latest data from the spanish institute of statistics for 2017 it has a population of 11 741 inhabitants 21 its wwtp is equipped to treat the wastewater from a population centre of 17 599 hab eq and can achieve a flow rate of 2223 m3 day 1 the wwtp has a water treatment line and a sludge treatment line the water treatment line comprises primary treatment coarse and fine screening and a de gritting and degreasing system and secondary treatment an extended aeration biological reactor and secondary settling in the sludge line the sludge is first thickened and then dehydrated until attaining a dry solids content above 60 it also has a deodorization system employing active carbon filtration according to european regulations 1 and its transposition into spanish law 22 23 which establishes the regulations applicable to the treatment of municipal wastewater the effluent from the wwtp meets discharge requirements 2 2 membrane technology reverse osmosis as the plant does not dispose of an advanced treatment that allows it to attain the level of water quality included in rd 1620 2007 17 permitting its reuse in the present study part of the effluent was subjected to advanced treatment by reverse osmosis the water reclamation plant is an aque frametm sea recovery desalination system equipped with a series of instruments for automated monitoring of the main control parameters fig 1 it is provided with a tank that feeds the osmosis unit equipped with a heat exchanger connected to an external cryostat which allows the temperature of the feed water to be controlled during the experiments the membrane housing is made of stainless steel to contain 2540 inch membranes distributed in a spiral configuration the reverse osmosis membrane was supplied by the dow filmtec company the chosen model was a bw30 2540 membrane which operated at a pressure of 15 bar the characteristics of reverse osmosis membrane are shown in table 1 control of the feed stream is carried out by means of a flowmeter installed in the inlet pipes to the feed tank likewise there are two flowmeters at both of the outlets of the permeated and reject streams a system of pipes equipped with three way valves for sampling purposes was used to convey the water along the three lines feed reject and permeate 2 3 reagents and chemical products used caffeine theobromine theophylline amoxicillin and penicillin g 99 purity all supplied by sigma aldrich madrid spain the mini columns used for solid phase extraction spe were supplied by waters oasis hlb cartridges waters corp milford ma the uplc hplc grade methanol and water used as solvents for chromatographic analysis were provided by scharlau barcelona spain formic acid 98 was purchased from sigma aldrich madrid spain the solutions of the emerging contaminants were prepared in each use in ultrapure water 2 4 experimental procedure during the characterization of the wastewater at medina sidonia wwtp it was observed that some of the contaminants were not present in all the analysed samples or were present at such low concentrations that it was difficult to quantify them therefore additional amounts of the contaminants under study had to be added to the effluent from the treatment plant a further aim was to study the removal capacity of this technology at concentrations higher than or equal to those usually observed at the wwtp for this purpose two pressure pumps located in the secondary settling tanks of the wwtp were used to pump the water through a 200 μm self cleaning filter copersa model 85102m p dc for its pre treatment once pre treated the water is sent 750 l h 1 flow rate to the feed tank 350 l of the reverse osmosis unit where it is mixed with a solution of the pharmaceutical drugs under study the feed tank worked at all times in open circuit this solution was prepared by diluting 56 g of each of the contaminants in a mixing tank with 400 l of wastewater the flow rate of the solution of pharmaceuticals into the reverse osmosis unit feed tank was 5 l h 1 this high concentration in the mixing tank is due to the fact that through the small flow of the peristaltic pump it is possible to contaminate the water for the study of the feed water fig 2 shows the flow chart in open circuit working conditions as a preventative measure the feed line from the feed tank is equipped with a pre filter consisting of a 5 μm mesh size polypropylene thread cartridge this ensures a sufficient quality of water before it enters the reverse osmosis unit thereby extending the useful life of the unit the necessary pressure to pump the feed stream through the membrane unit is achieved by means of a 075 kw 1hp centrifugal pump that provides a flow rate of 700 750 l h 1 furthermore the plant is equipped with a 1 49 kw 2 hp pistons pump capable of raising the pressure to 50 bars the concentration of each contaminant in the influent mixture to the reverse osmosis unit varied ranging from 0 177 0 557 mg l 1 for caffeine 0 101 0 534 mg l 1 for theobromine 0 135 0 641 mg l 1 for theophylline lods limit of detection 0 164 mg l 1 for amoxicillin and lods 0 213 mg l 1 for penicillin g similar amounts have been found for the family of antibiotics in influents to the gulf of cadiz spain by other authors 24 25 the open circuit process operated for 72 h with samples being taken at 1 2 4 12 24 48 and 72 h an autopsy of the membrane was performed to determine its integrity the accumulated fouling and the pollutants that may have been retained in it after carrying out the experiments 2 5 solid phase extraction spe the low concentrations of the pollutants under study in the reverse osmosis unit influent effluent and permeate streams meant that it was necessary to concentrate them by means of solid phase extraction to optimize the operating conditions and the type of columns used a series of trials were carried out following the procedures as used on a previous study 26 acetonitrile acn and methanol meoh were tested as eluting agents the best results were obtained with mini columns equipped with 60 mg solid phase oasis hlb cartridges supplied by waters using methanol as the eluyent the column was activated using 10 ml methanol and 10 ml water at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 then 100 ml of sample was passed through the mini column at the same flow rate with the aim of retaining the studied compounds the retained compounds were desorbed and eluted again using 10 ml methanol in a test tube at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 finally the extract was evaporated with liquid nitrogen at 40 c and the dry residue dissolved in 1 ml water the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter prior to the entire extraction analysis nylonflo 47 mm provided by pall corporation michigan 2 6 analytical techniques for the analysis of emerging contaminants an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc equipment was used the uplc was coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry was used for the identification quantification of analytes xevo waters synapt g2 to identify emerging contaminats was compared retention times and accurate mass measurements allowing an error of less than 5 mg l 1 to those for commercially available pure standards masslynx 4 1 software was employed to analize the compounds the noise type selected was root mean square rms limits of detection were calculated for the quantifier transition instrumental limits of detection ilod and quantitation iloq for each target compound were calculated based on the signal to noise ratio of 3 ilods and a signal to noise ratio of 10 iloqs near the target peak by using the lowest standard solution quantification of target compounds was performed using calibration curves from 1 10 3 to 1 mg l 1 prepared in water in 1 ml vials a dilution factor 1 2 of the greatest concentration samples was performed to calculate the levels of the analytes the reproducibility and repeatability of the methods were evaluated by performing three successive extractions and injections of the same sample and by re analyzing a batch of standards two weeks after its first analysis the mass spectrometer equipped with a 50 mm beh c18 column and 1 7 μm pore size both from waters milford ma a volume of 10 μl was injected into the column using methanol as the eluent the mass spectrum ranged from 50 to 1200 amu positive and negative electrosprays esi were used to identify the peaks representing the studied contaminants the total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn chromatography and analyser samples were filtered with merck 0 2 μm syringe they were measured on a shimadzu toc l cph analyser with an asi l autosampler and a tn unit thermo elemental iris intrepid icp aes spectrophotometer was used to the meausures of the concentrations of cations and anions in the fouling the deposits accumulated on the membrane were visualized using a nova nanosem 450 scanning electron microscope sem microanalysis of the majority chemical was analize in an energy dispersive spectrometers eds determination of the other parameters cod bod5 sst turbidity nitrogen and total phosphorus conductivity hardness ammonium chlorides total coliforms and escherichia coli was carried out in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of waters and wastewater 27 samples not uplc ms were analysed in duplicate or triplicate having a maximum standard deviation of 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 quality assurance quality control the intra day variation was evaluated by continuously injecting two replicates within a day differences observed ranged from 1 to 8 whereas the inter day variation was performed by analysing some replicates on different days differences observed were between 3 and 10 the ms response of all compounds was linear between 1 10 3 to 1 mg l 1 and coefficients of determination r2 for calibration curves were always above 0 9 for target compounds the limits of detection lods ranged were 0 001 0 0003 0 001 0 001 and 0 0006 mg l 1 to caffeine theobromine theophylline amoxicillin and penicillin g respectively and limits of quantitation loqs were 0 004 0 001 0 004 0 0014 and 0 002 mg l 1 respectively the retention time of the compounds was 0 68 0 44 0 56 0 42 and 3 38 for caffeine mw 195 0882 theobromine mw 181 0726 theophylline mw 181 0726 amoxicillin mw 366 1124 and penicillin g mw 357 0890 respectively the aqueous phase consisted of a 0 1 solution of formic acid a and methanol b as organic solvent the flow rate was 0 40 ml min 1 the best results were obtained in esi mode with an operating gradient that began with a 70 30 mix of water methanol for 3 min the water concentration was then decreased until 4 20 min until obtaining a ratio of 10 a 90 b subsequently returning to the initial conditions 70 30 at 4 50 min and maintaining this ratio until 5 min overall run time 5 min the recovery efficiencies of the mini columns using methanol to activate the columns and as the eluent were respectively 49 43 and 42 for caffeine theobromine and theophylline and 10 and 82 for amoxicillin and penicillin g although these values are low except for penicillin g the results coincide with those obtained by the authors of the reference method 26 3 2 characterization of the influent and effluent at medina sidonia wwtp table 2 shows the average values of the parameters analysed in the influent and effluent at medina sidonia wwtp as well as those corresponding to the four samplings carried out in the months in which the present study was conducted january march 2018 during this period appreciable rainfall was registered on 25 days a rate much higher than the 6 7 days of recent years 1981 2015 28 in general if we compare these results with those obtained by the same authors in previous studies 29 the wastewater reaching the medina sidonia treatment plant can still be considered medium polluted wastewater 30 the maximum values detected in most of the influent parameters correspond to a sample taken after one of the rainiest weeks in march which led to the increase in the flow of water entering the treatment plant the parameters with the highest standard deviations are chemical demand of oxygen cod 416 mgo2 l 1 total solids in suspension tss 525 mg l 1 turbidity 374 32 ntu conductivity 2031 ms cm 1 and hardness 747 mg caco3 l 1 the bod5 cod ratio presents an average value of 0 15 this is lower than the values usually found in municipal wastewater which vary between 0 2 0 5 31 thus indicating that there are a fraction of not easily biodegradable constituents 32 in the case of the pollutants under study a general decrease is observed with respect to the values found in previous studies the family of stimulants was always detected in the wwtp influent with average values of 19 3 and 19 μg l 1 for caffeine theobromine and theophylline respectively the values for the antibiotics were below 2 μg l 1 limit of quantification for the family of antibiotics or they were below the limit of detection findings in line with the results provided by other authors in the gulf of cadiz 25 the values of all the parameters in the effluent are lower than those obtained in the influent except for nitrates which increased from 13 63 to 21 34 mg l 1 the average removal rates obtained for cod bod5 and tss were 69 91 and 99 respectively the increase in nitrates in the effluent may be due to the oxidation of ammonia nh3 and nitrite no2 to nitrate no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria 33 these findings show that the wwtp achieves a quality effluent that complies with directive 91 271 eec 1 regarding discharges average values of 4 0 4 0 and 30 2 μg l 1 were quantification for caffeine theobromine and theophylline in the effluent respectively the high concentration of theophylline is worth highlighting possibly due to the fact that theophylline is a metabolite of caffeine hence a decrease in the concentration of caffeine may increase the concentration of theophylline 34 the family of antibiotics was rarely quantified in the samples from medina sidonia wwtp but they were detected contrary to what occurs in other larger cities in other european countries france 0 33 0 51 μg l 1 italy 0 29 0 58 μg l 1 greece 0 46 μg l 1 sweden 0 12 μg l 1 and switzerland 0 25 0 41 μg l 1 35 although the concentrations of these substances reaching aquatic ecosystems are low they may pose environmental and human health problems in the receiving waters due to the plant s limited capacity to degrade them 36 37 or to problems of accumulation in the environment on the other hand application of the water reuse regulations table 3 to the wwtp effluent shows that the values for e coli in the effluent 4 15 cfu 100 ml 1 u log10 are higher than those of this same parameter for less restrictive uses 4 cfu 100 ml 1 u log10 thus indicating that its reuse is not possible this finding together with the fact that the emerging contaminants are not removed by the conventional treatments employed at the plant means that more specific technologies need to be used for their treatment if the aim is to reuse this wastewater 3 3 removal of pharmaceutical drugs and stimulants by reverse osmosis before carrying the experiments to separate the contaminants using membrane technology it was necessary to check whether the solution of the contaminants underwent a process of biodegradation photo oxidation adsorption to the walls of the tank etc during its time of residence in the mixing tank 72 h that might result in variations in the concentration of the feed to the reverse osmosis unit two types of experiments were accordingly performed in the first a co solution in ultrapure water of 1 mg l 1 of the contaminants under study was prepared and placed in an amber glass flask to ensure complete darkness this experiment would serve as a reference blank experiment the flask was placed in the same room as the mixing tank to ensure the same environmental conditions in the second experiment the necessary amount of each antibiotic and stimulant was added to the 400 l of the mixing tank to achieve a concentration of approximately 1 mg l 1 for each pollutant the maximum concentration of caffeine found in the environment by other authors 38 the temperature in the glass flask varied between 15 and 25 c while the measured temperature in the mixing tank ranged between 10 and 25 c a daily sample was taken from both the flask and the tank for analysis during 3 days in the glass flask the degradation percentage on the third day was similar for caffeine theobromine and theophylline 23 24 and 23 respectively under the best conditions the results for amoxicillin and penicillin g were 46 and 37 respectively these findings show that degradation exists even under the best conditions and needs to be taken into account in the mixing tank the percentage degradation for the stimulants on the third day was respectively 20 and 18 for caffeine and theobromine and 7 for theophylline this may be because theophylline is a metabolite of caffeine and hence a decrease in the concentration of caffeine may lead to an increase in the concentration of theophylline 34 the greatest difference occurred in the family of antibiotics from the first day in the mixing tank percentage degradations of 52 and 46 were obtained for amoxicillin and penicillin g respectively reaching 89 and 70 on the third day of testing the results of both experiments confirmed that increasing the residence time generally led to an increase in the percentage degradation of the solution of contaminants and that the antibiotics degraded rapidly due to some type of process of hydrolysis of the drug itself adsorption to the solids in the water or to the tank walls biodegradation processes etc 10 all this led to a decrease in the concentration of contaminants reaching the reverse osmosis plant these results also indicate that the compounds under study especially the antibiotics might be degraded during the treatment processes employed at the plant however it should be recalled that the hydraulic residence times of wastewater in the biological treatment units of wwtps are considerably lower than those during which the wastewater remained in the mixing tank in the present study in addition the total mineralization of the compounds could not be confirmed since intermediate metabolites were not quantified which could become more dangerous than the contaminants studied 39 this uncertainty is further accompanied by the higher energy consumption of biological processes the definitive solution thus lies in the implementation of advanced treatment systems that are capable of removing these contaminants from wastewater and enable its reuse 40 after determining the way that the contaminant solutions might behave during the 72 h that the test lasted a series of experiments were carried out to test the performance of reverse osmosis membranes in the removal of stimulants and antibiotics table 4 shows the results thus obtained the concentrations in the feed stream were the same as those found by other authors in wwtp effluents and in effluents from hospital wastewaters 24 41 it can be seen that the concentration of each pollutant generally decreases with time due to the previously discussed processes the deviations from this behaviour are due to variations in the influent flow rate to the membrane feed tank from the wwtp itself which means that the concentration of each pollutant can vary thus caffeine varies from 0 557 mg l 1 2 h to 0 177 mg l 1 24 h and theobromine from 0 534 mg l 1 2 h to 0 104 mg l 1 24 h the highest concentration of theophylline in the feed stream was observed at 72 h 0 641 mg l 1 possibly due to the degradation of caffeine in the mixing tank with the subsequent increase in theophylline as previously discussed the minimum concentration of theophylline was detected at 2 h 0 104 mg l 1 amoxicillin and penicillin g were not detected in the feed after 48 h of testing due to their degradation or complete hydrolysis in the mixing tank that feeds the unit s feed tank in the permeate stream it can be observed that no contaminants were detected in any case whatsoever during the 72 h the study lasted table 4 it can therefore be concluded that 100 separation was obtained for all the compounds under study these results are in agreement with those reported by other authors 40 who detected removal rate of over 99 for caffeine in wastewater when using reverse osmosis on the other hand the concentrations in the reject stream are at all times higher than the starting concentrations in the feed stream the lowest concentrations found in the reject stream for caffeine theobromine and theophylline were respectively 0 209 mg l 1 48 h 0 230 mg l 1 12 h and 0 190 mg l 1 24 h and the highest 0 706 mg l 1 4 h 0 756 mg l 1 72 h and 0 742 mg l 1 72 h for amoxicillin and penicillin g the lowest reject concentrations were seen to occur at 24 h 0 103 and 0 052 mg l 1 and the highest in the first hour of operation 0 177 and 0 296 mg l 1 respectively higher concentrations in the reject stream for the family of antibiotics are normal during the first hours of operation due to the decrease in concentration in the feed stream in view of these results it can be stated that the dow filmtec bw30 2540 membrane provides very good results for the removal of the contaminants under study at the wwtp even at high concentrations hence the discharge or use of an effluent treated by means of this type of membrane would not pose any risk to the environment or human health as has been demonstrated it removes all possible risks due to the presence of the contaminants under study it is necessary to know the associated costs the theoretical power for a centrifugal pump is obtained according to the following equation 1 pb ρ g q hb where pb is the theoretical power of the pump watts p is the density of the fluid 1000 kg m 3 for water g is the acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s 2 q is the flow rate 0 0002 m3 s 1 720 l h 1 for both membranes hb is the working pressure 15 bar hence the theoretical power of the centrifugal pump was 300 186 w 0 32 kw for ro then one day will consume 7 68 kw day 1 taking into account the serious problems such as environmental social and bacterial resistance and the low energy cost it would be plausible to use these technologies as tertiary treatment in large populations 3 4 reclamation and reuse of the wastewater in order to determine the quality of the reclaimed water obtained after the membrane treatment and to analyse in which of the different uses established in the spanish legislation it may be reused different parameters specified in royal decree 1620 2007 17 were analysed in addition to the studied contaminants figs 3 and 4 show the values obtained for the analysed parameters in the feed permeate and reject streams during the time the experiment lasted and their comparison with the values stipulated in the aforementioned royal decree table 3 the parameter for intestinal nematodes was excluded from the study as none were detected in previous characterizations although other parameters of interest for the use of wastewater and the legislation of discharges have been included in the table it can be seen that for practically all the samples taken the values in the permeated stream of the parameters included in the discharge legislation bod5 cod and tss fig 3a c are always lower than those in the feed this indicates that tertiary treatment by reverse osmosis is effective for their removal obtaining removal rates of 81 71 and 88 respectively although there is no legislation regarding nutrients except in the case of discharges in a sensitive area directive 91 271 eec 1 they should be taken into account depending on the intended use of the reclaimed water their presence could result in processes of eutrophication herbaceous growth on streets or pavements excessive fertilization etc phosphates are removed 99 5 on average fig 3d and total phosphorus 76 these are fairly good percentages considering that there are inorganic forms of phosphorus such as polyphosphates from cleaning agents orthophosphates pyrophosphates triphosphates and anions that are difficult to remove from wastewater and show the good performance of the membrane against these compounds nitrogenous compounds ammonium and nitrates fig 3e and f present values below the limits of detection in the permeated stream except for the case of ammonium at 2 h total nitrogen with an 88 removal rate presents values in the feed stream ranging from 11 63 mg l 1 4 h to 20 07 mg l 1 72 h and in the permeate stream from 1 57 mg l 1 4 h to 2 01 mg l 1 72 h e coli and total coliforms except for the first 4 h are absent in the permeate fig 4c and d turbidity chlorides and hardness are below the limits of detection in the permeate stream fig 4a e and f these results mean that this stream is suitable for any of the uses allowed under current spanish regulations without any risk of fouling of machinery formation of calcareous deposits in pipes etc concentrations below the limit of detection 1 mg l 1 were obtained for toc in the permeate stream except for the first 4 h of operation 1 69 mg l 1 1 24 mg l 1 and 1 09 mg l 1 for 1 2 and 4 h respectively the ph does not show significant changes in any of the three streams the lowest values being for the reject stream fig 4h the results obtained in sections 3 2 and 3 3 allow us to conclude that the water obtained after the tertiary treatment by reverse osmosis may be used for any of the uses stipulated in the regulations including the most demanding 3 5 autopsy of the membrane one of the main aspects to be taken into account in membrane processes is the decrease in performance due to fouling 42 a lower yield means delays in operation lower water quality a decrease in the permeate stream and in the saline reject stream and hence a reduction in the economic performance of the operation 43 fouling can be classified as reversible and irreversible and knowledge of the fouling of the membrane will enable us to avoid it and determine the best conditions for cleaning and disinfecting the facility 44 therefore an autopsy was performed on the membrane used in the experiments the procedure employed was as follows analysis of the decrease in the permeate stream external and internal inspection of the membrane unit assessment of the membrane assessment of the deposits chemical analysis of the deposits and other analyses such as sem and eds the permeate stream presented a stable flow rate during the 72 h that the experiment lasted as to the external inspection it was verified that the physical integrity of the membrane had not suffered any variation similarly the permeate collector tube and the inlet ring were in good condition there was no telescoping effect or dirt on the membrane inlet or outlet after verifying that the membrane did not undergo any process of external degeneration the internal inspection was then carried out the membrane was accordingly cut and its layers unwound a small layer of fouling was lodged homogeneously in between the layers and in the spacer samples of the fouling and the membrane were taken and analysed under a scanning electron microscope sem and an elemental analysis was performed using energy dispersive spectrometry eds this latter technique allows us to determine the type of pollution that occurs in the membrane biological particles colloidal matter inorganic incrustation organic fouling and metals 45 the sample had to be pre treated with gold the moisture content and organic matter content of the fouling was analysed and an ion analysis was carried out with the following results moisture content of the sample loss at 105 c the sample presented a moisture content of 25 4 mg l 1 after being subjected to 105 c for 24 h organic matter content loss at 450 c after heating the sample to 450 c a loss of 24 7 mg l 1 of organic matter was detected cations ammonium potassium and calcium the observed values were 2 84 2 71 and 64 94 mg l 1 respectively anions chloride nitrites nitrates and phosphates were detected in the fouling at values of 94 59 0 33 89 26 and 10 13 mg l 1 respectively this demonstrates the capacity of the membrane to remove these pollutants which are retained in the fouling clusters of matter resulting from salt incrustations and several types of diatoms were observed under the microscope fig 5 eds showed that the priority compounds found in the fouling were organic matter oxygen carbon and nitrogen as well as sodium magnesium silica phosphorus and sulphur salts metals such as aluminium and gold were also detected the latter due to the gold metallization of the sample prior to analysis figure 38 it can therefore be concluded that different types of fouling are produced during the process as a result of the composition of the wastewater although of all of them biological fouling is the one that contributes the most due to the composition of the wastewater fig 6 the presence of the compounds found in the autopsy showed the correct functioning of this technology for the elimination of emerging contaminants in wastewater this means that the water can be reused without generating a risk derived from these contaminants 4 conclusions despite the large number of studies demonstrating the environmental risks and impacts emerging pollutants can have on ecosystems and living beings including their effects on human health they continue to be ignored by legislation if we also take into account that these contaminants are not being removed by the conventional treatments used in the plant it makes it essential to use more efficient technologies for their treatment overcoat if the objective is the reuse of these waste waters the removal of emerging contaminants such as caffeine theobromine theophylline amoxicillin and penicillin g have been studied in wwtp wastewater using bw30 2540 reverse osmosis membranes which have proven effective as a tertiary treatment this technique achieved 100 removal of the contaminants without signs of membrane deterioration in the 72 h the tests lasted likewise the other issues of current concern namely the scarcity of water is addressed in the study via the reclamation and reuse of the treated wastewater the bw30 2540 membrane producing water of sufficient quality for its reuse these uses include residential or urban irrigation e g irrigation of areas or street cleaning agricultural e g irrigation aquaculture industrial e g cooling towers process and cleaning water recreational e g golf courses and environmental e g recharge aquifers uses we can thus ensure that the water has an optimum quality for its reuse without the risks posed by these emerging contaminants both in receiving waters and water for human consumption acknowledgments we thank wwtp s technician of medina sidonia juan carlos for all his work and we also thank the global medina company for the facilities 
14422,the presence in natural watercourses of different types of emerging contaminants including stimulants and antibiotics from different sources constitutes a serious environmental issue the problem is aggravated in regions where water is scarce and its reuse should form part of its integrated cycle the removal of these contaminants so that the water may be reused is currently one of the most widely studied issues in the field of wastewater treatment within this context the present paper addresses the removal of different contaminants caffeine theobromine theophylline amoxicillin and penicillin g the chosen treatment was the use of reverse osmosis membranes which were installed at the outlet of the secondary settling tank of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp in medina sidonia sw spain carrying out sampling in the feed reject and permeate streams over a period of 72 h dow filmtec bw30 2540 membranes were used for this purpose operating at a pressure of 15 bar the emerging contaminants were analysed by ultra performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms the applied treatments allowed a contaminant free permeate to be obtained with the required quality for its reuse this technique achieved 100 removal of the contaminants without signs of membrane deterioration after running the 72 h test keywords drugs membrane wastewater treatment plant and reusing 1 introduction the use of certain substances such as pharmaceuticals and stimulants is rising in modern society these substances have been grouped under the term emerging pollutants 1 or emerging contaminants there is no legislation regarding them and therefore their removal from wastewater at municipal treatment plants is not mandatory this entire issue is gaining importance as these compounds have not been subjected to suitable assessment regarding the environmental risks and impacts they can have on ecosystems and living beings including their effects on human health 2 3 most of the emerging contaminats are not considered in the list of priority pollutants developed by the european union and allowable concentrations in surface waters are not made available for environmental impact assessment 4 these substances may be responsible for eco toxicological changes such as the feminization of organisms 5 6 and microbiological resistance among others an example of these changes is the environmental impact produced by the existence of antibiotics such as penicillin even at low concentrations which can cause resistance in bacteria and other microorganisms 7 these include streptococcus pneumoniae which is classified as penicillin non susceptible on the world health organization who list of priority pathogens to help in prioritizing the research and development r d of new and effective antibiotic treatments 8 caffeine theobromine and theophylline which belong to the family of stimulants have also been detected in quite significant concentrations in both wastewater and receiving waters 9 10 especially in some mediterranean river basins where wwtp effluents constitute a high percentage of the total river flow especially in periods of drought 11 conventional wwtps usually based on biological processes are unable to fully remove these contaminants or any of their intermediate degradation products in other terms the majority of wastewater treatment plants are designed primarily to remove organic nutrients such as carbonaceous nitrogenous and phosphorous organic substances they are not required to remove emerging contaminat in particular antibiotic and stimulant 12 it is therefore necessary to resort to new treatments for their removal the technologies currently being employed include membrane processes in particular nanofiltration and reverse osmosis both technologies have been very effective in the removal of different organic compounds 13 as they enable the respective separation of divalent and monovalent ions from wastewater studies have been reported for the removal of these contaminants through other technologies such solar photocatalytic oxidation intermittent sand or coke filters 14 15 the environmental concern especially in the mediterranean countries where there is a shortage of water not only focuses on the removal of these pollutants but also on the possibility of obtaining a final wwtp effluent with sufficient quality to be reused nevertheless although there is a european discharge regulation 16 that regulates the organic load that wwtp effluents should have there is still no specific legislation on the possible reuse of these effluents as a pioneer in the reuse of wastewater spain has been the first to legislate on the quality of reclaimed water through royal decree 1620 2007 of 7 december which establishes the legal framework for the reuse of treated water 17 in order to be able to reuse permeate water reclaimed water spanish legislation requires a different quality this quality will vary according to the final use for which the permeate water is intended however neither the legislation on discharges nor that on reuse takes emerging pollutants into consideration as they are not among the priority substances in the field of water policy 16 numerous authors have devoted themselves to the removal of contaminants by reverse osmosis 18 20 however this study presents the results of the elimination of 5 emerging contaminants with a full scale pilot plant with real wastewater and for a period of 72 h to avoid the problems of contamination and increased resistance of bacteria to certain emerging contaminants that are being encountered the present paper studies the removal of emerging contaminants belonging to the families of stimulants caffeine theobromine and theophylline and antibiotics amoxicillin and penicillin g in municipal wastewater via reverse osmosis as a tertiary treatment at a wwtp these compounds have been selected because they present a high risk to the environment and human health or because they are a chemical marker for surface water pollution by domestic wastewaters were assessed it is expected to find an effective elimination of these contaminants in the permeate water through the treatment of reverse osmosis and that in turn the water obtained can be reused for other uses 2 materials and methods 2 1 equipment used 2 1 1 medina sidonia wwtp medina sidonia is a municipality in the province of cádiz in southern spain according to the latest data from the spanish institute of statistics for 2017 it has a population of 11 741 inhabitants 21 its wwtp is equipped to treat the wastewater from a population centre of 17 599 hab eq and can achieve a flow rate of 2223 m3 day 1 the wwtp has a water treatment line and a sludge treatment line the water treatment line comprises primary treatment coarse and fine screening and a de gritting and degreasing system and secondary treatment an extended aeration biological reactor and secondary settling in the sludge line the sludge is first thickened and then dehydrated until attaining a dry solids content above 60 it also has a deodorization system employing active carbon filtration according to european regulations 1 and its transposition into spanish law 22 23 which establishes the regulations applicable to the treatment of municipal wastewater the effluent from the wwtp meets discharge requirements 2 2 membrane technology reverse osmosis as the plant does not dispose of an advanced treatment that allows it to attain the level of water quality included in rd 1620 2007 17 permitting its reuse in the present study part of the effluent was subjected to advanced treatment by reverse osmosis the water reclamation plant is an aque frametm sea recovery desalination system equipped with a series of instruments for automated monitoring of the main control parameters fig 1 it is provided with a tank that feeds the osmosis unit equipped with a heat exchanger connected to an external cryostat which allows the temperature of the feed water to be controlled during the experiments the membrane housing is made of stainless steel to contain 2540 inch membranes distributed in a spiral configuration the reverse osmosis membrane was supplied by the dow filmtec company the chosen model was a bw30 2540 membrane which operated at a pressure of 15 bar the characteristics of reverse osmosis membrane are shown in table 1 control of the feed stream is carried out by means of a flowmeter installed in the inlet pipes to the feed tank likewise there are two flowmeters at both of the outlets of the permeated and reject streams a system of pipes equipped with three way valves for sampling purposes was used to convey the water along the three lines feed reject and permeate 2 3 reagents and chemical products used caffeine theobromine theophylline amoxicillin and penicillin g 99 purity all supplied by sigma aldrich madrid spain the mini columns used for solid phase extraction spe were supplied by waters oasis hlb cartridges waters corp milford ma the uplc hplc grade methanol and water used as solvents for chromatographic analysis were provided by scharlau barcelona spain formic acid 98 was purchased from sigma aldrich madrid spain the solutions of the emerging contaminants were prepared in each use in ultrapure water 2 4 experimental procedure during the characterization of the wastewater at medina sidonia wwtp it was observed that some of the contaminants were not present in all the analysed samples or were present at such low concentrations that it was difficult to quantify them therefore additional amounts of the contaminants under study had to be added to the effluent from the treatment plant a further aim was to study the removal capacity of this technology at concentrations higher than or equal to those usually observed at the wwtp for this purpose two pressure pumps located in the secondary settling tanks of the wwtp were used to pump the water through a 200 μm self cleaning filter copersa model 85102m p dc for its pre treatment once pre treated the water is sent 750 l h 1 flow rate to the feed tank 350 l of the reverse osmosis unit where it is mixed with a solution of the pharmaceutical drugs under study the feed tank worked at all times in open circuit this solution was prepared by diluting 56 g of each of the contaminants in a mixing tank with 400 l of wastewater the flow rate of the solution of pharmaceuticals into the reverse osmosis unit feed tank was 5 l h 1 this high concentration in the mixing tank is due to the fact that through the small flow of the peristaltic pump it is possible to contaminate the water for the study of the feed water fig 2 shows the flow chart in open circuit working conditions as a preventative measure the feed line from the feed tank is equipped with a pre filter consisting of a 5 μm mesh size polypropylene thread cartridge this ensures a sufficient quality of water before it enters the reverse osmosis unit thereby extending the useful life of the unit the necessary pressure to pump the feed stream through the membrane unit is achieved by means of a 075 kw 1hp centrifugal pump that provides a flow rate of 700 750 l h 1 furthermore the plant is equipped with a 1 49 kw 2 hp pistons pump capable of raising the pressure to 50 bars the concentration of each contaminant in the influent mixture to the reverse osmosis unit varied ranging from 0 177 0 557 mg l 1 for caffeine 0 101 0 534 mg l 1 for theobromine 0 135 0 641 mg l 1 for theophylline lods limit of detection 0 164 mg l 1 for amoxicillin and lods 0 213 mg l 1 for penicillin g similar amounts have been found for the family of antibiotics in influents to the gulf of cadiz spain by other authors 24 25 the open circuit process operated for 72 h with samples being taken at 1 2 4 12 24 48 and 72 h an autopsy of the membrane was performed to determine its integrity the accumulated fouling and the pollutants that may have been retained in it after carrying out the experiments 2 5 solid phase extraction spe the low concentrations of the pollutants under study in the reverse osmosis unit influent effluent and permeate streams meant that it was necessary to concentrate them by means of solid phase extraction to optimize the operating conditions and the type of columns used a series of trials were carried out following the procedures as used on a previous study 26 acetonitrile acn and methanol meoh were tested as eluting agents the best results were obtained with mini columns equipped with 60 mg solid phase oasis hlb cartridges supplied by waters using methanol as the eluyent the column was activated using 10 ml methanol and 10 ml water at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 then 100 ml of sample was passed through the mini column at the same flow rate with the aim of retaining the studied compounds the retained compounds were desorbed and eluted again using 10 ml methanol in a test tube at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 finally the extract was evaporated with liquid nitrogen at 40 c and the dry residue dissolved in 1 ml water the samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter prior to the entire extraction analysis nylonflo 47 mm provided by pall corporation michigan 2 6 analytical techniques for the analysis of emerging contaminants an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc equipment was used the uplc was coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry was used for the identification quantification of analytes xevo waters synapt g2 to identify emerging contaminats was compared retention times and accurate mass measurements allowing an error of less than 5 mg l 1 to those for commercially available pure standards masslynx 4 1 software was employed to analize the compounds the noise type selected was root mean square rms limits of detection were calculated for the quantifier transition instrumental limits of detection ilod and quantitation iloq for each target compound were calculated based on the signal to noise ratio of 3 ilods and a signal to noise ratio of 10 iloqs near the target peak by using the lowest standard solution quantification of target compounds was performed using calibration curves from 1 10 3 to 1 mg l 1 prepared in water in 1 ml vials a dilution factor 1 2 of the greatest concentration samples was performed to calculate the levels of the analytes the reproducibility and repeatability of the methods were evaluated by performing three successive extractions and injections of the same sample and by re analyzing a batch of standards two weeks after its first analysis the mass spectrometer equipped with a 50 mm beh c18 column and 1 7 μm pore size both from waters milford ma a volume of 10 μl was injected into the column using methanol as the eluent the mass spectrum ranged from 50 to 1200 amu positive and negative electrosprays esi were used to identify the peaks representing the studied contaminants the total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn chromatography and analyser samples were filtered with merck 0 2 μm syringe they were measured on a shimadzu toc l cph analyser with an asi l autosampler and a tn unit thermo elemental iris intrepid icp aes spectrophotometer was used to the meausures of the concentrations of cations and anions in the fouling the deposits accumulated on the membrane were visualized using a nova nanosem 450 scanning electron microscope sem microanalysis of the majority chemical was analize in an energy dispersive spectrometers eds determination of the other parameters cod bod5 sst turbidity nitrogen and total phosphorus conductivity hardness ammonium chlorides total coliforms and escherichia coli was carried out in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of waters and wastewater 27 samples not uplc ms were analysed in duplicate or triplicate having a maximum standard deviation of 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 quality assurance quality control the intra day variation was evaluated by continuously injecting two replicates within a day differences observed ranged from 1 to 8 whereas the inter day variation was performed by analysing some replicates on different days differences observed were between 3 and 10 the ms response of all compounds was linear between 1 10 3 to 1 mg l 1 and coefficients of determination r2 for calibration curves were always above 0 9 for target compounds the limits of detection lods ranged were 0 001 0 0003 0 001 0 001 and 0 0006 mg l 1 to caffeine theobromine theophylline amoxicillin and penicillin g respectively and limits of quantitation loqs were 0 004 0 001 0 004 0 0014 and 0 002 mg l 1 respectively the retention time of the compounds was 0 68 0 44 0 56 0 42 and 3 38 for caffeine mw 195 0882 theobromine mw 181 0726 theophylline mw 181 0726 amoxicillin mw 366 1124 and penicillin g mw 357 0890 respectively the aqueous phase consisted of a 0 1 solution of formic acid a and methanol b as organic solvent the flow rate was 0 40 ml min 1 the best results were obtained in esi mode with an operating gradient that began with a 70 30 mix of water methanol for 3 min the water concentration was then decreased until 4 20 min until obtaining a ratio of 10 a 90 b subsequently returning to the initial conditions 70 30 at 4 50 min and maintaining this ratio until 5 min overall run time 5 min the recovery efficiencies of the mini columns using methanol to activate the columns and as the eluent were respectively 49 43 and 42 for caffeine theobromine and theophylline and 10 and 82 for amoxicillin and penicillin g although these values are low except for penicillin g the results coincide with those obtained by the authors of the reference method 26 3 2 characterization of the influent and effluent at medina sidonia wwtp table 2 shows the average values of the parameters analysed in the influent and effluent at medina sidonia wwtp as well as those corresponding to the four samplings carried out in the months in which the present study was conducted january march 2018 during this period appreciable rainfall was registered on 25 days a rate much higher than the 6 7 days of recent years 1981 2015 28 in general if we compare these results with those obtained by the same authors in previous studies 29 the wastewater reaching the medina sidonia treatment plant can still be considered medium polluted wastewater 30 the maximum values detected in most of the influent parameters correspond to a sample taken after one of the rainiest weeks in march which led to the increase in the flow of water entering the treatment plant the parameters with the highest standard deviations are chemical demand of oxygen cod 416 mgo2 l 1 total solids in suspension tss 525 mg l 1 turbidity 374 32 ntu conductivity 2031 ms cm 1 and hardness 747 mg caco3 l 1 the bod5 cod ratio presents an average value of 0 15 this is lower than the values usually found in municipal wastewater which vary between 0 2 0 5 31 thus indicating that there are a fraction of not easily biodegradable constituents 32 in the case of the pollutants under study a general decrease is observed with respect to the values found in previous studies the family of stimulants was always detected in the wwtp influent with average values of 19 3 and 19 μg l 1 for caffeine theobromine and theophylline respectively the values for the antibiotics were below 2 μg l 1 limit of quantification for the family of antibiotics or they were below the limit of detection findings in line with the results provided by other authors in the gulf of cadiz 25 the values of all the parameters in the effluent are lower than those obtained in the influent except for nitrates which increased from 13 63 to 21 34 mg l 1 the average removal rates obtained for cod bod5 and tss were 69 91 and 99 respectively the increase in nitrates in the effluent may be due to the oxidation of ammonia nh3 and nitrite no2 to nitrate no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria 33 these findings show that the wwtp achieves a quality effluent that complies with directive 91 271 eec 1 regarding discharges average values of 4 0 4 0 and 30 2 μg l 1 were quantification for caffeine theobromine and theophylline in the effluent respectively the high concentration of theophylline is worth highlighting possibly due to the fact that theophylline is a metabolite of caffeine hence a decrease in the concentration of caffeine may increase the concentration of theophylline 34 the family of antibiotics was rarely quantified in the samples from medina sidonia wwtp but they were detected contrary to what occurs in other larger cities in other european countries france 0 33 0 51 μg l 1 italy 0 29 0 58 μg l 1 greece 0 46 μg l 1 sweden 0 12 μg l 1 and switzerland 0 25 0 41 μg l 1 35 although the concentrations of these substances reaching aquatic ecosystems are low they may pose environmental and human health problems in the receiving waters due to the plant s limited capacity to degrade them 36 37 or to problems of accumulation in the environment on the other hand application of the water reuse regulations table 3 to the wwtp effluent shows that the values for e coli in the effluent 4 15 cfu 100 ml 1 u log10 are higher than those of this same parameter for less restrictive uses 4 cfu 100 ml 1 u log10 thus indicating that its reuse is not possible this finding together with the fact that the emerging contaminants are not removed by the conventional treatments employed at the plant means that more specific technologies need to be used for their treatment if the aim is to reuse this wastewater 3 3 removal of pharmaceutical drugs and stimulants by reverse osmosis before carrying the experiments to separate the contaminants using membrane technology it was necessary to check whether the solution of the contaminants underwent a process of biodegradation photo oxidation adsorption to the walls of the tank etc during its time of residence in the mixing tank 72 h that might result in variations in the concentration of the feed to the reverse osmosis unit two types of experiments were accordingly performed in the first a co solution in ultrapure water of 1 mg l 1 of the contaminants under study was prepared and placed in an amber glass flask to ensure complete darkness this experiment would serve as a reference blank experiment the flask was placed in the same room as the mixing tank to ensure the same environmental conditions in the second experiment the necessary amount of each antibiotic and stimulant was added to the 400 l of the mixing tank to achieve a concentration of approximately 1 mg l 1 for each pollutant the maximum concentration of caffeine found in the environment by other authors 38 the temperature in the glass flask varied between 15 and 25 c while the measured temperature in the mixing tank ranged between 10 and 25 c a daily sample was taken from both the flask and the tank for analysis during 3 days in the glass flask the degradation percentage on the third day was similar for caffeine theobromine and theophylline 23 24 and 23 respectively under the best conditions the results for amoxicillin and penicillin g were 46 and 37 respectively these findings show that degradation exists even under the best conditions and needs to be taken into account in the mixing tank the percentage degradation for the stimulants on the third day was respectively 20 and 18 for caffeine and theobromine and 7 for theophylline this may be because theophylline is a metabolite of caffeine and hence a decrease in the concentration of caffeine may lead to an increase in the concentration of theophylline 34 the greatest difference occurred in the family of antibiotics from the first day in the mixing tank percentage degradations of 52 and 46 were obtained for amoxicillin and penicillin g respectively reaching 89 and 70 on the third day of testing the results of both experiments confirmed that increasing the residence time generally led to an increase in the percentage degradation of the solution of contaminants and that the antibiotics degraded rapidly due to some type of process of hydrolysis of the drug itself adsorption to the solids in the water or to the tank walls biodegradation processes etc 10 all this led to a decrease in the concentration of contaminants reaching the reverse osmosis plant these results also indicate that the compounds under study especially the antibiotics might be degraded during the treatment processes employed at the plant however it should be recalled that the hydraulic residence times of wastewater in the biological treatment units of wwtps are considerably lower than those during which the wastewater remained in the mixing tank in the present study in addition the total mineralization of the compounds could not be confirmed since intermediate metabolites were not quantified which could become more dangerous than the contaminants studied 39 this uncertainty is further accompanied by the higher energy consumption of biological processes the definitive solution thus lies in the implementation of advanced treatment systems that are capable of removing these contaminants from wastewater and enable its reuse 40 after determining the way that the contaminant solutions might behave during the 72 h that the test lasted a series of experiments were carried out to test the performance of reverse osmosis membranes in the removal of stimulants and antibiotics table 4 shows the results thus obtained the concentrations in the feed stream were the same as those found by other authors in wwtp effluents and in effluents from hospital wastewaters 24 41 it can be seen that the concentration of each pollutant generally decreases with time due to the previously discussed processes the deviations from this behaviour are due to variations in the influent flow rate to the membrane feed tank from the wwtp itself which means that the concentration of each pollutant can vary thus caffeine varies from 0 557 mg l 1 2 h to 0 177 mg l 1 24 h and theobromine from 0 534 mg l 1 2 h to 0 104 mg l 1 24 h the highest concentration of theophylline in the feed stream was observed at 72 h 0 641 mg l 1 possibly due to the degradation of caffeine in the mixing tank with the subsequent increase in theophylline as previously discussed the minimum concentration of theophylline was detected at 2 h 0 104 mg l 1 amoxicillin and penicillin g were not detected in the feed after 48 h of testing due to their degradation or complete hydrolysis in the mixing tank that feeds the unit s feed tank in the permeate stream it can be observed that no contaminants were detected in any case whatsoever during the 72 h the study lasted table 4 it can therefore be concluded that 100 separation was obtained for all the compounds under study these results are in agreement with those reported by other authors 40 who detected removal rate of over 99 for caffeine in wastewater when using reverse osmosis on the other hand the concentrations in the reject stream are at all times higher than the starting concentrations in the feed stream the lowest concentrations found in the reject stream for caffeine theobromine and theophylline were respectively 0 209 mg l 1 48 h 0 230 mg l 1 12 h and 0 190 mg l 1 24 h and the highest 0 706 mg l 1 4 h 0 756 mg l 1 72 h and 0 742 mg l 1 72 h for amoxicillin and penicillin g the lowest reject concentrations were seen to occur at 24 h 0 103 and 0 052 mg l 1 and the highest in the first hour of operation 0 177 and 0 296 mg l 1 respectively higher concentrations in the reject stream for the family of antibiotics are normal during the first hours of operation due to the decrease in concentration in the feed stream in view of these results it can be stated that the dow filmtec bw30 2540 membrane provides very good results for the removal of the contaminants under study at the wwtp even at high concentrations hence the discharge or use of an effluent treated by means of this type of membrane would not pose any risk to the environment or human health as has been demonstrated it removes all possible risks due to the presence of the contaminants under study it is necessary to know the associated costs the theoretical power for a centrifugal pump is obtained according to the following equation 1 pb ρ g q hb where pb is the theoretical power of the pump watts p is the density of the fluid 1000 kg m 3 for water g is the acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s 2 q is the flow rate 0 0002 m3 s 1 720 l h 1 for both membranes hb is the working pressure 15 bar hence the theoretical power of the centrifugal pump was 300 186 w 0 32 kw for ro then one day will consume 7 68 kw day 1 taking into account the serious problems such as environmental social and bacterial resistance and the low energy cost it would be plausible to use these technologies as tertiary treatment in large populations 3 4 reclamation and reuse of the wastewater in order to determine the quality of the reclaimed water obtained after the membrane treatment and to analyse in which of the different uses established in the spanish legislation it may be reused different parameters specified in royal decree 1620 2007 17 were analysed in addition to the studied contaminants figs 3 and 4 show the values obtained for the analysed parameters in the feed permeate and reject streams during the time the experiment lasted and their comparison with the values stipulated in the aforementioned royal decree table 3 the parameter for intestinal nematodes was excluded from the study as none were detected in previous characterizations although other parameters of interest for the use of wastewater and the legislation of discharges have been included in the table it can be seen that for practically all the samples taken the values in the permeated stream of the parameters included in the discharge legislation bod5 cod and tss fig 3a c are always lower than those in the feed this indicates that tertiary treatment by reverse osmosis is effective for their removal obtaining removal rates of 81 71 and 88 respectively although there is no legislation regarding nutrients except in the case of discharges in a sensitive area directive 91 271 eec 1 they should be taken into account depending on the intended use of the reclaimed water their presence could result in processes of eutrophication herbaceous growth on streets or pavements excessive fertilization etc phosphates are removed 99 5 on average fig 3d and total phosphorus 76 these are fairly good percentages considering that there are inorganic forms of phosphorus such as polyphosphates from cleaning agents orthophosphates pyrophosphates triphosphates and anions that are difficult to remove from wastewater and show the good performance of the membrane against these compounds nitrogenous compounds ammonium and nitrates fig 3e and f present values below the limits of detection in the permeated stream except for the case of ammonium at 2 h total nitrogen with an 88 removal rate presents values in the feed stream ranging from 11 63 mg l 1 4 h to 20 07 mg l 1 72 h and in the permeate stream from 1 57 mg l 1 4 h to 2 01 mg l 1 72 h e coli and total coliforms except for the first 4 h are absent in the permeate fig 4c and d turbidity chlorides and hardness are below the limits of detection in the permeate stream fig 4a e and f these results mean that this stream is suitable for any of the uses allowed under current spanish regulations without any risk of fouling of machinery formation of calcareous deposits in pipes etc concentrations below the limit of detection 1 mg l 1 were obtained for toc in the permeate stream except for the first 4 h of operation 1 69 mg l 1 1 24 mg l 1 and 1 09 mg l 1 for 1 2 and 4 h respectively the ph does not show significant changes in any of the three streams the lowest values being for the reject stream fig 4h the results obtained in sections 3 2 and 3 3 allow us to conclude that the water obtained after the tertiary treatment by reverse osmosis may be used for any of the uses stipulated in the regulations including the most demanding 3 5 autopsy of the membrane one of the main aspects to be taken into account in membrane processes is the decrease in performance due to fouling 42 a lower yield means delays in operation lower water quality a decrease in the permeate stream and in the saline reject stream and hence a reduction in the economic performance of the operation 43 fouling can be classified as reversible and irreversible and knowledge of the fouling of the membrane will enable us to avoid it and determine the best conditions for cleaning and disinfecting the facility 44 therefore an autopsy was performed on the membrane used in the experiments the procedure employed was as follows analysis of the decrease in the permeate stream external and internal inspection of the membrane unit assessment of the membrane assessment of the deposits chemical analysis of the deposits and other analyses such as sem and eds the permeate stream presented a stable flow rate during the 72 h that the experiment lasted as to the external inspection it was verified that the physical integrity of the membrane had not suffered any variation similarly the permeate collector tube and the inlet ring were in good condition there was no telescoping effect or dirt on the membrane inlet or outlet after verifying that the membrane did not undergo any process of external degeneration the internal inspection was then carried out the membrane was accordingly cut and its layers unwound a small layer of fouling was lodged homogeneously in between the layers and in the spacer samples of the fouling and the membrane were taken and analysed under a scanning electron microscope sem and an elemental analysis was performed using energy dispersive spectrometry eds this latter technique allows us to determine the type of pollution that occurs in the membrane biological particles colloidal matter inorganic incrustation organic fouling and metals 45 the sample had to be pre treated with gold the moisture content and organic matter content of the fouling was analysed and an ion analysis was carried out with the following results moisture content of the sample loss at 105 c the sample presented a moisture content of 25 4 mg l 1 after being subjected to 105 c for 24 h organic matter content loss at 450 c after heating the sample to 450 c a loss of 24 7 mg l 1 of organic matter was detected cations ammonium potassium and calcium the observed values were 2 84 2 71 and 64 94 mg l 1 respectively anions chloride nitrites nitrates and phosphates were detected in the fouling at values of 94 59 0 33 89 26 and 10 13 mg l 1 respectively this demonstrates the capacity of the membrane to remove these pollutants which are retained in the fouling clusters of matter resulting from salt incrustations and several types of diatoms were observed under the microscope fig 5 eds showed that the priority compounds found in the fouling were organic matter oxygen carbon and nitrogen as well as sodium magnesium silica phosphorus and sulphur salts metals such as aluminium and gold were also detected the latter due to the gold metallization of the sample prior to analysis figure 38 it can therefore be concluded that different types of fouling are produced during the process as a result of the composition of the wastewater although of all of them biological fouling is the one that contributes the most due to the composition of the wastewater fig 6 the presence of the compounds found in the autopsy showed the correct functioning of this technology for the elimination of emerging contaminants in wastewater this means that the water can be reused without generating a risk derived from these contaminants 4 conclusions despite the large number of studies demonstrating the environmental risks and impacts emerging pollutants can have on ecosystems and living beings including their effects on human health they continue to be ignored by legislation if we also take into account that these contaminants are not being removed by the conventional treatments used in the plant it makes it essential to use more efficient technologies for their treatment overcoat if the objective is the reuse of these waste waters the removal of emerging contaminants such as caffeine theobromine theophylline amoxicillin and penicillin g have been studied in wwtp wastewater using bw30 2540 reverse osmosis membranes which have proven effective as a tertiary treatment this technique achieved 100 removal of the contaminants without signs of membrane deterioration in the 72 h the tests lasted likewise the other issues of current concern namely the scarcity of water is addressed in the study via the reclamation and reuse of the treated wastewater the bw30 2540 membrane producing water of sufficient quality for its reuse these uses include residential or urban irrigation e g irrigation of areas or street cleaning agricultural e g irrigation aquaculture industrial e g cooling towers process and cleaning water recreational e g golf courses and environmental e g recharge aquifers uses we can thus ensure that the water has an optimum quality for its reuse without the risks posed by these emerging contaminants both in receiving waters and water for human consumption acknowledgments we

14423,in this study working of hybrid anaerobic aerobic biological treatment technology for real textile wastewater was investigated on the basis of system evaluation and optimization in two phases in phase i system was optimized at laboratory scale on synthetic textile wastewater and later real textile wastewater was treated in phase ii the study was conducted for 242 days in which industrial discharge coming from textile mill was collected and subjected to laboratory scale hybrid treatment activated sludge used in the process was obtained from full scale membrane bioreactor mbr plant and adapted to the synthetic and real textile wastewater using anaerobic process individual application of anaerobic treatment was found to be insufficient for the removal of cod tkn and dyes the proposed combine hybrid anaerobic aerobic system was found to be effective in reporting removal efficiencies of 99 5 cod 99 3 tkn and 78 4 dyes the anaerobic sbr added value to the hybrid system as it played a key role in improving treatment efficiency in addition to the production of sustainable energy source of biogas study shows that aerobic treatment is required to increase the treatment level by providing the final polishing to anaerobically treated effluent in order to reclaim water the optimum hrt for hybrid anaerobic aerobic system in treating real textile wastewater was found to be 54 h

and considered as a significant contributor of the economy in the country a variety of technological operations are involved in textile mills including sizing desizing scouring bleaching mercerizing and dyeing the production of fundamentals involves natural and synthetic fibers like cotton yarn wool polyester and nylon which adds an excessive value to the country s gdp innumerable processes in textile industry involve consumption of excess amount of water which results in the generation of a large quantity of toxic wastewater and degradation of water resources 1 textile wastewater composition primarily includes high organic loads acids volatile organic compounds hydrocarbons alkalis dyes and other toxic chemicals allied to the category of persistent organic pollutants pops that are resistant to environmental degradability 2 the key concern of textile wastewater is its treatment before its discharge as it involves colored compounds which are responsible for the lethal pollution in the environment 3 4 these colored compounds are categorized into several types on the basis of their complex structures chromophore is the part of dye molecule which predominantly imparts color to wastewater like azo dye nn anthraquinone dye co and phthalocyanine dye c32h18n8 among various categories of dyes reactive are most commonly used dyes in cotton industries which add high color ph and organic load to the wastewater 5 pakistan is one of the largest producer of cotton consisting 521 operational cotton spinning units therefore pakistan s textile wastewater is composed of reactive dyes in high proportion 6 direct discharge of textile wastewater to water bodies demand viable biological treatment technology adaptation by textile sector in order to meet the stringent national environmental quality standards neqs of pakistan environmental protection agency pak epa for textile industrial wastewater treatment due to high organic loading rate in addition to the presence of toxic dyes different approaches of treatment have been investigated in the past 7 in recent years textile wastewater treatment has been the subject of studies and frequently investigated as its discharge consists of environmentally detrimental toxic compounds which is difficult to treat using conventional treatment technologies 8 a lot of research has been performed on synthetic industrial wastewater treatment but the treatment of real textile wastewater has been challenging due to its complex composition and variation different technologies have been reported for textile

to the treatment 12 conventional anaerobic technologies like anaerobic sbr can play an important role in bacterial degradation of organic compounds and decolorization of dyes the decolorization rate

alternative as compared to conventional activated sludge systems for the treatment of wastewaters containing persistent toxic compounds farooqi and basheer 13 concluded from his sbr based study that if aerobic sludge in sbr provided with proper aeration can improve the process of development of aerobic microorganisms which further enhances the sludge acclimatization previous studies have exploited sbrs as more flexible approach as their operating conditions can be adjusted depending upon the biological reaction environment 14 combination of wastewater treatment technologies can

system comprising a combination of conventional anaerobic sbr and aerobic sbr at laboratory scale the study aims at suitability and significance of an adaptation protocol of hybrid anaerobic sbr aerobic sbr system optimized under variable hrts composite samples were collected from a local textile industry to conduct this study for duration of 242 days the vision of this study was set to accomplish production of biogas from anaerobic sbr as viable energy source and conservation of water by closing the water cycle loop within the industries 2 materials and methods 2 1 influent wastewater experimental study comprised of textile wastewater treatment through hybrid biological treatment technology consisting of anaerobic sbr followed by aerobic sbr each having volume of 6 5 l

chlorides color and conductivity for phase ii composite samples of raw textile wastewater were obtained from a pakistani textile industry this textile mill runs fabric operations majorly comprises processing of both cotton and synthetic fibers the samples were collected after primary clarification using composite sampling method and were stored at 4 c until tested in the laboratory scale setup industrial wastewater characteristically consists of compounds that results from textile operations in fabric production which includes processes like weaving bleaching and dyeing before starting the experimental study of phase ii preliminary characterization of raw textile wastewater of similar parameters analyzed in phase i was performed using standard methods 16 table 1 shows the real wastewater characteristics and recipe of synthetic wastewater of strength 3000 mg cod l the ph of the wastewater during system operation was maintained between range of 6 8 7 2 throughout the study which is reported effective and favorable for microbial growth rate involved in anaerobic digestion 17 for performing real textile wastewater treatment sampling from textile industry was performed on weekly basis depending upon the working volume of the reactor installed at water and wastewater laboratory of the institute of environmental sciences and engineering iese nust campus islamabad after minimum 24 h clarification in the feed tank the real wastewater was fed to the anaerobic sbr the experimental study was conducted over duration of 242 days water quality analyses for both anaerobic sbr and aerobic sbr were undertaken throughout the study 2 2 experimental setup and procedure operating conditions of the installed laboratory setup anaerobic sbr coupled with aerobic sbr are depicted in table 2 working volume of each reactor was designed to be of 6 l containing one third of sludge volume for dynamic microbial activity mlss mlvss ratio in each reactor was maintained from 0 6 to 0 7 throughout the study on system startup acclimatized sludge of 120 days was added into the anaerobic sbr raw textile wastewater was introduced into the anaerobic reactor by gravity flow provided with solenoid valve and timer mechanical mixer was provided for mixing of acclimatized sludge with influent wastewater the mesophilic temperature of 30 35 c at rotational speed of 180 270 rpm was maintained throughout the study anaerobic process requires longer start up time due to slow growth of bacterial species mainly methanogenic and syntrophic therefore the adaption period to the microbes was provided before the steady experimental phase similarly reported in literature 18 the preliminary anaerobic study prior to phase i was conducted for duration of 120 days in order to acclimatize activated sludge to anaerobic conditions for sbr operation while acclimatization of aerobic sludge was achieved easily by providing proper aeration and food over a period of 20 days for sbr operation during acclimatization phase sludge was fed with synthetic wastewater and provided with proper mixing conditions the biogas production was considered as an indicator for completion of acclimatization phase similarly real wastewater application to batch study was also performed to allow the microbial adaptation prior to use in phase ii study the schematic of hybrid anaerobic sbr aerobic sbr is shown in fig 1 the hydraulic retention time in anaerobic sbr was set to be of 12 18 24 42 and 48 h to evaluate the performance capability of anaerobic process treating synthetic textile wastewater after providing anaerobic treatment in sbr at variable hrts permeate was streamed to aerobic sbr where treatment efficiency of aerobic process was evaluated by setting reactor hrt to 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 h for maintaining dissolved oxygen air supply was provided in the form of coarse bubbling at a rate of 8 l min by air compressor model hailea aco 208 fig 1 depicts the two stage process where firstly wastewater was treated anaerobically and then polished in aerobic sbr for enhanced treatment 2 3 parameter analyses the analyses protocols involved the extent of following parameters color color removal rate for both types of wastewater synthetic and real was performed by spectrophotometric single wavelength method 212 c samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min supernatant was separated from the pellet and then subjected into the uv spectrophotometer for further analysis chemical oxygen demand cod cod analysis was carried out in accordance with standard method of closed reflux titrimetric method 522 c which involved digestion followed by titration of wastewater samples total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrogen tests were carried out using standard macro kjeldahl method to calculate the total nitrogen production in both anaerobic aerobic reactors 4500 norg b throughout the study experimental analysis was carried out at adjusted ph which was maintained and checked by electrometric method 4500h b biogas measurement was performed using water displacement method 3 results and discussion 3 1 sludge acclimatization fig 2 shows the results of anaerobic sludge acclimatization to synthetic and real textile wastewater during the initial batch runs biogas production was found to be low as hydrolysis of wastewater organics into biogas is a slow process because of the activity of slow growing methanogens responsible for biogas production the adaptation ability improved with time till complete acclimatized conditions were observed 19 anaerobic systems with appropriate hydrodynamic batch conditions i e hrt and cod concentration resulting from sludge acclimatization adds a key value to the methanogenesis activity enhancing optimal biogas production 20 sbr systems due to the requirement of less space aeration plays a key role in desirable sludge acclimatization which further results into an achievement of desired effluent standards 13 during the first phase of study the biogas production was observed to be less due to frequent change in environment of the activated sludge from aerobic to anaerobic conditions in anaerobic digestion biogas production is slow at startup because during the organic to biogas conversion phenomenon the organic degradation undergoes hydrolysis acidogenesis prior to methanogenesis 21 observed results satisfy previous studies on anaerobic systems that the color and cod removal rate was found to be low at initial stage due to the slow microbial activity under low ph conditions 22 the biogas production reported in terms of liters of biogas per liter volume of reactor per day is consistent with similar studies reported earlier 23 24 fig 2 reveals an increase in the biogas production in phase ii due to the stability of sludge acclimatization already achieved in phase i biogas production was found to increase from 2 41 0 42 l l d to 3 51 0 30 l l d as wastewater strength was shifted from synthetic to real textile wastewater el mashad et al 25 previously reported that the driving parameter in sludge acclimatization for biogas production was temperature which was maintained between 30 40 c as compared to 32 35 c maintained in this study 3 2 treatment performance of the hybrid biological system 3 2 1 chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency the cod profile during whole experimental study in treating synthetic and real textile wastewater in two phases of hybrid system is shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows the cod removal profile at different hrts in anaerobic sbr system due to the action of methanogenic and syntrophic anaerobic microbial species cod removal increased with an increase in hrt in anaerobic process at 24 h of hrt cod percent removal was 69 9 fig 3a for real textile wastewater and 63 2 for synthetic wastewater however at 48 h of hrt the maximum organic degradation of 80 80 and 86 87 for synthetic and real textile wastewater respectively was observed also the total cod removal efficiency of hybrid anaerobic aerobic system at variable hrts treating synthetic and real textile wastewater is shown in fig 3b punzi et al 26 reported an average 70 cod removal by studying combined technology of anaerobic ozonation at hrt of 120 h whereas in this study the cod removal of synthetic wastewater in phase ii was found to be comparatively higher due to the acclimatized sludge used from phase i the efficiency of anaerobically pretreated wastewater was increased by provision of final polishing treatment using conventional aerobic sbr aerobic treatment operating at variable hrts followed by anaerobic pretreatment was to achieve high quality permeate integration of conventional biological techniques is a smart approach in increasing treatment efficiency by reducing operational cost and footprint in comparison to individual conventional plant configurations 27 it is clearly observed from the results that the treatment in both phases by providing combined anaerobic aerobic treatment increases the system efficiency up to 98 0 and 99 5 for synthetic and real wastewater respectively therefore the optimum hrt for hybrid anaerobic aerobic system in treating real textile wastewater is inferred to be 54 h for maximum cod removal efficiency previous studies reported that the combined treatment systems may lead to operating cost reduction along with the increased cod removal efficiency 28 29 the optimal results were achieved at organic loading rate olr of 1 5 kg m3 d i e at codi i initial of 3000 mg l anaerobic hrt of 48 h 3 2 2 decolorization of dyes the function of anaerobic microbial species varies when exposed to different levels of color pollutants which allow their adaptability to the degradation of toxic pollutants 9 anaerobic biological activity plays a key role while treating complex colored compounds 22 the results for decolorization of textile wastewater are shown in fig 4 which describes the applicability of the hybrid system in treating colored wastewater during the hybrid system operation the anaerobic phase is the main contributor regarding color removal efficiency 3 2 3 effect of anaerobic treatment on dye decolorization in hybrid type reactors the advantage of anaerobic sbr is to maximize the decolorization efficiency in addition to the cod removal lowering the cost of aeration in subsequent aerobic sbr zhang et al 20 determined from his experimental approach that anaerobic systems among all the conventional biological systems imparts the maximum degradation of complex color compounds in industrial wastewater effectively and energy economically the presence of non biodegradable complex compounds present in textile wastewater impart color to the wastewater which can be treated anaerobically by slow degradation 30 fig 4 depicts color removal efficiency increased with an increase in hrt by anaerobic microbial activity in phase i decolorization efficiency of 43 08 was observed while in phase ii this percentage increased up to 78 40 due to the improved sludge acclimatization similarly talarposhti et al 31 reported that by increasing the mixing frequency of anaerobic sludge with wastewater in anaerobic digestion the potential of available biological surface area for contact and absorption with dyes increases therefore it can be inferred that continuous mixing in anaerobic sbr aids the dye removal efficiency under enhanced sludge acclimatized conditions as observed in present study 3 2 4 color removal prudence in aerobic phase decolorization efficiency remained unchanged in aerobic sbr due to the complex degradable byproducts formed previously in the process as shown in fig 4 it has been reported that anaerobic dye reduction metabolites usually undergo a mechanism of partial mineralization when permeate from anaerobic treatment is subjected to aerobic treatment 32 the reason for this behavior of aerobic sbr is because the byproducts released from anaerobic dye degradation like aromatic amines are aerobically non biodegradable and consequently color removal efficiency cannot improve notably and similar finding was also reported earlier 33 3 2 5 effect of mixed liquor properties on treatment performance mixed liquor suspended solids mlss is a major parameter that regulates the treatment performance of hybrid anaerobic aerobic system sathian et al 34 concluded that in sbr systems treating dyeing industrial wastewater the mlss cannot be washed out easily by hydraulic surges and can be maintained during the initial cycles the high ph of real wastewater affected the f m ratio in the hybrid system and consequently the organic removal rate figs 5 and 6 shows that the mlss concentration from 6000 to 8000 mg l was maintained by adjusting the wastewater ph between 6 8 and 7 2 in order to improve cod and color removal efficiencies the sudden change of mlss concentration from phase i to phase ii was due to the alkaline ph of real textile wastewater which disturbed the f m ratio of anaerobic sbr as shown in fig 5 the sludge acclimatized in phase i also experienced disturbance in phase ii due to the complex composition of real textile wastewater resulting in the fluctuation of mlss and f m ratio in anaerobic sbr for organic removal of industrial wastewater 7000 mg l of mlss in biological tank is reported to be ideal for organic removal 35 additionally the volatile fatty acids vfa to alkalinity ratio and total nitrogen removal tkn were also investigated as discussed below integrated anaerobic aerobic biological systems are viable alternative hybrid systems for treating complex natured real textile wastewater 27 a study on combined biological and chemical system treating industrial wastewater was conducted which resulted in 86 6 cod efficiency under 5 days of hrt 34 the novelty of this hybrid biological study is the treatment of textile wastewater at lower hrt resulting in higher efficiency removal rate hrt 54 h combined increasing the concentration beyond 8000 mg l restricts the growth of microorganisms by decreasing f m ratio it is also proved in literature that mlss impacts directly the removal efficiency of wastewater 36 the complexity in combined treatment systems is to maintain the mlss concentrations in both reactors which is performed in this study 3 2 6 vfa alkalinity ratio fig 6 shows the trend of vfa alkalinity ratio in anaerobic sbr at initial stages the application of real textile wastewater of alkaline nature disturbed the reactor stability by lowering the vfa alkalinity ratio the ideal condition for anaerobic microorganisms is to maintain vfa alkalinity of 0 3 0 4 which takes time with sludge acclimatization 37 during the anaerobic treatment the sludge was completely acclimatized to synthetic wastewater at ph 6 8 7 2 during phase i when the real textile wastewater was applied to the optimized system in phase ii the vfa alkalinity ratio dropped because of its high ph of 9 5 which was adjusted to 7 1 by adding acid solution of hcl the adjusted ph increased the action of facultative bacterial population as shown in fig 6 the function of facultative anaerobic bacterial species involves the conversion of carbon sources to volatile fatty acids vfa in the complete absence of oxygen 37 for ph adjustment an option of chemical addition i e hydrochloric acid sodium bicarbonate is a possible solution however from economical perspective at industrial scale better acclimatized sludge can eliminate the chemical addition in this study after acclimatization period of 32 days with acid addition for ph adjustment self regulation of ph was observed is also shown in fig 6 this outcome satisfies the previously reported study where the acclimatized bacterial consortium adapted to the ph of 6 8 7 2 and did not require any ph neutralization prior to its application for treatment 38 razaviarani and buchanan 39 reported that vfa alkalinity ratio for anaerobic operation was found to be fairly below the critical value of 0 4 whereas vfa alkalinity ratio was within the range of 0 3 to 0 4 throughout this study as this range was found to be ideal for ph self regulation in anaerobic system it was further observed that the anaerobic decolorization and cod removal was not affected by the chemical adjustment because of better acclimatized sludge 3 2 7 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn table 3 shows tkn removal in anaerobic reactor was low and the provision of subsequent aerobic treatment increased the tkn removal rate punzi et al 26 reported that due to the release of amino groups from dye molecules in colored wastewater the anaerobic nitrogen removal efficiency declines similar results were also observed in present study that raised the demand of aerobic post treatment provision to maximize nitrogen removal efficiency an average removal rate of tkn in hybrid system treating real textile wastewater was observed to be 95 6 this is because of the assimilation of influent ammonia nitrogen and organic nitrogen removal of tkn tkn is a major reflecting parameter in modeling and upscaling the integrated technologies in treating wastewater 40 the maximum tkn removal was found in aerobic reactor at 6 h hrt along with the maximum removal rates of cod previous studies have also reported that microbial population involved in aerobic sludge demands certain amount of nitrogen as a nutrient source for the biomass growth 41 therefore tkn removal plays an important role in improving the treatment efficiency of hybrid anaerobic aerobic treatment system 3 2 8 effluent characteristics the influent and effluent concentrations neqs limits and removal efficiencies by hybrid anaerobic sbr aerobic sbr treatment in both phases of experimental study are reported in table 4 3 2 9 industrial implication of anaerobic aerobic system the overall efficiency trends of hybrid anaerobic sbr aerobic sbr system treating real textile wastewater is shown in fig 7 a 92 linearity of data for removal efficiencies can be predicted from the derived equations fig 7a determines the linear equation y 0 619x 47 732 of r2 0 9285 exhibiting the applicability of anaerobic treatment for industrial wastewater of 3000 mg cod l the applicability of aerobic system for polishing action is shown in fig 7b by linear equation y 2 4566x 83 085 of r2 0 921 in a hybrid system therefore with the help of these model equations industries can find out their wastewater removal efficiencies at designed hrts of hybrid system 4 conclusions a hybrid biological system constituting anaerobic sbr and aerobic sbr for treating real textile wastewater was found to be a feasible treatment technology the production of biogas of 3 51 0 30 l l d provides the value addition to the hybrid technology satisfactory effluent meeting neqs were obtained with high removal efficiencies of cod 99 5 tkn 99 3 and color 78 4 acclimatized sludge was found to have a positive impact in improving system treatment efficiency and biogas production as compared to running anaerobic and aerobic system individually maximum removal efficiencies were effectively obtained from the hybrid system therefore for sustainability adaptation of the hybrid anaerobic aerobic system is recommended for textile industrial wastewater treatment acknowledgments authors are thankful and would like to

phase i system was optimized at laboratory scale on synthetic textile wastewater and later real textile wastewater was treated in phase ii the study was conducted for 242 days in which industrial discharge coming from textile mill was collected and subjected to laboratory scale hybrid treatment activated sludge used in the process was obtained from full scale membrane bioreactor mbr plant and adapted to the synthetic and real textile wastewater using anaerobic process individual application of anaerobic treatment was found to be insufficient for the removal of cod tkn and dyes the proposed combine hybrid anaerobic aerobic system was found to be effective in reporting removal efficiencies of 99 5 cod 99 3 tkn and 78 4 dyes the anaerobic sbr added value to the hybrid system as it played a key role in improving treatment efficiency in addition to the production of sustainable energy source of biogas study shows that aerobic treatment is required to increase the treatment level by providing the final polishing to anaerobically treated effluent in order to reclaim water the optimum hrt for hybrid anaerobic aerobic system in treating real textile wastewater was found to be 54 h

and considered as a significant contributor of the economy in the country a variety of technological operations are involved in textile mills including sizing desizing scouring bleaching mercerizing and dyeing the production of fundamentals involves natural and synthetic fibers like cotton yarn wool polyester and nylon which adds an excessive value to the country s gdp innumerable processes in textile industry involve consumption of excess amount of water which results in the generation of a large quantity of toxic wastewater and degradation of water resources 1 textile wastewater composition primarily includes high organic loads acids volatile organic compounds hydrocarbons alkalis dyes and other toxic chemicals allied to the category of persistent organic pollutants pops that are resistant to environmental degradability 2 the key concern of textile wastewater is its treatment before its discharge as it involves colored compounds which are responsible for the lethal pollution in the environment 3 4 these colored compounds are categorized into several types on the basis of their complex structures chromophore is the part of dye molecule which predominantly imparts color to wastewater like azo dye nn anthraquinone dye co and phthalocyanine dye c32h18n8 among various categories of dyes reactive are most commonly used dyes in cotton industries which add high color ph and organic load to the wastewater 5 pakistan is one of the largest producer of cotton consisting 521 operational cotton spinning units therefore pakistan s textile wastewater is composed of reactive dyes in high proportion 6 direct discharge of textile wastewater to water bodies demand viable biological treatment technology adaptation by textile sector in order to meet the stringent national environmental quality standards neqs of pakistan environmental protection agency pak epa for textile industrial wastewater treatment due to high organic loading rate in addition to the presence of toxic dyes different approaches of treatment have been investigated in the past 7 in recent years textile wastewater treatment has been the subject of studies and frequently investigated as its discharge consists of environmentally detrimental toxic compounds which is difficult to treat using conventional treatment technologies 8 a lot of research has been performed on synthetic industrial wastewater treatment but the treatment of real textile wastewater has been challenging due to its complex composition and variation different technologies have been reported for textile wastewater treatment which includes physio chemical treatment processes and activated carbon adsorption processes having a limitation of handling large amount of sludge generation and incomplete

remained unchanged in aerobic sbr due to the complex degradable byproducts formed previously in the process as shown in fig 4 it has been reported that anaerobic dye reduction metabolites usually undergo a mechanism of partial mineralization when permeate from anaerobic treatment is subjected to aerobic treatment 32 the reason for this behavior of aerobic sbr is because the byproducts released from anaerobic dye degradation like aromatic amines are aerobically non biodegradable and consequently color removal efficiency cannot improve notably and similar finding was also reported earlier 33 3 2 5 effect of mixed liquor properties on treatment performance mixed liquor suspended solids mlss is a major parameter that regulates the treatment performance of hybrid anaerobic aerobic system sathian et al 34 concluded that in sbr systems treating dyeing industrial wastewater the mlss cannot be washed out easily by hydraulic surges and can be maintained during the initial cycles the high ph of real wastewater affected the f m ratio in the hybrid system and consequently the organic removal rate figs 5 and 6 shows that the mlss concentration from 6000 to 8000 mg l was maintained by adjusting the wastewater ph between 6 8 and 7 2 in order to improve cod and color removal efficiencies the sudden change of mlss concentration from phase i to phase ii was due to the alkaline ph of real textile wastewater which disturbed the f m ratio of anaerobic sbr as shown in fig 5 the sludge acclimatized in phase i also experienced disturbance in phase ii due to the complex composition of real textile wastewater resulting in the fluctuation of mlss and f m ratio in anaerobic sbr for organic removal of industrial wastewater 7000 mg l of mlss in biological tank is reported to be ideal for organic removal 35 additionally the volatile fatty acids vfa to alkalinity ratio and total nitrogen removal tkn were also investigated as discussed below integrated anaerobic aerobic biological systems are viable alternative hybrid systems for treating complex natured real textile wastewater 27 a study on combined biological and chemical system treating industrial wastewater was conducted which resulted in 86 6 cod efficiency under 5 days of hrt 34 the novelty of this hybrid biological study is the treatment of textile wastewater at lower hrt resulting in higher efficiency removal rate hrt 54 h combined increasing the concentration beyond 8000 mg l restricts the growth of microorganisms by decreasing f m ratio it is also proved in literature that mlss impacts directly the removal efficiency of wastewater 36 the complexity in combined treatment systems is to maintain the mlss concentrations in both reactors which is performed in this study 3 2 6 vfa alkalinity ratio fig 6 shows the trend of vfa alkalinity ratio in anaerobic sbr at initial stages the application of real textile wastewater of alkaline nature disturbed the reactor stability by lowering the vfa alkalinity ratio the ideal condition for anaerobic microorganisms is to maintain vfa alkalinity of 0 3 0 4 which takes time with sludge acclimatization 37 during the anaerobic treatment the sludge was completely acclimatized to synthetic wastewater at ph 6 8 7 2 during phase i when the real textile wastewater was applied to the optimized system in phase ii the vfa alkalinity ratio dropped because of its high ph of 9 5 which was adjusted to 7 1 by adding acid solution of hcl the adjusted ph increased the action of facultative bacterial population as shown in fig 6 the function of facultative anaerobic bacterial species involves the conversion of carbon sources to volatile fatty acids vfa in the complete absence of oxygen 37 for ph adjustment an option of chemical addition i e hydrochloric acid sodium bicarbonate is a possible solution however from economical perspective at industrial scale better acclimatized sludge can eliminate the chemical addition in this study after acclimatization period of 32 days with acid addition for ph adjustment self regulation of ph was observed is also shown in fig 6 this outcome satisfies the previously reported study where the acclimatized bacterial consortium adapted to the ph of 6 8 7 2 and did not require any ph neutralization prior to its application for treatment 38 razaviarani and buchanan 39 reported that vfa alkalinity ratio for anaerobic operation was found to be fairly below the critical value of 0 4 whereas vfa alkalinity ratio was within the range of 0 3 to 0 4 throughout this study as this range was found to be ideal for ph self regulation in anaerobic system it was further observed that the anaerobic decolorization and cod removal was not affected by the chemical adjustment because of better acclimatized sludge 3 2 7 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn table 3 shows tkn removal in anaerobic reactor was low and the provision of subsequent aerobic treatment increased the tkn removal rate punzi et al 26 reported that due to the release of amino groups from dye molecules in colored wastewater the anaerobic nitrogen removal efficiency declines similar results were also observed in present study that raised the demand of aerobic post treatment provision to maximize nitrogen removal efficiency an average removal rate of tkn in hybrid system treating real textile wastewater was observed to be 95 6 this is because of the assimilation of influent ammonia nitrogen and organic nitrogen removal of tkn tkn is a major reflecting parameter in modeling and upscaling the integrated technologies in treating wastewater 40 the maximum tkn removal was found in aerobic reactor at 6 h hrt along with the maximum removal rates of cod previous studies have also reported that microbial population involved in aerobic sludge demands certain amount of nitrogen as a nutrient source for the biomass growth 41 therefore tkn removal plays an important role in improving the treatment efficiency of hybrid anaerobic aerobic treatment system 3 2 8 effluent characteristics the influent and effluent concentrations neqs limits and removal efficiencies by hybrid anaerobic sbr aerobic sbr treatment in both phases of experimental study are reported in table 4 3 2 9 industrial implication of anaerobic aerobic system the overall efficiency trends of hybrid anaerobic sbr aerobic sbr system treating real textile wastewater is shown in fig 7 a 92 linearity of data for removal efficiencies can be predicted from the derived equations fig 7a determines the linear equation y 0 619x 47 732 of r2 0 9285 exhibiting the applicability of anaerobic treatment for industrial wastewater of 3000 mg cod l the applicability of aerobic system for polishing action is shown in fig 7b by linear equation y 2 4566x 83 085 of r2 0 921 in a hybrid system therefore with the help of these model equations industries can find out their wastewater removal efficiencies at designed hrts of hybrid system 4 conclusions a hybrid biological system constituting anaerobic sbr and aerobic sbr for treating real textile wastewater was found to be a feasible treatment technology the production of biogas of 3 51 0 30 l l d provides the value addition to the hybrid technology satisfactory effluent meeting neqs were obtained with high removal efficiencies of cod 99 5 tkn 99 3 and color 78 4 acclimatized sludge was found to have a positive impact in improving system treatment efficiency and biogas production as compared to running anaerobic and aerobic system individually maximum removal efficiencies were effectively obtained from the hybrid system therefore for sustainability adaptation of the hybrid anaerobic aerobic system is recommended for textile industrial wastewater treatment acknowledgments authors are thankful and would like to

14424,brine generated from membrane filtration processes is becoming an important concern indeed untreated or improperly managed concentrate can lead to serious negative effects in the environment as some other flow configurations of ro systems concentrate recirculation allows to reduce the brine generation in this study a high system water recovery and concentrate retention was achieved with the additional advantage of a reduced membrane water recovery which minimizes the fouling effects of the increasing concentration of the solution being passed through the membrane solute rejections and permeate quality were not significantly affected by the different concentrate retention ratios and by the increasing salinity concentration of the solution in the feed tank during three hours of experiments however highly concentrated feed water can damage membranes and reduce its performances hence with this configuration the process have to be interrupted when the salt concentration in the

with available fresh water sources 1 the main reason for the water scarcity is increasing demand caused by the population growth bad management of available water resources and industrialization 2 wastewater reclamation is not only an appropriate solution to overcome this problem but also it is needed to meet the more restrictive discharge limits 3 industrial wastewaters are mostly treated by conventional activated sludge cas process or mbr membrane bioreactor systems mbr systems integrate membrane filtration and bioreactor processes which make mbr act as both biological treatment unit and filtration system 4 main advantages of mbr process over cas are obtaining a high quality effluent high removal of organic contaminants high retention of suspended solids less sludge generation smaller footprint 5 6 the main disadvantages about this process are higher operating cost than cas process and the requirement of maintenance 7 secondary effluents of industrial wastewaters generally include high amounts of salinity nutrients as nitrate and phosphorus heavy metals hardness etc which in most cases do not fit with discharge and reuse limits although mbr process can be applied for the production of low and or medium quality water it is also used as a good pre treatment step before nf or ro processes 8 with their advantages of ability to work without any phase change or chemical addition membrane filtration processes are frequently used in wastewater treatment processes when compared with thermal processes they consume less energy and operate easily 9 membrane processes especially reverse osmosis ro are the leading technologies in desalination plants 10 the ro process is widely adopted for secondary effluent treatment to obtain a high quality product water 11 this technology is applied in a wide range of industrial fields such as chemical medical textile petrochemical electrochemical biotechnology agriculture and environmental fields 12 13 ro process can remove more than 90 of monovalent and 95 of divalent ions from water which results in a high salinity reduction it also removes nutrients efficiently from treated wastewater effluents fouling is one of the biggest issues for membrane filtration processes most of the foulants in water deposit on membranes and decrease the yield of the process those foulants are removed from membrane surface by different physical chemical or biological methods 14 the most important disadvantage of membrane cleaning is its high cost which is generally between 5 and 20 of the total operating cost 15 yet another problematic issue about membrane filtration is the concentrate stream or brine generated from the filtration processes indeed untreated and or improperly managed concentrate stream can lead to serious negative effects on local environment much more than in the case of secondary effluent 16 in the literature there are some reports of serious impact caused by ro brine on sea environment 17 the disposal of seawater ro concentrate stream to ocean is possible after positive results of analysis including hydrodynamic modeling of the discharge whole effluent toxicity salinity tolerance analysis of the marine species etc 18 another popular way to eliminate ro concentrate is leaving it to natural evaporation by creating a solid waste 19 the major problems with this process are the long time required and large area that cannot be feasible for evaporating large volume of concentrate stream 20 it is also possible to both reduce concentrate discharge and recover valuable compounds 21 yet this require extra steps such as bipolar membrane electrodialysis or electrochlorination 22 although it is an advantage that these processes can produce acid base or chlorine scaling up is still challenging also concentrate discharge costs are creating 5 33 of total desalination costs depending on concentrate volume quality and required treatment before disposal 23 therefore it is an important issue to reduce the amount of concentrate before further treatments several flow configurations of ro systems allow to reduce the concentrate generation some of these configurations include membrane modules connected in series with or without interstage pump and permeate throttling pyramid design and concentrate recirculation as shown in fig 1 concentrate recirculation can reduce significantly the amount of concentrate generated in membrane processes reducing discharge costs furthermore in comparison with continuous systems it presents more flexibility to the feed water quality easy cleaning easy control of permeate quality by termination of the process and lower investment costs 24 however such a system configuration does not allow a continuous operation resulting in uncontinuous permeate flow and quality increased membrane fouling longer residence time for feed and concentrate and so higher total operation cost furthermore the higher concentration in the feed requires larger pump power and energy consumption 24 kappel et al found out that nanofiltration nf concentrate recirculation in a hybrid system consisting of mbr nf for wastewater treatment is feasible and the nf permeate quality is not impacted by the recirculation 25 in this study mbr treated industrial wastewater was further processed by bw30 a brackish water ro membrane in concentrate recirculation configuration at the end membrane and system performances were assessed including product water quality and the concentrate retention ratio 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater effluent characterization feed solution is the secondary effluent of the mbr wastewater treatment plant at an industrial organized zone itob osb located in menderes izmir turkey after pre filtration steps the wastewater is sent to mbr system as a secondary treatment the characteristic properties of mbr treated industrial effluent often change due the different composition and volume of the wastewater produced by different factories the properties of the mbr effluent for each experiment are shown in table 1 2 2 system configuration and experimental design experiments were conducted in the wastewater treatment plant area at itob organized industry zone itob osb in menderes izmir turkey the tests were performed in a small scale pilot plant including six membranes 3 nf and 3 ro membranes however single membrane tests were conducted by using bw30 ro 2540 membrane supplied by dow chem the bw30 ro 2540 membrane has a 2 6 m2 of active membrane area and can be used up to 40 bar of pressure and 45 c of temperature experiments were performed in concentrate recirculation mode in this configuration a portion of the concentrate stream was sent back again to the feed tank to reduce the discharged concentrate amount while the rest of the concentrate was discharged to evaporation tank such configuration of the system was shown in fig 2 where m is the fresh mbr effluent inlet p is the permeate stream c is the total concentrate produced which is divided into two streams ct is recirculated to the feed tank and cd is discharged the mbr treated wastewater of itob osb was first passed through two 10 μm cartridge filters after that effluent was collected in a 500 l volume of feed tank and a manual chemical dosage was applied the naocl solution akua pol 2150 1 ml of for each 100 l of feed was dosed for disinfection purpose anti scalant 1 2 ml for 400 l of feed was used to prevent precipitation of some hardness ions in wastewater on the surface of membrane then some amount of na2s2o5 0 5 g for 100 l of feed was added to eliminate the excess free chlorine in the solution after that the feed solution was fed to the sand filter with the help of a low pressure pump and then to a cartridge filter after all pre treatment steps the feed solution was supplied to the bw30 membrane with a high pressure pump model ws201 interpump group while a portion of concentrate was recycled to the system fresh mbr effluent was sent to the feed tank its flow rate was tried to be kept equal to the total flow rate of discharged concentrate and produced permeate in order to keep the level in the tank constant in the meantime the ratio of the flow rates of recirculating concentrate to the fresh mbr effluent entering to the feed tank was adjusted as 25 35 45 and 60 filtration experiments were conducted for three hours while permeate and feed samples were taken at each hour only one concentrate sample was taken at the end of experiment applied feed pressure was 20 bar for all experiments with bw30 membrane 2 3 analytical methods quality analysis of product water were performed by measuring some parameters such as total dissolved solid tds electrical conductivity ec salinity and temperature using hq14d model conductometer the ph of samples was monitored by hq14d model ph meter online bicarbonate concentration temporary hardness and magnesium calcium hardness permanent hardness were measured with titrimetric methods ion chromatography device shimadzu ic 10 ai model was used for analysis of chloride sulphate and nitrate ions total organic carbon toc measurements were made by a toc device shimadzu toc vcph model concentrations of sodium potassium calcium and magnesium ions were measured by atomic absorption spectrometer shimadzu aa 7000 silica sio2 chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn color total suspended solid tss were analyzed by a colorimeter dr 3900 benchtop vis model a micro tpi field model portable turbidimeter was used for turbidity measurements 2 4 membrane and system performances the performances of the membrane and the filtration system were evaluated by calculating different parameters considered parameters are defined as follows 2 4 1 water recovery wr the water recovery is the percentage ratio of permeate produced to feed water two different water recoveries were calculated for the system water recovery wrs the mbr effluent was taken into account as the feed of the system in case of the membrane water recovery wrm the feed stream to the membrane was considered the related equations are given below 1 wr s v p v m 100 2 wr m v p v f 100 where vp is the permeate flow rate vm is mbr effluent flow rate and vf is feed flow rate to the membrane 2 4 2 permeate flux j the volumetric permeate flux through the membrane is the volumetric flow rate of permeate vp passing through a unit active area of membrane am it describes the productivity of the membrane module this parameter was tried to keep constant at different experiments the unit of measure commonly used is l per m2 of membrane area per hour or lmh thus it s defined as 3 j v p a m 2 4 3 concentrate retention the concentrate retention cr is the ratio of recirculated concentrate to total concentrate and it is defined as follows 4 cr c t c where ct is the concentrate flow rate recirculated and c is the total concentrate flow rate 2 4 4 concentration ratio of the feed tank solution this parameter is defined as the ratio of the final value of a specific parameter in the feed tank to the initial value of this it was calculated as an indicator of the change of water quality in the tank throughout the experiments 5 c f i c f c i 100 where cf is the final parameter value and ci is the initial parameter value both in the feed tank 2 4 5 the solute rejection the apparent or observed solute rejection r is defined as 6 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp is the parameter value in the permeate stream and cf is the parameter value in the membrane feed stream instantaneous rejection is defined by using concentrations at determined times after the beginning of the experiment while average rejection was calculated from average compositions of permeate and feed streams during the entire experiment 2 4 6 standard deviation standard deviation is a parameter to quantify the variation of set of data while low standard deviation values show precision of different measurements high standard deviation values symbolize some most of the measurements are varied from the average 26 standard deviation for any measurement set is calculated by using eq 7 7 s d i 1 n x i x m n where n is the number of measurements xm is the mean average of measurements and xi symbolizes any measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane and system performances 3 1 1 volumetric flow rates and relative parameters the performance of the membrane and the system in the different filtration experiments were compared by calculating parameters defined in part 2 4 the results obtained are shown in table 2 permeate flux was kept almost constant values varied from 40 2 to 41 2 lmh in order to have similar productivity of the membrane module solute rejections depend on permeate flux thus it was necessary to keep the flux constant to observe the variation of the solute rejections solely by the effect of the concentrate amounts in the feed tank the effect of the temperature on solute rejections was neglected temperature average values varied from 19 5 to 28 0 c concentrate amount of the inlet flow to the feed tank is increased by closing concentrate discharge valve first partially then totally when the amount of concentrate discharged is reduced the concentrate retention is increased from 0 57 to 1 00 except the final concentrated feed solution in the tank the membrane water recovery decreased when the concentrate ratio in the inlet flow into the feed tank was increased from 35 to 60 due to the variation of the ratio of concentrate to permeate that was necessary to change to achieve the desired flow rates and the ratios between them c c m for example even though high water recoveries were achieved even 100 when c c m 0 6 which means zero concentrate discharge except the waste in the feed tank at the end of the experiment and increasing fouling properties of the feed solution were minimized by decreasing the membrane water recovery the concentration ratio of the final feed water to the initial one was increased from 137 9 to 173 6 when the concentrate ratio in the inlet flow into the feed tank increased from 25 to 60 such concentration ratios were calculated taken into consideration initial and final values of the conductivity as a concentration indicator of the solution in the feed tank shown in fig 3 this effect can be better shown by investigation of the values of different parameters in the feed solution table 3 shows the effect of increasing concentrate recirculation on the salinity of the feed solution because of the high concentration of the salinity in the feed tank experiments were stopped after three hours indeed the main disadvantage of the concentrate recirculation configuration is that the operation cannot be continuous but it has to be stopped when the feed solution concentration reached to a certain value which compromises the membrane performances and lifespan this system configuration reduces the waste discharge amount when the salt concentration in feed tank becomes high a further treatment is needed since it is impossible to discharge it into fresh water streams a possible way to treat this water is by natural evaporation 3 1 2 rejections and permeate quality average rejections for selected parameters for different experiments are shown in table 4 color cod magnesium sulphate and hardness values in the permeate samples were in some cases under detection limits thus rejections relative to those parameters were calculated by using their respective detection limits rejections calculated in this manner are referred to as minimum observed rejections denoted with symbol min and no instantaneous rejections were considered for these parameters most of average observed rejections were almost constant thus not affected by the different concentrations in the feed tank small differences in rejection values can be attributed to analytical errors especially in parameters whose values in water are close to the detection limits nh4 n tss color turbidity especially for permeate samples making rejections of these parameters depending on mostly feed concentrations average rejections of monovalent and divalent ions are greater than 95 and 97 respectively as expected from a brackish water ro membrane thus salinity was decreased from 2 0 2 5 to 0 04 0 10 see tables 1 and 5 rejections of the considered parameters were not affected significantly during the three hours of experiments in spite of the increasing concentrations in the feed tank however a high concentrated feed water can damage membranes and reduce its performances resulting in a low product water quality thus with this configuration the process has to be interrupted when the concentration in the feed tank reached a certain level maximum time that system can operate avoiding too much fouling on membrane surface has to be set by monitoring the membrane performances the average permeate compositions are shown in table 5 high hardness removal was achieved reaching final values on permeate flows of less than 17 8 mg l caco3 which was the lowest detection limit even when hardness in the initial feed solution varied from 352 to 502 mg l caco3 the average values of some parameters such as tss turbidity cod calcium magnesium sulfates toc phosphates hardness and ph were almost constant in the obtained permeate in spite of slightly or in some cases importantly some differences exist in the initial feed solution concentrations as mentioned for hardness other parameters such as color sodium potassium chloride the resulting conductivity and salinity and nitrogen content as nitrate nitrite and ammonium presented slightly higher values in the product water of the experiments with ratios of 25 and 35 of concentrates re circulated over total inlet in the feed tank such differences could be due to significant differences in the initial feed solution concentrations the low salinity hardness and other parameters make ro permeate useful for some purposes such as irrigation boiler feed water cooling water etc 27 however for each application many different parameters must be compared with respective guidelines 4 conclusions concentrate recirculation flow configuration permitted to reduce drastically the amount of generated brine in a ro filtration process a 100 of system water recovery and thus 1 00 of concentrate retention ratio were achieved with the additional advantage of a reduced membrane water recovery which minimizes the fouling effects of the increasing concentration of the solution being passed through the membrane in this case the conductivity in the feed tank was increased by 73 6 of the initial value most of the average observed rejections of selected parameters were almost constant thus not affected by the different concentrate recovery ratios rejections were also not affected by the increasing concentration of the concentrate stream in the feed tank during three hours of experiments the average product water quality was almost constant presenting negligible differences in average values of some parameters on the other hand highly concentrated feed water can damage membranes and reduce its performances resulting in a low product water quality thus with this configuration the process have to be interrupted when the salt concentration in the feed tank reached to a certain level hence the process present some disadvantages such as discontinuous permeate flow and quality increased membrane fouling longer residence time for feed and concentrate and so larger pump power and energy consumption required resulting in higher total running costs maximum time that system can operate avoiding too much fouling on membrane surface have to be set by monitoring the membrane performances and selected parameter values in feed solution the final generated brine

sio2 chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn color total suspended solid tss were analyzed by a colorimeter dr 3900 benchtop vis model a micro tpi field model portable turbidimeter was used for turbidity measurements 2 4 membrane and system performances the performances of the membrane and the filtration system were evaluated by calculating different parameters considered parameters are defined as follows 2 4 1 water recovery wr the water recovery is the percentage ratio of permeate produced to feed water two different water recoveries were calculated for the system water recovery wrs the mbr effluent was taken into account as the feed of the system in case of the membrane water recovery wrm the feed stream to the membrane was considered the related equations are given below 1 wr s v p v m 100 2 wr m v p v f 100 where vp is the permeate flow rate vm is mbr effluent flow rate and vf is feed flow rate to the membrane 2 4 2 permeate flux j the volumetric permeate flux through the membrane is the volumetric flow rate of permeate vp passing through a unit active area of membrane am it describes the productivity of the membrane module this parameter was tried to keep constant at different experiments the unit of measure commonly used is l per m2 of membrane area per hour or lmh thus it s defined as 3 j v p a m 2 4 3 concentrate retention the concentrate retention cr is the ratio of recirculated concentrate to total concentrate and it is defined as follows 4 cr c t c where ct is the concentrate flow rate recirculated and c is the total concentrate flow rate 2 4 4 concentration ratio of the feed tank solution this parameter is defined as the ratio of the final value of a specific parameter in the feed tank to the initial value of this it was calculated as an indicator of the change of water quality in the tank throughout the experiments 5 c f i c f c i 100 where cf is the final parameter value and ci is the initial parameter value both in the feed tank 2 4 5 the solute rejection the apparent or observed solute rejection r is defined as 6 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp is the parameter value in the permeate stream and cf is the parameter value in the membrane feed stream instantaneous rejection is defined by using concentrations at determined times after the beginning of the experiment while average rejection was calculated from average compositions of permeate and feed streams during the entire experiment 2 4 6 standard deviation standard deviation is a parameter to quantify the variation of set of data while low standard deviation values show precision of different measurements high standard deviation values symbolize some most of the measurements are varied from the average 26 standard deviation for any measurement set is calculated by using eq 7 7 s d i 1 n x i x m n where n is the number of measurements xm is the mean average of measurements and xi symbolizes any measurement 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane and system performances 3 1 1 volumetric flow rates and relative parameters the performance of the membrane and the system in the different filtration experiments were compared by calculating parameters defined in part 2 4 the results obtained are shown in table 2 permeate flux was kept almost constant values varied from 40 2 to 41 2 lmh in order to have similar productivity of the membrane module solute rejections depend on permeate flux thus it was necessary to keep the flux constant to observe the variation of the solute rejections solely by the effect of the concentrate amounts in the feed tank the effect of the temperature on solute rejections was neglected temperature average values varied from 19 5 to 28 0 c concentrate amount of the inlet flow to the feed tank is increased by closing concentrate discharge valve first partially then totally when the amount of concentrate discharged is reduced the concentrate retention is increased from 0 57 to 1 00 except the final concentrated feed solution in the tank the membrane water recovery decreased when the concentrate ratio in the inlet flow into the feed tank was increased from 35 to 60 due to the variation of the ratio of concentrate to permeate that was necessary to change to achieve the desired flow rates and the ratios between them c c m for example even though high water recoveries were achieved even 100 when c c m 0 6 which means zero concentrate discharge except the waste in the feed tank at the end of the experiment and increasing fouling properties of the feed solution were minimized by decreasing the membrane water recovery the concentration ratio of the final feed water to the initial one was increased from 137 9 to 173 6 when the concentrate ratio in the inlet flow into the feed tank increased from 25 to 60 such concentration ratios were calculated taken into consideration initial and final values of the conductivity as a concentration indicator of the solution in the feed tank shown in fig 3 this effect can be better shown by investigation of the values of different parameters in the feed solution table 3 shows the effect of increasing concentrate recirculation on the salinity of the feed solution because of the high concentration of the salinity in the feed tank experiments were stopped after three hours indeed the main disadvantage of the concentrate recirculation configuration is that the operation cannot be continuous but it has to be stopped when the feed solution concentration reached to a certain value which compromises the membrane performances and lifespan this system configuration reduces the waste discharge amount when the salt concentration in feed tank becomes high a further treatment is needed since it is impossible to discharge it into fresh water streams a possible way to treat this water is by natural evaporation 3 1 2 rejections and permeate quality average rejections for selected parameters for different experiments are shown in table 4 color cod magnesium sulphate and hardness values in the permeate samples were in some cases under detection limits thus rejections relative to those parameters were calculated by using their respective detection limits rejections calculated in this manner are referred to as minimum observed rejections denoted with symbol min and no instantaneous rejections were considered for these parameters most of average observed rejections were almost constant thus not affected by the different concentrations in the feed tank small differences in rejection values can be attributed to analytical errors especially in parameters whose values in water are close to the detection limits nh4 n tss color turbidity especially for permeate samples making rejections of these parameters depending on mostly feed concentrations average rejections of monovalent and divalent ions are greater than 95 and 97 respectively as expected from a brackish water ro membrane thus salinity was decreased from 2 0 2 5 to 0 04 0 10 see tables 1 and 5 rejections of the considered parameters were not affected significantly during the three hours of experiments in spite of the increasing concentrations in the feed tank however a high concentrated feed water can damage membranes and reduce its performances resulting in a low product water quality thus with this configuration the process has to be interrupted when the concentration in the feed tank reached a certain level maximum time that system can operate avoiding too much fouling on membrane surface has to be set by monitoring the membrane performances the average permeate compositions are shown in table 5 high hardness removal was achieved reaching final values on permeate flows of less than 17 8 mg l caco3 which was the lowest detection limit even when hardness in the initial feed solution varied from 352 to 502 mg l caco3 the average values of some parameters such as tss turbidity cod calcium magnesium sulfates toc phosphates hardness and ph were almost constant in the obtained permeate in spite of slightly or in some cases importantly some differences exist in the initial feed solution concentrations as mentioned for hardness other parameters such as color sodium potassium chloride the resulting conductivity and salinity and nitrogen content as nitrate nitrite and ammonium presented slightly higher values in the product water of the experiments with ratios of 25 and 35 of concentrates re circulated over total inlet in the feed tank such differences could be due to significant differences in the initial feed solution concentrations the low salinity hardness and other parameters make ro permeate useful for some purposes such as irrigation boiler feed water cooling water etc 27 however for each application many different parameters must be compared with respective guidelines 4 conclusions concentrate recirculation flow configuration permitted to reduce drastically the amount of generated brine in a ro filtration process a 100 of system water recovery and thus 1 00 of concentrate retention ratio were achieved with the additional advantage of a reduced membrane water recovery which minimizes the fouling effects of the increasing concentration of the solution being passed through the membrane in this case the conductivity in the feed tank was increased by 73 6 of the initial value most of the average observed rejections of selected parameters were almost constant thus not affected by the different concentrate recovery ratios rejections were also not affected by the increasing concentration of the concentrate stream in the feed tank during three hours of experiments the average product water quality was almost constant presenting negligible differences in average values of some parameters on the other hand highly concentrated feed water can damage membranes and reduce its performances resulting in a low product water quality thus with this configuration the process have to be interrupted when the salt concentration in the feed tank reached to a certain level hence the process present some disadvantages such as discontinuous permeate flow and quality increased membrane fouling longer residence time for feed and concentrate and so larger pump power and energy consumption required resulting in higher total running costs maximum time that system can operate avoiding too much fouling on membrane surface have to be set by monitoring the membrane performances and selected parameter values in feed solution the final generated brine
