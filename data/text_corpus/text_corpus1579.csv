7895,study region liuxihe river basin in guangdong province china study focus deciphering the runoff variation and its causes is crucial for catchment water management the impacts of long term precipitation aand land use change on the annual surface runoff were quantitatively analysed using various methods for the period of 1948 2019 new hydrological insights we found that abrupt change occurred in 2009 for precipitation and 2003 for runoff and the slope of precipitation runoff cumulative curve changed after 2000 with an increase of 122 this indicated that human activities in the early 2000 s may have resulted in a marked increase of runoff in addition to precipitation the dominant land use transfer was from croplands to constructed lands most profoundly during 2000 2010 the multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the increase of precipitation and the cropland to constructed land transitions were nearly equally responsible for the runoff increase in total the long term precipitation and major land use change explained 79 of annual runoff variation furthermore the effect of surface water area especially the pond area was discussed and the negative linear relationship was found not statistically significant but the impact of pond area ratio and its storage capacity on peak flow during rainstorms is worth further exploration towards flood mitigation which can serve as an important and effective measure for nature based management graphical abstract ga1 keywords runoff variation climate change land use cover change liuxihe river basin humid south china 1 introduction water cycle plays an important role in global energy exchange and mass balance and it is increasingly affected by climate change and human activities huntington 2006 de oliveira serrão et al 2022 dos santos et al 2018 liu et al 2020 lamparter et al 2018 berihun et al 2019 chanapathi and thatikonda 2020 climate change can affect the variation and spatial distribution of global water resources for instance precipitation and temperature can pose a strong impact on runoff and evaporation thus alter the water resources availability changnon and demissie 1996 jung et al 2010 arnell and gosling 2013 while human activities including land use cover change lucc surface and groundwater withdrawal and hydraulic engineering projects can also have a significant impact on the major hydrological process sulamo et al 2021 liu et al 2021 pan et al 2021 delgado et al 2020 de paulo rodrigues da silva et al 2018 among all the hydrological components runoff is a result of the compound impacts from both the natural and anthropogenic processes and is one of the most important readily extractable forms of water resources yuan et al 2014 runoff can be easily affected by land use cover change a typical type of human activities through alteration in soil properties and surface roughness schilling et al 2010 for example previous studies have shown that deforestation can affect soil infiltration change the process of runoff yield urbanization can increase impervious surface area shorten the confluence time of runoff and increase flood peak discharge in recent years more and more attention has been drawn by environmental change associated with hydrology and water resources for example labat et al 2004 examined the impact of global warming on runoff suggesting a 4 global runoff increase by 1 rise in global temperature duan et al 2017 examined the relative roles of climatic variables in altering annual runoff in the conterminous united states in the 21st century and suggested that precipitation has been the primary control of runoff variation kong et al 2016 found that more than 90 of runoff changes in the yellow river basin were human activity induced li et al 2010 found a negative impact of water and soil conservation measures on runoff generation based on a statistical model the methods used in the above mentioned studies can be categorized into hydrological modelling method elastic coefficient method and empirical statistical method hydrological models especially distributed models can reflect the spatial heterogeneity of catchments by combining geospatial information which is helpful to understand hydrological processes more deeply and objectively the hydrological models simulate different scenarios by controlling the input of climate and land use data to quantify the attribution of runoff change zhang et al 2016a sun et al 2014 senbeta and romanowicz 2021 one widely used elastic coefficient method is based on the budyko framework which assumes that the ratio of annual evapotranspiration to precipitation is a function of aridity and other basin characteristics the runoff variation caused by the unit change of the influencing factors is the elasticity coefficient of runoff after calculating the sensitivity of runoff to various meteorological elements the runoff variation caused by climate change can be obtained and then the impact degree of human activities can be determined by the water balance wang and hejazi 2011 xu et al 2014 although the budyko framework and the hydrological models are useful the studies require significant amount of data wang et al 2016 empirical statistical method reconstructs the runoff process in the period of human influence by establishing a statistical relationship between runoff and the related variables then the impact of climate change and human activities can be determined by comparing the difference between the reconstructed runoff and actual runoff liu et al 2017 miao et al 2011 despite the usefulness of the statistical method previous studies usually established the relationship between runoff and rainfall under overall land use change context but did not quantify the impact of a specific land use type change the state of the art land use classification maps derived from high resolution satellite images of long time series provide us a new opportunity to further refine the impact of land use change on runoff the pearl river delta is one of the most developed regions in china studies have shown that both the intensity and duration of rainstorms in this region tends to increase and the occurrence frequency and intensity of flood disasters increase consequently chen et al 2021 high intensity of human activities also led to serious loss of cropland and increasing demand for construction land which results in great pressure for sustainable ecological and societal development zhao and ye 2020 as the important water resource protection zone of guangzhou the core city of the pearl river delta the liuxihe river basin lxh is prone to floods due to frequent rainstorms yuan et al 2015 meanwhile prominent ecological problems in the basin such as acute contradiction between water resources supply and demand serious water contamination xie et al 2020 and great shifts in land use and landscape pattern zhu et al 2021 have drawn interest to some scholars si et al 2021 yuan et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b zhao et al 2013 these previous studies were primarily based on scenario analysis by replacing certain types of land cover with others it is also important to analyse the trend and causes of runoff change in the basin from the perspective of long term actual land use change therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the change patterns of rainfall runoff relationships in lxh based on a long time series of multiple datasets 2 to analyse the trend of land use change in the basin during the period of light to heavy anthropogenic influences and 3 to evaluate the causal relationships between surface runoff and various influencing factors particularly the land use types which contributed most to runoff variations were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area liuxihe river is located in the north of guangzhou 23 12 23 57 n 113 10 114 02 e fig 1 which belongs to the pearl river delta river network it is 171 km in length and originates from guifeng mountain in conghua district converged by numerous secondary streams the river runs through conghua district from north to south flows through areas in baiyun district and finally merges into the pearl river the third largest river in china liuxihe river basin lxh covers a total area of about 2300 km2 accounting for 31 land area of guangzhou and supplying 60 of the drinking water which determines its important resource and ecological value the predominant climate is subtropical monsoon humid climate with abundant rainfall the average annual temperature is 20 22 and the average annual evaporation is 1200 mm average annual rainfall is 1824 mm about 81 of which falls in the rainy season from april to september elevation of the basin is high in the northeast 1171 m and low in the southwest 29 m with mountainous areas in the upper reaches and hilly plains in the middle and lower reaches the upper reaches of lxh are densely forested the middle reaches are mainly cropland and orchards planting vegetables flowers and fruits the lower reaches is mainly construction land with a high level of urbanization and industrialization and have been expanding to the surrounding suburbs in recent years yu and ng 2007 there are reservoirs sluices and hydropower stations in the basin which are designed to control the flow and enhance the management ability of natural runoff according to the latest comprehensive plan for the liuxihe river basin the total annual water consumption in the basin should be limited to less than 900 million m3 by 2020 and the water consumption per 10000 chinese yuan of gdp should be controlled at less than 66 m3 for sustainable water use in the basin 2 2 data sources and pre processing the available observation data in the study area is too scarce to fully reflect the long term trends of the hydrological variations however the global land data assimilation system gldas applies advanced land surface modelling and data assimilation techniques to combine satellite and ground truth data to generate fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 which provides possibilities for assessing regional hydroclimate changes park and choi 2015 we extracted and processed gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 equivalent to 25 km and a temporal resolution of 3 h in google earth engine gee the mean monthly precipitation and surface runoff data in lxh were calculated for the period of 1948 2019 previous studies showed that the quality of gldas precipitation data in the pearl river basin was acceptable for a different period wang et al 2021 here due to the availability of observations only monthly precipitation and runoff from 2013 to 2017 provided by hydrographic bureau of guangdong province were compared to gldas data in the basin fig 2 precipitation data were obtained from 11 representative gauges in and around the basin and runoff data were obtained from the da ao hydrological station the runoff observation data were segmented by the digital filtering method nathan and mcmahon 1990 to obtain the surface runoff sequence the comparison showed that gldas reproduced the dynamics of the observations with r 2 of 0 90 and 0 66 respectively for precipitation and runoff therefore gldas data were used to analyse the long term hydro environmental relationships the land use cover data used in this paper was from the china land cover dataset clcd published by wuhan university yang and huang 2021 based on landsat series with a spatial resolution of 30 m from 1990 to 2019 classification results include cropland forest shrub grassland water snow ice barren impervious surface and wetland in gee the area occupied by various types of land in the study domain was calculated for each year 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 trend test and mutation detection in this paper mann kendall mk nonparametric test was used to analyse the trend of the data series and mann kendall rank test was used to test the mutation time these methods are recommended by the world meteorological organization to analyse the trend of meteorological and hydrological factors over time and can help identify when disturbance happens to alter the relative stable relationships jiang and you 1996 concluded that the mk test is efficient for identifying periods with significant hydrological changes and has an advantage over other methods in terms of precision note that the mutation test identifies the time when a data series have abrupt change as a result of all inclusive impacts from different factors for more specific information and calculations of the mk trend and mutation test please refer to the supplementary document 2 3 2 double mass curve the double mass curve dmc method merriam 1937 is an intuitive and effective method to analyse the consistency or long term evolution trend of hydrometeorological variables searcy and hardison 1960 argued that if the ratio of two variables is constant with time the dmc of one variable and its related variable should form a straight line the two variables would have the same physical cause or a clear causal relationship conversely the slope of the dmc will change if the relationship between two variables changes due to disturbances the slope change mostly reflects a change caused by human activities as pointed out by previous studies which analysed the impact of urbanization process land use cover change and other human activities on runoff generation jiang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 for example pirnia et al 2019 applied this method in the tajan river in iran to distinguish the impact of climate and human activities from 1971 to 2010 and showed that climate variability and human activities contributed 57 76 and 42 24 to stream flow variations respectively in this paper the effects of climate and human activities on surface runoff were described intuitively by a precipitation surface runoff dmc for the series of annual precipitation p i mm and annual surface runoff qs i mm the new series of cumulative precipitation x t mm and cumulative surface runoff y t mm can be expressed as 1 x t i t t p i t 1 2 3 n 2 y t i t t q s i t 1 2 3 n where n is the time series length the dmc can be obtained by taking x t and y t as independent variables and dependent variables respectively 2 3 3 land use transition matrix land use transition matrix pontius et al 2004 can describe the changes of land use types at the beginning and end of the study period and quantify the transfer degree and direction among different types the transition matrix t is expressed as follows 3 t a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a m 1 a m 2 a m n where a mn is the area transfer from the land use type m to the land use type n in addition this paper used land use transition status t s to measure the change trend of each land use type and the calculation formula is as follows 4 t s a i n a o u t a i n a o u t where a in represents the area changed from other land use types to this land use type and a out represents the area changed from this land use type to other land use types when 0 t s 1 the land use type is in expansion state when 1 t s 0 is in reduction state the closer t s is to 1 the more drastic the change degree 2 3 4 multiple linear regression analysis with standardized variables multiple linear regression mlr tranmer et al 2020 was used to analyse the impact of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff during 1990 2019 when all data were available in order to eliminate the dimensional influence data series were standardized s i before analysis i e the mean value μ of the original data s i was subtracted and then divided by the standard deviation σ 5 s i s i μ σ through non parametric kolmogorov smirnov test de oliveira serrão e a et al 2020 it was found that both precipitation and surface runoff followed the normal distribution after all variables were standardized mlr was conducted following eq 6 and the regression coefficient were then used to reflect the influence degree of the corresponding independent variables wang et al 2019a the larger the coefficient the stronger the influence the sign of coefficient indicates positive negative impact 6 q s a p i 1 n b i a i where a is the standardized regression coefficient of precipitation b i is the standardized regression coefficient of the annual area of each land use type during 1990 2019 q s p and a i is the standardized surface runoff precipitation and area of each land use type investigated note that the applicable conditions of mlr are as follows 1 dependent variable is continuous 2 dependent variables are independent of each other the durbin watson d w method durbin and watson 1950 was used to test whether autocorrelation exists between variables it is generally believed that when the d w test results are near 2 variables are independent of each other 3 no multicollinearity exists between independent variables multicollinearity can lead to many problems in relationship analysis such as inconsistency between the results and the objective facts and instability of the estimation equation the variance inflation factor vif marquardt 1970 was used to test the multicollinearity for detailed information about the kolmogorov smirnov test and the durbin watson method as well as the statistical test results please refer to the supplementary document all statistical analysis was conducted in the software spss 26 3 results 3 1 interannual variations of precipitation and surface runoff fig 3a shows the variation of precipitation in lxh from 1948 to 2019 during the 72 years the average annual precipitation of lxh was 1872 7 307 9 mm and the maximum and minimum value was 2777 6 mm in 2016 and 1250 0 mm in 1963 respectively according to the results of mk trend analysis the overall precipitation showed an upward trend z 2 69 and passed the significance level of 0 01 with an increasing rate of 5 34 mm a the uf and ub curves intersected near 2009 within the significance level of 0 05 1 96 showing a mutation around this year fig 3b fig 3a shows the variation of surface runoff in lxh in the same period of precipitation from 1948 to 2019 with the mean annual surface runoff being 91 7 53 3 mm like precipitation the mean annual surface runoff also showed an overall upward trend but with a lower rate of 1 78 mm a z 5 77 which was statistically significant at the level of 0 01 the lower increase rate of runoff compared to precipitation could be due to the considerable amount of water abstraction for domestic and industrial use as the population and urbanization grows rapidly in this area zhu et al 2021 in addition the mk mutation test showed that uf and ub curves of surface runoff intersected near 2003 fig 3d the surface runoff mutation occurred a few years earlier than the precipitation abrupt change in 2009 indicating that human activities have affected the surface runoff during the early 2000 s fig 4 shows the dmc of precipitation and runoff in lxh from 1948 to 2019 it was observed that the slope of the curve changed around 2000 rising from 0 0359 to 0 0797 an increase of 122 it indicated that the relationship between precipitation and surface runoff has changed significantly since 2000 influenced by human activities 3 2 shifts in land use land cover according to the above analysis surface runoff began to be influenced by human activities around early 2000 s so we analysed the changes of land use cover types in lxh over 1990 2019 to further discuss the effects of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff changes based on the series of land use classification maps the area and dynamic change of each land use type were given in fig 5 figs 6 and 7 and table 2 are the analysis results of land use transition it was observed that most of the land use transition occurred from 1990 to 2010 among which the transition between cropland and impervious surface was the most prominent especially during 2000 2010 when the urban expansion was most drastic and extensive in the past 30 years 90 7 of the newly increased impervious surface was transformed from cropland it demonstrated that the basin experienced rapid urbanization on the cost of losing croplands table 1 the main land use types in lxh are forest and cropland which accounted for more than 80 of the basin on average in the past 30 years the area of cropland has been continuously declining t s 0 634 and the area in 2019 was only 69 14 of that in 1990 the area of impervious surface kept increasing t s 0 988 and its area in 2019 was 5 66 times that in 1990 the forest area showed a fluctuating but overall increasing trend t s 0 179 the water body firstly increased and then decreased and the area of river and reservoirs fluctuated slightly which was mainly caused by the increase and decrease of the ponds area t s 0 063 used for fish farming in the basin 3 3 quantifying the impacts of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff land use cover types with area ratio less than 1 were considered posing little or no impacts on the runoff generation which left forest cropland impervious surface and water bodies together with precipitation for analysis in addition we found that the variations of total water surface area in the basin were largely induced by the change of the fishing ponds table 1 therefore the ponds area rather than the total water body area was used for further analysis here mlr analysis showed that the collinear statistical vif value of impervious surface area was as high as 15975 9 mainly because 90 69 of the new increased impervious surface came from cropland accounting for 75 1 of the total impervious surface area in 2019 in other words there was a high collinearity between the increase of impervious surface and the decrease of cropland so the area of impervious surface was excluded in the mlr analysis while the change of cropland was used to represent the result of their interactions the analysis results were given in table 3 and eq 7 the areas in the above equation were after standardization using the data series in fig 6 it was observed that the increase of precipitation the transition between cropland and impervious surface the increase of forest and the decrease of ponds together resulted in 79 of the increase of surface runoff p 0 01 among them the increase of precipitation and the transition between cropland and impervious surface were the two most significant factors leading to an increase of runoff p 0 05 the influence degree of the two factors in the long term was close coefficient of 0 491 vs 0 443 with the former having a slightly greater impact than the latter we also noticed that the ponds area had a negative impact on surface runoff 7 r 0 491 p 0 443 a c r o p l a n d 0 136 a f o r e s t 0 01 a p o n d s r 2 0 79 4 discussion 4 1 hydrology and landscape changes in the basin during the rapid urbanization and industrialization progress the basin has seen great changes in hydrology and landscapes zhu et al 2021 which has resulted in many economic and environmental issues analysing and understanding these changes can help resolve these issues the analysis of the surface runoff variation in the basin showed that the surface runoff increased significantly from 1948 to 2019 so did the precipitation during the same period studies have shown that the precipitation at guangzhou station close to the lower reaches of lxh showed a significant upward trend from 1959 to 2012 tang and chen 2015 which is consistent with our results consistency of precipitation and surface runoff changes indicated a direct linkage between the two processes located in the subtropical region the pearl river delta region has abundant rainfall and is significantly affected by typhoon rainstorm and monsoon rain belt deng et al 2018 so extreme precipitation is prominent wu and huang 2016 zhang et al 2009 causing flood discharge along the rivers rapidly which seriously threatens the safety of the middle and lower reaches where cropland and residential areas are dominant it is estimated that the average annual loss by flooding in guangzhou alone was over 500 million chinese yuan each year therefore it is necessary to determine the role of precipitation in extreme hydrology and take corresponding flood control measures to minimize the associated economic loss the mk test demonstrated the mutation time of surface runoff 2003 was before that of rainfall 2009 and the slope of the dmc also changed around 2000 indicating that the change of surface runoff during the early 2000 s was obviously also influenced by human activities apart from precipitation combined with the results of land use cover analysis we observed that the transition among land use types was indeed very intense between 1990 and 2010 and a large amount of cropland was transferred into impervious surface as also shown in zhu et al 2021 as one of the cities in the pearl river delta region with high density of cropland guangzhou faces the challenges under rapid urbanization to ensure sufficient quantity and quality of cropland for food security economic development social stability as well as eco environmental protection zhao and ye 2020 therefore on the premise of ensuring social and economic development the basin needs to balance the contradiction between cropland and municipal expansion and protect agricultural resources and environment liu et al 2005 jiang et al 2015 4 2 contribution of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff mlr analysis showed that 79 of the increase of surface runoff was induced by precipitation and major lucc and the former posed the greatest impact among the factors investigated other studies on lxh yuan et al 2015 also agreed that the change of runoff was dominated by the change of precipitation mainly because precipitation is the most important factor of runoff variation under the humid and subtropical climate in southern china the transition between cropland to impervious surface also had a great impact on runoff only second to precipitation in the long term which has not been explicitly reported in previous studies that focused on a short period the area of cropland was negatively correlated with surface runoff because more than 60 of the cropland was transferred to impervious surface which reduced infiltration and water residence time on the surface meanwhile the decrease of cropland also led to the decrease of canopy interception and evapotranspiration resulting in surface runoff increase hu et al 2021 the transition between cropland and impervious surface was the most significant change in the basin and its influence was far more significant than other land use types this is especially true in many developing countries where urbanization and industrialization are in fast pace for instance shrestha 2019 analysed flood characteristics of pampanga river basin in the philippines and concluded that the flood inundation depth and flooding areas may continue to increase due to urbanization and conversions of cropland into built up areas lxh has also experienced rapid urbanization on the cost of losing croplands which is still ongoing but a little less intensive than the period of 2000 2010 the balance between cropland and impervious surface is not only beneficial to the ecological security but also of great significance to flood control based on our analysis the increase of forest area had a slightly positive influence on surface runoff but the influence was not significant the conclusion of the hydrological effect of forest is not clear in the literature so far some studies showed that afforestation will reduce runoff bhattacharjee and behera 2018 while others found little or no influence ferreira and ghimire 2012 chang 2006 in a previous study in liuxihe river basin yuan et al 2015 when the impervious surface and water body remained unchanged and other land use types were all set as forest the runoff decreased we showed that the area of forest transferred to other land use types was less than the area of other land use types transferred into forest which according to the above study may lead to reduction in runoff but actually surface runoff showed slight increase which may be explained by the fact that some of the forest was transferred to impervious surface ranking the fourth largest transfer among all during 1990 2019 the different results reflect the complexity of the impacts of land use changes on hydrology wagner et al 2013 marhaento et al 2017 forests are often proposed to mitigate small scale flood by enhancing interception macroporous infiltration for deep soil water recharge ellison et al 2017 tembata et al 2020 the mitigation is mainly effective under a certain threshold of rainfall amount and intensity soulsby et al 2017 and especially effective when forest locations are well arranged wheater and evans 2009 marshall et al 2014 this effect may not be strong because yuan et al 2015 only found 0 7 decrease in runoff with extreme conversion scenario while our results showed a slight increase the change of ponds area has a negative effect on surface runoff because the pond can accommodate part of precipitation and subsurface lateral flow thus reduces the water yield and peak discharge of the basin smith et al 2002 this is similar with nicholas research longbucco 2010 which focused on ponds in 29 basins in the united states and showed that the proportion of pond area was negatively correlated with flood peak discharge however the influence was limited in this study compared to precipitation and cropland conversion since ponds only occupied a small area and the t s was only 0 063 indicating a small change trend nonetheless the existence of ponds in a basin can essentially play an important role in regulating hydrological processes and water conservation chaney et al 2012 lowrance et al 2007 studied two small basins in the little river watershed near tifton georgia for seven years finding that the south basin had only 55 of the total runoff of the north basin due to the presence of farm ponds occupying about 6 of the total watershed area yusoff et al 2018 concluded that the volume for the ponds was effective to accommodate the increasing storm water runoff from catchment area despite its great potential in flood control the quantification of ponds storage capacity requires comprehensive geometric measurement of area water depth and edge height etc which requires a large workload but is worth further investigations 4 3 limitations this paper only discussed the impact of precipitation and area of main land use types on surface runoff other factors were not considered comprehensively for example some studies have shown that annual temperature in the pearl river delta showed a gradual increase trend under the background of urbanization and global climate change wang et al 2019b which may increase evaporation and change vegetation phenology thus affects surface runoff in addition the change of spatial landscape patterns i e landscape configuration in the basin was not considered but its influence on surface runoff can be profound from the perspective of spatial distribution of land use types which can essentially alter hydrologic connections of the river systems epting et al 2018 jahanishakib et al 2021 on the other hand there are many reservoirs sluices and other regulation and storage projects in the basin built up in recent years however because these water projects are not easy to be quantitatively analysed their impact was not assessed which can also be one of the factors leading to the uncertainty in the impact analysis moreover we found there are many available statistical methods for the similar purposes while choosing different methods may lead to slight difference in the statistical results but should not change the fact of climate and land use change contribution to the runoff changes 5 conclusions this paper analysed the impact of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff in a humid subtropical river basin both precipitation and surface runoff were found increased significantly over the last 7 decades and their abrupt change occurred in 2009 and 2003 respectively the slope of the precipitation surface runoff double mass curve changed in 2000 indicating enhanced impacts of human activities on the precipitation runoff relationships since then meanwhile the land use change was more drastic before 2010 than after 2010 featured in significant cropland decrease and continuous impervious surface increase with the largest transition between the two the increase of precipitation and lucc was predominantly responsible for runoff change together explaining 79 of runoff increase with nearly equal contributions however as land use types stabilize with socioeconomic development in the future the runoff would mainly change with climate especially precipitation patterns in this region which should attract more attention on climate impact mitigation measures to reduce flood risks this paper provides an effective way of examining the long term impact of precipitation and land use change on runoff and the analysis can be applicable in other humid areas with rich datasets however it should be noted that this study does not consider the impact of other climate factor such as temperature and landscape configuration changes and water conservancy projects like the cascade reservoirs were also not considered which should be further investigated in the future for a comprehensive understanding of the climate and land use change impact on runoff variations credit authorship contribution statement jinghua zheng data curation formal analysis

7895,study region liuxihe river basin in guangdong province china study focus deciphering the runoff variation and its causes is crucial for catchment water management the impacts of long term precipitation aand land use change on the annual surface runoff were quantitatively analysed using various methods for the period of 1948 2019 new hydrological insights we found that abrupt change occurred in 2009 for precipitation and 2003 for runoff and the slope of precipitation runoff cumulative curve changed after 2000 with an increase of 122 this indicated that human activities in the

multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the increase of precipitation and the cropland to constructed land transitions were nearly equally responsible for the runoff increase in total the long term precipitation and major land use change explained 79 of annual runoff variation furthermore the effect of surface water area especially the pond area was discussed and the negative linear

more and more attention has been drawn by environmental change associated with hydrology and water resources for example labat et al 2004 examined the impact of global warming on runoff suggesting a 4 global runoff increase by 1 rise in global temperature duan et al 2017 examined the relative roles of climatic variables in altering annual runoff in the conterminous united states in the 21st century and suggested that precipitation has been the primary control of runoff variation kong et al 2016 found that more than 90 of runoff changes in the yellow river basin were human activity induced li et al 2010 found a negative impact of water and soil conservation measures on runoff generation based on a statistical model the methods used in the above mentioned studies can be categorized into hydrological modelling method elastic coefficient method and empirical statistical method hydrological models especially distributed models can reflect the spatial heterogeneity of catchments by combining geospatial information which is helpful to understand hydrological processes more deeply and objectively the hydrological models simulate different scenarios by controlling the input of climate and land use data to quantify the attribution of runoff change zhang et al 2016a sun et al 2014 senbeta and romanowicz 2021 one widely used elastic coefficient method is based on the budyko framework which assumes that the ratio of annual evapotranspiration to precipitation is a function of aridity and other basin characteristics the runoff variation caused by the unit change of the influencing factors is the elasticity coefficient of runoff after calculating the sensitivity of runoff to various meteorological elements the runoff variation caused by climate change can be obtained and then the impact degree of human activities can be determined by the water balance wang and hejazi 2011 xu et al 2014 although the budyko framework and the hydrological models are useful the studies require significant amount of data wang et al 2016 empirical statistical method reconstructs the runoff process in the period of human influence by establishing a statistical relationship between runoff and the related variables then the impact of climate change and human activities can be determined by comparing the difference between the reconstructed runoff and actual runoff liu et al 2017 miao et al 2011 despite the usefulness of the statistical method previous studies usually established the relationship between runoff and rainfall under overall land use change context but did not quantify the impact of a specific land use type change the state of the art land use classification maps derived from high resolution satellite images of long time series provide us a new opportunity to further refine the impact of land use change on runoff the pearl river delta is one of the most developed regions in china studies have shown that both the intensity and duration of rainstorms in this region tends to increase and the occurrence frequency and intensity of flood disasters increase consequently chen et al 2021 high intensity of human activities also led to serious loss of cropland and increasing demand for construction land which results in great pressure for sustainable ecological and societal development zhao and ye 2020 as the important water resource protection zone of guangzhou the core city of the pearl river delta the liuxihe river basin lxh is prone to floods due to frequent rainstorms yuan et al 2015 meanwhile prominent ecological problems in the basin such as acute contradiction between water resources supply and demand serious water contamination xie et al 2020 and great shifts in land use and landscape pattern zhu et al 2021 have drawn interest to some scholars si et al 2021 yuan et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b zhao et al 2013 these previous studies were primarily based on scenario analysis by replacing certain types of land cover with others it is also important to analyse the trend and causes of runoff change in the basin from the perspective of long term actual land use change therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the change patterns of rainfall runoff relationships in lxh based on a long time series of multiple datasets 2 to analyse the trend of land use change in the basin during the period of light to heavy anthropogenic influences and 3 to evaluate the causal relationships between surface runoff and various influencing factors particularly the land use types which contributed most to runoff variations were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area liuxihe river is located in the north of guangzhou 23 12 23 57 n 113 10 114 02 e fig 1 which belongs to the pearl river delta river network it is 171 km in length and originates from guifeng mountain in conghua district converged by numerous secondary streams the river runs through conghua district from north to south flows through areas in baiyun district and finally merges into the pearl river the third largest river in china liuxihe river basin lxh covers a total area of about 2300 km2 accounting for 31 land area of guangzhou and supplying 60 of the drinking water which determines its important resource and ecological value the predominant climate is subtropical monsoon humid climate with abundant rainfall the average annual temperature is 20 22 and the average annual evaporation is 1200 mm average annual rainfall is 1824 mm about 81 of which falls in the rainy season from april to september elevation of the basin is high in the northeast 1171 m and low in the southwest 29 m with mountainous areas in the upper reaches and hilly plains in the middle and lower reaches the upper reaches of lxh are densely forested the middle reaches are mainly cropland and orchards planting vegetables flowers and fruits the lower reaches is mainly construction land with a high level of urbanization and industrialization and have been expanding to the surrounding suburbs in recent years yu and ng 2007 there are reservoirs sluices and hydropower stations in the basin which are designed to control the flow and enhance the management ability of natural runoff according to the latest comprehensive plan for the liuxihe river basin the total annual water consumption in the basin should be limited to less than 900 million m3 by 2020 and the water consumption per 10000 chinese yuan of gdp should be controlled at less than 66 m3 for sustainable water use in the basin 2 2 data sources and pre processing the available observation data in the study area is too scarce to fully reflect the long term trends of the hydrological variations however the global land data assimilation system gldas applies advanced land surface modelling and data assimilation techniques to combine satellite and ground truth data to generate fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 which provides possibilities for assessing regional hydroclimate changes park and choi 2015 we extracted and processed gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 equivalent to 25 km and a temporal resolution of 3 h in google earth engine gee the mean monthly precipitation and surface runoff data in lxh were calculated for the period of 1948 2019 previous studies showed that the quality of gldas precipitation data in the pearl river basin was acceptable for a different period wang et al 2021 here due to the availability of observations only monthly precipitation and runoff from 2013 to 2017 provided by hydrographic bureau of guangdong province were compared to gldas data in the basin fig 2 precipitation data were obtained from 11 representative gauges in and around the basin and runoff data were obtained from the da ao hydrological station the runoff observation data were segmented by the digital filtering method nathan and mcmahon 1990 to obtain the surface runoff sequence the comparison showed that gldas reproduced the dynamics of the observations with r 2 of 0 90 and 0 66 respectively for precipitation and runoff therefore gldas data were used to analyse the long term hydro environmental relationships the land use cover data used in this paper was from the china land cover dataset clcd published by wuhan university yang and huang 2021 based on landsat series with a spatial resolution of 30 m from 1990 to 2019 classification results include cropland forest shrub grassland water snow ice barren impervious surface and wetland in gee the area occupied by various types of land in the study domain was calculated for each year 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 trend test and mutation detection in this paper mann kendall mk nonparametric test was used to analyse the trend of the data series and mann kendall rank test was used to test the mutation time these methods are recommended by the world meteorological organization to analyse the trend of meteorological and hydrological factors over time and can help identify when disturbance happens to alter the relative stable relationships jiang and you 1996 concluded that the mk test is efficient for identifying periods with significant hydrological changes and has an advantage over other methods in terms of precision note that the mutation test identifies the time when a data series have abrupt change as a result of all inclusive impacts from different factors for more specific information and calculations of the mk trend and mutation test please refer to the supplementary document 2 3 2 double mass curve the double mass curve dmc method merriam 1937 is an intuitive and effective method to analyse the consistency or long term evolution trend of hydrometeorological variables searcy and hardison 1960 argued that if the ratio of two variables is constant with time the dmc of one variable and its related variable should form a straight line the two variables would have the same physical cause or a clear causal relationship conversely the slope of the dmc will change if the relationship between two variables changes due to disturbances the slope change mostly reflects a change caused by human activities as pointed out by previous studies which analysed the impact of urbanization process land use cover change and other human activities on runoff generation jiang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 for example pirnia et al 2019 applied this method in the tajan river in iran to distinguish the impact of climate and human activities from 1971 to 2010 and showed that climate variability and human activities contributed 57 76 and 42 24 to stream flow variations respectively in this paper the effects of climate and human activities on surface runoff were described intuitively by a precipitation surface runoff dmc for the series of annual precipitation p i mm and annual surface runoff qs i mm the new series of cumulative precipitation x t mm and cumulative surface runoff y t mm can be expressed as 1 x t i t t p i t 1 2 3 n 2 y t i t t q s i t 1 2 3 n where n is the time series length the dmc can be obtained by taking x t and y t as independent variables and dependent variables respectively 2 3 3 land use transition matrix land use transition matrix pontius et al 2004 can describe the changes of land use types at the beginning and end of the study period and quantify the transfer degree and direction among different types the transition matrix t is expressed as follows 3 t a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a m 1 a m 2 a m n where a mn is the area transfer from the land use type m to the land use type n in addition this paper used land use transition status t s to measure the change trend of each land use type and the calculation formula is as follows 4 t s a i n a o u t a i n a o u t where a in represents the area changed from other land use types to this land use type and a out represents the area changed from this land use type to other land use types when 0 t s 1 the land use type is in expansion state when 1 t s 0 is in reduction state the closer t s is to 1 the more drastic the change degree 2 3 4 multiple linear regression analysis with standardized variables multiple linear regression mlr tranmer et al 2020 was used to analyse the impact of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff during 1990 2019 when all data were available in order to eliminate the dimensional influence data series were standardized s i before analysis i e the mean value μ of the original data s i was subtracted and then divided by the standard deviation σ 5 s i s i μ σ through non parametric kolmogorov smirnov test de oliveira serrão e a et al 2020 it was found that both precipitation and surface runoff followed the normal distribution after all variables were standardized mlr was conducted following eq 6 and the regression coefficient were then used to reflect the influence degree of the corresponding independent variables wang et al 2019a the larger the coefficient the stronger the influence the sign of coefficient indicates positive negative impact 6 q s a p i 1 n b i a i where a is the standardized regression coefficient of precipitation b i is the standardized regression coefficient of the annual area of each land use type during 1990 2019 q s p and a i is the standardized surface runoff precipitation and area of each land use type investigated note that the applicable conditions of mlr are as follows 1 dependent variable is continuous 2 dependent variables are independent of each other the durbin watson d w method durbin and watson 1950 was used to test whether autocorrelation exists between variables it is generally believed that when the d w test results are near 2 variables are independent of each other 3 no multicollinearity exists between independent variables multicollinearity can lead to many problems in relationship analysis such as inconsistency between the results and the objective facts and instability of the estimation equation the variance inflation factor vif marquardt 1970 was used to test the multicollinearity for detailed information about the kolmogorov smirnov test and the durbin watson method as well as the statistical test results please refer to the supplementary document all statistical analysis was conducted in the software spss 26 3 results 3 1 interannual variations of precipitation and surface runoff fig 3a shows the variation of precipitation in lxh from 1948 to 2019 during the 72 years the average annual precipitation of lxh was 1872 7 307 9 mm and the maximum and minimum value was 2777 6 mm in 2016 and 1250 0 mm in 1963 respectively according to the results of mk trend analysis the overall precipitation showed an upward trend z 2 69 and passed the significance level of 0 01 with an increasing rate of 5 34 mm a the uf and ub curves intersected near 2009 within the significance level of 0 05 1 96 showing a mutation around this year fig 3b fig 3a shows the variation of surface runoff in lxh in the same period of precipitation from 1948 to 2019 with the mean annual surface runoff being 91 7 53 3 mm like precipitation the mean annual surface runoff also showed an overall upward trend but with a lower rate of 1 78 mm a z 5 77 which was statistically significant at the level of 0 01 the lower increase rate of runoff compared to precipitation could be due to the considerable amount of water abstraction for domestic and industrial use as the population and urbanization grows rapidly in this area zhu et al 2021 in addition the mk mutation test showed that uf and ub curves of surface runoff intersected near 2003 fig 3d the surface runoff mutation occurred a few years earlier than the precipitation abrupt change in 2009 indicating that human activities have affected the surface runoff during the early 2000 s fig 4 shows the dmc of precipitation and runoff in lxh from 1948 to 2019 it was observed that the slope of the curve changed around 2000 rising from 0 0359 to 0 0797 an increase of 122 it indicated that the relationship between precipitation and surface runoff has changed significantly since 2000 influenced by human activities 3 2 shifts in land use land cover according to the above analysis surface runoff began to be influenced by human activities around early 2000 s so we analysed the changes of land use cover types in lxh over 1990 2019 to further discuss the effects of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff changes based on the series of land use classification maps the area and dynamic change of each land use type were given in fig 5 figs 6 and 7 and table 2 are the analysis results of land use transition it was observed that most of the land use transition occurred from 1990 to 2010 among which the transition between cropland and impervious surface was the most prominent especially during 2000 2010 when the urban expansion was most drastic and extensive in the past 30 years 90 7 of the newly increased impervious surface was transformed from cropland it demonstrated that the basin experienced rapid urbanization on the cost of losing croplands table 1 the main land use types in lxh are forest and cropland which accounted for more than 80 of the basin on average in the past 30 years the area of cropland has been continuously declining t s 0 634 and the area in 2019 was only 69 14 of that in 1990 the area of impervious surface kept increasing t s 0 988 and its area in 2019 was 5 66 times that in 1990 the forest area showed a fluctuating but overall increasing trend t s 0 179 the water body firstly increased and then decreased and the area of river and reservoirs fluctuated slightly which was mainly caused by the increase and decrease of the ponds area t s 0 063 used for fish farming in the basin 3 3 quantifying the impacts of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff land use cover types with area ratio less than 1 were considered posing little or no impacts on the runoff generation which left forest cropland impervious surface and water bodies together with precipitation for analysis in addition we found that the variations of total water surface area in the basin were largely induced by the change of the fishing ponds table 1 therefore the ponds area rather than the total water body area was used for further analysis here mlr analysis showed that the collinear statistical vif value of impervious surface area was as high as 15975 9 mainly because 90 69 of the new increased impervious surface came from cropland accounting for 75 1 of the total impervious surface area in 2019 in other words there was a high collinearity between the increase of impervious surface and the decrease of cropland so the area of impervious surface was excluded in the mlr analysis while the change of cropland was used to represent the result of their interactions the analysis results were given in table 3 and eq 7 the areas in the above equation were after standardization using the data series in fig 6 it was observed that the increase of precipitation the transition between cropland and impervious surface the increase of forest and the decrease of ponds together resulted in 79 of the increase of surface runoff p 0 01 among them the increase of precipitation and the transition between cropland and impervious surface were the two most significant factors leading to an increase of runoff p 0 05 the influence degree of the two factors in the long term was close coefficient of 0 491 vs 0 443 with the former having a slightly greater impact than the latter we also noticed that the ponds area had a negative impact on surface runoff 7 r 0 491 p 0 443 a c r o p l a n d 0 136 a f o r e s t 0 01 a p o n d s r 2 0 79 4 discussion 4 1 hydrology and landscape changes in the basin during the rapid urbanization and industrialization progress the basin has seen great changes in hydrology and landscapes zhu et al 2021 which has resulted in many economic and environmental issues analysing and understanding these changes can help resolve these issues the analysis of the surface runoff variation in the basin showed that the surface runoff increased significantly from 1948 to 2019 so did the precipitation during the same period studies have shown that the precipitation at guangzhou station close to the lower reaches of lxh showed a significant upward trend from 1959 to 2012 tang and chen 2015 which is consistent with our results consistency of precipitation and surface runoff changes indicated a direct linkage between the two processes located in the subtropical region the pearl river delta region has abundant rainfall and is significantly affected by typhoon rainstorm and monsoon rain belt deng et al 2018 so extreme precipitation is prominent wu and huang 2016 zhang et al 2009 causing flood discharge along the rivers rapidly which seriously threatens the safety of the middle and lower reaches where cropland and residential areas are dominant it is estimated that the average annual loss by flooding in guangzhou alone was over 500 million chinese yuan each year therefore it is necessary to determine the role of precipitation in extreme hydrology and take corresponding flood control measures to minimize the associated economic loss the mk test demonstrated the mutation time of surface runoff 2003 was before that of rainfall 2009 and the slope of the dmc also changed around 2000 indicating that the change of surface runoff during the early 2000 s was obviously also influenced by human activities apart from precipitation combined with the results of land use cover analysis we observed that the transition among land use types was indeed very intense between 1990 and 2010 and a large amount of cropland was transferred into impervious surface as also shown in zhu et al 2021 as one of the cities in the pearl river delta region with high density of cropland guangzhou faces the challenges under rapid urbanization to ensure sufficient quantity and quality of cropland for food security economic development social stability as well as eco environmental protection zhao and ye 2020 therefore on the premise of ensuring social and economic development the basin needs to balance the contradiction between cropland and municipal expansion and protect agricultural resources and environment liu et al 2005 jiang et al 2015 4 2 contribution of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff mlr analysis showed that 79 of the increase of surface runoff was induced by precipitation and major lucc and the former posed the greatest impact among the factors investigated other studies on lxh yuan et al 2015 also agreed that the change of runoff was dominated by the change of precipitation mainly because precipitation is the most important factor of runoff variation under the humid and subtropical climate in southern china the transition between cropland to impervious surface also had a great impact on runoff only second to precipitation in the long term which has not been explicitly reported in previous studies that focused on a short period the area of cropland was negatively correlated with surface runoff because more than 60 of the cropland was transferred to impervious surface which reduced infiltration and water residence time on the surface meanwhile the decrease of cropland also led to the decrease of canopy interception and evapotranspiration resulting in surface runoff increase hu et al 2021 the transition between cropland and impervious surface was the most significant change in the basin and its influence was far more significant than other land use types this is especially true in many developing countries where urbanization and industrialization are in fast pace for instance shrestha 2019 analysed flood characteristics of pampanga river basin in the philippines and concluded that the flood inundation depth and flooding areas may continue to increase due to urbanization and conversions of cropland into built up areas lxh has also experienced rapid urbanization on the cost of losing croplands which is still ongoing but a little less intensive than the period of 2000 2010 the balance between cropland and impervious surface is not only beneficial to the ecological security but also of great significance to flood control based on our analysis the increase of forest area had a slightly positive influence on surface runoff but the influence was not significant the conclusion of the hydrological effect of forest is not clear in the literature so far some studies showed that afforestation will reduce runoff bhattacharjee and behera 2018 while others found little or no influence ferreira and ghimire 2012 chang 2006 in a previous study in liuxihe river basin yuan et al 2015 when the impervious surface and water body remained unchanged and other land use types were all set as forest the runoff decreased we showed that the area of forest transferred to other land use types was less than the area of other land use types transferred into forest which according to the above study may lead to reduction in runoff but actually surface runoff showed slight increase which may be explained by the fact that some of the forest was transferred to impervious surface ranking the fourth largest transfer among all during 1990 2019 the different results reflect the complexity of the impacts of land use changes on hydrology wagner et al 2013 marhaento et al 2017 forests are often proposed to mitigate small scale flood by enhancing interception macroporous infiltration for deep soil water recharge ellison et al 2017 tembata et al 2020 the mitigation is mainly effective under a certain threshold of rainfall amount and intensity soulsby et al 2017 and especially effective when forest locations are well arranged wheater and evans 2009 marshall et al 2014 this effect may not be strong because yuan et al 2015 only found 0 7 decrease in runoff with extreme conversion scenario while our results showed a slight increase the change of ponds area has a negative effect on surface runoff because the pond can accommodate part of precipitation and subsurface lateral flow thus reduces the water yield and peak discharge of the basin smith et al 2002 this is similar with nicholas research longbucco 2010 which focused on ponds in 29 basins in the united states and showed that the proportion of pond area was negatively correlated with flood peak discharge however the influence was limited in this study compared to precipitation and cropland conversion since ponds only occupied a small area and the t s was only 0 063 indicating a small change trend nonetheless the existence of ponds in a basin can essentially play an important role in regulating hydrological processes and water conservation chaney et al 2012 lowrance et al 2007 studied two small basins in the little river watershed near tifton georgia for seven years finding that the south basin had only 55 of the total runoff of the north basin due to the presence of farm ponds occupying about 6 of the total watershed area yusoff et al 2018 concluded that the volume for the ponds was effective to accommodate the increasing storm water runoff from catchment area despite its great potential in flood control the quantification of ponds storage capacity requires comprehensive geometric measurement of area water depth and edge height etc which requires a large workload but is worth further investigations 4 3 limitations this paper only discussed the impact of precipitation and area of main land use types on surface runoff other factors were not considered comprehensively for example some studies have shown that annual temperature in the pearl river delta showed a gradual increase trend under the background of urbanization and global climate change wang et al 2019b which may increase evaporation and change vegetation phenology thus affects surface runoff in addition the change of spatial landscape patterns i e landscape configuration in the basin was not considered but its influence on surface runoff can be profound from the perspective of spatial distribution of land use types which can essentially alter hydrologic connections of the river systems epting et al 2018 jahanishakib et al 2021 on the other hand there are many reservoirs sluices and other regulation and storage projects in the basin built up in recent years however because these water projects are not easy to be quantitatively analysed their impact was not assessed which can also be one of the factors leading to the uncertainty in the impact analysis moreover we found there are many available statistical methods for the similar purposes while choosing different methods may lead to slight difference in the statistical results but should not change the fact of climate and land use change contribution to the runoff changes 5 conclusions this paper analysed the impact of precipitation and lucc on surface runoff in a humid subtropical river basin both precipitation and surface runoff were found increased significantly over the last 7 decades and their abrupt change occurred in 2009 and 2003 respectively the slope of the precipitation surface runoff double mass curve changed in 2000 indicating enhanced impacts of human activities on the precipitation runoff relationships since then meanwhile the land use change was more drastic before 2010 than after 2010 featured in significant cropland decrease and continuous impervious surface increase with the largest transition between the two the increase of precipitation and lucc was predominantly responsible for runoff change together explaining 79 of runoff increase with nearly equal contributions however as land use types stabilize with socioeconomic development in the future the runoff would mainly change with climate especially precipitation patterns in this region which should attract more attention on climate impact mitigation measures to reduce flood risks this paper provides an effective way of examining the long term impact of precipitation and land use change on runoff and the analysis can be applicable in other humid areas with rich datasets however it should be noted that this study does not consider the impact of other climate factor such as temperature and landscape configuration changes and water conservancy projects like the cascade reservoirs were also not considered which should be further investigated in the future for a comprehensive understanding of the climate and land use change impact on runoff variations credit authorship contribution statement jinghua zheng data curation formal analysis

phung et al 2021 yusuf and francisco 2009 mean temperature raised by 0 62 c annual average and precipitation decreased by 6 9 19 8 in this region monre 2016 tide level along the coast of the vmd has been projected to rise by 17 38 cm in the middle of the century by the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 triet et al 2020 at present many studies on climate change analyzed in vmd are well documented in literature for example dang et al 2020b studied the change in distributions of rainfall and its characteristics in coastal provinces of the vmd due to climate change and el niño southern oscillation enso conditions during a time period of 32 years 1984 2015 extreme rainfall events of the mekong delta were analyzed by lee and dang 2020 the change of precipitation and temperature in mekong delta was analyzed in past and future time scales using gcms models of both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios nguyen 2017 several studies analyzed climate change impacts in the past and future time scales on rice production dang et al 2020a jiang et al 2019 kontgis et al 2019 tuu et al 2020 drought loc et al 2020 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 sedimentation bussi et al 2021 chuenchum et al 2020 sediment and discharge khoi et al 2020 flood pham et al 2021 thanh et al 2019 triet et al 2020 runoff hoan et al 2020 hoang et al 2016 lee et al 2020 hydropower and irrigation hoang et al 2019 and water quality whitehead et al 2019 in the mekong region studies were conducted related to climate and land use change impacts on dam performance pokhrel et al 2018 and water resources sridhar et al 2019 in the mekong region the methods applied for hydrological simulation for prediction of future runoff involves the swat soil and water assessment tool model eastham et al 2008 hoanh et al 2010 le et al 2020b however most of the published studies on the land use in the mekong delta were limited to narrow range of land use types in local areas or over a period of short time past studies on climate change used a limited number of gcms data with change impact on a specific study such as rice production runoff sedimentation impact of dam construction etc however in this study we explored land use change for a longer period 2000 2018 with more in depth in land use classification specifically for agricultural land there is a surprising lack of even basic analysis ready data and tools in the public domain to support a shared understanding of the delta recent advances in earth observation data and analytic technologies can be extremely useful to address these challenges satellite remote sensing has been used in extensively in many past hydrological studies precipitation from satellite sensors have been compared favorably to raingage observations hashemi et al 2017 mondal et al 2018 and le et al 2018 soil moisture is now available at high spatial resolution as a result of various downscaling schemes using radar observations narayan et al 2006 narayan and lakshmi 2008 or visible and thermal observations fang et al 2013 2018a b 2019 2020 2021 satellite soil moisture has been also used in an assimilation mode kim et al 2021 and precipitation has been used as inputs le et al 2020 and finally numerous sources of satellite observations and model outputs have been used to close the water balance in global watersheds lakshmi et al 2018 kansara and lakshmi 2021 in this paper we aim to address the knowledge gaps in assessing the climate water and land of vmd objectives are i land use and land cover variation in the vmd during 19 years from 2000 to 2018 with additional analysis on two provinces in the northern vmd an giang and dong thap the most intensive agricultural rice farming systems in vmd ii historical climatic variability of precipitation land surface temperature and evapotranspiration over vmd iii the impact of projected climatic scenarios three for precipitation based and three for temperature based on streamflow in the mekong river basin using swat which is a semi distributed hydrological model the extreme climate is categorized in two ways namely precipitation very wet very dry and normal and temperature hot cold and normal after analyzing 16 gcms of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 this study investigated the corresponding changes in the streamflow for the vmd corresponding to these future climate conditions we expect our results will support a suitable direction to modify the existing policy to manage the changes in land use climate and water in the vmd 2 study area the vietnamese part of the mekong delta which has a population of about 20 million people is the region located in the far south of vietnam fig 1 the delta which accounts for about 12 of the total area of the country approximately forming a triangle of 3 9 million hectares extending from my tho in the east to chau doc and ha tien in the northwest in cau mau in the extreme southern tip of vietnam kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 the majority of the land area of the delta is flat excluding some isolated low mountains in the an giang and kien giang provinces close to the border with cambodia and the sand ridges of the coast of 5 8 m elevation elevation of more than half of the delta is less than 1 m above mean sea level the upper delta consists of two large flood plains and a smaller central floodplain 1 the greater long xuyen quadrangle is approximately 600 000 ha on the left bank of the hau river bassac 2 the plain of reeds is approximately 700 000 ha on the right bank of the tien river mekong and 3 a smaller central flood plain between the hau and tien rivers mard 2016 these three vast floodplain areas work as natural sponges by absorbing water in the flood seasons and release back water into the mainstream in the dry season the delta is divided into 13 provinces administratively with the city of can tho is generally considered as the center the mekong river is discharged into the east sea and into the gulf of thailand ho chi minh city is the significant gateway outside of the delta although high flows of the mekong river cause the flooding in the vam co passing through ho chi minh city the success of development of the delta thus far is ascribed to two important factors the annual natural supply of freshwater and nutrient laden sediments by the mekong river and the government s support for master planning for land use every year large amounts of sediments are transported downstream during floods into the mekong delta contributing to building of delta in addition the government s master planning efforts have mandated the regulation of the freshwater hydrology of the delta to facilitate multiple rice cropping each year 3 data and methodology the study focuses on developing a historical understanding of key land climate and water data parameters for the vietnam mekong delta primarily using earth observation and available global datasets it also explores some future scenarios namely on climate change using a version of the swat a public domain tool used to explore the interaction of land climate and water around the world fig 2 land climate and water have intricate linkages which play a key role in planning and management decisions fig 3 in the case of increased precipitation that may result in flooding dikes are required to keep the water out of the agricultural lands and or the land can be used for aquaculture if there is a rainfall deficit as predicted by some future climate scenarios there could be the use of groundwater until the groundwater starts to run out and delay in the planting of rice may be a strategy in the case of an increase in temperature a delay in planting the rice crop and or reverting the land to aquaculture would be a land use decision 3 1 data a range of sources to assemble a historical knowledge base of the mekong delta on the three aspects being studied land climate and water are summarized in table 1 many gcm products are available in the cmip5 archive and there are greater uncertainties regarding the future climate scenarios to avoid the uncertainties in selecting just one climate projection a broader range of future gcm climate projections can be obtained by selecting several possible future scenarios based on their precipitation and temperature projections namely very wet to very dry precipitation based and hot to cold temperature based this study compared monthly gcms models products to select illustrative future climate scenarios for the mekong river basin mrb the cmip5 gcms for the mrb are available from the world bank s climate change knowledge portal https climateknowledgeportal worldbank org watershed 178 climate data projections for example the study considered the maximum increment of annual average precipitation of the projected period 2061 2080 as compared to the base case 1986 2005 for all gcm models output to select the very wet climatic condition the minimum increment of annual average precipitation was obtained in the very dry climatic condition and the minimum difference of annual average precipitation between projected and base case was obtained in the normal climatic condition similarly hot cold and normal climatic conditions were selected based on temperature after comparing different gcm models products the study selected six gcms three for precipitation based and three for temperature based for extreme climate namely csiro mk3 6 0 very wet miroc esm chem very dry giss e2 r normal ipsl cm5a mr hot gfdl esm2m cold and miroc5 normal at the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 for the 20 years 2061 2080 the model details are indicated in table 2 before using the gcms in the water balance study bias correction method linear scaling is applied to correct the bias for adjusting all gcm model outputs using the observed data from 1986 to 2005 le et al 2018a lenderink et al 2007 teutschbein and seibert 2012 the time scale of climate data is considered as the base case 1986 2005 and projtion cases 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 3 2 land use land cover classification land cover was classified based on images of landsat thematic mapper 5 tm5 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and landsat 8 from nasa https earthdata nasa gov the mod09q1 version 6 product gives an estimation of the surface spectral reflectance of terra modis bands 1 and 2 which are corrected for atmospheric conditions such as aerosols gasses and rayleigh scattering vermote 2015 the data was produced to the spatial resolution of 250 m with an 8 day composite available period from 2000 to the present the surface spectral reflectance was used to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015 and 2018 and detected the land use changes at a high spatial resolution 30 m using multiple satellite sources land classification consists of two main procedures firstly land was classified into eight common categories water mangrove forest built up agriculture barren grassland wetland secondly three important land types forest agriculture water were reclassified in more detail such as forest was sub divided into the evergreen forest deciduous forest and mixed forest agriculture was sub divided into double rice crop single rice crop triple rice crop and other crops water was divided into aquaculture and other water the first order classification used 30 m landsat products using multiple images for each year to select the best cloud free image an unsupervised isodata classification leinenkugel et al 2014 was then performed for 50 classes and visual inspection was used to group those 50 classes into the eight common land use classes mentioned above the second order classification used modis ndvi at a spatial resolution of 250 m normal difference vegetation index ndvi computed from modis products provided auxiliary information which enabled the classification of land use in more detail it is based on the fact that the responses of different land use to ndvi are significantly different defries and eshleman 2004 defries and townshend 1994 for example evergreen forest usually has higher ndvi values around the year as compared to those values from a deciduous forest a single rice crop often has one peak ndvi in a year while double rice crop and triple rice crops observe two and three peaks ndvi in a year respectively spruce et al 2018 3 3 soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model the swat model is a semi distributed and physically based eco hydrological model that functions at various time steps i e daily monthly yearly for simulation of the streamflow water quality and sediment of large complex river basins arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 spatial data e g land use dem and soil and weather data precipitation minimum temperature maximum temperature as shown in table 1 corresponding to water parameter of the studied aspects column are required to set up the swat model to estimate water balance the swat model is also forced with future scenarios of climate change to explore the water balance change in the next decades the output of the swat model is stream discharge at outlet points chosen by the user 4 results and discussions 4 1 land use land cover changes over vmd for 19 years 2000 2018 fig 4 presents land use land cover change over the vmd for 19 years 2000 2018 and average precipitation over different land use categories in general the coastal areas have aquacultures whereas the interior is dominated by crop cultivation the land in the delta is also used for aquaculture and growing other crops mostly vegetables over the past twenty years there has been a move from double to triple rice crops while double rice crop and aquaculture are the top land use categories in the delta the area of triple rice crop has increased from 12 in 2000 to 19 in 2018 fig 4a b during this period again the area under double rice crop decreased from 34 to 27 with the area under aquaculture remaining roughly constant at around 25 there has also been a gradual decrease in the single rice crop area between the peak in 2003 10 to a low in 2018 6 however precipitation and temperature changes are limiting the viability of this growth pattern going forward already precipitation in the triple rice crop area has decreased significantly by 31 between 2000 and 2018 with the largest drop occurring between 2012 and 2015 21 this is similar to the overall trend of precipitation across all types of land cover which has generally decreased by 27 between 2000 and 2018 moreover we assess changes on agricultural lands for two upper north provinces of vietnam mekong delta an giang and dong thap roughly 85 of the land areas in these two provinces are for agricultural purposes contributing a large proportion of rice production for the vietnamese mekong delta in these two provinces from our land classification products the triple rice crop increases significantly over 2000 2018 fig 5a c in an giang the increase in the triple rice crop corresponds with the decrease in the double rice crop the area of triple rice doubled from 21 in 2006 to 50 in 2012 while the area of double rice halved from 71 to 42 in dong thap this transformation process is slower and shifted by several years the area of triple rice doubled from 12 in 2012 to 27 in 2015 the significant increase in the triple rice crop is likely due to national plans which invest in high dikes instead of low dike construction minh et al 2019 tran et al 2018 2019 the high dike is designed at a crest level of 0 5 m above the historical flood peak of the year 2000 thanh et al 2019 which mitigates the risk of annual flooding and enables intensive agriculture production on the other hand the low dike construction only keeps water free from the agricultural field in certain months in a year except for the high flooding season e g august and september we confirmed this fact as from our land classification product in high dike areas triple rice crops are greatly expanded the area of triple rice from 3 in 2000 to 78 in 2018 for an giang and from 9 in 2000 to 33 in 2018 for dong thap fig 5b d in recent years however there is a gradual increase in farmers growing crops other than rice between 2015 and 2018 the area used for other crops has increased from less than 1 to around 3 for an giang and less than 1 to around 6 for dong thap this is likely due in part to the historic drought in 2014 2016 le et al 2020a ngo et al 2020 which affected rice productivity and encouraged some farmers to adapt by growing other crops in addition some farmers have followed market signals for other crops or despite being covered by a very good canal network faced difficulties with the increased irrigation water requirements of a triple rice crop there is a great concern about the movement from double to three rice crops recent observations have found that the third crop in an giang has the lowest yield and maximum cost of production resulting in lower net profits for triple compared to double crop tran et al 2018 in dong thap to explore characteristics of high dikes and triple rice crop we also collected farmer interview data from four wards of hong ngu district dong thap province please see appendix 2 among these wards two wards are high dike areas and mainly cultivate triple rice crop while the other two are low dike areas with the dominance of double rice crops despite farmers in high dike areas being more satisfied with flood prevention transportation and agricultural safety farmer interviews found that water quality for irrigation in high dike areas was worse than in low dike areas farmers were asked to rank their level of satisfaction from 5 very dissatisfied to 0 very satisfied on average farmers living in high dike areas were satisfied with flood prevention transportation and safety in agricultural activities median score range of 1 43 1 98 while farmers in low dike areas were somewhat less satisfied median scores range from 1 91 to 2 65 however with respect to water quality for irrigation farmers living in the high dike areas were less satisfied median score of 3 0 than those living in low dike areas median score of 2 4 old high dike areas with more than 10 years in dike operation received the lowest score for water quality 4 2 historical climate assessment over vietnamese mekong delta in this section the seasonal climate variables precipitation land surface temperature and evapotranspiration were estimated by averaging corresponding months of the particular season four seasons selected are winter december february spring march may summer june august and autumn september november the trend pattern was compared with the results of significant level p value and the spatial distribution of change patterns was estimated using the linear regression method mondal and lakshmi 2021 4 2 1 precipitation the present study was to analyze the distribution of precipitation variability and linear trend pattern monthly and seasonal time scale using monthly high resolution chirps data from 1981 to 2018 38 years in the vmd the maximum precipitation was observed from may to october summer and fall seasons while the minimum precipitation from december to february winter season in the vmd fig 6 in the winter season december january and february the rainfall was less than about 2 mm day for most of the vmd we can also observe that the entire region shows an almost constant distribution of rainfall of around 1 2 mm day in the spring the rainfall continually increases between march to may from about 1 mm day to greater than 5 mm day the peak rainfall is seen in the southwestern corner of the vmd examining the mean of the spring precipitation we observe that the maximum precipitation occurs in the western coast of the vmd adjoining the gulf of thailand summer is the peak of precipitation june july august and ranges from 5 mm day to 12 mm day the peak rainfall occurs in september but the fall season september october and november follows the summer as the second highest seasonal average precipitation the rainfall in september peaks at around 15 mm day most of the precipitation occurred due to the influence of the south and southwest summer monsoon sengupta and nigam 2019 the decreasing trend was witnessed in the summer season june and august for the entire vmd except for the north central part in june as well as in the fall season in september in the eastern corner of the vmd the decreasing trend is most evident in the month of august where it peaks at around 0 004 to 0 006 mm month year the decreasing trend of precipitation of these three months june august and september could play crucial role in annual precipitation in the vmd because these three months observed high precipitation more than 6 mm day wu et al 2016 observed the decreasing trend of precipitation in a part of the mekong river basin from 1960 to 2009 tropical cyclones associated rainfall indicated decline after analyzing the data from 1983 to 2016 in the mekong river basin chen et al 2019 a decreasing trend was partly observed in the southern part in march southwest part in may and southeast part in september of the study area a low increasing trend was observed in the central part of the study area from march to july fig 7 the largest increasing trend was observed for the winter season december january and february where the rates of increase were higher than 0 1 mm month year for most of the vmd this increasing trend was also seen in the eastern portion of vmd for march a significant level p 0 05 of precipitation was observed in the vmd in january february july august and december appendix 3 of these the months with large precipitation are july and august and we see significance p 0 05 for the southern and eastern portion of the vmd the results for the decrease in precipitation hold good for the month of august that shows a decreasing trend in precipitation between 0 04 and 0 06 mm month year 4 2 2 land surface temperature lst surface temperature is one of the key variables in weather and climate forecasting hence analysis of its behavior is essential for the assessment of variability in climate that can vary spatially as well as temporally at different scales like local regional and global the changes in temperature affect people as well as agriculture and the availability of water the international panel on climate change ipcc has observed that global temperature trends indicate a warming of 0 85 0 65 1 06 c during the period 1880 2012 besides each of the last three decades has been sequentially warmer than any previous decade since 1850 ipcc 2014 with this consequence spatial satellite based land surface temperature lst data can be a better option for studies the present study investigated the spatial distribution and change pattern of lst day and nighttime in monthly and seasonal time scales using modis data from 2000 to 2018 19 years in the vmd the spatial distribution of lst in day and nighttime was shown in fig 8a and fig 8b the distribution of daytime lst observed in winter spring summer and fall were below 29 c above 29 c 28 30 c and below 30 c respectively the range of nighttime lst varied in winter from 21 to 25 c while in the other three seasons spring summer and fall from 22 to 26 c and above the spatial distribution of the daytime lst is relatively homogeneous in the winter months and greater spatial variability is seen in the other time periods of the year in particular the warming associated with the spring march may shows warm areas of daytime lst in the northwest and the southeast portions of vmd that are greater than 34 c in the nighttime lst we observe that there is a warm area in the southern tip of the vmd peninsula between april and august of 26 c or greater this warm feature exists in all months with different magnitude the northern portion of the vmd shows a two degree cooler temperature than this portion for all of the months the distribution of linear trend of lst in day and nighttime was shown in fig 9a b the decreasing trend of day lst is observed from january to april months in different parts of the study area and the increasing trend is found in most of the areas from may to december the month with the most prevalent cooling in daytime lst trend is february followed by april and march and in some locations we see cooling trends of almost 0 15 c year in the other months exception of january to april we see a warming trend in the order of 0 05 0 15 c year portions of the vmd for these months have linear trends that exceed 0 15 c year in particular the northernmost area of vmd shows a very large warming in september few patches of decreasing trend of nighttime lst are observed from september to january and most of the areas showed an increasing trend in all months we observe that for the same portion of daytime lst that showed an increase in september northern region there is a decrease in lst on the order of 0 15 c year the positive increasing trend is observed in daytime and nighttime temperature in the month of may june and august in the west south and east parts of the vmd the decreasing trend is observerd in febuary march and april in daytime temperature while increasing trend is found in nighttime temperature the air temperature showed a significant increasing trend in all land use types with an average increasing rate of 0 23 c decade in the mekong river basin from 1981 to 1012 hu and mo 2021 the significance level of both lst in different months is listed in appendix 4 few scatter patches showed a significance level p 0 10 while most of the study area showed the non significant status in both types of lst for the daytime lst we observe the largest area of significance in the month of february and the least in december and july for the nighttime lst the largest area of significance are june and july and the least areas of significance occur in the month of october 4 2 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et is a key variable in the efficient management of water resources and agriculture in addition et is also a major component of the hydrological cycle aside from the runoff and rainfall it is associated with the vegetation soil and atmosphere interface a shortage in the global water resources impacts production in agriculture therefore a reliable et estimation is necessary for the improvement of water use efficiency instrument based traditional methods are sometimes difficult for implementation and are expensive and do not estimate over large areas recently the et has been estimated over large areas using remote sensing methods on the basis of energy balance from satellite sensors cammalleri et al 2014 kundu et al 2018 several researchers have used an energy balance methodology to calculate the net radiation soil heat flux and sensible heat flux that can be used for the estimation of actual et allen et al 2007 in fig 10 the spatial distribution of et was illustrated on the monthly and seasonal scales during march and april most of the areas showed less 60 mm month et while other months observed high et 60 mm month in the south part of the vmd low 60 mm month et was found in february and may few areas of high 60 mm month et were observed in january february may and june the highest amount of et was seen in the center portion of vmd in the month of january at about 100 mm month march and april exhibited the least et of about 40 60 mm month summer and fall showed much greater spatial uniformity in the et as compared to spring and winter the maps of et showed linear features in the northeastern portion of the vmd and these corresponded to high irrigated rice crop areas the spatial distribution of the linear trend of monthly et is shown in fig 11 the decreasing trend of et was found in may and july september to december while a high rate 3 mm year of the increasing trend was observed from december to april examining the spatial distribution of the trend we see that summer and fall showed more spatial uniformity as compared to winter and spring the months of may and october showed large areas of decreasing et trend ranging to about 2 3 mm year the months of february march and april showed large areas with a positive trend of et of almost 3 mm month the level of significance of et in different months is illustrated in appendix 5 the trend in non significant level p 0 10 was found in most of the areas in all months except during february to april the months with the least number of areas under significant were the fall months of september october and november 4 3 impact of climate change on streamflow into the vmd the entire mekong river basin mrb covering an area of about 800 000 km2 is divided into 53 sub basins for estimating the impact of climate change on streamflow using the swat model change of streamflow from the upstream mekong river basin due to climate change would have a profound impact on the downstream region the vmd for this initial climate change impact analysis the csiromk3 6 0 global circulation model gcm in the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 high emission scenario is used in this study these are one of the representative models and scenarios in cmip5 and also listed on the world bank climate atlas the calibration of the swat model was done followed by validation of the model using three stream gages in the mrb namely chiang saen luang prabang and khong chiam using 25 years 1970 1994 of observed monthly streamflow measurements at three locations this is a standard method to validate a model and determine that it is effective in the simulation of other periods where the streamflow observations are not available in our case the future climate simulations the model performance is evaluated by the correlation coefficient r value using observed and simulated data of monthly streamflow 25 years of observations in three different locations which are located in the central and southern parts of the mrb these comparisons are shown in fig 12a for the locations of chiang saen luang prabang and khong chiam three locations respectively the computed correlation coefficients are 0 701 0 714 and 0 655 respectively for the three locations projected streamflow using climate change scenarios is shown in fig 12a the study compared the base 1986 2005 simulated monthly streamflow with the simulations from the climate change scenarios from the csiromk3 6 0 global circulation model rcp 8 5 high emission scenario for the periods 2021 2040 2041 2060 2061 2080 and 2081 2100 in all the simulated cases there are some common observations firstly the peak streamflow for the base case occurs during september whereas for all the other cases the peak occurs during the month of august this is a significant result as it has implications for the agriculture sector with regards to crop planting and irrigation this may require changes in crop planting and harvesting schedule secondly the total annual streamflow area under the curve is greater for all the climate change cases as compared to the base case this implies that streamflow increases with climate change for all the 20 year time periods in the 2021 2100 time period corresponding to csiro mk3 6 0 cmip5 model rcp85 this would imply in general a greater availability of water throughout the year and thereby decrease the dependence on other sources for irrigation for example groundwater thirdly this additional streamflow occurs earlier in the year and for the later climate change scenarios 2081 2100 is greater than 2061 2080 for example the streamflow in june prior to peak streamflow is the largest for the 2081 2100 time period as compared to the other cases with the lowest being the base case 1986 2005 this increased streamflow is for the time april september for all the climate change periods compared to the base case fourthly the streamflow after the peak declines in a similar manner for the base case and all the climate change cases the increased availability of streamflow earlier in the year as compared to the base case is for the time period april to september this would imply some changes in agricultural management such as earlier sowing of the seeds or changes in rotation in the future as discussed in the previous statements in this paragraph the projected 2061 2080 climate scenarios at high emission scenario rcp8 5 are selected from the cmip5 gcms categorized in two ways namely precipitation very wet very dry and normal and temperature hot cold and normal table 2 to examine the impact of the extreme climatic condition on streamflow in the mekong river basin mrb these six gcms three precipitation based and three temperature based were used for this study for the 20 years 2061 2080 using the swat model fig 12b on examining all the simulated cases using extreme climate conditions there are some distinct patterns firstly the peak streamflow for the gfdl esm2m occurs during august whereas in all the other cases the peak occurs during the month of september secondly in extreme climates such as a very wet condition the streamflow of csiro mk3 6 0 is greater whereas streamflow of miroc esm chem is lower in a very dry condition as compared to other extreme climate conditions thirdly in hot climate conditions the streamflow of ipsl cm5a mr is lower whereas in cold climate condition the streamflow of gfdl esm2m is higher fourthly streamflow gradually increases during april september and declines after the peak in a similar manner during september march for all projected climate scenarios and the base cases the change in percentage of projected climate variables annual precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and simulated projected streamflow as compared to the base case 1986 2005 using six extreme climatic conditions are shown in table 3 the csiro mk3 6 0 very wet condition shows an increase in the streamflow 38 41 precipitation 27 94 maximum temperature 6 30 and minimum temperature 16 86 the miroc esm chem very dry condition shows a decrease in the streamflow 23 84 and precipitation 12 19 while maximum and minimum temperature show increases 6 99 and 20 99 respectively in the normal climate condition based on precipitation the giss e2 r shows an increase in the streamflow 5 13 precipitation 20 47 and minimum temperature 13 34 while maximum temperature decreases 0 49 the ipsl cm5a mr hot condition shows a decrease in the streamflow 23 32 precipitation 10 69 and minimum temperature 5 82 while maximum temperature increases 18 62 in the cold climate condition gfdl esm2m streamflow precipitation and minimum temperature increase 14 20 10 46 and 9 06 respectively while maximum temperature decreases 2 99 5 conclusions vigorous planning and management of the mekong delta requires a long term strategic integrated perspective that is based on a strong shared understanding of the history status and future projections on the three key interlinked themes of land climate and water from this study our results can be summarized as follows i for the entire vmd the area of triple rice crop has increased while single and double rice crops have decreased with the area under aquaculture remaining roughly constant from 2000 to 2018 the increasing trend in triple rice crop is significant in two northern portions provinces an giang and dong thap in 2018 55 and 31 of agricultural lands are triple rice crop for an giang and for dong thap respectively while these figures in 2000 are only 7 and 3 respectively ii this study raises a concern on the expansion of triple rice crop that maybe not a sustainable development because 1 climatic condition is unfavorable as precipitation in the triple rice crop area has decreased 31 significantly from 2000 to 2018 2 previous studies also exhibited that drought trends in vmd are increasing le et al 2020a 3 in the future the number of drought months in the delta is projected to intensify between 2020 and 2099 compared to the period from 1986 to 20059 see appendix 6 4 by analyzing farmer interview in hong ngu district of dong thap province we did not find significant economic benefits but water quality problem in the areas growing triple rice crop iii there is a large demand for water in rice and other agriculture in the winter that cannot be satisfied by precipitation alone august and therefore is likely to increase the withdrawal of groundwater the assessment of land surface temperature and evapotranspiration indicates these datasets are well alignment with the delta s characteristics and are necessary ancillary datasets for water resources planning iv from the extreme climate study the csiro mk3 6 0 very wet condition shows the maximum increased streamflow 38 41 while the miroc esm chem very dry condition shows the minimum decrease in the streamflow 23 84 this work is expected to help the government at different levels to make decisions relating to cropping water infrastructure and other land use to help in the land use management and decision making the study proposes the use of historical publicly available earth observation data and publicly available models credit authorship contribution

7896,study region the vietnamese mekong delta vmd is located in vietnam study focus the vietnamese mekong delta vmd region has one of the leading productions of rice in the world and it stands at the intersection of extreme anthropogenic activity and climate change to this end the major focus of this study is to explore the changes in land use climate water resources and their inter relationship which are intended to showcase the ability of publicly available earth observations and models in improving understanding of the past changes and future scenarios and contribute to improved decision making we analyzed the change of agricultural crops single double and triple and climatic parameters precipitation and land surface temperature and evapotranspiration consequently we used soil and water assessment tool model swat and selected six gcms for extreme climate to investigate the change of streamflow new hydrological insights our results indicated that double rice crop and aquaculture are the top two land use categories in the vmd the areas of triple rice crop have increased significantly especially for the an giang and dong thap provinces however by examining the climate water and land data analytics we see challenges in the expansion of triple rice crop over vmd the spatio temporal changes in climate variables and future streamflow projections provide strong evidence to water

assessment tool model eastham et al 2008 hoanh et al 2010 le et al 2020b however most of the published studies on the land use in the mekong delta were limited to narrow range of land use types in local areas or over a period of short time past studies on climate change used a limited number of gcms data with change impact on a specific study such as rice production runoff sedimentation impact of dam construction etc however in this study we explored land use change for a longer period 2000 2018 with more in depth in land use classification specifically for agricultural land there is a surprising lack of even basic analysis ready data and tools in the public domain to support a shared understanding of the delta recent advances in earth observation data and analytic technologies can be extremely useful to address these challenges satellite remote sensing has been used in extensively in many past hydrological studies precipitation from satellite sensors have been compared

watersheds lakshmi et al 2018 kansara and lakshmi 2021 in this paper we aim to address the knowledge gaps in assessing the climate water and land of vmd objectives are i land use and land cover variation in the vmd during 19 years from 2000 to 2018 with additional analysis on two provinces in the northern vmd an giang and dong thap the most intensive agricultural rice farming systems in vmd ii historical climatic variability of precipitation land surface temperature and evapotranspiration over vmd iii the impact of projected climatic scenarios three for precipitation based and three for temperature based on streamflow in the mekong river basin using swat which is a semi distributed hydrological model the extreme climate is categorized in two ways namely precipitation very wet very dry and normal and temperature hot cold and normal after analyzing 16 gcms of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 this study investigated the corresponding changes in the streamflow for the vmd corresponding to these future climate conditions we expect our results will support a suitable direction to modify the existing policy to manage the changes in land use climate and water in the vmd 2 study area the vietnamese part of the mekong delta which has a population of about 20 million people is the region located in the far south of vietnam fig 1 the delta which accounts for about 12 of the total area of the country approximately forming a triangle of 3 9 million hectares extending from my tho in the east to chau doc and ha tien in the northwest in cau mau in the extreme southern tip of vietnam kingdom of the netherlands and the socialist republic of vietnam 2013 the majority of the land area of the delta is flat excluding some isolated low mountains in the an giang and kien giang provinces close to the border with cambodia and the sand ridges of the coast of 5 8 m elevation elevation of more than half of the delta is less than 1 m above mean sea level the upper delta consists of two large flood plains and a smaller central floodplain 1 the greater long xuyen quadrangle is approximately 600 000 ha on the left bank of the hau river bassac 2 the plain of reeds is approximately 700 000 ha on the right bank of the tien river mekong and 3 a smaller central flood plain between the hau and tien rivers mard 2016 these three vast floodplain areas work as natural sponges by absorbing water in the flood seasons and release back water into the mainstream in the dry season the delta is divided into 13 provinces administratively with the city of can tho is generally considered as the center the mekong river is discharged into the east sea and into the gulf of thailand ho chi minh city is the significant gateway outside of the delta although high flows of the mekong river cause the flooding in the vam co passing through ho chi minh city the success of development of the delta thus far is ascribed to two important factors the annual natural supply of freshwater and nutrient laden sediments by the mekong river and the government s support for master planning for land use every year large amounts of sediments are transported downstream during floods into the mekong delta contributing to building of delta in addition the government s master planning efforts have mandated the regulation of the freshwater hydrology of the delta to facilitate multiple rice cropping each year 3 data and methodology the study focuses on developing a historical understanding of key land climate and water data parameters for the vietnam mekong delta primarily using earth observation and available global datasets it also explores some future scenarios namely on climate change using a version of the swat a public domain tool used to explore the interaction of land climate and water around the world fig 2 land climate and water have intricate linkages which play a key role in planning and management decisions fig 3 in the case of increased precipitation that may result in flooding dikes are required to keep the water out of the agricultural lands and or the land can be used for aquaculture if there is a rainfall deficit as predicted by some future climate scenarios there could be the use of groundwater until the groundwater starts to run out and delay in the planting of rice may be a strategy in the case of an increase in temperature a delay in planting the rice crop and or reverting the land to aquaculture would be a land use decision 3 1 data a range of sources to assemble a historical knowledge base of the mekong delta on the three aspects being studied land climate and water are summarized in table 1 many gcm products are available in the cmip5 archive and there are greater uncertainties regarding the future climate scenarios to avoid the uncertainties in selecting just one climate projection a broader range of future gcm climate projections can be obtained by selecting several possible future scenarios based on their precipitation and temperature projections namely very wet to very dry precipitation based and hot to cold temperature based this study compared monthly gcms models products to select illustrative future climate scenarios for the mekong river basin mrb the cmip5 gcms for the mrb are available from the world bank s climate change knowledge portal https climateknowledgeportal worldbank org watershed 178 climate data projections for example the study considered the maximum increment of annual average precipitation of the projected period 2061 2080 as compared to the base case 1986 2005 for all gcm models output to select the very wet climatic condition the minimum increment of annual average precipitation was obtained in the very dry climatic condition and the minimum difference of annual average precipitation between projected and base case was obtained in the normal climatic condition similarly hot cold and normal climatic conditions were selected based on temperature after comparing different gcm models products the study selected six gcms three for precipitation based and three for temperature based for extreme climate namely csiro mk3 6 0 very wet miroc esm chem very dry giss e2 r normal ipsl cm5a mr hot gfdl esm2m cold and miroc5 normal at the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 for the 20 years 2061 2080 the model details are indicated in table 2 before using the gcms in the water balance study bias correction method linear scaling is applied to correct the bias for adjusting all gcm model outputs using the observed data from 1986 to 2005 le et al 2018a lenderink et al 2007 teutschbein and seibert 2012 the time scale of climate data is considered as the base case 1986 2005 and projtion cases 2020 2039 2040 2059 2060 2079 and 2080 2099 3 2 land use land cover classification land cover was classified based on images of landsat thematic mapper 5 tm5 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and landsat 8 from nasa https earthdata nasa gov the mod09q1 version 6 product gives an estimation of the surface spectral reflectance of terra modis bands 1 and 2 which are corrected for atmospheric conditions such as aerosols gasses and rayleigh scattering vermote 2015 the data was produced to the spatial resolution of 250 m with an 8 day composite available period from 2000 to the present the surface spectral reflectance was used to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015 and 2018 and detected the land use changes at a high spatial resolution 30 m using multiple satellite sources land classification consists of two main procedures firstly land was classified into eight common categories water mangrove forest built up agriculture barren grassland wetland secondly three important land types forest agriculture water were reclassified in more detail such as forest was sub divided into the evergreen forest deciduous forest and mixed forest agriculture was sub divided into double rice crop single rice crop triple rice crop and other crops water was divided into aquaculture and other water the first order classification used 30 m landsat products using multiple images for each year to select the best cloud free image an unsupervised isodata classification leinenkugel et al 2014 was then performed for 50 classes and visual inspection was used to group those 50 classes into the eight common land use classes mentioned above the second order classification used modis ndvi at a spatial resolution of 250 m normal difference vegetation index ndvi computed from modis products provided auxiliary information which enabled the classification of land use in more detail it is based on the fact that the responses of different land use to ndvi are significantly different defries and eshleman 2004 defries and townshend 1994 for example evergreen forest usually has higher ndvi values around the year as compared to those values from a deciduous forest a single rice crop often has one peak ndvi in a year while double rice crop and triple rice crops observe two and three peaks ndvi in a year respectively spruce et al 2018 3 3 soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model the swat model is a semi distributed and physically based eco hydrological model that functions at various time steps i e daily monthly yearly for simulation of the streamflow water quality and sediment of large complex river basins arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 spatial data e g land use dem and soil and weather data precipitation minimum temperature maximum temperature as shown in table 1 corresponding to water parameter of the studied aspects column are required to set up the swat model to estimate water balance the swat model is also forced with future scenarios of climate change to explore the water balance change in the next decades the output of the swat model is stream discharge at outlet points chosen by the user 4 results and discussions 4 1 land use land cover changes over vmd for 19 years 2000 2018 fig 4 presents land use land cover change over the vmd for 19 years 2000 2018 and average precipitation over different land use categories in general the coastal areas have aquacultures whereas the interior is dominated by crop cultivation the land in the delta is also used for aquaculture and growing other crops mostly vegetables over the past twenty years there has been a move from double to triple rice crops while double rice crop and aquaculture are the top land use categories in the delta the area of triple rice crop has increased from 12 in 2000 to 19 in 2018 fig 4a b during this period again the area under double rice crop decreased from 34 to 27 with the area under aquaculture remaining roughly constant at around 25 there has also been a gradual decrease in the single rice crop area between the peak in 2003 10 to a low in 2018 6 however precipitation and temperature changes are limiting the viability of this growth pattern going forward already precipitation in the triple rice crop area has decreased significantly by 31 between 2000 and 2018 with the largest drop occurring between 2012 and 2015 21 this is similar to the overall trend of precipitation across all types of land cover which has generally decreased by 27 between 2000 and 2018 moreover we assess changes on agricultural lands for two upper north provinces of vietnam mekong delta an giang and dong thap roughly 85 of the land areas in these two provinces are for agricultural purposes contributing a large proportion of rice production for the vietnamese mekong delta in these two provinces from our land classification products the triple rice crop increases significantly over 2000 2018 fig 5a c in an giang the increase in the triple rice crop corresponds with the decrease in the double rice crop the area of triple rice doubled from 21 in 2006 to 50 in 2012 while the area of double rice halved from 71 to 42 in dong thap this transformation process is slower and shifted by several years the area of triple rice doubled from 12 in 2012 to 27 in 2015 the significant increase in the triple rice crop is likely due to national plans which invest in high dikes instead of low dike construction minh et al 2019 tran et al 2018 2019 the high dike is designed at a crest level of 0 5 m above the historical flood peak of the year 2000 thanh et al 2019 which mitigates the risk of annual flooding and enables intensive agriculture production on the other hand the low dike construction only keeps water free from the agricultural field in certain months in a year except for the high flooding season e g august and september we confirmed this fact as from our land classification product in high dike areas triple rice crops are greatly expanded the area of triple rice from 3 in 2000 to 78 in 2018 for an giang and from 9 in 2000 to 33 in 2018 for dong thap fig 5b d in recent years however there is a gradual increase in farmers growing crops other than rice between 2015 and 2018 the area used for other crops has increased from less than 1 to around 3 for an giang and less than 1 to around 6 for dong thap this is likely due in part to the historic drought in 2014 2016 le et al 2020a ngo et al 2020 which affected rice productivity and encouraged some farmers to adapt by growing other crops in addition some farmers have followed market signals for other crops or despite being covered by a very good canal network faced difficulties with the increased irrigation water requirements of a triple rice crop there is a great concern about the movement from double to three rice crops recent observations have found that the third crop in an giang has the lowest yield and maximum cost of production resulting in lower net profits for triple compared to double crop tran et al 2018 in dong thap to explore characteristics of high dikes and triple rice crop we also collected farmer interview data from four wards of hong ngu district dong thap province please see appendix 2 among these wards two wards are high dike areas and mainly cultivate triple rice crop while the other two are low dike areas with the dominance of double rice crops despite farmers in high dike areas being more satisfied with flood prevention transportation and agricultural safety farmer interviews found that water quality for irrigation in high dike areas was worse than in low dike areas farmers were asked to rank their level of satisfaction from 5 very dissatisfied to 0 very satisfied on average farmers living in high dike areas were satisfied with flood prevention transportation and safety in agricultural activities median score range of 1 43 1 98 while farmers in low dike areas were somewhat less satisfied median scores range from 1 91 to 2 65 however with respect to water quality for irrigation farmers living in the high dike areas were less satisfied median score of 3 0 than those living in low dike areas median score of 2 4 old high dike areas with more than 10 years in dike operation received the lowest score for water quality 4 2 historical climate assessment over vietnamese mekong delta in this section the seasonal climate variables precipitation land surface temperature and evapotranspiration were estimated by averaging corresponding months of the particular season four seasons selected are winter december february spring march may summer june august and autumn september november the trend pattern was compared with the results of significant level p value and the spatial distribution of change patterns was estimated using the linear regression method mondal and lakshmi 2021 4 2 1 precipitation the present study was to analyze the distribution of precipitation variability and linear trend pattern monthly and seasonal time scale using monthly high resolution chirps data from 1981 to 2018 38 years in the vmd the maximum precipitation was observed from may to october summer and fall seasons while the minimum precipitation from december to february winter season in the vmd fig 6 in the winter season december january and february the rainfall was less than about 2 mm day for most of the vmd we can also observe that the entire region shows an almost constant distribution of rainfall of around 1 2 mm day in the spring the rainfall continually increases between march to may from about 1 mm day to greater than 5 mm day the peak rainfall is seen in the southwestern corner of the vmd examining the mean of the spring precipitation we observe that the maximum precipitation occurs in the western coast of the vmd adjoining the gulf of thailand summer is the peak of precipitation june july august and ranges from 5 mm day to 12 mm day the peak rainfall occurs in september but the fall season september october and november follows the summer as the second highest seasonal average precipitation the rainfall in september peaks at around 15 mm day most of the precipitation occurred due to the influence of the south and southwest summer monsoon sengupta and nigam 2019 the decreasing trend was witnessed in the summer season june and august for the entire vmd except for the north central part in june as well as in the fall season in september in the eastern corner of the vmd the decreasing trend is most evident in the month of august where it peaks at around 0 004 to 0 006 mm month year the decreasing trend of precipitation of these three months june august and september could play crucial role in annual precipitation in the vmd because these three months observed high precipitation more than 6 mm day wu et al 2016 observed the decreasing trend of precipitation in a part of the mekong river basin from 1960 to 2009 tropical cyclones associated rainfall indicated decline after analyzing the data from 1983 to 2016 in the mekong river basin chen et al 2019 a decreasing trend was partly observed in the southern part in march southwest part in may and southeast part in september of the study area a low increasing trend was observed in the central part of the study area from march to july fig 7 the largest increasing trend was observed for the winter season december january and february where the rates of increase were higher than 0 1 mm month year for most of the vmd this increasing trend was also seen in the eastern portion of vmd for march a significant level p 0 05 of precipitation was observed in the vmd in january february july august and december appendix 3 of these the months with large precipitation are july and august and we see significance p 0 05 for the southern and eastern portion of the vmd the results for the decrease in precipitation hold good for the month of august that shows a decreasing trend in precipitation between 0 04 and 0 06 mm month year 4 2 2 land surface temperature lst surface temperature is one of the key variables in weather and climate forecasting hence analysis of its behavior is essential for the assessment of variability in climate that can vary spatially as well as temporally at different scales like local regional and global the changes in temperature affect people as well as agriculture and the availability of water the international panel on climate change ipcc has observed that global temperature trends indicate a warming of 0 85 0 65 1 06 c during the period 1880 2012 besides each of the last three decades has been sequentially warmer than any previous decade since 1850 ipcc 2014 with this consequence spatial satellite based land surface temperature lst data can be a better option for studies the present study investigated the spatial distribution and change pattern of lst day and nighttime in monthly and seasonal time scales using modis data from 2000 to 2018 19 years in the vmd the spatial distribution of lst in day and nighttime was shown in fig 8a and fig 8b the distribution of daytime lst observed in winter spring summer and fall were below 29 c above 29 c 28 30 c and below 30 c respectively the range of nighttime lst varied in winter from 21 to 25 c while in the other three seasons spring summer and fall from 22 to 26 c and above the spatial distribution of the daytime lst is relatively homogeneous in the winter months and greater spatial variability is seen in the other time periods of the year in particular the warming associated with the spring march may shows warm areas of daytime lst in the northwest and the southeast portions of vmd that are greater than 34 c in the nighttime lst we observe that there is a warm area in the southern tip of the vmd peninsula between april and august of 26 c or greater this warm feature exists in all months with different magnitude the northern portion of the vmd shows a two degree cooler temperature than this portion for all of the months the distribution of linear trend of lst in day and nighttime was shown in fig 9a b the decreasing trend of day lst is observed from january to april months in different parts of the study area and the increasing trend is found in most of the areas from may to december the month with the most prevalent cooling in daytime lst trend is february followed by april and march and in some locations we see cooling trends of almost 0 15 c year in the other months exception of january to april we see a warming trend in the order of 0 05 0 15 c year portions of the vmd for these months have linear trends that exceed 0 15 c year in particular the northernmost area of vmd shows a very large warming in september few patches of decreasing trend of nighttime lst are observed from september to january and most of the areas showed an increasing trend in all months we observe that for the same portion of daytime lst that showed an increase in september northern region there is a decrease in lst on the order of 0 15 c year the positive increasing trend is observed in daytime and nighttime temperature in the month of may june and august in the west south and east parts of the vmd the decreasing trend is observerd in febuary march and april in daytime temperature while increasing trend is found in nighttime temperature the air temperature showed a significant increasing trend in all land use types with an average increasing rate of 0 23 c decade in the mekong river basin from 1981 to 1012 hu and mo 2021 the significance level of both lst in different months is listed in appendix 4 few scatter patches showed a significance level p 0 10 while most of the study area showed the non significant status in both types of lst for the daytime lst we observe the largest area of significance in the month of february and the least in december and july for the nighttime lst the largest area of significance are june and july and the least areas of significance occur in the month of october 4 2 3 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et is a key variable in the efficient management of water resources and agriculture in addition et is also a major component of the hydrological cycle aside from the runoff and rainfall it is associated with the vegetation soil and atmosphere interface a shortage in the global water resources impacts production in agriculture therefore a reliable et estimation is necessary for the improvement of water use efficiency instrument based traditional methods are sometimes difficult for implementation and are expensive and do not estimate over large areas recently the et has been estimated over large areas using remote sensing methods on the basis of energy balance from satellite sensors cammalleri et al 2014 kundu et al 2018 several researchers have used an energy balance methodology to calculate the net radiation soil heat flux and sensible heat flux that can be used for the estimation of actual et allen et al 2007 in fig 10 the spatial distribution of et was illustrated on the monthly and seasonal scales during march and april most of the areas showed less 60 mm month et while other months observed high et 60 mm month in the south part of the vmd low 60 mm month et was found in february and may few areas of high 60 mm month et were observed in january february may and june the highest amount of et was seen in the center portion of vmd in the month of january at about 100 mm month march and april exhibited the least et of about 40 60 mm month summer and fall showed much greater spatial uniformity in the et as compared to spring and winter the maps of et showed linear features in the northeastern portion of the vmd and these corresponded to high irrigated rice crop areas the spatial distribution of the linear trend of monthly et is shown in fig 11 the decreasing trend of et was found in may and july september to december while a high rate 3 mm year of the increasing trend was observed from december to april examining the spatial distribution of the trend we see that summer and fall showed more spatial uniformity as compared to winter and spring the months of may and october showed large areas of decreasing et trend ranging to about 2 3 mm year the months of february march and april showed large areas with a positive trend of et of almost 3 mm month the level of significance of et in different months is illustrated in appendix 5 the trend in non significant level p 0 10 was found in most of the areas in all months except during february to april the months with the least number of areas under significant were the fall months of september october and november 4 3 impact of climate change on streamflow into the vmd the entire mekong river basin mrb covering an area of about 800 000 km2 is divided into 53 sub basins for estimating the impact of climate change on streamflow using the swat model change of streamflow from the upstream mekong river basin due to climate change would have a profound impact on the downstream region the vmd for this initial climate change impact analysis the csiromk3 6 0 global circulation model gcm in the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 high emission scenario is used in this study these are one of the representative models and scenarios in cmip5 and also listed on the world bank climate atlas the calibration of the swat model was done followed by validation of the model using three stream gages in the mrb namely chiang saen luang prabang and khong chiam using 25 years 1970 1994 of observed monthly streamflow measurements at three locations this is a standard method to validate a model and determine that it is effective in the simulation of other periods where the streamflow observations are not available in our case the future climate simulations the model performance is evaluated by the correlation coefficient r value using observed and simulated data of monthly streamflow 25 years of observations in three different locations which are located in the central and southern parts of the mrb these comparisons are shown in fig 12a for the locations of chiang saen luang prabang and khong chiam three locations respectively the computed correlation coefficients are 0 701 0 714 and 0 655 respectively for the three locations projected streamflow using climate change scenarios is shown in fig 12a the study compared the base 1986 2005 simulated monthly streamflow with the simulations from the climate change scenarios from the csiromk3 6 0 global circulation model rcp 8 5 high emission scenario for the periods 2021 2040 2041 2060 2061 2080 and 2081 2100 in all the simulated cases there are some common observations firstly the peak streamflow for the base case occurs during september whereas for all the other cases the peak occurs during the month of august this is a significant result as it has implications for the agriculture sector with regards to crop planting and irrigation this may require changes in crop planting and harvesting schedule secondly the total annual streamflow area under the curve is greater for all the climate change cases as compared to the base case this implies that streamflow increases with climate change for all the 20 year time periods in the 2021 2100 time period corresponding to csiro mk3 6 0 cmip5 model rcp85 this would imply in general a greater availability of water throughout the year and thereby decrease the dependence on other sources for irrigation for example groundwater thirdly this additional streamflow occurs earlier in the year and for the later climate change scenarios 2081 2100 is greater than 2061 2080 for example the streamflow in june prior to peak streamflow is the largest for the 2081 2100 time period as compared to the other cases with the lowest being the base case 1986 2005 this increased streamflow is for the time april september for all the climate change periods compared to the base case fourthly the streamflow after the peak declines in a similar manner for the base case and all the climate change cases the increased availability of streamflow earlier in the year as compared to the base case is for the time period april to september this would imply some changes in agricultural management such as earlier sowing of the seeds or changes in rotation in the future as discussed in the previous statements in this paragraph the projected 2061 2080 climate scenarios at high emission scenario rcp8 5 are selected from the cmip5 gcms categorized in two ways namely precipitation very wet very dry and normal and temperature hot cold and normal table 2 to examine the impact of the extreme climatic condition on streamflow in the mekong river basin mrb these six gcms three precipitation based and three temperature based were used for this study for the 20 years 2061 2080 using the swat model fig 12b on examining all the simulated cases using extreme climate conditions there are some distinct patterns firstly the peak streamflow for the gfdl esm2m occurs during august whereas in all the other cases the peak occurs during the month of september secondly in extreme climates such as a very wet condition the streamflow of csiro mk3 6 0 is greater whereas streamflow of miroc esm chem is lower in a very dry condition as compared to other extreme climate conditions thirdly in hot climate conditions the streamflow of ipsl cm5a mr is lower whereas in cold climate condition the streamflow of gfdl esm2m is higher fourthly streamflow gradually increases during april september and declines after the peak in a similar manner during september march for all projected climate scenarios and the base cases the change in percentage of projected climate variables annual precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and simulated projected streamflow as compared to the base case 1986 2005 using six extreme climatic conditions are shown in table 3 the csiro mk3 6 0 very wet condition shows an increase in the streamflow 38 41 precipitation 27 94 maximum temperature 6 30 and minimum temperature 16 86 the miroc esm chem very dry condition shows a decrease in the streamflow 23 84 and precipitation 12 19 while maximum and minimum temperature show increases 6 99 and 20 99 respectively in the normal climate condition based on precipitation the giss e2 r shows an increase in the streamflow 5 13 precipitation 20 47 and minimum temperature 13 34 while maximum temperature decreases 0 49 the ipsl cm5a mr hot condition shows a decrease in the streamflow 23 32 precipitation 10 69 and minimum temperature 5 82 while maximum temperature increases 18 62 in the cold climate condition gfdl esm2m streamflow precipitation and minimum temperature increase 14 20 10 46 and 9 06 respectively while maximum temperature decreases 2 99 5 conclusions vigorous planning and management of the mekong delta requires a long term strategic integrated perspective that is based on a strong shared understanding of the history status and future projections on the three key interlinked themes of land climate and water from this study our results can be summarized as follows i for the entire vmd the area of triple rice crop has increased while single and double rice crops have decreased with the area under aquaculture remaining roughly constant from 2000 to 2018 the increasing trend in triple rice crop is significant in two northern portions provinces an giang and dong thap in 2018 55 and 31 of agricultural lands are triple rice crop for an giang and for dong thap respectively while these figures in 2000 are only 7 and 3 respectively ii this study raises a concern on the expansion of triple rice crop that maybe not a sustainable development because 1 climatic condition is unfavorable as precipitation in the triple rice crop area has decreased 31 significantly from 2000 to 2018 2 previous studies also exhibited that drought trends in vmd are increasing le et al 2020a 3 in the future the number of drought months in the delta is projected to intensify between 2020 and 2099 compared to the period from 1986 to 20059 see appendix 6 4 by analyzing farmer interview in hong ngu district of dong thap province we did not find significant economic benefits but water quality problem in the areas growing triple rice crop iii there is a large demand for water in rice and other agriculture in the winter that cannot be satisfied by precipitation alone august and therefore is likely to increase the withdrawal of groundwater the assessment of land surface temperature and evapotranspiration indicates these datasets are well alignment with the delta s characteristics and are necessary ancillary datasets for water resources planning iv from the extreme climate study the csiro mk3 6 0 very wet condition shows the maximum increased streamflow 38 41 while the miroc esm chem very dry condition shows the minimum decrease in the streamflow 23 84 this work is expected to help the government at different levels to make decisions relating to cropping water infrastructure and other land use to help in the land use management and decision making the study proposes the use of historical publicly available earth observation data and publicly available models credit authorship contribution

7897,study region xiaoqing river basin shandong province china study focus identifying the driving factors of temporal and spatial variation in runoff is key to water resource management the traditional machine learning model lacks transparency and interpretability which affects the wide application of machine learning in the identification of influencing factors of hydrology interpretable machine learning method can improve the interpretability of machine learning model the extreme gradient boosting xgboost is established based on the data generated by the calibrated soil water assessment tool swat and the xgboost is interpreted using the shapely additive explanations shap method to identify the impact of driving factors on runoff generation new hydrological insights for the region the results show that xgboost can simulate the simulation ability of swat and shap can identify the factors affecting runoff generation by interpreting xgboost it was found that climatic features have different effects on runoff in different sub basins and rainfall at high elevations or slope has stronger effects on runoff than that at low elevations there is an obvious threshold effect of land use combination or slope on the generation of runoff and this threshold effect is driven by high precipitation the results of this study can provide a new method for factor analysis of runoff graphical abstract ga1 keywords runoff swat xgboost shapely additive explanations xiaoqing river basin 1 introductions runoff is an important part of the regional water cycle and the response of runoff to its driving factors such as climate topography land use etc are different under different conditions as rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns lead to an increase in evaporation climate change is likely to affect the hydrological cycle and water resources huntington 2006 duan et al 2016 the characteristics of the underlying surface of the basin will also have a certain impact on the hydrological process and the differences in topography and geomorphology are closely related to the hydrological process of the basin beven et al 1988 identifying the driving factors of runoff is critical for people to understand the hydrological process scientifically and the relevant research results will provide a theoretical basis for water resource management in recent years many studies xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 li et al 2021 busico et al 2020 hu et al 2021 have explored the impact of driving factors on runoff which are mainly divided into three categories empirical statistics water heat coupling balance method elastic coefficient method and hydrological model method the empirical statistical method establishes the statistical relationship between runoff and related influence variables including regression analysis and the rainfall runoff double cumulative curve method based on the multivariate linear regression method zhang et al 2016 found that the runoff of the poyang lake basin is the most sensitive to climate change kong et al 2016 based on the double accumulation curve of precipitation and runoff showed that the contribution rate of human activities to the runoff change of the yellow river from 1950 to 2015 was as high as 91 7 although the empirical statistical analysis method is simple to calculate it requires a long series of measured data and there is a lack of analysis of the physical mechanism of the hydrological process in the basin xu et al 2014 the most widely used elastic coefficient method is based on the budyko hypothesis based on the budyko hypothesis xu et al 2014 found that the impact of climate change and land use on runoff in 33 mountain watersheds in the haihe river basin led to an average runoff reduction of 26 9 and 73 1 respectively wang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 used the elastic method based on budyko to study the sensitivity of runoff to climate and watershed variables the results show that the absolute sensitivity of runoff to climate variables decreases with an increase in the drought index indicating that runoff in humid areas is more sensitive to climate change although the elastic coefficient method based on the budyko hypothesis is easy to obtain budyko is only limited to the annual scale for the distinction of a monthly scale or a finer scale the budyko hypothesis may not be competent and rich runoff data are needed some studies chaplot 2005 kannan et al 2007 narsimlu et al 2013 faghih et al 2017 busico et al 2020 have established a watershed hydrological model swat to observe the resulting runoff changes by changing the input of the hydrological model however as the number of these parameters and their possible values increases the number of combinations increases exponentially which may make the process repetitive and tedious if the model takes a long time to run uusitalo et al 2015 as can be seen from these examples of previous work different methods process based and statistics based combined with existing runoff time series lead to different conclusions to solve the above research difficulties there is an urgent need for a simple and efficient means to simulate the watershed runoff process on a fine scale to identify the response of runoff to driving factors in recent years many studies kratzert et al 2019 lian et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 schmidt et al 2020 fung et al 2020 have demonstrated the applicability of machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks and long short memory networks in the field of hydrology and discussed their comparison with traditional hydrological models and methods research has shown that machine learning has achieved consistent or even better results than traditional methods in lake water level simulation fan et al 2021 river water temperature prediction rahmani et al 2020 soil moisture karthikeyan and mishra 2021 and runoff simulation kratzert et al 2019 mirzaei et al 2021 owing to the poor interpretation of traditional machine learning methods the direction of the influence of features on output cannot be clarified and the visibility of feature importance is poor which has led to many studies avoiding the use of machine learning for attribution analysis nearing et al 2020 however the recent emergence of the shap method seems to have reversed this situation shap originates from game theory and constructs an additive interpretation model štrumbelj and kononenko 2014 and all features are regarded as contributors the response of the machine learning output to input can be obtained through the calculated shap value lundberg and lee 2017 in the study of feature analysis shap technology has achieved satisfactory results in many fields such as medicine lama et al 2021 automotive engineering wen et al 2021 materials mangalathu et al 2020 and water environment wang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 and confirmed its applicability in feature analysis however to the best of our knowledge only few studies have applied interpretable machine learning methods to the attribution analysis of variables in hydrology although the establishment of a machine learning hydrological prediction model based on measured hydrological data can obtain satisfactory results with a relatively simple process the model lacks the physical mechanism of watershed hydrological process kratzert et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 the main purpose of this study is to develop a new uncertainty analysis method based on interpretable machine learning this study will have a strong physical mechanism model swat to combine a machine learning model to identify the impact of driving factors on runoff in the xiaoqing river basin this study focused on two aspects 1 to determine whether xgboost can simulate the prediction ability of the complex hydrological model swat and if so whether it can use fewer input variables to obtain satisfactory model performance 2 the xgboost model was interpreted by shap to identify the responses of runoff generation to input variables at different spatio temporal scales 2 material and methods the method framework of this research is shown in fig 1 first swat was run to obtain hydrological variables for 11 years 2008 2018 in each subbasin including responses to predictions and multiple variables as predictors there is a complex nonlinear relationship between the response variable and the prediction variable if xgboost can predict response variables well then xgboost can simulate swat s prediction ability secondly according to the shap interpretation of xgboost the importance ranking of input variables is obtained and the input variables are filtered and several xgboosts with different model structures are developed it evaluates its performance to determine whether xgboost could simulate swat simulation capabilities with simple input data finally according to the results of shap interpretation all variable training xgboost the factors affecting runoff generation were identified 2 1 study area the xiaoqing river originating in jinan city fig 2 and finally entering the laizhou bay is the most important large river in shandong province china jiang et al 2017 the total length of the mainstream of the xiaoqing river is 237 km and the watershed area is approximately 10 336 km2 the overall topography of the basin is high in the south and low in the north with hills in the south and plain depressions in the north the basin has obvious seasonal variations and a temperate monsoon climate jiao et al 2017 the main manifestations are as follows summer high temperature rainfall sudden rainstorms winter droughts long drought periods more precipitation in the southern mountain area more precipitation in the upper reaches than in the lower reaches and more precipitation in the south 2 2 models 2 2 1 soil water assessment tool swat swat is a distributed model developed by the united states department of agriculture it requires a large amount of data for simulation and is an effective tool for the long term simulation of various river flows gassman et al 2007 swat has been successfully deployed in many parts of the world and has been shown to model hydrological processes erosion vegetation growth and water quality changes in large watersheds and to help assess the impacts of climate change and water resource management strauch and volk 2013 busico et al 2020 woo et al 2021 the data for building the swat are listed in table 1 the xiaoqing river basin is divided into 80 sub basins and 471 hydrological response units the model was calibrated and verified using the sufi 2 algorithm of swat cup the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were employed to evaluate the swat model during the calibration and verification periods r2 and nse were higher than 0 8 and 0 6 respectively table 2 it can be clearly seen that although the simulated value of swat runoff is higher than the observed value at several peaks the overall fit between the two is high fig 3 the simulated peak value during the validation period is higher than the measured runoff value which may be because the water cycle is no longer a natural state but a natural artificial dual water cycle state and it is difficult to obtain all the artificial water cycle data the simulated peak value during the validation period is higher than the measured runoff value which may be because the water cycle is no longer a natural state and it is difficult to obtain all the data of water taking and scheduling information of dams built in river channels the results show that the calibrated swat model can effectively describe the hydrological process of xiaoqing river basin the runoff generation data of 80 sub basins simulated by swat were extracted to train the machine learning model 2 2 2 extreme gradient boosting xgboost the xgboost algorithm is an extension of the gradient lifting machine gradient boosting machine gbm algorithm it is an optimization model with the characteristics of both a linear model and a tree model it can simultaneously complete regression and classification tasks at the same time the xgboost algorithm is composed of several decision trees cart machine learning is realized through the integration of decision trees the predicted values of all decision trees add up to the predicted values of the model and the model is trained by the gradient lifting decision tree algorithm in contrast to the gbdt algorithm the xgboost algorithm uses the second order taylor expansion of the loss function to quickly approach the objective function and adds regularization parameters to avoid overfitting fast training speed and high prediction accuracy 1 y ˆ i t 1 n f t x i f t x i r where n is the number of trees f t is a function of function space r y ˆ i is the predicted value of the regression tree x i is the ith data of the input r is the set of all possible regression tree models 2 x obj i 1 n l y y ˆ k 1 k ω f k where i 1 n l y y ˆ is used to describe the difference between the predicted value and the real value of the model and k 1 k ω f k is the regularization term of the objective function 3 ω f k γ t λ 1 2 j 1 t ω j 2 where t is the number of leaf nodes γ is the coefficient of the penalty function ω is the fraction of leaf nodes and λ is used to ensure that the score of leaf nodes is not too large when the regularization parameter is zero xgboost degenerates to the traditional boosting model the application of machine learning model in watershed hydrological research is limited by large data requirements and the neglect of spatial variability yang et al 2020 to solve the problem of insufficient training of machine learning model and ignorance of the spatial variability of predictors we used physical distributed hydrological model swat to generate a large amount of runoff data the runoff yield data of 80 sub basins generated by swat from 2008 to 2018 were selected as the training target variable of xgboost the input variables of xgboost are the necessary data for swat modeling topography meteorology land use and soil type see table 3 for details the dataset contains 10560 records it was randomly divided into 80 training set and 20 test set and the nse rmse and r2 were employed to evaluate the xgboost if xgboost can make use of the input and output of swat to achieve a satisfactory runoff forecasting effect it can simulate the forecasting ability of swat 2 3 shapely additive explanations shap in this study shap was used to interpret the xgboost model that simulates swat forecasting ability to construct a simpler runoff prediction model e g a structure that only involves several input variables and identify the runoff response to driving factors on different spatial temporal scales shap is a machine learning result interpretation model inspired by cooperative game theory and all features are regarded as contributors in the shap analysis framework each prediction sample corresponds to a prediction value and the shap value is the value obtained by each feature in the prediction sample traditional feature importance only shows which feature is important and does not show how this feature affects the prediction results lundberg and lee 2017 the biggest advantage of shap value is the influence of the shap on reflecting the characteristics of each sample and it also shows a positive and negative influence assuming that the i sample is x i the j feature of the i sample is x i j the predicted value of the model for the sample is y i and the average value of the sample target variable is y base then the shap value is calculated using the following formula 4 y i y base f x i 1 f x i 2 f x ik it can be seen from the formula that f x i 1 is the contribution value of the first feature in the i sample to the final predicted value y i when f x i 1 0 it shows that this feature promotes the increase of the predicted value which is a positive effect in contrary it shows that the final predicted value will be reduced under the influence of this feature which is a negative effect all computations were conducted using python 3 7 3 results 3 1 xgboost for runoff forecasting to better simulate the ability of swat to predict runoff generation and consider the possible influence of previous conditions on the current runoff the data of the current month denoted as t and one month ago t 1 were input into xgboost model respectively to predict the runoff on the t month fig 3 shows the xgboost performance for the runoff forecasting for the testing periods with an nse of 0 936 and rmse of 2 259 a high accuracy was obtained for testing table 4 with the extension of the forecast period to 1 month the nse decreased to 0 848 and the rmse increased to 3 327 the input variables of meteorology soil land use and topographic conditions were combined and two time t 1 and t were selected as the input respectively which is sufficient to reflect the runoff at month t these results confirm that xgboost can simulate the runoff generation prediction ability of swat swat has high requirements for data and demands abundant data to drive the model and it is very important to explore a simpler prediction model with input variables input variables are gradually eliminated according to the importance of the features in the xgboost interpreted by shap fig 4 start with the least important variable and eliminate variables of similar importance each time after removing the variables the model was retrained and new feature importance was obtained as shown in fig 5 the overall trend is that the performance of the model decreases with a reduction in the variables xgboost can predict satisfactorily even when the number of variables is reduced to five nse 0 903 rmse 2 767 fig 6 and table s1 these variables p frst r yysql and mint can be easily monitored especially p r and mint which can be easily obtained through meteorological monitoring stations the remaining attributes frst and yysql are also easily available xgboost has a good ability to replicate swat runoff yield xgboost can simulate the ability of swat to predict runoff based on the input and output data of swat moreover xgboost can achieve satisfactory results with fewer variables 3 2 identify the factors affecting runoff it is important to develop accurate runoff forecasting models because more accurate models can better capture the relationship between runoff and drivers another equally important aspect is how to interpret the modeling results and translate them into actionable projects this section discusses how to use the shap method to interpret the results of xgboost and identify the impact of drivers on runoff 3 2 1 total effects of factors to visualize the influence of input variables on runoff generation shap was used to illustrate how these variables affect the variations in runoff generation in the model fig 7 displays the top 20 most important features of the xgboost model p was found to be the dominant climatic feature affecting runoff generation followed by s maxt and r fig 7a among them there is a strong positive correlation between p and runoff fig 8a that is with the increase in rainfall the stronger the promoting effect on runoff generation the intensity of the positive correlation between humidity and runoff was less than that of rainfall fig 8b maxt has little effect on runoff below 20 or even restrains runoff production however when maxt is higher than 25 the effect of maxt on runoff is unstable when the mint is lower than 10 the effect on runoff is not obvious however mint inhibited runoff production above 20 and promoted runoff production between 10 and 20 in this study the threshold value also known as the critical value refers to a value at which an effect promotion or inhibition can change in other words a variable below a certain value promotes runoff generation and suppresses runoff generation when it is higher this value is called threshold value meanwhile we observe that there is an obvious threshold effect of s on runoff generation as shown in fig 8e when s is higher than 24 mj m2 the generation of runoff is restrained or reduced while when s is lower than 24 mj m2 runoff generation is promoted but the promoting effect is not intuitive in a word with an increase in the s the runoff production ability decreases gradually yysql and yysll were interpreted by shap as the greatest soil features affecting runoff there is an obvious positive correlation between yysql and runoff while there is an obvious threshold effect relationship between yysll and runoff when the yysll was greater than 0 13 the runoff yield was higher than the that of yysll less than 0 13 fig 8g and h we can clearly observe that different land use types have different effects on runoff fig 8i k there are different land use combinations in different sub watershed units the high value of agrr indicates small values of other land types and the threshold effects of the three main land use types on runoff agrr is approximately 0 7 urbn is approximately 0 2 and frst is approximately 0 1 among these an agrr higher than 0 7 that is urbn and frst lower than 0 2 and 0 1 respectively inhibit the generation of runoff and lower than 0 2 will promote in the topographic features the larger the slo the more conducive it is to the generation of runoff and there is an obvious threshold of 20 in other words under the same conditions the runoff in the area with high a slope was greater than that in the area with a low slope fig 8l 3 2 2 interaction effects the total effect diagram fig 8 shows that there is a strong nonlinear relationship between the variables and runoff generation we also observed that there was an obvious vertical dispersion between the characteristics and runoff generation but this vertical dispersion was driven by the interaction of other characteristics fig 8 therefore the effects of the input characteristics of swat on the simulated runoff generation are not independent of each other but there are some interactions the shap dependence plot fig 9 was used to visualize the impact of climatic factors and other driving factors on runoff generation through the xgboost interpreted by shap we observed that due to the strong spatial heterogeneity in the xiaoqing river basin the effects of rainfall on runoff generation in different sub basins were different for example from the point of view of the type of land use the promoting effect of rainfall on runoff was lower when agrr was higher than when agrr was low fig 9a in other words a large area of agricultural land in the sub basin will inhibit the response of runoff to rainfall moreover with respect to the type of soil rainfall and soil types also have obvious interactions with runoff as shown in figs 9d and e when the yysql was low the promoting effect of rainfall on runoff was higher than that of high yysql however yysll is almost the opposite of yysql considering the topographic features when the slo is different the degree of promotion of rainfall increase to runoff is different that is when the rainfall is large the runoff of high slo is larger than that of low slo and the same is true of elevation and channel slope fig 9f h we also observed that the threshold effect of land use or topography on runoff was driven by precipitation figs 9i l for example high precipitation agrrs have an obvious threshold effect on runoff generation while the effects of low precipitation and agrr on runoff generation can be ignored such as slo fig 9l the above results it show that there are significant differences in the effects of driving factors on runoff in different sub basins which proves that shap can interpret swat using xgboost for feature analysis 4 discussion it can be seen from the above results that xgboost with simple structure can simulate the runoff generation prediction ability of swat firstly since xgboost achieved satisfactory performance it can better simulate the prediction ability of swat secondly only five variables were identified as the pivotal variables of swat performance the consistency of shap identification results with hydrology theory further supports the reliability of the results in recent years the integration of physical mechanism model and machine learning is considered as a promising modeling method in geoscience research reichstein et al 2019 yang et al 2020 xie et al 2021 in this study a typical method combining physical modeling with machine learning is proposed swat is a complex and powerful semi distributed hydrologic model in which there are abundant physical mechanisms of runoff migration arnold and fohrer 2005 the runoff time series data generated by swat model are intrinsically linked by the hydrological mechanism process represented by mathematical equations therefore these data are external representations of the complex dynamics of the simulation system when this data was used to train xgboost it learned to describe system dynamics in terms of nonlinear functions in effect xgboost training is guided by physical mechanical processes embedded in swat therefore xgboost model can be considered as a mechanism guidance in theory which means that the model is no longer purely data driven because there is an inherent correlation between the variables used for model training liang et al 2020 due to the lack of transparency and interpretability the machine learning model is often criticized as a black box sun and scanlon 2019 this affects the widespread use of machine learning methods in hydrological modeling although they are more flexible and may be more accurate than traditional statistical models warner and misra 1996 to solve the interpretable problem of xgboost the shap method was used to interpret the xgboost to identify important influencing factors and identify their impact on runoff the identification results of key drivers are consistent with the classical theories of hydrology topography is an important part of the underlying surface of the basin which affects the entire runoff change ye et al 2018 caviedes voullième et al 2021 in the topographic features there is a strong non linear relationship between the slope and runoff of the sub basin in the study there is also the influence of the slope driven by precipitation on the threshold effect of runoff generation the complex threshold relationship between runoff and slope is the result of a variety of factors zhang et al 2018 including rainfall system surface roughness slope flow continuity topsoil sealing layer soil particles and infiltration capacity these factors have different effects on the runoff production chen et al 2013 for example the precipitation affects the formation of the sealing layer and can significantly reduce the infiltration rate assouline and ben hur 2006 climate change can affect the water cycle which in turn affects water resources and causes floods and droughts wang et al 2015 in this study through the characteristic analysis we observed that climate characteristics is the most important factor affecting runoff in the xiaoqing river basin however we observed a strong positive correlation between rainfall and runoff in addition to an obvious threshold effect between temperature solar radiation and runoff this threshold may be caused by the indirect effects of temperature and solar radiation on rainfall and evaporation fig 8 changes in precipitation and evaporation will cause changes in the hydrological cycle thus affecting the runoff process leading to changes in the total amount of water resources in the basin as well as changes in temporal and spatial distribution wang et al 2016 through the interpretation of xgboost by shap it was found that there is a strong spatial heterogeneity in the response of runoff to climatic factors and the effects of climatic factors on runoff are different in different sub basins fig 9 for example there is a strong correlation between rainfall and runoff in high elevation areas fig 9g which is almost consistent with the results of li et al 2020 the high topography leads to the adiabatic expansion and cooling of the rising air mass which in turn increases the relative humidity leads to the formation of clouds and precipitation and finally affects the runoff meshesha et al 2015 the effect of rainfall on runoff is also different under different soil conditions fig 9d which may be due to the physical and chemical properties of the soil some studies have shown that yysql has higher soil moisture smaller soil porosity and slower water seepage saint laurent and arsenault boucher 2020 therefore the response of runoff to rainfall is not sensitive in sub watersheds with more yysql hydrologists have always focused on studying the impact of land use change on watershed runoff dynamics ma et al 2020 zhang and yu 2021 it is not clear whether there is a clear quantitative relationship between the change in various land use types and the mechanism of runoff generation hundecha and bárdossy 2004 this lack of knowledge is mainly due to the heterogeneity of land use characteristics in watersheds and the concurrent effects of climate which are often difficult to distinguish wang et al 2009 in this study the shap shows the comprehensive impact of climate factors and land use factors on runoff the results show that there is an obvious threshold effect of land use combination on the generation of runoff and this threshold effect is affected by high precipitation when rainfall was large and the proportion of cultivated land was less than 0 7 the generation of runoff was promoted fig 9i on the other hand when rainfall was large and the proportion of construction area was more than 0 2 fig 9j the generation of runoff was promoted this may be due to the different permeability of each land use resulting in different mechanisms of runoff response to rainfall wang et al 2014 duan et al 2022 for example in general the permeability of construction land is poor the response of runoff to high precipitation is more sensitive and runoff can be easily produced this threshold of land use mix can help policy makers involved in land use planning to consider land use change because it can amplify the impact of climate and population change on watershed hydrodynamics napoli et al 2017 because many factors affect the threshold i e soil characteristics vegetation types and topography blanco sepúlveda and aguilar carrillo 2015 saffarpour et al 2016 and have complex spatio temporal scale effects the threshold behavior is different in space slope and basin and time or seasonal scale liu et al 2018 in this study it is also found that there is an obvious threshold effect between slope soil type land use and runoff and this threshold effect is driven by rainfall for example the runoff of sub basins with high slope and high yysll content is more responsive to higher rainfall which may be due to its surface resistance and extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity at the uphill position which promotes the generation of rainfall runoff which is similar to the results of a study nanda and sen 2021 tani 1997 found that when the previous conditions were dry and the rainfall did not exceed 100 mm the runoff was less than 10 of the rainfall when the total rainfall exceeds 100 mm the increase in runoff is almost equal to the increase in rainfall this shows that when the soil reaches saturated water content almost all rainfall contributes to runoff detty and mcguire 2010 believe that in runoff events with these threshold conditions when the groundwater level rises to a highly permeable near surface soil the threshold behavior is due to the increase of effective saturated hydraulic conductivity which involves the transmission feedback mechanism meanwhile the threshold behavior affecting runoff generation can fully reflect the nonlinearity of production flow mechanism 5 conclusions in this study swat combined with xgboost and shap was used to identify the driving factors of runoff generation and satisfactory results were obtained this method can not only fully identify the interaction of different variables on runoff generation but also be suitable for areas with insufficient hydrological data the main conclusions are as follows the proposed xgboost has runoff generation prediction ability for simulating swat in addition xgboost with a simple structure five input variables can provide satisfactory results for simulating swat prediction of runoff generation mechanically guided xgboost is effective and efficient for water quality prediction and is expected to be a promising tool the effects of drivers on runoff can be identified using shap to interpret xgboost with swat simulation capabilities it was found that there are obvious thresholds for the influence of some topographic slope land use and climatic features temperature and solar radiation on runoff generation a slope higher than 20 or proportion of residential area higher 0 2 promotes the generation of runoff lower than 20 or 0 2 will inhibit among the climatic factors the effects of temperature and solar radiation on runoff also have thresholds 20 and 25 mj m2 shap can identify the interaction of variables on runoff we observed that in the xiaoqing river basin the response of runoff to driving factors is different in different sub basins the runoff generated in the rainfall areas of the low slope or elevation areas is lower than that in the areas with high slope or elevation there is an obvious threshold effect of land use combination on the generation of runoff and this threshold effect was affected by high precipitation the rainfall is large and the proportion of the construction area is more than 0 2 which promotes the generation of runoff the xgboost model was built based on the input and output of the swat using shap to interpret xgboost is approximately equivalent to using shap to interpret swat that is in the entire research process xgboost is used as the intermediate bridge between swat and shap to identify the driving factors of runoff generation there are certain requirements for the accuracy of the swat simulation if the accuracy is insufficient the credibility of the results of shap attribution analysis is poor the shap results show that the response of runoff to land use is unclear and the human impact on runoff cannot be identified dynamic land use ought to be used to improve the analysis of future runoff generation shap has achieved satisfactory results in many areas lama et al 2021 mangalathu et al 2020 wen et al 2021 and we believe that shap can make

7897,study region xiaoqing river basin shandong province china study focus identifying the driving factors of temporal and spatial variation in runoff is key to water resource management the traditional machine learning model lacks transparency and interpretability which affects the wide application of machine learning in the identification of influencing factors of hydrology interpretable machine learning method can improve the interpretability of machine learning model the extreme gradient boosting xgboost is established based on the data generated by the calibrated soil water assessment tool swat and the xgboost is interpreted using the shapely additive explanations shap method to identify the impact of driving factors on runoff generation new hydrological insights for the region the results show that xgboost can simulate the simulation ability of swat and shap can identify the factors affecting runoff generation by interpreting xgboost it was found that climatic features have different effects on runoff in different sub basins and rainfall at high elevations or slope has stronger effects on runoff than that at low elevations there is an obvious threshold effect of land use combination or slope on the generation of runoff and this threshold effect is driven by high precipitation the results of this study can provide a new method for factor analysis of runoff graphical abstract ga1 keywords runoff swat xgboost shapely additive explanations xiaoqing river basin 1 introductions runoff is an important part of the regional water cycle and the response of runoff to its driving factors such as climate topography land use etc are different under different conditions as rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns lead to an increase in evaporation climate change is likely to affect the hydrological cycle and water resources huntington 2006 duan et al 2016 the characteristics of the underlying surface of the basin will also have a certain impact on the hydrological process and the differences in topography and geomorphology are closely related to the hydrological process of the basin beven et al 1988 identifying the driving factors of runoff is critical for people to understand the hydrological process scientifically and the relevant research results will provide a theoretical basis for water resource management in recent years many studies xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 li et al 2021 busico et al 2020 hu et al 2021 have explored the impact of driving factors on runoff which are mainly divided into three categories empirical statistics water heat coupling balance method elastic coefficient method and hydrological model method the empirical statistical method establishes the statistical relationship between runoff and related influence variables including regression analysis and the rainfall runoff double cumulative curve method based on the multivariate linear regression method zhang et al 2016 found that the runoff of the poyang lake basin is the most sensitive to climate change kong et al 2016 based on the double accumulation curve of precipitation and runoff showed that the contribution rate of human activities to the runoff change of the yellow river from 1950 to 2015 was as high as 91 7 although the empirical statistical analysis method is simple to calculate it requires a long series of measured data and there is a lack of analysis of the physical mechanism of the hydrological process in the basin xu et al 2014 the most widely used elastic coefficient method is based on the budyko hypothesis based on the budyko hypothesis xu et al 2014 found that the impact of climate change and land use on runoff in 33 mountain watersheds in the haihe river basin led to an average runoff reduction of 26 9 and 73 1 respectively wang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 used the elastic method based on budyko to study the sensitivity of runoff to climate and watershed variables the results show that the absolute sensitivity of runoff to climate variables decreases with an increase in the drought index indicating that runoff in humid areas is more sensitive to climate change although the elastic coefficient method based on the budyko hypothesis is easy to obtain budyko is only limited to the annual scale for the distinction of a monthly scale or a finer scale the budyko hypothesis may not be competent and rich runoff data are needed some studies chaplot 2005 kannan et al 2007 narsimlu et al 2013 faghih et al 2017 busico et al 2020 have established a watershed hydrological model swat to observe the resulting runoff changes by changing the input of the hydrological model however as the number of these parameters and their possible values increases the number of combinations increases exponentially which may make the process repetitive and tedious if the model takes a long time to run uusitalo et al 2015 as can be seen from these examples of previous work different methods process based and statistics based combined with existing runoff time series lead to different conclusions to solve the above research difficulties there is an urgent need for a simple and efficient means to simulate the watershed runoff process on a fine scale to identify the response of runoff to driving factors in recent years many studies kratzert et al 2019 lian et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 schmidt et al 2020 fung et al 2020 have demonstrated the applicability of machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks and long short memory networks in the field of hydrology and discussed their comparison with traditional hydrological models and methods research has shown that machine learning has achieved consistent or even better results than traditional methods in lake water level simulation fan et al 2021 river water temperature prediction rahmani et al 2020 soil moisture karthikeyan and mishra 2021 and runoff simulation kratzert et al 2019 mirzaei et al 2021 owing to the poor interpretation of traditional machine learning methods the direction of the influence of features on output cannot be clarified and the visibility of feature importance is poor which has led to many studies avoiding the use of machine learning for attribution analysis nearing et al 2020 however the recent emergence of the shap method seems to have reversed this situation shap originates from game theory and constructs an additive interpretation model štrumbelj and kononenko 2014 and all features are regarded as contributors the response of the machine learning output to input can be obtained through the calculated shap value lundberg and lee 2017 in the study of feature analysis shap technology has achieved satisfactory results in many fields such as medicine lama et al 2021 automotive engineering wen et al 2021 materials mangalathu et al 2020 and water environment wang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 and confirmed its applicability in feature analysis however to the best of our knowledge only few studies have applied interpretable machine learning methods to the attribution analysis of variables in hydrology although the establishment of a machine learning hydrological prediction model based on measured hydrological data can obtain satisfactory results with a relatively simple process the model lacks the physical mechanism of watershed hydrological process kratzert et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 the main purpose of this study is to develop a new uncertainty analysis method based on interpretable machine learning this study will have a strong physical mechanism model swat to combine a machine learning model to identify the impact of driving factors on runoff in the xiaoqing river basin this study focused on two aspects 1 to determine whether xgboost can simulate the prediction ability of the complex hydrological model swat and if so whether it can use fewer input variables to obtain satisfactory model performance 2 the xgboost model was interpreted by shap to identify the responses of runoff generation to input variables at different spatio temporal scales 2 material and methods the method framework of this research is shown in fig 1 first swat was run to obtain hydrological variables for 11 years 2008 2018 in each subbasin including responses to predictions and multiple variables as predictors there is a complex nonlinear relationship between the response variable and the prediction variable if xgboost can predict response variables well then xgboost can simulate swat s prediction ability secondly according to the shap interpretation of xgboost the importance ranking of input variables is obtained and the input variables are filtered and several xgboosts with different model structures are developed it evaluates its performance to determine whether xgboost could simulate swat simulation capabilities with simple input data finally according to the results of shap interpretation all variable training xgboost the factors affecting runoff generation were identified 2 1 study area the xiaoqing river originating in jinan city fig 2 and finally entering the laizhou bay is the most important large river in shandong province china jiang et al 2017 the total length of the mainstream of the xiaoqing river is 237 km and the watershed area is approximately 10 336 km2 the overall topography of the basin is high in the south and low in the north with hills in the south and plain depressions in the north the basin has obvious seasonal variations and a temperate monsoon climate jiao et al 2017 the main manifestations are as follows summer high temperature rainfall sudden rainstorms winter droughts long drought periods more precipitation in the southern mountain area more precipitation in the upper reaches than in the lower reaches and more precipitation in the south 2 2 models 2 2 1 soil water assessment tool swat swat is a distributed model developed by the united states department of agriculture it requires a large amount of data for simulation and is an effective tool for the long term simulation of various river flows gassman et al 2007 swat has been successfully deployed in many parts of the world and has been shown to model hydrological processes erosion vegetation growth and water quality changes in large watersheds and to help assess the impacts of climate change and water resource management strauch and volk 2013 busico et al 2020 woo et al 2021 the data for building the swat are listed in table 1 the xiaoqing river basin is divided into 80 sub basins and 471 hydrological response units the model was calibrated and verified using the sufi 2 algorithm of swat cup the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were employed to evaluate the swat model during the calibration and verification periods r2 and nse were higher than 0 8 and 0 6 respectively table 2 it can be clearly seen that although the simulated value of swat runoff is higher than the observed value at several peaks the overall fit between the two is high fig 3 the simulated peak value during the validation period is higher than the measured runoff value which may be because the water cycle is no longer a natural state but a natural artificial dual water cycle state and it is difficult to obtain all the artificial water cycle data the simulated peak value during the validation period is higher than the measured runoff value which may be because the water cycle is no longer a natural state and it is difficult to obtain all the data of water taking and scheduling information of dams built in river channels the results show that the calibrated swat model can effectively describe the hydrological process of xiaoqing river basin the runoff generation data of 80 sub basins simulated by swat were extracted to train the machine learning model 2 2 2 extreme gradient boosting xgboost the xgboost algorithm is an extension of the gradient lifting machine gradient boosting machine gbm algorithm it is an optimization model with the characteristics of both a linear model and a tree model it can simultaneously complete regression and classification tasks at the same time the xgboost algorithm is composed of several decision trees cart machine learning is realized through the integration of decision trees the predicted values of all decision trees add up to the predicted values of the model and the model is trained by the gradient lifting decision tree algorithm in contrast to the gbdt algorithm the xgboost algorithm uses the second order taylor expansion of the loss function to quickly approach the objective function and adds regularization parameters to avoid overfitting fast training speed and high prediction accuracy 1 y ˆ i t 1 n f t x i f t x i r where n is the number of trees f t is a function of function space r y ˆ i is the predicted value of the regression tree x i is the ith data of the input r is the set of all possible regression tree models 2 x obj i 1 n l y y ˆ k 1 k ω f k where i 1 n l y y ˆ is used to describe the difference between the predicted value and the real value of the model and k 1 k ω f k is the regularization term of the objective function 3 ω f k γ t λ 1 2 j 1 t ω j 2 where t is the number of leaf nodes γ is the coefficient of the penalty function ω is the fraction of leaf nodes and λ is used to ensure that the score of leaf nodes is not too large when the regularization parameter is zero xgboost degenerates to the traditional boosting model the application of machine learning model in watershed hydrological research is limited by large data requirements and the neglect of spatial variability yang et al 2020 to solve the problem of insufficient training of machine learning model and ignorance of the spatial variability of predictors we used physical distributed hydrological model swat to generate a large amount of runoff data the runoff yield data of 80 sub basins generated by swat from 2008 to 2018 were selected as the training target variable of xgboost the input variables of xgboost are the necessary data for swat modeling topography meteorology land use and soil type see table 3 for details the dataset contains 10560 records it was randomly divided into 80 training set and 20 test set and the nse rmse and r2 were employed to evaluate the xgboost if xgboost can make use of the input and output of swat to achieve a satisfactory runoff forecasting effect it can simulate the forecasting ability of swat 2 3 shapely additive explanations shap in this study shap was used to interpret the xgboost model that simulates swat forecasting ability to construct a simpler runoff prediction model e g a structure that only involves several input variables and identify the runoff response to driving factors on different spatial temporal scales shap is a machine learning result interpretation model inspired by cooperative game theory and all features are regarded as contributors in the shap analysis framework each prediction sample corresponds to a prediction value and the shap value is the value obtained by each feature in the prediction sample traditional feature importance only shows which feature is important and does not show how this feature affects the prediction results lundberg and lee 2017 the biggest advantage of shap value is the influence of the shap on reflecting the characteristics of each sample and it also shows a positive and negative influence assuming that the i sample is x i the j feature of the i sample is x i j the predicted value of the model for the sample is y i and the average value of the sample target variable is y base then the shap value is calculated using the following formula 4 y i y base f x i 1 f x i 2 f x ik it can be seen from the formula that f x i 1 is the contribution value of the first feature in the i sample to the final predicted value y i when f x i 1 0 it shows that this feature promotes the increase of the predicted value which is a positive effect in contrary it shows that the final predicted value will be reduced under the influence of this feature which is a negative effect all computations were conducted using python 3 7 3 results 3 1 xgboost for runoff forecasting to better simulate the ability of swat to predict runoff generation and consider the possible influence of previous conditions on the current runoff the data of the current month denoted as t and one month ago t 1 were input into xgboost model respectively to predict the runoff on the t month fig 3 shows the xgboost performance for the runoff forecasting for the testing periods with an nse of 0 936 and rmse of 2 259 a high accuracy was obtained for testing table 4 with the extension of the forecast period to 1 month the nse decreased to 0 848 and the rmse increased to 3 327 the input variables of meteorology soil land use and topographic conditions were combined and two time t 1 and t were selected as the input respectively which is sufficient to reflect the runoff at month t these results confirm that xgboost can simulate the runoff generation prediction ability of swat swat has high requirements for data and demands abundant data to drive the model and it is very important to explore a simpler prediction model with input variables input variables are gradually eliminated according to the importance of the features in the xgboost interpreted by shap fig 4 start with the least important variable and eliminate variables of similar importance each time after removing the variables the model was retrained and new feature importance was obtained as shown in fig 5 the overall trend is that the performance of the model decreases with a reduction in the variables xgboost can predict satisfactorily even when the number of variables is reduced to five nse 0 903 rmse 2 767 fig 6 and table s1 these variables p frst r yysql and mint can be easily monitored especially p r and mint which can be easily obtained through meteorological monitoring stations the remaining attributes frst and yysql are also easily available xgboost has a good ability to replicate swat runoff yield xgboost can simulate the ability of swat to predict runoff based on the input and output data of swat moreover xgboost can achieve satisfactory results with fewer variables 3 2 identify the factors affecting runoff it is important to develop accurate runoff forecasting models because more accurate models can better capture the relationship between runoff and drivers another equally important aspect is how to interpret the modeling results and translate them into actionable projects this section discusses how to use the shap method to interpret the results of xgboost and identify the impact of drivers on runoff 3 2 1 total effects of factors to visualize the influence of input variables on runoff generation shap was used to illustrate how these variables affect the variations in runoff generation in the model fig 7 displays the top 20 most important features of the xgboost model p was found to be the dominant climatic feature affecting runoff generation followed by s maxt and r fig 7a among them there is a strong positive correlation between p and runoff fig 8a that is with the increase in rainfall the stronger the promoting effect on runoff generation the intensity of the positive correlation between humidity and runoff was less than that of rainfall fig 8b maxt has little effect on runoff below 20 or even restrains runoff production however when maxt is higher than 25 the effect of maxt on runoff is unstable when the mint is lower than 10 the effect on runoff is not obvious however mint inhibited runoff production above 20 and promoted runoff production between 10 and 20 in this study the threshold value also known as the critical value refers to a value at which an effect promotion or inhibition can change in other words a variable below a certain value promotes runoff generation and suppresses runoff generation when it is higher this value is called threshold value meanwhile we observe that there is an obvious threshold effect of s on runoff generation as shown in fig 8e when s is higher than 24 mj m2 the generation of runoff is restrained or reduced while when s is lower than 24 mj m2 runoff generation is promoted but the promoting effect is not intuitive in a word with an increase in the s the runoff production ability decreases gradually yysql and yysll were interpreted by shap as the greatest soil features affecting runoff there is an obvious positive correlation between yysql and runoff while there is an obvious threshold effect relationship between yysll and runoff when the yysll was greater than 0 13 the runoff yield was higher than the that of yysll less than 0 13 fig 8g and h we can clearly observe that different land use types have different effects on runoff fig 8i k there are different land use combinations in different sub watershed units the high value of agrr indicates small values of other land types and the threshold effects of the three main land use types on runoff agrr is approximately 0 7 urbn is approximately 0 2 and frst is approximately 0 1 among these an agrr higher than 0 7 that is urbn and frst lower than 0 2 and 0 1 respectively inhibit the generation of runoff and lower than 0 2 will promote in the topographic features the larger the slo the more conducive it is to the generation of runoff and there is an obvious threshold of 20 in other words under the same conditions the runoff in the area with high a slope was greater than that in the area with a low slope fig 8l 3 2 2 interaction effects the total effect diagram fig 8 shows that there is a strong nonlinear relationship between the variables and runoff generation we also observed that there was an obvious vertical dispersion between the characteristics and runoff generation but this vertical dispersion was driven by the interaction of other characteristics fig 8 therefore the effects of the input characteristics of swat on the simulated runoff generation are not independent of each other but there are some interactions the shap dependence plot fig 9 was used to visualize the impact of climatic factors and other driving factors on runoff generation through the xgboost interpreted by shap we observed that due to the strong spatial heterogeneity in the xiaoqing river basin the effects of rainfall on runoff generation in different sub basins were different for example from the point of view of the type of land use the promoting effect of rainfall on runoff was lower when agrr was higher than when agrr was low fig 9a in other words a large area of agricultural land in the sub basin will inhibit the response of runoff to rainfall moreover with respect to the type of soil rainfall and soil types also have obvious interactions with runoff as shown in figs 9d and e when the yysql was low the promoting effect of rainfall on runoff was higher than that of high yysql however yysll is almost the opposite of yysql considering the topographic features when the slo is different the degree of promotion of rainfall increase to runoff is different that is when the rainfall is large the runoff of high slo is larger than that of low slo and the same is true of elevation and channel slope fig 9f h we also observed that the threshold effect of land use or topography on runoff was driven by precipitation figs 9i l for example high precipitation agrrs have an obvious threshold effect on runoff generation while the effects of low precipitation and agrr on runoff generation can be ignored such as slo fig 9l the above results it show that there are significant differences in the effects of driving factors on runoff in different sub basins which proves that shap can interpret swat using xgboost for feature analysis 4 discussion it can be seen from the above results that xgboost with simple structure can simulate the runoff generation prediction ability of swat firstly since xgboost achieved satisfactory performance it can better simulate the prediction ability of swat secondly only five variables were identified as the pivotal variables of swat performance the consistency of shap identification results with hydrology theory further supports the reliability of the results in recent years the integration of physical mechanism model and machine learning is considered as a promising modeling method in geoscience research reichstein et al 2019 yang et al 2020 xie et al 2021 in this study a typical method combining physical modeling with machine learning is proposed swat is a complex and powerful semi distributed hydrologic model in which there are abundant physical mechanisms of runoff migration arnold and fohrer 2005 the runoff time series data generated by swat model are intrinsically linked by the hydrological mechanism process represented by mathematical equations therefore these data are external representations of the complex dynamics of the simulation system when this data was used to train xgboost it learned to describe system dynamics in terms of nonlinear functions in effect xgboost training is guided by physical mechanical processes embedded in swat therefore xgboost model can be considered as a mechanism guidance in theory which means that the model is no longer purely data driven because there is an inherent correlation between the variables used for model training liang et al 2020 due to the lack of transparency and interpretability the machine learning model is often criticized as a black box sun and scanlon 2019 this affects the widespread use of machine learning methods in hydrological modeling although they are more flexible and may be more accurate than traditional statistical models warner and misra 1996 to solve the interpretable problem of xgboost the shap method was used to interpret the xgboost to identify important influencing factors and identify their impact on runoff the identification results of key drivers are consistent with the classical theories of hydrology topography is an important part of the underlying surface of the basin which affects the entire runoff change ye et al 2018 caviedes voullième et al 2021 in the topographic features there is a strong non linear relationship between the slope and runoff of the sub basin in the study there is also the influence of the slope driven by precipitation on the threshold effect of runoff generation the complex threshold relationship between runoff and slope is the result of a variety of factors zhang et al 2018 including rainfall system surface roughness slope flow continuity topsoil sealing layer soil particles and infiltration capacity these factors have different effects on the runoff production chen et al 2013 for example the precipitation affects the formation of the sealing layer and can significantly reduce the infiltration rate assouline and ben hur 2006 climate change can affect the water cycle which in turn affects water resources and causes floods and droughts wang et al 2015 in this study through the characteristic analysis we observed that climate characteristics is the most important factor affecting runoff in the xiaoqing river basin however we observed a strong positive correlation between rainfall and runoff in addition to an obvious threshold effect between temperature solar radiation and runoff this threshold may be caused by the indirect effects of temperature and solar radiation on rainfall and evaporation fig 8 changes in precipitation and evaporation will cause changes in the hydrological cycle thus affecting the runoff process leading to changes in the total amount of water resources in the basin as well as changes in temporal and spatial distribution wang et al 2016 through the interpretation of xgboost by shap it was found that there is a strong spatial heterogeneity in the response of runoff to climatic factors and the effects of climatic factors on runoff are different in different sub basins fig 9 for example there is a strong correlation between rainfall and runoff in high elevation areas fig 9g which is almost consistent with the results of li et al 2020 the high topography leads to the adiabatic expansion and cooling of the rising air mass which in turn increases the relative humidity leads to the formation of clouds and precipitation and finally affects the runoff meshesha et al 2015 the effect of rainfall on runoff is also different under different soil conditions fig 9d which may be due to the physical and chemical properties of the soil some studies have shown that yysql has higher soil moisture smaller soil porosity and slower water seepage saint laurent and arsenault boucher 2020 therefore the response of runoff to rainfall is not sensitive in sub watersheds with more yysql hydrologists have always focused on studying the impact of land use change on watershed runoff dynamics ma et al 2020 zhang and yu 2021 it is not clear whether there is a clear quantitative relationship between the change in various land use types and the mechanism of runoff generation hundecha and bárdossy 2004 this lack of knowledge is mainly due to the heterogeneity of land use characteristics in watersheds and the concurrent effects of climate which are often difficult to distinguish wang et al 2009 in this study the shap shows the comprehensive impact of climate factors and land use factors on runoff the results show that there is an obvious threshold effect of land use combination on the generation of runoff and this threshold effect is affected by high precipitation when rainfall was large and the proportion of cultivated land was less than 0 7 the generation of runoff was promoted fig 9i on the other hand when rainfall was large and the proportion of construction area was more than 0 2 fig 9j the generation of runoff was promoted this may be due to the different permeability of each land use resulting in different mechanisms of runoff response to rainfall wang et al 2014 duan et al 2022 for example in general the permeability of construction land is poor the response of runoff to high precipitation is more sensitive and runoff can be easily produced this threshold of land use mix can help policy makers involved in land use planning to consider land use change because it can amplify the impact of climate and population change on watershed hydrodynamics napoli et al 2017 because many factors affect the threshold i e soil characteristics vegetation types and topography blanco sepúlveda and aguilar carrillo 2015 saffarpour et al 2016 and have complex spatio temporal scale effects the threshold behavior is different in space slope and basin and time or seasonal scale liu et al 2018 in this study it is also found that there is an obvious threshold effect between slope soil type land use and runoff and this threshold effect is driven by rainfall for example the runoff of sub basins with high slope and high yysll content is more responsive to higher rainfall which may be due to its surface resistance and extremely low soil hydraulic conductivity at the uphill position which promotes the generation of rainfall runoff which is similar to the results of a study nanda and sen 2021 tani 1997 found that when the previous conditions were dry and the rainfall did not exceed 100 mm the runoff was less than 10 of the rainfall when the total rainfall exceeds 100 mm the increase in runoff is almost equal to the increase in rainfall this shows that when the soil reaches saturated water content almost all rainfall contributes to runoff detty and mcguire 2010 believe that in runoff events with these threshold conditions when the groundwater level rises to a highly permeable near surface soil the threshold behavior is due to the increase of effective saturated hydraulic conductivity which involves the transmission feedback mechanism meanwhile the threshold behavior affecting runoff generation can fully reflect the nonlinearity of production flow mechanism 5 conclusions in this study swat combined with xgboost and shap was used to identify the driving factors of runoff generation and satisfactory results were obtained this method can not only fully identify the interaction of different variables on runoff generation but also be suitable for areas with insufficient hydrological data the main conclusions are as follows the proposed xgboost has runoff generation prediction ability for simulating swat in addition xgboost with a simple structure five input variables can provide satisfactory results for simulating swat prediction of runoff generation mechanically guided xgboost is effective and efficient for water quality prediction and is expected to be a promising tool the effects of drivers on runoff can be identified using shap to interpret xgboost with swat simulation capabilities it was found that there are obvious thresholds for the influence of some topographic slope land use and climatic features temperature and solar radiation on runoff generation a slope higher than 20 or proportion of residential area higher 0 2 promotes the generation of runoff lower than 20 or 0 2 will inhibit among the climatic factors the effects of temperature and solar radiation on runoff also have thresholds 20 and 25 mj m2 shap can identify the interaction of variables on runoff we observed that in the xiaoqing river basin the response of runoff to driving factors is different in different sub basins the runoff generated in the rainfall areas of the low slope or elevation areas is lower than that in the areas with high slope or elevation there is an obvious threshold effect of land use combination on the generation of runoff and this threshold effect was affected by high precipitation the rainfall is large and the proportion of the construction area is more than 0 2 which promotes the generation of runoff the xgboost model was built based on the input and output of the swat using shap to interpret xgboost is approximately equivalent to using shap to interpret swat that is in the entire research process xgboost is used as the intermediate bridge between swat and shap to identify the driving factors of runoff generation there are certain requirements for the accuracy of the swat simulation if the accuracy is insufficient the credibility of the results of shap attribution analysis is poor the shap results show that the response of runoff to land use is unclear and the human impact on runoff cannot be identified dynamic land use ought to be used to improve the analysis of future runoff generation shap has achieved satisfactory results in many areas lama et al 2021 mangalathu et al 2020 wen et al 2021 and we believe that shap can make

7898,study region the terauchi catchment southwestern japan study focus this paper evaluates two gauge merged precipitation datasets derived from weather radars r a and satellites gsmap g based on their capability to improve streamflow simulation using the soil and water assessment tool swat model a third dataset includes measurements from local rain gauges used for producing the r a database but not the gsmap g product was prepared for comparison reasons the r a and gsmap g data were first compared to gauge observations the performance and prediction uncertainty of the swat model forced by the evaluated datasets were subsequently quantified and compared new hydrological insights for the region the r a dataset overestimated the precipitation while the gsmap g underestimated it after calibration the r a performed best nse 88 91 followed by the gauge nse 84 and gsmap g nse 54 scenarios the r a product improved the overall simulation performance by 6 50 and 62 40 in terms of nse and

at the spatial and temporal scales among these parameters precipitation is the key driving force in simulating streamflow dynamics tuo et al 2016 and the primary source of prediction uncertainty in many hydrological models chao et al 2018 yang et al 2017 thus accurate data and adequate representation of precipitation variability are crucial for precise simulation outputs and effective decision making balancing between the accuracy and spatial representation of precipitation data in hydrological models is still challenging dembélé et al 2020 indeed the precipitation is traditionally measured using rain gauges sun et al 2018 which provide accurate observations at a point scale of 20 cm diameter these measurements are often treated as the truth rainfall value tapiador et al 2017 however they may become uncertain when the point scale observations are extended to ungauged areas due to a sparse rain gauge network deng et al 2019 yang et al 2017 the uncertainty increases in environments

presents high spatial and temporal variability making the assumption of spatially uniform rainfall in hydrological models invalid cho et al 2009 in addition rain gauge measurements may exhibit significant negative bias during windy weather and intense rainfall conditions that generate water losses and erratic behavior of the gauge system cha and lee 2021 tobin and bennett 2009 zhong et al 2016 these drawbacks lead to an inaccurate spatial representation of the precipitation that may impact the simulation outputs advances in remote sensing technologies weather radars and satellites make up for the limitations of rain gauges by allowing a spatial observation of the precipitation these technologies provide rainfall estimates with high spatial and temporal resolutions at global and regional scales sun et al 2018 that can emerge as promising alternatives for gauge based data in hydrological models several studies have evaluated the performance of radar and satellite precipitation products using the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 as it is one of the most acknowledged models tan et al 2021 and references therein the studies findings showed the usefulness of these alternatives in simulating hydrological processes however it has been stressed that satellites and radars only based datasets resulted in unsatisfactory daily streamflow simulation performances due to substantial rainfall estimation errors merging the advantages of rain gauges in radar and satellite products is an effective strategy for overcoming precipitation uncertainty while preserving spatial coverage ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 different methods and algorithms applied to radar and satellite products have remarkably improved the quality of precipitation estimates and

2020 ishizaki and matsuyama 2018 mega et al 2019 suzuki et al 2017 tashima et al 2020 the potential of the gsmap g in simulating streamflow using the swat model was evaluated only in a few works and limited over catchments in china and southeast asia deng et al 2019 dinh et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 while the potential of the r a product has not yet assessed in this study we evaluated the potential of the gsmap g and r a precipitation datasets to simulate daily streamflow using the swat model in the terauchi watershed a forested headwater catchment in southwestern japan the swat model was also applied using a gauge precipitation dataset that served for comparison the first part of the investigation compares the gsmap g and r a datasets with gauge observations at grid and catchment scales the second part assesses the performances of the swat model forced by the three precipitation datasets in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty the results of the present investigation should provide insights into the potential of the gsmap g and r a products in simulating daily streamflow using the swat model in a mountainous catchment with an extreme climate 2 study site and precipitation datasets 2 1 the terauchi catchment this study focused on the terauchi watershed in southwestern japan fig 1a the catchment was selected because it is a headwater of the chikugo river basin and therefore its streamflow is not significantly influenced by hydropower production or anthropogenic activities furthermore the area experienced frequent convective rainstorms during the rainy season in summer may july and the typhoon season in autumn august october the catchment drains approximately 51 km2 to the terauchi dam constructed downstream for flood protection and water supply purposes the study area is dominated by dense evergreen forests around 88 frs evergreen in fig 1d and brown forest soils approximately 92 fig 1e with an elevation varying between 115 and 725 m a s l fig 1c the climate is humid and subtropical with rainy summers mean annual precipitation and average temperature recorded from 2010 to 2019 at the asakura station located approximately 10 km to the southwest of the catchment were 2058 mm and about 16 c respectively 2 2 precipitation datasets 2 2 1 gauge precipitation dataset in japan the rain gauge network comprises thousands of rain gauges operated by the japanese meteorological agency jma and the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit of japan there are approximately 1300 weather stations with an average interval of 17 km operated by the jma kawase et al 2019 this network is known as the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas the mlit network comprises about 2800 rain gauges used for flood control and river management only four rain gauges are located in and around the terauchi catchment and accordingly were selected in the current study fig 1b rainfall data recorded before 2010 by one of the selected rain gauges are incomplete therefore we focused on the period 2010 2019 as an assessment period to ensure the completeness of all rainfall data 2 2 2 radar rain gauge analyzed precipitation dataset the japanese weather radar network includes 46 c band radars operated by the jma and mlit weather radars emit microwaves within a radius of hundreds of kilometers via a rotating antenna and observe the reflected echo intensities and doppler velocities every five minutes the backscattered signals are processed converted into precipitation estimates and merged with ground rain gauges to produce the radar rain gauge analyzed precipitation r a dataset nagata 2011 this product provides hourly cumulative rainfall with a spatial resolution of 5 km 1988 2001 2 5 km 2001 2005 and 1 km from 2006 the 5 km and 2 5 km r a datasets were produced based on data from 20 weather radars and the amedas rain gauges since 2006 the spatial resolution and prediction accuracy of the r a dataset has been improved due to including data from 26 weather radars managed by mlit and more rain gauges operated by mlit and local governments in the processing algorithm ishizaki and matsuyama 2018 suzuki et al 2017 assessed the accuracy of the 1 km r a dataset by comparing daily precipitation estimates with rainfall measurements at 498 rain gauges not included in the r a calibration algorithm from 2006 to 2013 and found a good correlation coefficient r 0 87 therefore it may accurately represent the spatial precipitation variability within the study area for evaluating the potential of the 1 km r a dataset in streamflow simulation we extracted the time series data 2010 2019 for each grid located inside and around the terauchi catchment fig 1b then we used it as rainfall inputs in the swat model 2 2 3 gauge adjusted global satellite mapping of precipitation dataset the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap project combines multiple satellite based precipitation estimates from passive microwave sensors and infrared radiometers to develop global hourly rainfall maps with a resolution of 0 1 kubota et al 2009 it is operated by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa under the global precipitation measures gpm mission the gsmap project provides different precipitation products standard near real time real time and reanalyzed with and without gauge adjustment these databases are produced by algorithms retrieving global precipitation estimates from satellites we employed the standard gauge calibrated gsmap product gsmap g produced by the gsmap algorithm ver 6 0 as input for the swat model by extracting the times series for each grid cell located inside and around the study area for 2010 2019 fig 1b this retrieval algorithm uses various attributes derived from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm precipitation radar pr to improve precipitation detection furthermore it adjusts the 24 h accumulated precipitation estimates to daily rain rates provided by the noaa climate prediction center cpc gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation data tashima et al 2020 to improve precipitation estimation this latter includes more than 16 000 rain gauges chen et al 2008 and none of them is located in or around our study area further information on the algorithm used for calibrating precipitation estimates is available in the algorithm theoretical basis document developed by the algorithm development team in jaxa jaxa 2014 3 methods 3 1 swat model 3 1 1 general description the swat model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture usda is a semi distributed process based model arnold et al 1998 it is operated on a watershed scale to simulate the time continuous changes in hydrological processes erosion vegetation yield and water quality and evaluate the impacts of land management practices the model requires geospatial topographic land use and soil data and temporal data precipitation temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation first the model uses the topographic data for delineating the study watershed after defining the watershed outlet then it discretizes the watershed into multiple sub basins depending on the threshold drainage area tda tda reflects the minimum upstream drainage area for channel origination lin et al 2020 subsequently each sub basin is subdivided into multiple lumped land units comprising unique land cover type soil class and slope combinations known as hydrological response units hrus all the processes in the swat model e g hydrology sediment dynamics plant growth and nutrients are governed by the water balance equation arnold et al 2012 eq 1 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil water content mm sw 0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm t is the time days r day is the amount of precipitation on day i mm q surf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm and q gw is the amount of return flow on day i mm detailed information on the simulation methods is available in the theoretical documentation of the swat model neitsch et al 2011 3 1 2 model setup and inputs this study uses the arcswat 2012 interface version 2012 10 4 24 to set up and parameterize the swat model the model inputs are listed and described in table 1 soil information was obtained from the soil database of the national institute for agro environmental sciences japan obara et al 2016 additionally the soil bulk density was estimated using nanko et al 2014 method based on the dem analysis a tda of 100 ha was used for discretizing the study area into 18 sub basins subsequently the thresholds of hru definition were set to 10 for land use soil and slope classes resulting in 72 hrus three precipitation datasets gauge r a gsmap g as described in section 2 2 have been used in this work we applied the swat model on a daily time step from 2010 to 2019 the first two years served as an equilibrium period to stabilize the initial soil water conditions abbaspour et al 2015 in each simulation the surface runoff was estimated using the curve number method developed by the soil conservation service scs 1972 the evapotranspiration was calculated using the hargreaves method requiring only temperature data hargreaves et al 1985 3 1 3 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated from 2012 to 2015 and validated from 2016 to 2019 for daily streamflow using observed daily discharge data at the outlet of the terauchi catchment these two durations were selected based on the average daily streamflow observed during both periods which did not change significantly before the calibration phase we performed a sensitivity analysis for several parameters that control the hydrological processes in the swat model the objective was to avoid over parameterization and determine the sensitive parameters in the terauchi catchment arnold et al 2012 the analysis was done using the latin hypercube one at a time lh oat method included within the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 procedure of the swat calibration uncertainty program swat cup the lh oat assesses the model sensitivity to a given parameter by varying the values of this parameter within a predefined uncertainty range while keeping the other parameters constant a detailed description of the method is available in abbaspour 2014 the baseflow recession factor alpha bf that partitions the total streamflow into surface runoff and baseflow was the most sensitive parameter in the terauchi catchment to reliably adjust this parameter and avoid the impact of auto calibration on streamflow simulation the alpha bf was fixed to 0 0415 in the three evaluated scenarios this value was retrieved using the automated flow separation method developed by arnold et al 1995 and the 10 year streamflow observations it indicates slow drainage and large storage in shallow aquifers wu and johnston 2007 the auto calibration step involved the other sensitive parameters that impact streamflow modeling by controlling the different hydrological processes table 2 it was performed with four iterations of 1000 simulations each using the sufi2 method in the first iteration the initial parameters intervals were quantified to physically reasonable uncertainty based on swat documentation neitsch et al 2011 after each iteration these intervals were narrowed to the new uncertainty ranges suggested by the suifi2 procedure the validation step evaluates the capability of the calibrated model to make sufficiently accurate streamflow simulations arnold et al 2012 it was performed using the fitted parameters obtained after the fourth calibration iteration and observed streamflow for 2016 2019 3 2 comparison of the precipitation datasets we evaluated the r a and gsmap g precipitation datasets at grid and catchment scales for 2010 2019 the daily data at four grid points where the rain gauges are located were extracted and compared with the gauge measurements using three quantitative statistics 1 the pearson correlation coefficient r measures the degree of collinearity 2 the percent bias pbias computes the average tendency of the merged datasets here negative values mean that the gsmap g or r a data are higher than the gauge measures 3 the root mean square error rmse computes the differences the equations used for calculating these metrics are available in appendix a furthermore we computed three categorical statistic metrics to assess the rainfall detection capabilities of the r a and gsmap g products these indicators are the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi the pod reveals the fraction of correctly detected precipitation occurrences the far indicates the fraction of falsely detected rains the csi represents the overall rains correctly detected by the gsmap or r a products the calculation methods are based on a 2 2 contingency table wilks 2011 and are detailed in appendix a at the catchment scale we first examined the daily precipitation inputs in the different models based on the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf then we evaluated the monthly variation of pbias and rmse that compared daily precipitation inputs from the r a and gsmap g products with those derived from the gauge dataset 3 3 hydrological evaluation of the precipitation datasets we evaluated the usefulness of the two gauge merged precipitation datasets in streamflow simulation by comparing the outputs of the r a and gsmap g scenarios to the gauge scenario and streamflow observations the comparison examines the model performance and prediction uncertainty 3 3 1 model performance the model performance was assessed by evaluating the goodness of fit between simulated and observed streamflow using four statistical indicators 1 the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient that calculates the quantity differences between the simulated streamflow and the observations nash and sutclifee 1970 2 the pbias that indicates an overestimation in the case of a negative value 3 the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr static that standardizes the rmse between simulated and observed streamflow to the standard deviation of the observations 4 the coefficient of determination r2 that describes the degree of collinearity between simulated and observed streamflow calculation equations are available in appendix a according to the values of these four statistical indicators the model performance was further judged following the performance evaluation criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 2015 for instance the model performance is deemed as satisfactory for flow simulation if 0 60 r2 0 75 0 50 nse 0 70 10 pbias 15 and 0 60 rsr 0 70 3 3 2 model prediction uncertainty uncertainties in streamflow simulation can be due to uncertain model inputs and parameters abbaspour et al 2015 biases in precipitation accuracy and spatial representation account for most of this uncertainty chao et al 2018 gassman et al 2007 therefore it is crucial to evaluate the prediction uncertainty associated with the different precipitation inputs in each scenario the streamflow prediction uncertainty was expressed as the final intervals of the calibrated parameters used by the suifi2 procedure at the final iteration of model calibration the suifi2 algorithm considers the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu at 2 5 and 97 5 of the cumulative probability distribution of the simulated streamflow derived through the latin hypercube sampling accordingly the model performance is represented by a set of good solutions expressed by the 95ppu instead of a single solution best simulation abbaspour et al 2015 the prediction uncertainty is assessed by computing two statistical indices p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2004 p factor represents the fraction of observed streamflow enveloped by the 95ppu a p factor 1 indicates that all the observations are bracketed by the 95ppu band r factor measures the thickness of the 95ppu band it computes the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu and the standard deviation of the observed streamflow a prediction uncertainty is acceptable if p factor 0 70 and r factor 1 5 abbaspour et al 2015 4 results 4 1 comparison of precipitation datasets the scatter plots in figs 2 and 3 compare daily precipitation data from the r a and gsmap g datasets with rain gauge observations for 2010 2019 the precipitation data estimated by the two gauge merged datasets were in good agreement with those measured by rain gauges r 90 for the r a dataset and r 80 for the gsmap g dataset the r a dataset overestimated daily rainfall pbias 38 28 to 15 89 conversely the gsmap g dataset underestimated the precipitation pbias 4 30 18 73 except at the yoshii station this underestimation was well noted for precipitation 100 mm d and convective rainfall events experienced in the area e g rainfall events of 2017 07 05 2012 07 14 and 2010 07 13 compared to the r a dataset the gsmap g dataset exhibited larger errors in estimating the precipitation rmse 8 92 11 64 mm d the categorical indicators computed using a rain no rain threshold of 1 mm at the four rain gauges are illustrated in fig 4 the r a dataset outperformed the gsmap g product in detecting rainfall during the observation period the r a dataset exhibited good rainfall detection scores average pod 0 87 average far 0 17 average csi 0 75 demonstrating its ability to correctly detect rainy days on the other hand the gsmap product presented lower rainfall detection accuracy with an average pod of 0 50 and an average far of 0 40 resulting in a low average csi of 0 37 at the catchment scale the daily precipitation inputs averaged over the terauchi catchment from the three datasets are compared in fig 5 the three precipitation datasets exhibited different occurrence probabilities for dry and rainy days the highest difference was for the occurrence of dry days precipitation 0 the r a and gsmap g datasets indicated a lower chance of dry days about 40 than the gauge dataset about 60 the occurrence probabilities of rainy days with less than 200 mm of precipitation did not differ significantly fig 5b the fractions of rainy days with extreme daily precipitation rainfall 200 mm day were low compared to the rain gauge scenario the r a dataset overestimated the intensities of these extremes while the gsmap g product underestimated them fig 6 further examines the monthly variation of pbias and rmse that compared daily precipitation inputs from the r a and gsmap g products with those derived from the gauge dataset the r a product introduced daily rain rates over the terauchi catchment higher than the gauge dataset regardless of the season as shown by the negative mean pbias in the case of the gsmap g dataset daily rainfall averaged over the study area varied between overestimated and underestimated with a significant underestimation during july and august about 20 the gsmap g dataset resulted in larger daily precipitation errors than the r a product regardless of the season these errors are significant during the rainy and typhoon seasons may october in july when many extreme rainfalls occurred over the study area the mean daily precipitation rmse was about 19 mm h for the gsmap g while it was around 9 mm d for the r a scenario according to the differences in precipitation inputs we expect disparate simulated hydrographs compared to streamflow observations 4 2 performance of the swat model using different precipitation datasets fig 7 compares the observed and simulated daily streamflow for the three scenarios during calibration and validation periods overall all simulations captured the seasonal patterns of daily streamflow the hydrographs showed a satisfactory agreement between daily observed and simulated streamflow all the simulations underestimated flow peaks greater than 60 m3 s which generally present low occurrence probability the tendency of the three precipitation datasets to underestimate these flow peaks was as the following gsmap g greater than gauge greater than r a the zoom in plots of the hydrographs on july 2012 july 2017 july 2018 and august 2019 clearly show this underestimation and are presented in figure b1 appendix b table 3 summarizes the values of statistical indicators used for evaluating the performances of the three simulation scenarios the gauge and r a based simulations outperformed the gsmap g in simulating daily streamflow at the outlet of the terauchi catchment during the calibration and validation periods the nse values were between 0 84 and 0 91 for the gauge and r a models while the nse value was 0 54 for the gsmap g scenario the gauge and gsmap g scenarios underestimated daily streamflow by 16 70 20 00 and 29 30 35 80 respectively conversely the r a dataset resulted in an overestimation of 2 60 11 20 according to the recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 2015 the r a scenario achieved very good performances in simulating streamflow trends r2 and nse and residual variations rsr and satisfactory performance in simulating average magnitudes pbias this latter improved to very good during the validation period the gauge based model reached very good performances in terms of nse and rsr and good performance in terms of r2 however it showed a non satisfactory performance in simulating average magnitudes pbias on the other hand the performance of the gsmap g model was satisfactory in simulating streamflow trends r2 and nse and residual variation and non satisfactory in simulating average magnitudes fig 8 shows that the three precipitation datasets resulted in different streamflow cdf curves especially for daily discharge less than 6 m3 s more than 90 of streamflow records and daily flow greater than 60 m3 s for daily streamflow lower than 1 m3 s the cumulative fractions exhibited by the simulations were higher than the observations from 1 m3 s the cdf of the r a product deviated from the others to show lower cumulative fractions of simulated daily streamflow these differences suggested that the performance of the evaluated precipitation datasets varied depending on streamflow intensity therefore to better understand this variation we categorized the daily observed streamflow into four ranges talchabhadel et al 2021 based on the occurrence exceedance probability oep 1 extremely high oep 0 1 high oep 1 10 average oep 10 60 and low oep 60 100 for each streamflow zone the performance of each scenario was evaluated by computing the pbias and rmse between simulated and observed discharge table 4 the three models underestimated extremely high streamflow with an advantage to the r a simulation that represented the lowest biases pbias 17 45 and errors rmse 16 55 m3 s for the high and average streamflow ranges the gauge and gsmap g datasets underestimated daily streamflow pbias 8 85 25 74 with an rmse range of 0 83 4 84 m3 s conversely the r a model overestimated daily streamflow by 9 10 20 25 as shown in the pbias values and introduced simulation rmse of 1 07 3 33 m3 s for the low streamflow category the gauge and gsmap g scenarios significantly underestimated daily streamflow pbias 35 24 and 48 05 respectively on the other hand the r a dataset resulted in a pbias of 3 10 meaning an overestimation of daily streamflow 4 3 uncertainty in streamflow simulation the uncertainty analysis was performed for the three simulations using the sufi2 procedure the values of p factor and r factor computed for evaluating the prediction uncertainty are shown in table 3 the three tested datasets presented a narrow 95ppu envelope r factor 0 22 0 35 during the calibration and validation periods considering the p factor that measures the fraction of observed streamflow within the 95ppu band the r a based model exhibited the lowest prediction uncertainty with a p factor of 0 71 for the calibration step and 0 69 for the validation step the gauge and gsmap g models did not reach an acceptable prediction uncertainty being their p factor was less than 0 70 the fitted value and range of uncertainty of each parameter used in the calibration process are shown in fig 9 overall the three precipitation datasets used in this study resulted in different fitted values and uncertainty ranges cn2 the most sensitive parameter of the auto calibrated parameters was raised by more than 35 in all models to increase surface runoff similar results were shown for the soil bulk density soil bd parameter that controls surface runoff and baseflow in all simulations the value of sol bd was raised by more than 45 to increase the surface runoff and decrease base flow this increase was accompanied by a significant reduction of the soil available water capacity sol awc and a high overland manning n coefficient ov n that influences the timing and volume of flow peaks the saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k indicates the ease of water movement through the soil profile slsubbsn and hru slp parameters are related to the topographic conditions in the study area together with the lateral flow travel time lat ttime these three parameters impact lateral flow contribution to streamflow during the calibration process lat ttime was low in all the simulations 1 78 10 70 days in the gauge scenario the sol k and hru slp were increased by 34 21 and 27 48 respectively allowing more lateral flow to the total streamflow a similar trend was also observed for the r a simulation with a slight increase in sol k and hru slp conversely the calibration of the gsmap g model resulted in an opposite tendency for reducing the contribution of lateral flow to the total streamflow gwqmn gw delay and revapmn parameters control the groundwater contribution to streamflow within the terauchi catchment alpha bnk the bank flow recession constant determines the water contribution from bank storage to the main channel while the three models shared relatively similar alpha bnk we noted significant variability in values and uncertainty ranges of the groundwater parameters compared to the gauge and r a models gwqmn in the gsmap g scenario was lower gwqmn 707 01 mm while gw delay and revapmn were higher gw delay 337 79 days revapmn 941 83 mm the differences in fitted parameters resulted in different groundwater contributions to the catchment water balance esco and epco determine water allocation between evaporation and percolation the esco parameter that governs soil evaporation within the swat model presented different fitted values in the three models it was close to 0 70 in the gauge model indicating low soil evaporation however it was calibrated to 0 39 and 0 22 for the r a and gsmap g models resulting in increased evaporation and thus high potential evapotranspiration on the other hand all the three models shared relatively low epco allowing plant water uptake from the upper soil profile ch n2 and ch k2 correspond to manning s n coefficient and hydraulic conductivity for the main channel the calibrated values of the ch n2 in the three models were in the range of 0 050 0 15 indicating that the main channel is mainly covered by heavy timber and brush the ch k2 in the gauge and r a scenarios reflected a moderately high loss rate however it suggested a moderate loss rate in the case of the gsmap g model 4 4 performances of the swat model using fixed parameters the present analysis was carried out to avoid any possible bias caused by the auto calibration of different input parameters in the swat model we averaged the fitted parameters obtained for the three tested precipitation datasets subsequently we run the swat model using the calibrated and averaged parameters for the total observation period table c1 table c2 summarizes the performance indicators computed for the three simulations using fixed parameters the performance of the gauge and r a models slightly decreased similar to the results obtained using calibrated parameters the r a model ranked the best in terms of streamflow simulation nse 0 89 followed by the gauge scenario nse 0 83 on the other hand the gsmap g scenario was sensitive to the change in model parameters as its performance was lowered by 6 to become non satisfactory with an nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the r a and gsmap g precipitation datasets the statistical comparison between daily r a precipitation estimates and gauge measurements revealed a strong correlation r 90 and accurate rainfall detection csi 0 74 literature showed that radar based precipitation estimates are usually lower than gauge based measurements schleiss et al 2020 seo et al 2015 however the r a dataset used in the present study showed an opposite tendency as shown in fig 2 the r a datasets overestimated the precipitation by 15 38 in comparison with rain gauge measurements causing higher average rainfall input in the swat model year round fig 6 similarly several previous comparisons demonstrated an overestimation of about 20 for the r a product ishizaki and matsuyama 2018 urita et al 2011 this overestimation can be originated from the adjustment algorithm used for calibrating radars precipitation estimates by local rain gauge measurements indeed the calibration process adopts the maximum value method which selects the highest value when comparing grid point estimates and rain gauge measurements makihara 2000 similar to the r a dataset gsmap g precipitation estimates were in good agreement with gauge measurements r 80 fig 3 however rainfall detection accuracy was significantly lower csi 0 37 and daily estimates were generally underestimated causing less water input in the swat model especially in july and august figs 5 and 6a the low rainfall detection generally originated from sampling errors in the passive microwave images kubota et al 2009 it is also related to the limitations of infrared and microwave sensors in capturing orographic localized and convective rainfall events hayashi et al 2021 nepal et al 2021 this was reflected in the significant rainfall estimation errors rmse by the gsmap g over the terauchi catchment which was observed during the rainy and typhoon seasons may october when heavy and orographic rainfalls are frequent fig 6b these estimation uncertainties implied the inefficiency of calibrating precipitation estimates based on only the 24 h accumulated rainfall amounts derived from the noaa cpc rain gauge based product they further suggested the need for updating the bias adjustment algorithm mega et al 2019 and the orographic rainfall correction scheme yamamoto and shige 2015 or the use of more local rain gauges deng et al 2019 to improve the quality of the product and extreme rainfall detection 5 2 implication of the selection of precipitation datasets in streamflow simulation the three precipitation datasets evaluated in the current study presented different measures detection accuracy and spatial representation of the rainfall r a approximately 1 km2 gauge around 400 cm2 gsmap g about 120 km2 these differences resulted in disparate rainfall inputs e g dry days fractions and daily rainfall volume over the catchment to the swat model and different streamflow simulation outputs from the statistical indicators shown in table 3 it was clear that the r a dataset outperformed the other evaluated datasets in simulating daily streamflow at the terauchi catchment the low gsmap g model performance nse 0 54 was faced with significantly higher performance in the case of the gauge dataset nse 0 84 this significant difference was also observed during the fixed parameters model test table c2 therefore it is most likely due to the intrinsic underestimation of rainfall originating from the gsmap g product knowing that the two datasets presented a similar spatial resolution this finding is consistent with the study of deng et al 2019 who revealed the outperformance of the gauge based model on the gsmap g dataset in a large basin 159 000 km2 in china extremely high oep 1 and low oep 60 flow events are generally difficult to reproduce in the swat model tan et al 2020 these issues were reflected by the different occurrence fractions of daily streamflow less than 2 m3 s in the simulations compared to the observations and the underestimation of flow peaks greater than 60 m3 s figs 7 and 8 one of the reasons is using only the nse as an objective function during the auto calibration process that reduced the mean differences and variances between simulated and observed streamflow but neglected the possible deviations in low flow periods krause et al 2005 the r a product partially overcame these issues as it improved the simulation of extremely high and low flow events table 4 compared to the gauge and gsmap g datasets this outperformance may not be only at the catchment scale but also at the sub basin scale the great performance of the r a dataset was due to the high spatial resolution of the product 1 km and the effective algorithm used for observing extreme rainfalls indeed the high spatial resolution of the r a product assists in capturing the detailed spatial features of precipitation in particular the extreme convective events hirokawa et al 2020 kato 2020 sueki and kajikawa 2019 tsuguti et al 2019 responsible for the extremely high flow events in the study area this led to overcoming the limitations of ground gauges in terms of spatial representation and measurement accuracy during extreme climatic conditions the benefits of the r a precipitation dataset in the swat model may therefore exceed the improvement of streamflow simulation to reach the study of hydro climatic extremes i e floods droughts similar findings were also stated for a 2 km radar rain gauge adjusted product in korea cha and lee 2021 although the study area presents static characteristics i e land use soil type topography during the simulation period the evaluated precipitation datasets resulted in different model parameterization and discharge flux fig 9 this is not surprising since the auto calibration used in this study considered a wide range of uncertainty to search for the best set of parameters that optimize the fitting between observed and simulated streamflow this variation leads to uncertain interpretations of the hydrological processes in the terauchi catchment the uncertainty can propagate towards other processes e g sediment dynamics and contaminant transport price et al 2014 it would therefore affect the decision making and may lead to different management and mitigation strategies the situation would be more significant for the gsmap g dataset which was the most sensitive to model parameterization therefore the precipitation datasets in hydrological modeling should be selected with caution considering their uncertainties and limitations 6 conclusions motivated by the potential of gauge calibrated precipitation datasets in capturing the spatial pattern of rainfall with high accuracy and resolution we investigated the usefulness of two datasets radar based r a and satellite based gsmap g as input in the swat for daily streamflow simulation the work focuses on the terauchi watershed a medium size mountainous catchment in southwestern japan the research outcomes are in the following points the r a precipitation data were in good agreement with gauge observations however they are overestimated the gsmap g underestimated the rainfall while found to be in correlation with gauge observations the performance of the swat model forced with the three different precipitation datasets was as the following r a gauge gsmap g the r a based model was the most performant in simulating the streamflow with an nse of 88 the r a based model improved the simulation of extremely high oep 1 and low oep 60 streamflow events the three precipitation datasets resulted in different simulation outputs and model parameterization overall this work reveals the outperformance of the r a product compared to the gsmap g and gauge datasets in accurately representing the spatial variability of rainfall within the terauchi catchment 51 km2 and improving daily streamflow simulation using the swat model however the study outcomes are case specific and expected to be true only in catchments with climate and scale similar to our study area in a larger basin the performance of the gauge dataset can be improved due to a higher rain gauge density tan and yang 2020 which may lead to different conclusions regarding the best precipitation dataset in terms of streamflow modeling accuracy furthermore the performances of the r a and gsmap g products in other study sites with different topographic conditions and climate regimes e g temperate and subarctic may change due to the climate and attitude dependent propagation of precipitation uncertainty fallah et al 2020 nepal et al 2021 future research efforts should aim to validate the added value of the r a product in improving streamflow simulation by focusing on other study areas with different climate and topographic conditions furthermore they should assess the potential of other satellite based datasets like the gpm imerg product which outperformed the gsmap g in representing the spatial precipitation variability hsu et al

their capability to improve streamflow simulation using the soil and water assessment tool swat model a third dataset includes measurements from local rain gauges used for producing the r a database but not the gsmap g product was prepared for comparison reasons the r a and gsmap g data were first compared to gauge observations the performance and prediction uncertainty of the swat model forced

calibration the r a performed best nse 88 91 followed by the gauge nse 84 and gsmap g nse 54 scenarios the r a product improved the overall simulation performance by 6 50 and 62 40 in terms of nse and absolute percent bias compared to the gauge model the performance of the evaluated datasets varied depending on streamflow occurrence exceedance probability oep the r a dataset improved the simulation

significant negative bias during windy weather and intense rainfall conditions that generate water losses and erratic behavior of the gauge system cha and lee 2021 tobin and bennett 2009 zhong et al 2016 these drawbacks lead to an inaccurate spatial representation of the precipitation that may impact the simulation outputs advances in remote sensing technologies weather radars and satellites make up for the limitations of rain gauges by allowing a spatial observation of the precipitation these technologies provide rainfall estimates with high spatial and temporal resolutions at global and regional scales sun et al 2018 that can emerge as promising alternatives for gauge based data in hydrological models several studies have evaluated the performance of radar and satellite precipitation products using the soil and water assessment tool swat model arnold et al 1998 as it is one of the most acknowledged models tan et al 2021 and references therein the studies findings showed the usefulness of these alternatives in simulating hydrological processes however it has been stressed that satellites and radars only based datasets resulted in unsatisfactory daily streamflow simulation

2020 ishizaki and matsuyama 2018 mega et al 2019 suzuki et al 2017 tashima et al 2020 the potential of the gsmap g in simulating streamflow using the swat model was evaluated only in a few works and limited over catchments in china and southeast asia deng et al 2019 dinh et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 while the potential of the r a product has not yet assessed in this study we evaluated the potential of the gsmap g and r a precipitation datasets to simulate daily streamflow using the swat model in the terauchi watershed a forested headwater catchment in southwestern japan the swat model was also applied using a gauge precipitation dataset that served for comparison the first part of the investigation compares the gsmap g and r a datasets with gauge observations at grid and catchment scales the second part assesses the performances of the swat model forced by the three precipitation datasets in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty the results of the present investigation should provide insights into the potential of the gsmap g and r a products in simulating daily streamflow using the swat model in a mountainous catchment with an extreme climate 2 study site and precipitation datasets 2 1 the terauchi catchment this study focused on the terauchi watershed in southwestern japan fig 1a the catchment was selected because it is a headwater of the chikugo river basin and therefore its streamflow is not significantly influenced by hydropower production or anthropogenic activities furthermore the area experienced frequent convective rainstorms during the rainy season in summer may july and the typhoon season in autumn august october the catchment drains approximately 51 km2 to the terauchi dam constructed downstream for flood protection and water supply purposes the study area is dominated by dense evergreen forests around 88 frs evergreen in fig 1d and brown forest soils approximately 92 fig 1e with an elevation varying between 115 and 725 m a s l fig 1c the climate is humid and subtropical with rainy summers mean annual precipitation and average temperature recorded from 2010 to 2019 at the asakura station located approximately 10 km to the southwest of the catchment were 2058 mm and about 16 c respectively 2 2 precipitation datasets 2 2 1 gauge precipitation dataset in japan the rain gauge network comprises thousands of rain gauges operated by the japanese meteorological agency jma and the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit of japan there are approximately 1300 weather stations with an average interval of 17 km operated by the jma kawase et al 2019 this network is known as the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas the mlit network comprises about 2800 rain gauges used for flood control and river management only four rain gauges are located in and around the terauchi catchment and accordingly were selected in the current study fig 1b rainfall data recorded before 2010 by one of the selected rain gauges are incomplete therefore we focused on the period 2010 2019 as an assessment period to ensure the completeness of all rainfall data 2 2 2 radar rain gauge analyzed precipitation dataset the japanese weather radar network includes 46 c band radars operated by the jma and mlit weather radars emit microwaves within a radius of hundreds of kilometers via a rotating antenna and observe the reflected echo intensities and doppler velocities every five minutes the backscattered signals are processed converted into precipitation estimates and merged with ground rain gauges to produce the radar rain gauge analyzed precipitation r a dataset nagata 2011 this product provides hourly cumulative rainfall with a spatial resolution of 5 km 1988 2001 2 5 km 2001 2005 and 1 km from 2006 the 5 km and 2 5 km r a datasets were produced based on data from 20 weather radars and the amedas rain gauges since 2006 the spatial resolution and prediction accuracy of the r a dataset has been improved due to including data from 26 weather radars managed by mlit and more rain gauges operated by mlit and local governments in the processing algorithm ishizaki and matsuyama 2018 suzuki et al 2017 assessed the accuracy of the 1 km r a dataset by comparing daily precipitation estimates with rainfall measurements at 498 rain gauges not included in the r a calibration algorithm from 2006 to 2013 and found a good correlation coefficient r 0 87 therefore it may accurately represent the spatial precipitation variability within the study area for evaluating the potential of the 1 km r a dataset in streamflow simulation we extracted the time series data 2010 2019 for each grid located inside and around the terauchi catchment fig 1b then we used it as rainfall inputs in the swat model 2 2 3 gauge adjusted global satellite mapping of precipitation dataset the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap project combines multiple satellite based precipitation estimates from passive microwave sensors and infrared radiometers to develop global hourly rainfall maps with a resolution of 0 1 kubota et al 2009 it is operated by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa under the global precipitation measures gpm mission the gsmap project provides different precipitation products standard near real time real time and reanalyzed with and without gauge adjustment these databases are produced by algorithms retrieving global precipitation estimates from satellites we employed the standard gauge calibrated gsmap product gsmap g produced by the gsmap algorithm ver 6 0 as input for the swat model by extracting the times series for each grid cell located inside and around the study area for 2010 2019 fig 1b this retrieval algorithm uses various attributes derived from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm precipitation radar pr to improve precipitation detection furthermore it adjusts the 24 h accumulated precipitation estimates to daily rain rates provided by the noaa climate prediction center cpc gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation data tashima et al 2020 to improve precipitation estimation this latter includes more than 16 000 rain gauges chen et al 2008 and none of them is located in or around our study area further information on the algorithm used for calibrating precipitation estimates is available in the algorithm theoretical basis document developed by the algorithm development team in jaxa jaxa 2014 3 methods 3 1 swat model 3 1 1 general description the swat model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture usda is a semi distributed process based model arnold et al 1998 it is operated on a watershed scale to simulate the time continuous changes in hydrological processes erosion vegetation yield and water quality and evaluate the impacts of land management practices the model requires geospatial topographic land use and soil data and temporal data precipitation temperature wind speed humidity and solar radiation first the model uses the topographic data for delineating the study watershed after defining the watershed outlet then it discretizes the watershed into multiple sub basins depending on the threshold drainage area tda tda reflects the minimum upstream drainage area for channel origination lin et al 2020 subsequently each sub basin is subdivided into multiple lumped land units comprising unique land cover type soil class and slope combinations known as hydrological response units hrus all the processes in the swat model e g hydrology sediment dynamics plant growth and nutrients are governed by the water balance equation arnold et al 2012 eq 1 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil water content mm sw 0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm t is the time days r day is the amount of precipitation on day i mm q surf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm e a is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm and q gw is the amount of return flow on day i mm detailed information on the simulation methods is available in the theoretical documentation of the swat model neitsch et al 2011 3 1 2 model setup and inputs this study uses the arcswat 2012 interface version 2012 10 4 24 to set up and parameterize the swat model the model inputs are listed and described in table 1 soil information was obtained from the soil database of the national institute for agro environmental sciences japan obara et al 2016 additionally the soil bulk density was estimated using nanko et al 2014 method based on the dem analysis a tda of 100 ha was used for discretizing the study area into 18 sub basins subsequently the thresholds of hru definition were set to 10 for land use soil and slope classes resulting in 72 hrus three precipitation datasets gauge r a gsmap g as described in section 2 2 have been used in this work we applied the swat model on a daily time step from 2010 to 2019 the first two years served as an equilibrium period to stabilize the initial soil water conditions abbaspour et al 2015 in each simulation the surface runoff was estimated using the curve number method developed by the soil conservation service scs 1972 the evapotranspiration was calculated using the hargreaves method requiring only temperature data hargreaves et al 1985 3 1 3 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated from 2012 to 2015 and validated from 2016 to 2019 for daily streamflow using observed daily discharge data at the outlet of the terauchi catchment these two durations were selected based on the average daily streamflow observed during both periods which did not change significantly before the calibration phase we performed a sensitivity analysis for several parameters that control the hydrological processes in the swat model the objective was to avoid over parameterization and determine the sensitive parameters in the terauchi catchment arnold et al 2012 the analysis was done using the latin hypercube one at a time lh oat method included within the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 procedure of the swat calibration uncertainty program swat cup the lh oat assesses the model sensitivity to a given parameter by varying the values of this parameter within a predefined uncertainty range while keeping the other parameters constant a detailed description of the method is available in abbaspour 2014 the baseflow recession factor alpha bf that partitions the total streamflow into surface runoff and baseflow was the most sensitive parameter in the terauchi catchment to reliably adjust this parameter and avoid the impact of auto calibration on streamflow simulation the alpha bf was fixed to 0 0415 in the three evaluated scenarios this value was retrieved using the automated flow separation method developed by arnold et al 1995 and the 10 year streamflow observations it indicates slow drainage and large storage in shallow aquifers wu and johnston 2007 the auto calibration step involved the other sensitive parameters that impact streamflow modeling by controlling the different hydrological processes table 2 it was performed with four iterations of 1000 simulations each using the sufi2 method in the first iteration the initial parameters intervals were quantified to physically reasonable uncertainty based on swat documentation neitsch et al 2011 after each iteration these intervals were narrowed to the new uncertainty ranges suggested by the suifi2 procedure the validation step evaluates the capability of the calibrated model to make sufficiently accurate streamflow simulations arnold et al 2012 it was performed using the fitted parameters obtained after the fourth calibration iteration and observed streamflow for 2016 2019 3 2 comparison of the precipitation datasets we evaluated the r a and gsmap g precipitation datasets at grid and catchment scales for 2010 2019 the daily data at four grid points where the rain gauges are located were extracted and compared with the gauge measurements using three quantitative statistics 1 the pearson correlation coefficient r measures the degree of collinearity 2 the percent bias pbias computes the average tendency of the merged datasets here negative values mean that the gsmap g or r a data are higher than the gauge measures 3 the root mean square error rmse computes the differences the equations used for calculating these metrics are available in appendix a furthermore we computed three categorical statistic metrics to assess the rainfall detection capabilities of the r a and gsmap g products these indicators are the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi the pod reveals the fraction of correctly detected precipitation occurrences the far indicates the fraction of falsely detected rains the csi represents the overall rains correctly detected by the gsmap or r a products the calculation methods are based on a 2 2 contingency table wilks 2011 and are detailed in appendix a at the catchment scale we first examined the daily precipitation inputs in the different models based on the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf then we evaluated the monthly variation of pbias and rmse that compared daily precipitation inputs from the r a and gsmap g products with those derived from the gauge dataset 3 3 hydrological evaluation of the precipitation datasets we evaluated the usefulness of the two gauge merged precipitation datasets in streamflow simulation by comparing the outputs of the r a and gsmap g scenarios to the gauge scenario and streamflow observations the comparison examines the model performance and prediction uncertainty 3 3 1 model performance the model performance was assessed by evaluating the goodness of fit between simulated and observed streamflow using four statistical indicators 1 the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient that calculates the quantity differences between the simulated streamflow and the observations nash and sutclifee 1970 2 the pbias that indicates an overestimation in the case of a negative value 3 the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr static that standardizes the rmse between simulated and observed streamflow to the standard deviation of the observations 4 the coefficient of determination r2 that describes the degree of collinearity between simulated and observed streamflow calculation equations are available in appendix a according to the values of these four statistical indicators the model performance was further judged following the performance evaluation criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 2015 for instance the model performance is deemed as satisfactory for flow simulation if 0 60 r2 0 75 0 50 nse 0 70 10 pbias 15 and 0 60 rsr 0 70 3 3 2 model prediction uncertainty uncertainties in streamflow simulation can be due to uncertain model inputs and parameters abbaspour et al 2015 biases in precipitation accuracy and spatial representation account for most of this uncertainty chao et al 2018 gassman et al 2007 therefore it is crucial to evaluate the prediction uncertainty associated with the different precipitation inputs in each scenario the streamflow prediction uncertainty was expressed as the final intervals of the calibrated parameters used by the suifi2 procedure at the final iteration of model calibration the suifi2 algorithm considers the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu at 2 5 and 97 5 of the cumulative probability distribution of the simulated streamflow derived through the latin hypercube sampling accordingly the model performance is represented by a set of good solutions expressed by the 95ppu instead of a single solution best simulation abbaspour et al 2015 the prediction uncertainty is assessed by computing two statistical indices p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2004 p factor represents the fraction of observed streamflow enveloped by the 95ppu a p factor 1 indicates that all the observations are bracketed by the 95ppu band r factor measures the thickness of the 95ppu band it computes the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu and the standard deviation of the observed streamflow a prediction uncertainty is acceptable if p factor 0 70 and r factor 1 5 abbaspour et al 2015 4 results 4 1 comparison of precipitation datasets the scatter plots in figs 2 and 3 compare daily precipitation data from the r a and gsmap g datasets with rain gauge observations for 2010 2019 the precipitation data estimated by the two gauge merged datasets were in good agreement with those measured by rain gauges r 90 for the r a dataset and r 80 for the gsmap g dataset the r a dataset overestimated daily rainfall pbias 38 28 to 15 89 conversely the gsmap g dataset underestimated the precipitation pbias 4 30 18 73 except at the yoshii station this underestimation was well noted for precipitation 100 mm d and convective rainfall events experienced in the area e g rainfall events of 2017 07 05 2012 07 14 and 2010 07 13 compared to the r a dataset the gsmap g dataset exhibited larger errors in estimating the precipitation rmse 8 92 11 64 mm d the categorical indicators computed using a rain no rain threshold of 1 mm at the four rain gauges are illustrated in fig 4 the r a dataset outperformed the gsmap g product in detecting rainfall during the observation period the r a dataset exhibited good rainfall detection scores average pod 0 87 average far 0 17 average csi 0 75 demonstrating its ability to correctly detect rainy days on the other hand the gsmap product presented lower rainfall detection accuracy with an average pod of 0 50 and an average far of 0 40 resulting in a low average csi of 0 37 at the catchment scale the daily precipitation inputs averaged over the terauchi catchment from the three datasets are compared in fig 5 the three precipitation datasets exhibited different occurrence probabilities for dry and rainy days the highest difference was for the occurrence of dry days precipitation 0 the r a and gsmap g datasets indicated a lower chance of dry days about 40 than the gauge dataset about 60 the occurrence probabilities of rainy days with less than 200 mm of precipitation did not differ significantly fig 5b the fractions of rainy days with extreme daily precipitation rainfall 200 mm day were low compared to the rain gauge scenario the r a dataset overestimated the intensities of these extremes while the gsmap g product underestimated them fig 6 further examines the monthly variation of pbias and rmse that compared daily precipitation inputs from the r a and gsmap g products with those derived from the gauge dataset the r a product introduced daily rain rates over the terauchi catchment higher than the gauge dataset regardless of the season as shown by the negative mean pbias in the case of the gsmap g dataset daily rainfall averaged over the study area varied between overestimated and underestimated with a significant underestimation during july and august about 20 the gsmap g dataset resulted in larger daily precipitation errors than the r a product regardless of the season these errors are significant during the rainy and typhoon seasons may october in july when many extreme rainfalls occurred over the study area the mean daily precipitation rmse was about 19 mm h for the gsmap g while it was around 9 mm d for the r a scenario according to the differences in precipitation inputs we expect disparate simulated hydrographs compared to streamflow observations 4 2 performance of the swat model using different precipitation datasets fig 7 compares the observed and simulated daily streamflow for the three scenarios during calibration and validation periods overall all simulations captured the seasonal patterns of daily streamflow the hydrographs showed a satisfactory agreement between daily observed and simulated streamflow all the simulations underestimated flow peaks greater than 60 m3 s which generally present low occurrence probability the tendency of the three precipitation datasets to underestimate these flow peaks was as the following gsmap g greater than gauge greater than r a the zoom in plots of the hydrographs on july 2012 july 2017 july 2018 and august 2019 clearly show this underestimation and are presented in figure b1 appendix b table 3 summarizes the values of statistical indicators used for evaluating the performances of the three simulation scenarios the gauge and r a based simulations outperformed the gsmap g in simulating daily streamflow at the outlet of the terauchi catchment during the calibration and validation periods the nse values were between 0 84 and 0 91 for the gauge and r a models while the nse value was 0 54 for the gsmap g scenario the gauge and gsmap g scenarios underestimated daily streamflow by 16 70 20 00 and 29 30 35 80 respectively conversely the r a dataset resulted in an overestimation of 2 60 11 20 according to the recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 2015 the r a scenario achieved very good performances in simulating streamflow trends r2 and nse and residual variations rsr and satisfactory performance in simulating average magnitudes pbias this latter improved to very good during the validation period the gauge based model reached very good performances in terms of nse and rsr and good performance in terms of r2 however it showed a non satisfactory performance in simulating average magnitudes pbias on the other hand the performance of the gsmap g model was satisfactory in simulating streamflow trends r2 and nse and residual variation and non satisfactory in simulating average magnitudes fig 8 shows that the three precipitation datasets resulted in different streamflow cdf curves especially for daily discharge less than 6 m3 s more than 90 of streamflow records and daily flow greater than 60 m3 s for daily streamflow lower than 1 m3 s the cumulative fractions exhibited by the simulations were higher than the observations from 1 m3 s the cdf of the r a product deviated from the others to show lower cumulative fractions of simulated daily streamflow these differences suggested that the performance of the evaluated precipitation datasets varied depending on streamflow intensity therefore to better understand this variation we categorized the daily observed streamflow into four ranges talchabhadel et al 2021 based on the occurrence exceedance probability oep 1 extremely high oep 0 1 high oep 1 10 average oep 10 60 and low oep 60 100 for each streamflow zone the performance of each scenario was evaluated by computing the pbias and rmse between simulated and observed discharge table 4 the three models underestimated extremely high streamflow with an advantage to the r a simulation that represented the lowest biases pbias 17 45 and errors rmse 16 55 m3 s for the high and average streamflow ranges the gauge and gsmap g datasets underestimated daily streamflow pbias 8 85 25 74 with an rmse range of 0 83 4 84 m3 s conversely the r a model overestimated daily streamflow by 9 10 20 25 as shown in the pbias values and introduced simulation rmse of 1 07 3 33 m3 s for the low streamflow category the gauge and gsmap g scenarios significantly underestimated daily streamflow pbias 35 24 and 48 05 respectively on the other hand the r a dataset resulted in a pbias of 3 10 meaning an overestimation of daily streamflow 4 3 uncertainty in streamflow simulation the uncertainty analysis was performed for the three simulations using the sufi2 procedure the values of p factor and r factor computed for evaluating the prediction uncertainty are shown in table 3 the three tested datasets presented a narrow 95ppu envelope r factor 0 22 0 35 during the calibration and validation periods considering the p factor that measures the fraction of observed streamflow within the 95ppu band the r a based model exhibited the lowest prediction uncertainty with a p factor of 0 71 for the calibration step and 0 69 for the validation step the gauge and gsmap g models did not reach an acceptable prediction uncertainty being their p factor was less than 0 70 the fitted value and range of uncertainty of each parameter used in the calibration process are shown in fig 9 overall the three precipitation datasets used in this study resulted in different fitted values and uncertainty ranges cn2 the most sensitive parameter of the auto calibrated parameters was raised by more than 35 in all models to increase surface runoff similar results were shown for the soil bulk density soil bd parameter that controls surface runoff and baseflow in all simulations the value of sol bd was raised by more than 45 to increase the surface runoff and decrease base flow this increase was accompanied by a significant reduction of the soil available water capacity sol awc and a high overland manning n coefficient ov n that influences the timing and volume of flow peaks the saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k indicates the ease of water movement through the soil profile slsubbsn and hru slp parameters are related to the topographic conditions in the study area together with the lateral flow travel time lat ttime these three parameters impact lateral flow contribution to streamflow during the calibration process lat ttime was low in all the simulations 1 78 10 70 days in the gauge scenario the sol k and hru slp were increased by 34 21 and 27 48 respectively allowing more lateral flow to the total streamflow a similar trend was also observed for the r a simulation with a slight increase in sol k and hru slp conversely the calibration of the gsmap g model resulted in an opposite tendency for reducing the contribution of lateral flow to the total streamflow gwqmn gw delay and revapmn parameters control the groundwater contribution to streamflow within the terauchi catchment alpha bnk the bank flow recession constant determines the water contribution from bank storage to the main channel while the three models shared relatively similar alpha bnk we noted significant variability in values and uncertainty ranges of the groundwater parameters compared to the gauge and r a models gwqmn in the gsmap g scenario was lower gwqmn 707 01 mm while gw delay and revapmn were higher gw delay 337 79 days revapmn 941 83 mm the differences in fitted parameters resulted in different groundwater contributions to the catchment water balance esco and epco determine water allocation between evaporation and percolation the esco parameter that governs soil evaporation within the swat model presented different fitted values in the three models it was close to 0 70 in the gauge model indicating low soil evaporation however it was calibrated to 0 39 and 0 22 for the r a and gsmap g models resulting in increased evaporation and thus high potential evapotranspiration on the other hand all the three models shared relatively low epco allowing plant water uptake from the upper soil profile ch n2 and ch k2 correspond to manning s n coefficient and hydraulic conductivity for the main channel the calibrated values of the ch n2 in the three models were in the range of 0 050 0 15 indicating that the main channel is mainly covered by heavy timber and brush the ch k2 in the gauge and r a scenarios reflected a moderately high loss rate however it suggested a moderate loss rate in the case of the gsmap g model 4 4 performances of the swat model using fixed parameters the present analysis was carried out to avoid any possible bias caused by the auto calibration of different input parameters in the swat model we averaged the fitted parameters obtained for the three tested precipitation datasets subsequently we run the swat model using the calibrated and averaged parameters for the total observation period table c1 table c2 summarizes the performance indicators computed for the three simulations using fixed parameters the performance of the gauge and r a models slightly decreased similar to the results obtained using calibrated parameters the r a model ranked the best in terms of streamflow simulation nse 0 89 followed by the gauge scenario nse 0 83 on the other hand the gsmap g scenario was sensitive to the change in model parameters as its performance was lowered by 6 to become non satisfactory with an nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the r a and gsmap g precipitation datasets the statistical comparison between daily r a precipitation estimates and gauge measurements revealed a strong correlation r 90 and accurate rainfall detection csi 0 74 literature showed that radar based precipitation estimates are usually lower than gauge based measurements schleiss et al 2020 seo et al 2015 however the r a dataset used in the present study showed an opposite tendency as shown in fig 2 the r a datasets overestimated the precipitation by 15 38 in comparison with rain gauge measurements causing higher average rainfall input in the swat model year round fig 6 similarly several previous comparisons demonstrated an overestimation of about 20 for the r a product ishizaki and matsuyama 2018 urita et al 2011 this overestimation can be originated from the adjustment algorithm used for calibrating radars precipitation estimates by local rain gauge measurements indeed the calibration process adopts the maximum value method which selects the highest value when comparing grid point estimates and rain gauge measurements makihara 2000 similar to the r a dataset gsmap g precipitation estimates were in good agreement with gauge measurements r 80 fig 3 however rainfall detection accuracy was significantly lower csi 0 37 and daily estimates were generally underestimated causing less water input in the swat model especially in july and august figs 5 and 6a the low rainfall detection generally originated from sampling errors in the passive microwave images kubota et al 2009 it is also related to the limitations of infrared and microwave sensors in capturing orographic localized and convective rainfall events hayashi et al 2021 nepal et al 2021 this was reflected in the significant rainfall estimation errors rmse by the gsmap g over the terauchi catchment which was observed during the rainy and typhoon seasons may october when heavy and orographic rainfalls are frequent fig 6b these estimation uncertainties implied the inefficiency of calibrating precipitation estimates based on only the 24 h accumulated rainfall amounts derived from the noaa cpc rain gauge based product they further suggested the need for updating the bias adjustment algorithm mega et al 2019 and the orographic rainfall correction scheme yamamoto and shige 2015 or the use of more local rain gauges deng et al 2019 to improve the quality of the product and extreme rainfall detection 5 2 implication of the selection of precipitation datasets in streamflow simulation the three precipitation datasets evaluated in the current study presented different measures detection accuracy and spatial representation of the rainfall r a approximately 1 km2 gauge around 400 cm2 gsmap g about 120 km2 these differences resulted in disparate rainfall inputs e g dry days fractions and daily rainfall volume over the catchment to the swat model and different streamflow simulation outputs from the statistical indicators shown in table 3 it was clear that the r a dataset outperformed the other evaluated datasets in simulating daily streamflow at the terauchi catchment the low gsmap g model performance nse 0 54 was faced with significantly higher performance in the case of the gauge dataset nse 0 84 this significant difference was also observed during the fixed parameters model test table c2 therefore it is most likely due to the intrinsic underestimation of rainfall originating from the gsmap g product knowing that the two datasets presented a similar spatial resolution this finding is consistent with the study of deng et al 2019 who revealed the outperformance of the gauge based model on the gsmap g dataset in a large basin 159 000 km2 in china extremely high oep 1 and low oep 60 flow events are generally difficult to reproduce in the swat model tan et al 2020 these issues were reflected by the different occurrence fractions of daily streamflow less than 2 m3 s in the simulations compared to the observations and the underestimation of flow peaks greater than 60 m3 s figs 7 and 8 one of the reasons is using only the nse as an objective function during the auto calibration process that reduced the mean differences and variances between simulated and observed streamflow but neglected the possible deviations in low flow periods krause et al 2005 the r a product partially overcame these issues as it improved the simulation of extremely high and low flow events table 4 compared to the gauge and gsmap g datasets this outperformance may not be only at the catchment scale but also at the sub basin scale the great performance of the r a dataset was due to the high spatial resolution of the product 1 km and the effective algorithm used for observing extreme rainfalls indeed the high spatial resolution of the r a product assists in capturing the detailed spatial features of precipitation in particular the extreme convective events hirokawa et al 2020 kato 2020 sueki and kajikawa 2019 tsuguti et al 2019 responsible for the extremely high flow events in the study area this led to overcoming the limitations of ground gauges in terms of spatial representation and measurement accuracy during extreme climatic conditions the benefits of the r a precipitation dataset in the swat model may therefore exceed the improvement of streamflow simulation to reach the study of hydro climatic extremes i e floods droughts similar findings were also stated for a 2 km radar rain gauge adjusted product in korea cha and lee 2021 although the study area presents static characteristics i e land use soil type topography during the simulation period the evaluated precipitation datasets resulted in different model parameterization and discharge flux fig 9 this is not surprising since the auto calibration used in this study considered a wide range of uncertainty to search for the best set of parameters that optimize the fitting between observed and simulated streamflow this variation leads to uncertain interpretations of the hydrological processes in the terauchi catchment the uncertainty can propagate towards other processes e g sediment dynamics and contaminant transport price et al 2014 it would therefore affect the decision making and may lead to different management and mitigation strategies the situation would be more significant for the gsmap g dataset which was the most sensitive to model parameterization therefore the precipitation datasets in hydrological modeling should be selected with caution considering their uncertainties and limitations 6 conclusions motivated by the potential of gauge calibrated precipitation datasets in capturing the spatial pattern of rainfall with high accuracy and resolution we investigated the usefulness of two datasets radar based r a and satellite based gsmap g as input in the swat for daily streamflow simulation the work focuses on the terauchi watershed a medium size mountainous catchment in southwestern japan the research outcomes are in the following points the r a precipitation data were in good agreement with gauge observations however they are overestimated the gsmap g underestimated the rainfall while found to be in correlation with gauge observations the performance of the swat model forced with the three different precipitation datasets was as the following r a gauge gsmap g the r a based model was the most performant in simulating the streamflow with an nse of 88 the r a based model improved the simulation of extremely high oep 1 and low oep 60 streamflow events the three precipitation datasets resulted in different simulation outputs and model parameterization overall this work reveals the outperformance of the r a product compared to the gsmap g and gauge datasets in accurately representing the spatial variability of rainfall within the terauchi catchment 51 km2 and improving daily streamflow simulation using the swat model however the study outcomes are case specific and expected to be true only in catchments with climate and scale similar to our study area in a larger basin the performance of the gauge dataset can be improved due to a higher rain gauge density tan and yang 2020 which may lead to different conclusions regarding the best precipitation dataset in terms of streamflow modeling accuracy furthermore the performances of the r a and gsmap g products in other study sites with different topographic conditions and climate regimes e g temperate and subarctic may change due to the climate and attitude dependent propagation of precipitation uncertainty fallah et al 2020 nepal et al 2021 future research efforts should aim to validate the added value of the r a product in improving streamflow simulation by focusing on other study areas with different climate and topographic conditions furthermore they should assess the potential of other satellite based datasets like the gpm imerg product which outperformed the gsmap g in representing the spatial precipitation variability hsu et al 2021 these future topics would provide interesting directions for improving the current algorithm used for producing the evaluated gauge merged datasets and future constellation requirements kidd et

7899,study region japan study focus in this study we analyzed the spatial frequency of annual extreme daily precipitation aedp across japan once every 100 years a large ensemble analysis was conducted using the database for policy decision making for future climate changes d4pdf for precipitation data a non parametric method was used to calculate the aedp amounts for each 20 km cell across japan new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated that aedp of rp100 year occurs once approximately every 1 18 years in the historical simulation across japan furthermore according to the representative concentration pathway delivering 8 5 w m2 globally rcp 8 5 the frequency of aedp of rp100 year increases once every 1 00 years in the 4 k future simulation the mean of aedp of rp100 year occurrence area with a return period of 100 years is 10 38 cells 4150 km2 with a median of six cells 2400 km2 with future changes in the mean area of aedp occurrence with a return period of 100 years predicted in rcp 8 5 there could be a massive increase in the area over which aedp occurs by 2 1 times when mean values are used and with a median predicted increase of 5 0 times the area additionally we examined extreme precipitation values for various return periods using d4pdf data to consider the relationship between the scale of extreme precipitation and its probability keywords d4pdf return period return area median global warming 1 introduction in recent years 100 year floods or rainfall disasters have been frequent across japan the observed increase in the frequency of these disasters has been attributed to global climate change as a result of warming the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc declared that the rise of 1 1 k since 1850 1900 is due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activity and the average global temperature is expected to reach a rise of 1 5 c over the next 20 years ipcc 2021 many researchers have suggested that an increase in extreme precipitation events has accompanied global warming for example hatsuzuka and sato 2019 analyzed future changes in monthly extreme precipitation amounts by modeling a 4 k increase in global temperatures their results indicated that global warming increased monthly extreme precipitation amounts with a return period rp of 100 years across a wide swath of japan particularly in the summer june to august this increase was especially severe in western kyushu and hokkaido fujita et al 2019 found that without additional relief efforts at middle and higher latitudes particularly in japan there would be a statistically significant increase in annual maximum daily precipitation in the near future 2030 2050 yuqing and li 2005 noted that in eastern china events accompanied by annual extreme daily precipitation aedp amounts would increase particularly in summer and kimoto 2005 conducted global climate model gcm based simulations and stated that changes in atmospheric circulation made summer monsoon scale areas of rainfall more likely to develop in east asia the extreme precipitation events that accompany climatic changes cause disasters every year particularly in recent years 100 year floods and extreme precipitation events have been frequent in japan it is critical that we identify the characteristics of these events in order to better predict prepare for and mitigate the destruction caused by them therefore it is necessary to clarify the relationship between the temporal frequency of extreme precipitation and its spatial distribution the frequency of extreme precipitation in a single location has been analyzed in many studies for example analyses have been conducted using intensity frequency duration idf curves of extreme precipitation events kusumastuti et al 2019 used idf curves to calculate rainfall intensity in indonesia s upper werba basin while shrestha et al 2017 used nine gcms to examine trends in bangkok and estimate idf curves under historical climates and potential future climate scenarios lima et al 2018 used regional idf curves to suggest that 100 year extreme precipitation events in northern south korea would increase by 30 under the representative concentration pathway delivering 8 5 w m2 globally rcp 8 5 future climate scenario however to accurately discern extreme precipitation risks at regional and national levels it is necessary to gain a spatially explicit understanding of such events previously studies have been conducted to obtain spatial information for extreme precipitation events for example mastrantonas et al 2021 analyzed the spatio temporal characteristics of extreme precipitation events in the mediterranean sea using arfs areal reduction factors and showed the spatio temporal dependence of extreme precipitation in other words it isn t easy to assess extreme precipitation by collecting point data spatially da analysis depth area is often used to discuss the spatial aspects of extreme precipitation durrans et al 2001 conducted a da analysis using radar precipitation over the entire united states sugawara et al 2018 analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of extreme precipitation in japan s yoneshiro basin using the rainfall dad depth area duration relationship to claim that the area of annual extreme precipitation with rp100 years increased by 50x from 2007 to 2013 overeem et al 2010 used radar rainfall data from the netherlands to propose a new method for modeling the frequency of extreme precipitation events with generalized extreme value gev distribution parameters via an interval area function since these spatial analyses focus on precipitation amounts it is impossible to compare regions with different precipitation amounts in addition no studies are focusing on the spatial frequency of occurrence on the other hand in this study the spatial analysis is conducted with a return period to compare spatial frequency in different regions in addition for the first time a discussion of the spatial recurrence area of extreme precipitation is included another novelty is done using a large ensemble climate model d4pdf rather than observed point precipitation the database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf mizuta et al 2017 fujita et al 2019 used in this study is one of the many climate models developed in recent years one advantage of such models is the use of the large ensemble approach research on extreme precipitation has frequently relied on time frames of 50 years at most in the case of radar data and less than 100 years in the case of other approaches gao et al 2006 li et al 2019 thus the accuracy of the results could not be guaranteed when estimating 100 year precipitation amounts since the data spanned only a few decades on the other hand large ensemble data from sources like the d4pdf can be used to estimate 100 year precipitation amounts due to the many decades of data improving the accuracy of the results dennis 2019 used d4pdf data from sweden for forecasting and claimed that the amount of extreme precipitation from events with long rps would increase in the southeast of the country they also noted a similar trend wherein the shorter the precipitation period and the longer the rp of the aedp the larger the amount of extreme precipitation a d4pdf regional climate model has also been used to assess the impacts of climatic instability hoshino and yamada 2018 tanaka et al 2018 watanabe et al 2020 reviewed d4pdf s bias correction and several previous studies have similarly examined the characteristics of extreme precipitation using d4pdf and other climate models nevertheless no research has examined the spatial distribution of extreme daily precipitation nationwide in japan therefore we used d4pdf data to clarify the spatial frequency of aedp across japan here the spatial frequency of occurrence indicates the spatial range and frequency of aedp amounts over a wide area determining the spatial frequencies of extreme precipitation spatial nationwide allows the frequency with which so called 100 year floods of precipitation disasters occur across japan to be determined the relationship between the area over which extreme precipitation occurs and its probability makes it possible to evaluate the spatial risk of extreme precipitation and assess future changes to achieve this the probable precipitation amounts were first determined for each cell across japan the non parametric method was used to determine the aedp amounts next the spatial frequency of occurrence was calculated to determine the number of cells across japan where an aedp event would occur within one year finally the obtained spatial frequencies were used to consider the relationship between the return period and the return area as well as future changes in return period 2 data and methods 2 1 dataset and study area the target area was japan precipitation data were obtained from d4pdf which is a database for policy decision making regarding future climate change mizuta et al 2017 fujita et al 2019 assembled by the japanese ministry of education culture sports science and technology s program for risk information on climate change it was designed for the risk assessment of climate change in this study we used the non hydrostatic regional climate model nhrcm sasaki et al 2011 murata et al 2013 downscaled from 60 to 20 km 400 km2 in the horizontal resolution for the region of japan the d4pdf japan regional model enables the assessment of future changes in extreme precipitation with a degree of uncertainty mizuta et al 2017 d4pdf comprises three simulations under different climates historical 2 k future and 4 k future as summarized in table 1 the horizontal resolution and duration of each simulation were as follows historical 20 km 1951 2010 2 k future 20 km 2031 2090 and 4 k future simulations 20 km 2051 2110 six sea surface temperature warming patterns were derived from six cmip5 gcm climate projections ccsm4 gfdl cm3 hadgem2 ao miroc5 mpi esm mr and mri cgcm3 in the future simulations future simulation precipitation data were used to analyze the extent of changes in the frequency of extreme precipitation under the 2 k and 4 k future simulations an advantage of the d4pdf model is that a set of data over thousands of years is usable therefore the accuracy of annual extreme daily precipitation aedp estimation is physically improved we used the results of climate model experiments instead of observational data for historical precipitation the reproducibility of the nhrcm is excellent which was determined by comparison with the observed precipitation kawase et al 2019 nosaka et al 2020 of the 13 560 cells across japan 1038 cells including inland areas 415 200 km2 were extracted and analyzed to analyze extreme precipitation at large spatial and temporal scales such as typhoons and fronts the temporal resolution was set to daily precipitation to match the spatial resolution of 20 km in d4pdf 2 2 precipitation stationarity and detrending for the annual maximum daily precipitation d4pdf historical simulation a mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was performed to determine nonstationary components detrending is necessary in the case of nonstationary precipitation for non stationarity and time series trends in precipitation the base year of aedp could not be determined for the future simulations of 2 k and 4 k the external forcing factors such as greenhouse gas concentrations are assigned the rcp8 5 values of 2040 and 2090 respectively therefore the warming stages were fixed and no precipitation trends were observed trend analysis was conducted using the mann kendall test and eqs 1 4 soldini and darvini 2017 xie et al 2018 the results are shown in fig 1 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where n is the number of data years 3000 m is the number of tied groups and t i is the number of data values in the i th group the statistical s test is given as follows s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k where t is the number of years 60 j and k are the ranks in ascending order and x j and x k are the ranks of precipitation sgn x j x k 1 x j x k 0 0 x j x k 0 1 x j x k 0 the significance of trends was evaluated by comparing the standardized variable z with the standard normal variate at the desired significance level 5 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 the z statistic corresponding to a significance level of 5 was 1 96 the left hand pre correction shown in fig 1 indicates that at many points the absolute value of mann kendall test statistic z used to assess the presence of trends exceeded 1 96 thus it can be concluded that the trends are present at many points several studies have shown an increasing trend in precipitation fujibe et al 2005 analyzed the time series trend of 4 h precipitation in japan and found that the more extensive the precipitation the more the trend increased a trend analysis of precipitation in south korea showed that extreme precipitation increased from 1954 to 1999 jung et al 2002 based on these studies the annual maximum daily precipitation is increasing due to climate change the trend analysis of precipitation in south korea showed that the frequency of extreme precipitation increased from 1954 to 1999 detrending was subsequently conducted using the mann kendall slope sen 1968 as shown in eq 5 and 6 respectively where β is the mann kendall slope x i j is the western calendar year and y i j is the maximum annual daily precipitation i 1 n y t y t 2010 q β where y t is the detrended precipitation amount and q is the target western calendar year as shown in the right hand image in fig 1 the absolute value of the detrended statistic z for all points was less than 1 96 therefore the trends were eliminated our historical simulation analysis was conducted using detrended precipitation data 2 3 calculation of aedp here rp x year aedp indicates the amount of aedp for a return period of x years because d4pdf is a large ensemble of precipitation data a non parametric method can be used instead of probability distributions to obtain aedp in this study aedp was calculated using the following plotting position formula p i a n 1 2 a where p is the exceedance probability i is the ordered rank of a sample value n is the sample size and a is a constant a 0 4 using the cunnane formula cunnane 1978 the cunnane formula is the best fitting constant for extreme value distributions such as the gev gumbel and lp3 distributions ologhadien 2021 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of aedp rp100 year aedp was obtained for each cell using a non parametric method the spatial distributions of rp100 year aedp in the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations are shown in fig 2 based on the historical simulation results rp100 year aedp considerably varied from site to site on the pacific side of southern japan precipitation exceeds 400 mm d in northern japan the precipitation is less than 200 mm d for most cells in the 2 k and 4 k future simulations the precipitation increased in many cells in particular rp100 year aedp exceeded 600 mm d in the cells 3 2 exceedance probability and area of aedp occurrence in the historical simulation the relationship between the area and exceedance probability of the occurrence of aedp is shown in fig 3 the area of aedp occurrence is the total area over rp x year aedp for each cell in japan the exceedance probability has two meanings of exceedance over the return period and over the aedp occurrence area for each year for instance fig 3 shows that the probability of occurrence of rp100 year aedp over 4000 km2 in japan was 0 37 moreover the exceedance probability that the aedp occurrence area was greater than one cell 400 km2 was calculated the probabilities of aedp occurring in more than one cell in a given year in japan were 0 96 0 85 and 0 67 for rp50 rp100 and rp200 year respectively these exceedance probabilities correspond to each spatial return period rp the spatial rp x km2 is the period until aedp occurs again at more than x km2 the spatial rps 400 km2 were 1 04 1 18 and 1 50 years for rp50 rp100 and rp200 year aedp respectively rp100 year aedp can occur in the entirety of japan once every 1 18 years for any given cell furthermore fig 3 presents the results of exceedance probability and the spatial rp for a large area of extreme precipitation occurrence the exceedance probability of aedp decreases as its area increases the exceedance probability of rp100 year aedp in an area of 10 000 km2 was 0 11 and its spatial rp 10 000 km2 was 9 23 years the exceedance probability of the aedp occurrence area with more than one cell 400 km2 is 0 85 therefore the probability of the rp100 year aedp occurrence area being between 400 and 10 000 km2 was 0 74 which is a deference between 0 55 and 0 11 fig 3 shows a larger difference in the exceedance probability for each rp and a lower value of the aedp occurrence area 3 3 exceedance probability and area of aedp occurrence under the future simulations the d4pdf future simulations expressed the exceedance probability and spatial rp for each aedp occurrence area for 2 k and 4 k fig 4 shows the relationship between exceedance probabilities and aedp occurrence area for each simulation specifically rp100 year aedp the exceedance probabilities of aedp occurring over 400 km2 were 0 85 0 97 and 1 00 for the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations respectively converting the exceedance probability into spatial rps the spatial rps 400 km2 of 100 year aedp in japan were 1 18 1 04 and 1 00 year for the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations respectively this implies that rp100 year aedp occurred almost every year in the 4 k future simulation future changes in the frequency of 100 year aedps were estimated the exceedance probabilities of aedp occurring over 400 km2 increased by 1 14 and 1 18 times under the 2 k and 4 k future simulations respectively similarly the exceedance probabilities of aedp occurring over 10 000 km2 increased by 2 56 and 5 69 times under the 2 k and 4 k future simulations respectively therefore future simulations project larger areas and more frequent aedps in japan 4 discussion 4 1 mean and median aedp areas the mean area of occurrence of rp100 year aedp was averaged for each area during the simulation period the mean area of rp100 year aedp is 8080 km2 20 2 cells for the 2 k simulation and 15 900 km2 39 7 cells for the 4 k simulation while that for the historical simulation is 4150 km2 10 4 cells future changes in the mean areas of aedp occurrence increased by 1 43 times under the 2 k future simulation and 3 83 times under the 4 k future simulation the mean occurrence area of rp100 year aedp was 10 4 cells 4150 km2 of the 1038 cells across japan which indicates that rp100 year aedp falls on an average area of 4150 km2 representing approximately 1 of the total area however this result is an average value obtained from the precipitation data of 3000 years and the rp100 year aedp occurrence area varied from year to year fig 5 shows the aedp occurrence areas and their respective probabilities across japan the occurrence area of rp100 year aedp is 0 km2 which implies that the probability of no rp100 year aedp occurring within one year is 15 2 that is for any given cell in japan no rp100 year aedp will occur in one year out of 6 6 years additionally years with a mean aedp area exceeding 4000 km2 accounted for approximately 37 therefore the mean area of rp100 year aedp is affected by the part of the year wherein aedp occurs over a wide area e g monsoon seasons or typhoons the mean value significantly deviates from the occurrence probability of 50 and the mean values are often meaningless the median value indicates that the exceedance probability was 50 the pie chart in fig 5 shows that the median value for an rp100 year aedp occurrence area was 2400 km2 and that for an rp100 year aedp occurrence area with 50 probability could be less than 2400 km2 similarly these events can occur approximately 50 of the time over an area of more than 2400 km2 using rp100 year aedp as an example the mean aedp occurrence area was 4266 km2 while the median was 2400 km2 in cases where the means and medians significantly diverge the median may be considered to represent the actual aedp occurrence area and frequency commonly observed more closely therefore future analyses should include both the mean and median values 4 2 aedp return areas 4 2 1 historical simulation return area is the area wherein aedp occurs in one cell in a given year the return area was calculated by dividing the total area of japan 1038 cells by the mean or median of the aedp occurrence area when the return area was calculated from the mean area of rp100 year aedp occurrence the return area was 40 000 km2 100 cells however the return area was 69 200 km2 173 cells when the median value was used fig 6 shows the relationship between the return period and area when the return area was calculated using the mean and median values of the aedp occurrence area when the mean area of rp100 year aedp was used the return period and area for the historical simulation were the same that is rp100 year aedp occurred once over 100 cells 40 000 km2 similarly rp50 year aedp occurred once over 50 cells 20 000 km2 however a difference was observed between the return period and area when the median area of rp100 year aedp was used the longer the rp the more significant the difference between the return period and area the mean value was 1 1 and 1 7 times the median value for rp10 and rp100 year respectively thus although rp100 year aedp could occur once over 100 cells using the mean and median values the probability of aedp occurring in less than one cell over 173 cells was 50 it is important to note that these results do not accurately represent the spatial distribution of aedps in japan as return areas were calculated by dividing the total number of cells across japan by the number of aedp cells the spatial distribution of the aedp occurrence cells was not considered and these results cannot be used to consider the dependencies of aedp by narrowing the return area to a region or basin it is possible to clarify the difference in the spatial frequency of extreme precipitation 4 2 2 future simulations we examined the aedps calculated from historical simulation precipitation data the frequency with which these events might occur in future simulations and the expected future changes in the spatial rps of the aedps because the aedps were calculated using precipitation data from the historical simulation the aedps under the historical and future 2 k and 4 k simulations were equivalent table 2 lists the future changes in the mean and median aedp areas using aedps in the historical simulation as aedp historical values the mean rp100 year aedp areas listed in table 2 are 8080 and 15 900 km2 for the 2 k and 4 k future simulations respectively as noted in section 4 1 the mean aedp occurrence area under the historical simulation was 4150 km2 which suggests that the rp100 year aedp in the 4 k future simulation is approximately four times that in the historical simulation this upward trend indicates that changes in the area were not dependent on the rp of aedp similarly for rp10 year the aedp occurrence area for the 4 k future simulation was 2 1 times that for the historical simulation when the median and mean aedp occurrence areas were compared it was clear that future changes were more pronounced using medians than means the median of the rp100 year aedp occurrence area was 12 400 km2 under the 4 k future simulation indicating an increase of 5 2 times over the 2400 km2 area of the historical simulation moreover the median of the rp10 year aedp occurrence area was predicted to be 2 2 times that of the historical simulation future changes in the relationship between the return period and area are shown in fig 7 the rp100 year aedp return areas were 40 000 20 550 and 10 460 km2 for the historical 2 k future 4 k future simulations respectively therefore for the 4 k future simulation rp100 year aedp occurred at a frequency approximately four times higher than that for the historical simulation when the median values were used the return area under the 2 k future simulation was 5600 km2 whereas it was 12 400 km2 under the 4 k future simulation that is the probability that rp100 year aedp will occur under the 4 k future simulation at least once in approximately 100 cells 40 000 km2 was 50 rp100 year aedp should occur once a year in an area of the kanto region 40 000 km2 4 3 spatial rps the spatial rps were calculated for the entirety of japan and the results are shown in fig 8 the spatial rp is the period until aedp occurs again in more than one cell in the target area the target area of this study was japan that is the spatial rp is the rp for aedp in even one cell for the entirety of japan the aedps of interest were rp30 rp50 rp100 rp200 and rp500 year the spatial rp of the aedp with rp x year refers to the spatial rp of rp x year aedp additionally we compared the historical simulation with the 2 k and 4 k future simulations as shown in fig 8 the spatial rps of 100 year rp aedp are 1 18 1 04 and 1 00 year in the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations respectively that is rp100 year aedp at a given location occurs approximately once a year in the spatial rp covering japan furthermore for the spatial rp of 500 year aedp the historical simulation was 2 41 years 1 48 and 1 11 years under the 2 k and 4 k future simulations respectively suggesting that the spatial rp of large scale aedp events significantly increases with the ongoing climate change 5 conclusions in this study d4pdf data were used to clarify the nature of the spatial frequency of aedp occurrence across japan and the future changes in the occurrence of aedp events aedp for each cell was determined using a non parametric method and the 100 year aedp area and spatial rp were calculated the mean area was 10 38 cells while the median was six cells additionally the probability that aedp would not occur once in a cell was 15 the return periods and areas were compared when the return area was calculated using the mean of aedp the return period and area matched regardless of the return period however when the return area was calculated using median aedp larger return periods yielded larger return areas the analysis of the change in the rp100 year aedp occurrence area indicated that the mean and median areas of aedp occurrence would increase by approximately 3 8 and 5 2 times respectively in the 4 k future simulation spatial rps in japan were compared using historical and future simulations the spatial rp 400 km2 for rp100 year aedp was 1 18 1 04 and 1 00 year under the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations respectively for future simulations it was established that rp100 year aedp could occur somewhere in japan at least once a year the results obtained in this study provide insights into the frequency of 100 year aedp events across japan the spatial frequency of spatial rps aedps was revealed for the first time in this study the methods proposed in this study in contrast to the use of point by point or cell by cell rps for analyzing spatial rps have potential applications in various disaster risk mitigation plans kawagoe et al 2006 conducted a cell by cell analysis of the relationship between extreme precipitation and slope disasters however analyses over a wider area at the scale of municipalities or prefectures could lead to more appropriate disaster risk assessments yamamoto et al 2021 assessed flood damage mitigation and adaptation plans and the aedp values obtained via their analyses were provided cell by cell diverging from the spatial extreme precipitation occurrence frequency thus the application of the proposed methods can lead to advances in water resource management and disaster risk research however several issues must be addressed for practical applications first the resolution requires refinement if spatial rp analysis is to be performed on a watershed basis the spatial resolution requires refinement at approximately 5 km this finer resolution allows us to consider the effects of local precipitation events such as thunderstorms second it is necessary to understand the relationship between extreme precipitation and flooding elucidating the relationship between the current river discharge standard and x km2 spatial rps will lead to more sophisticated flow forecasting given that extreme precipitation occurs in a spatially continuous manner a method for analyzing extreme precipitation in a spatial manner

7899,study region japan study focus in this study we analyzed the spatial frequency of annual extreme daily precipitation aedp across japan once every 100 years a large ensemble analysis was conducted using the database for policy decision making for future climate changes d4pdf for precipitation data a non parametric method was used to calculate the aedp amounts for each 20 km cell across japan new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated that aedp of rp100 year occurs once approximately every 1 18 years in the historical simulation across japan furthermore according to the representative concentration pathway delivering 8 5 w m2 globally rcp 8 5 the frequency of aedp of rp100 year increases once every 1 00 years in the 4 k future simulation the mean of aedp of rp100 year occurrence area with a return period of 100 years is 10 38 cells 4150 km2 with a median of six cells 2400 km2 with future changes in the mean area of aedp occurrence with a return period of 100 years predicted in rcp 8 5 there could be a massive increase in the area over which aedp occurs by 2 1 times when mean values are used and with a median predicted increase of 5 0 times the area additionally we examined extreme precipitation values for various return periods using d4pdf data to consider the relationship between the scale of extreme precipitation and its probability keywords d4pdf return period return area median global warming 1 introduction in recent years 100 year floods or rainfall disasters have been frequent across japan the observed increase in the frequency of these disasters has been attributed to global climate change as a result of warming the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc declared that the rise of 1 1 k since 1850 1900 is due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activity and the average global temperature is expected to reach a rise of 1 5 c over the next 20 years ipcc 2021 many researchers have suggested that an increase in extreme precipitation events has accompanied global warming for example hatsuzuka and sato 2019 analyzed future changes in monthly extreme precipitation amounts by modeling a 4 k increase in global temperatures their results indicated that global warming increased monthly extreme precipitation amounts with a return period rp of 100 years across a wide swath of japan particularly in the summer june to august this increase was especially severe in western kyushu and hokkaido fujita et al 2019 found that without additional relief efforts at middle and higher latitudes particularly in japan there would be a statistically significant increase in annual maximum daily precipitation in the near future 2030 2050 yuqing and li 2005 noted that in eastern china events accompanied by annual extreme daily precipitation aedp amounts would increase particularly in summer and kimoto 2005 conducted global climate model gcm based simulations and stated that changes in atmospheric circulation made summer monsoon scale areas of rainfall more likely to develop in east asia the extreme precipitation events that accompany climatic changes cause disasters every year particularly in recent years 100 year floods and extreme precipitation events have been frequent in japan it is critical that we identify the characteristics of these events in order to better predict prepare for and mitigate the destruction caused by them therefore it is necessary to clarify the relationship between the temporal frequency of extreme precipitation and its spatial distribution the frequency of extreme precipitation in a single location has been analyzed in many studies for example analyses have been conducted using intensity frequency duration idf curves of extreme precipitation events kusumastuti et al 2019 used idf curves to calculate rainfall intensity in indonesia s upper werba basin while shrestha et al 2017 used nine gcms to examine trends in bangkok and estimate idf curves under historical climates and potential future climate scenarios lima et al 2018 used regional idf curves to suggest that 100 year extreme precipitation events in northern south korea would increase by 30 under the representative concentration pathway delivering 8 5 w m2 globally rcp 8 5 future climate scenario however to accurately discern extreme precipitation risks at regional and national levels it is necessary to gain a spatially explicit understanding of such events previously studies have been conducted to obtain spatial information for extreme precipitation events for example mastrantonas et al 2021 analyzed the spatio temporal characteristics of extreme precipitation events in the mediterranean sea using arfs areal reduction factors and showed the spatio temporal dependence of extreme precipitation in other words it isn t easy to assess extreme precipitation by collecting point data spatially da analysis depth area is often used to discuss the spatial aspects of extreme precipitation durrans et al 2001 conducted a da analysis using radar precipitation over the entire united states sugawara et al 2018 analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of extreme precipitation in japan s yoneshiro basin using the rainfall dad depth area duration relationship to claim that the area of annual extreme precipitation with rp100 years increased by 50x from 2007 to 2013 overeem et al 2010 used radar rainfall data from the netherlands to propose a new method for modeling the frequency of extreme precipitation events with generalized extreme value gev distribution parameters via an interval area function since these spatial analyses focus on precipitation amounts it is impossible to compare regions with different precipitation amounts in addition no studies are focusing on the spatial frequency of occurrence on the other hand in this study the spatial analysis is conducted with a return period to compare spatial frequency in different regions in addition for the first time a discussion of the spatial recurrence area of extreme precipitation is included another novelty is done using a large ensemble climate model d4pdf rather than observed point precipitation the database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf mizuta et al 2017 fujita et al 2019 used in this study is one of the many climate models developed in recent years one advantage of such models is the use of the large ensemble approach research on extreme precipitation has frequently relied on time frames of 50 years at most in the case of radar data and less than 100 years in the case of other approaches gao et al 2006 li et al 2019 thus the accuracy of the results could not be guaranteed when estimating 100 year precipitation amounts since the data spanned only a few decades on the other hand large ensemble data from sources like the d4pdf can be used to estimate 100 year precipitation amounts due to the many decades of data improving the accuracy of the results dennis 2019 used d4pdf data from sweden for forecasting and claimed that the amount of extreme precipitation from events with long rps would increase in the southeast of the country they also noted a similar trend wherein the shorter the precipitation period and the longer the rp of the aedp the larger the amount of extreme precipitation a d4pdf regional climate model has also been used to assess the impacts of climatic instability hoshino and yamada 2018 tanaka et al 2018 watanabe et al 2020 reviewed d4pdf s bias correction and several previous studies have similarly examined the characteristics of extreme precipitation using d4pdf and other climate models nevertheless no research has examined the spatial distribution of extreme daily precipitation nationwide in japan therefore we used d4pdf data to clarify the spatial frequency of aedp across japan here the spatial frequency of occurrence indicates the spatial range and frequency of aedp amounts over a wide area determining the spatial frequencies of extreme precipitation spatial nationwide allows the frequency with which so called 100 year floods of precipitation disasters occur across japan to be determined the relationship between the area over which extreme precipitation occurs and its probability makes it possible to evaluate the spatial risk of extreme precipitation and assess future changes to achieve this the probable precipitation amounts were first determined for each cell across japan the non parametric method was used to determine the aedp amounts next the spatial frequency of occurrence was calculated to determine the number of cells across japan where an aedp event would occur within one year finally the obtained spatial frequencies were used to consider the relationship between the return period and the return area as well as future changes in return period 2 data and methods 2 1 dataset and study area the target area was japan precipitation data were obtained from d4pdf which is a database for policy decision making regarding future climate change mizuta et al 2017 fujita et al 2019 assembled by the japanese ministry of education culture sports science and technology s program for risk information on climate change it was designed for the risk assessment of climate change in this study we used the non hydrostatic regional climate model nhrcm sasaki et al 2011 murata et al 2013 downscaled from 60 to 20 km 400 km2 in the horizontal resolution for the region of japan the d4pdf japan regional model enables the assessment of future changes in extreme precipitation with a degree of uncertainty mizuta et al 2017 d4pdf comprises three simulations under different climates historical 2 k future and 4 k future as summarized in table 1 the horizontal resolution and duration of each simulation were as follows historical 20 km 1951 2010 2 k future 20 km 2031 2090 and 4 k future simulations 20 km 2051 2110 six sea surface temperature warming patterns were derived from six cmip5 gcm climate projections ccsm4 gfdl cm3 hadgem2 ao miroc5 mpi esm mr and mri cgcm3 in the future simulations future simulation precipitation data were used to analyze the extent of changes in the frequency of extreme precipitation under the 2 k and 4 k future simulations an advantage of the d4pdf model is that a set of data over thousands of years is usable therefore the accuracy of annual extreme daily precipitation aedp estimation is physically improved we used the results of climate model experiments instead of observational data for historical precipitation the reproducibility of the nhrcm is excellent which was determined by comparison with the observed precipitation kawase et al 2019 nosaka et al 2020 of the 13 560 cells across japan 1038 cells including inland areas 415 200 km2 were extracted and analyzed to analyze extreme precipitation at large spatial and temporal scales such as typhoons and fronts the temporal resolution was set to daily precipitation to match the spatial resolution of 20 km in d4pdf 2 2 precipitation stationarity and detrending for the annual maximum daily precipitation d4pdf historical simulation a mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was performed to determine nonstationary components detrending is necessary in the case of nonstationary precipitation for non stationarity and time series trends in precipitation the base year of aedp could not be determined for the future simulations of 2 k and 4 k the external forcing factors such as greenhouse gas concentrations are assigned the rcp8 5 values of 2040 and 2090 respectively therefore the warming stages were fixed and no precipitation trends were observed trend analysis was conducted using the mann kendall test and eqs 1 4 soldini and darvini 2017 xie et al 2018 the results are shown in fig 1 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where n is the number of data years 3000 m is the number of tied groups and t i is the number of data values in the i th group the statistical s test is given as follows s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n sgn x j x k where t is the number of years 60 j and k are the ranks in ascending order and x j and x k are the ranks of precipitation sgn x j x k 1 x j x k 0 0 x j x k 0 1 x j x k 0 the significance of trends was evaluated by comparing the standardized variable z with the standard normal variate at the desired significance level 5 z s 1 var s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s s 0 the z statistic corresponding to a significance level of 5 was 1 96 the left hand pre correction shown in fig 1 indicates that at many points the absolute value of mann kendall test statistic z used to assess the presence of trends exceeded 1 96 thus it can be concluded that the trends are present at many points several studies have shown an increasing trend in precipitation fujibe et al 2005 analyzed the time series trend of 4 h precipitation in japan and found that the more extensive the precipitation the more the trend increased a trend analysis of precipitation in south korea showed that extreme precipitation increased from 1954 to 1999 jung et al 2002 based on these studies the annual maximum daily precipitation is increasing due to climate change the trend analysis of precipitation in south korea showed that the frequency of extreme precipitation increased from 1954 to 1999 detrending was subsequently conducted using the mann kendall slope sen 1968 as shown in eq 5 and 6 respectively where β is the mann kendall slope x i j is the western calendar year and y i j is the maximum annual daily precipitation i 1 n y t y t 2010 q β where y t is the detrended precipitation amount and q is the target western calendar year as shown in the right hand image in fig 1 the absolute value of the detrended statistic z for all points was less than 1 96 therefore the trends were eliminated our historical simulation analysis was conducted using detrended precipitation data 2 3 calculation of aedp here rp x year aedp indicates the amount of aedp for a return period of x years because d4pdf is a large ensemble of precipitation data a non parametric method can be used instead of probability distributions to obtain aedp in this study aedp was calculated using the following plotting position formula p i a n 1 2 a where p is the exceedance probability i is the ordered rank of a sample value n is the sample size and a is a constant a 0 4 using the cunnane formula cunnane 1978 the cunnane formula is the best fitting constant for extreme value distributions such as the gev gumbel and lp3 distributions ologhadien 2021 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of aedp rp100 year aedp was obtained for each cell using a non parametric method the spatial distributions of rp100 year aedp in the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations are shown in fig 2 based on the historical simulation results rp100 year aedp considerably varied from site to site on the pacific side of southern japan precipitation exceeds 400 mm d in northern japan the precipitation is less than 200 mm d for most cells in the 2 k and 4 k future simulations the precipitation increased in many cells in particular rp100 year aedp exceeded 600 mm d in the cells 3 2 exceedance probability and area of aedp occurrence in the historical simulation the relationship between the area and exceedance probability of the occurrence of aedp is shown in fig 3 the area of aedp occurrence is the total area over rp x year aedp for each cell in japan the exceedance probability has two meanings of exceedance over the return period and over the aedp occurrence area for each year for instance fig 3 shows that the probability of occurrence of rp100 year aedp over 4000 km2 in japan was 0 37 moreover the exceedance probability that the aedp occurrence area was greater than one cell 400 km2 was calculated the probabilities of aedp occurring in more than one cell in a given year in japan were 0 96 0 85 and 0 67 for rp50 rp100 and rp200 year respectively these exceedance probabilities correspond to each spatial return period rp the spatial rp x km2 is the period until aedp occurs again at more than x km2 the spatial rps 400 km2 were 1 04 1 18 and 1 50 years for rp50 rp100 and rp200 year aedp respectively rp100 year aedp can occur in the entirety of japan once every 1 18 years for any given cell furthermore fig 3 presents the results of exceedance probability and the spatial rp for a large area of extreme precipitation occurrence the exceedance probability of aedp decreases as its area increases the exceedance probability of rp100 year aedp in an area of 10 000 km2 was 0 11 and its spatial rp 10 000 km2 was 9 23 years the exceedance probability of the aedp occurrence area with more than one cell 400 km2 is 0 85 therefore the probability of the rp100 year aedp occurrence area being between 400 and 10 000 km2 was 0 74 which is a deference between 0 55 and 0 11 fig 3 shows a larger difference in the exceedance probability for each rp and a lower value of the aedp occurrence area 3 3 exceedance probability and area of aedp occurrence under the future simulations the d4pdf future simulations expressed the exceedance probability and spatial rp for each aedp occurrence area for 2 k and 4 k fig 4 shows the relationship between exceedance probabilities and aedp occurrence area for each simulation specifically rp100 year aedp the exceedance probabilities of aedp occurring over 400 km2 were 0 85 0 97 and 1 00 for the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations respectively converting the exceedance probability into spatial rps the spatial rps 400 km2 of 100 year aedp in japan were 1 18 1 04 and 1 00 year for the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations respectively this implies that rp100 year aedp occurred almost every year in the 4 k future simulation future changes in the frequency of 100 year aedps were estimated the exceedance probabilities of aedp occurring over 400 km2 increased by 1 14 and 1 18 times under the 2 k and 4 k future simulations respectively similarly the exceedance probabilities of aedp occurring over 10 000 km2 increased by 2 56 and 5 69 times under the 2 k and 4 k future simulations respectively therefore future simulations project larger areas and more frequent aedps in japan 4 discussion 4 1 mean and median aedp areas the mean area of occurrence of rp100 year aedp was averaged for each area during the simulation period the mean area of rp100 year aedp is 8080 km2 20 2 cells for the 2 k simulation and 15 900 km2 39 7 cells for the 4 k simulation while that for the historical simulation is 4150 km2 10 4 cells future changes in the mean areas of aedp occurrence increased by 1 43 times under the 2 k future simulation and 3 83 times under the 4 k future simulation the mean occurrence area of rp100 year aedp was 10 4 cells 4150 km2 of the 1038 cells across japan which indicates that rp100 year aedp falls on an average area of 4150 km2 representing approximately 1 of the total area however this result is an average value obtained from the precipitation data of 3000 years and the rp100 year aedp occurrence area varied from year to year fig 5 shows the aedp occurrence areas and their respective probabilities across japan the occurrence area of rp100 year aedp is 0 km2 which implies that the probability of no rp100 year aedp occurring within one year is 15 2 that is for any given cell in japan no rp100 year aedp will occur in one year out of 6 6 years additionally years with a mean aedp area exceeding 4000 km2 accounted for approximately 37 therefore the mean area of rp100 year aedp is affected by the part of the year wherein aedp occurs over a wide area e g monsoon seasons or typhoons the mean value significantly deviates from the occurrence probability of 50 and the mean values are often meaningless the median value indicates that the exceedance probability was 50 the pie chart in fig 5 shows that the median value for an rp100 year aedp occurrence area was 2400 km2 and that for an rp100 year aedp occurrence area with 50 probability could be less than 2400 km2 similarly these events can occur approximately 50 of the time over an area of more than 2400 km2 using rp100 year aedp as an example the mean aedp occurrence area was 4266 km2 while the median was 2400 km2 in cases where the means and medians significantly diverge the median may be considered to represent the actual aedp occurrence area and frequency commonly observed more closely therefore future analyses should include both the mean and median values 4 2 aedp return areas 4 2 1 historical simulation return area is the area wherein aedp occurs in one cell in a given year the return area was calculated by dividing the total area of japan 1038 cells by the mean or median of the aedp occurrence area when the return area was calculated from the mean area of rp100 year aedp occurrence the return area was 40 000 km2 100 cells however the return area was 69 200 km2 173 cells when the median value was used fig 6 shows the relationship between the return period and area when the return area was calculated using the mean and median values of the aedp occurrence area when the mean area of rp100 year aedp was used the return period and area for the historical simulation were the same that is rp100 year aedp occurred once over 100 cells 40 000 km2 similarly rp50 year aedp occurred once over 50 cells 20 000 km2 however a difference was observed between the return period and area when the median area of rp100 year aedp was used the longer the rp the more significant the difference between the return period and area the mean value was 1 1 and 1 7 times the median value for rp10 and rp100 year respectively thus although rp100 year aedp could occur once over 100 cells using the mean and median values the probability of aedp occurring in less than one cell over 173 cells was 50 it is important to note that these results do not accurately represent the spatial distribution of aedps in japan as return areas were calculated by dividing the total number of cells across japan by the number of aedp cells the spatial distribution of the aedp occurrence cells was not considered and these results cannot be used to consider the dependencies of aedp by narrowing the return area to a region or basin it is possible to clarify the difference in the spatial frequency of extreme precipitation 4 2 2 future simulations we examined the aedps calculated from historical simulation precipitation data the frequency with which these events might occur in future simulations and the expected future changes in the spatial rps of the aedps because the aedps were calculated using precipitation data from the historical simulation the aedps under the historical and future 2 k and 4 k simulations were equivalent table 2 lists the future changes in the mean and median aedp areas using aedps in the historical simulation as aedp historical values the mean rp100 year aedp areas listed in table 2 are 8080 and 15 900 km2 for the 2 k and 4 k future simulations respectively as noted in section 4 1 the mean aedp occurrence area under the historical simulation was 4150 km2 which suggests that the rp100 year aedp in the 4 k future simulation is approximately four times that in the historical simulation this upward trend indicates that changes in the area were not dependent on the rp of aedp similarly for rp10 year the aedp occurrence area for the 4 k future simulation was 2 1 times that for the historical simulation when the median and mean aedp occurrence areas were compared it was clear that future changes were more pronounced using medians than means the median of the rp100 year aedp occurrence area was 12 400 km2 under the 4 k future simulation indicating an increase of 5 2 times over the 2400 km2 area of the historical simulation moreover the median of the rp10 year aedp occurrence area was predicted to be 2 2 times that of the historical simulation future changes in the relationship between the return period and area are shown in fig 7 the rp100 year aedp return areas were 40 000 20 550 and 10 460 km2 for the historical 2 k future 4 k future simulations respectively therefore for the 4 k future simulation rp100 year aedp occurred at a frequency approximately four times higher than that for the historical simulation when the median values were used the return area under the 2 k future simulation was 5600 km2 whereas it was 12 400 km2 under the 4 k future simulation that is the probability that rp100 year aedp will occur under the 4 k future simulation at least once in approximately 100 cells 40 000 km2 was 50 rp100 year aedp should occur once a year in an area of the kanto region 40 000 km2 4 3 spatial rps the spatial rps were calculated for the entirety of japan and the results are shown in fig 8 the spatial rp is the period until aedp occurs again in more than one cell in the target area the target area of this study was japan that is the spatial rp is the rp for aedp in even one cell for the entirety of japan the aedps of interest were rp30 rp50 rp100 rp200 and rp500 year the spatial rp of the aedp with rp x year refers to the spatial rp of rp x year aedp additionally we compared the historical simulation with the 2 k and 4 k future simulations as shown in fig 8 the spatial rps of 100 year rp aedp are 1 18 1 04 and 1 00 year in the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations respectively that is rp100 year aedp at a given location occurs approximately once a year in the spatial rp covering japan furthermore for the spatial rp of 500 year aedp the historical simulation was 2 41 years 1 48 and 1 11 years under the 2 k and 4 k future simulations respectively suggesting that the spatial rp of large scale aedp events significantly increases with the ongoing climate change 5 conclusions in this study d4pdf data were used to clarify the nature of the spatial frequency of aedp occurrence across japan and the future changes in the occurrence of aedp events aedp for each cell was determined using a non parametric method and the 100 year aedp area and spatial rp were calculated the mean area was 10 38 cells while the median was six cells additionally the probability that aedp would not occur once in a cell was 15 the return periods and areas were compared when the return area was calculated using the mean of aedp the return period and area matched regardless of the return period however when the return area was calculated using median aedp larger return periods yielded larger return areas the analysis of the change in the rp100 year aedp occurrence area indicated that the mean and median areas of aedp occurrence would increase by approximately 3 8 and 5 2 times respectively in the 4 k future simulation spatial rps in japan were compared using historical and future simulations the spatial rp 400 km2 for rp100 year aedp was 1 18 1 04 and 1 00 year under the historical 2 k future and 4 k future simulations respectively for future simulations it was established that rp100 year aedp could occur somewhere in japan at least once a year the results obtained in this study provide insights into the frequency of 100 year aedp events across japan the spatial frequency of spatial rps aedps was revealed for the first time in this study the methods proposed in this study in contrast to the use of point by point or cell by cell rps for analyzing spatial rps have potential applications in various disaster risk mitigation plans kawagoe et al 2006 conducted a cell by cell analysis of the relationship between extreme precipitation and slope disasters however analyses over a wider area at the scale of municipalities or prefectures could lead to more appropriate disaster risk assessments yamamoto et al 2021 assessed flood damage mitigation and adaptation plans and the aedp values obtained via their analyses were provided cell by cell diverging from the spatial extreme precipitation occurrence frequency thus the application of the proposed methods can lead to advances in water resource management and disaster risk research however several issues must be addressed for practical applications first the resolution requires refinement if spatial rp analysis is to be performed on a watershed basis the spatial resolution requires refinement at approximately 5 km this finer resolution allows us to consider the effects of local precipitation events such as thunderstorms second it is necessary to understand the relationship between extreme precipitation and flooding elucidating the relationship between the current river discharge standard and x km2 spatial rps will lead to more sophisticated flow forecasting given that extreme precipitation occurs in a spatially continuous manner a method for analyzing extreme precipitation in a spatial manner
