12820,the ion exchange properties of crystalline and γ zirconium phosphates in the sodium and hydrogen forms were investigated the zirconium phosphates were synthesized by a mechanochemistry assisted protocol amongst the compounds na2 zirconium phosphate and γ h2 zirconium phosphate were found to be excellent ion exchangers for nh4 and k ions two key cations in renal sorbent dialysis systems the maximum nh4 uptake by na2 zirconium phosphate was 5 5 mmol g close to the theoretical limit of exchangeable sites in multi ion solutions γ h2 zirconium phosphate was a selective exchanger for k with total uptake capacity of 2 9 mmol g the as synthesized microcrystalline zirconium phosphates were encapsulated by polyacrylonitrile to form spherical porous beads of tailorable sizes owing to the porosity access to the ion exchange sites of the embedded zirconium phosphates particles was unaffected enabling fast kinetics in the uptake of nh4 and k in this form the pan zrp beads can be easily handled in sorbent cartridges the activity of the pan zrp beads could be fully restored by simple regeneration with the appropriate electrolyte graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords crystalline zirconium phosphates ion exchangers mechanochemistry polymer encapsulation renal dialysis 1 introduction the kidney has important functions in the body such as removing excess fluids maintaining the acid base and electrolyte balance and eliminating metabolic waste products 1 2 in chronic kidney disease ckd the ability of the kidney to remove waste substances and acid load from the body declines 3 4 such patients require dialysis where an external device takes over the function of the kidney to remove ions such as ammonium sodium potassium and magnesium from the blood 5 7 in sorbent dialysis the dialysate is continuously regenerated providing an uninterrupted supply of fresh dialysate this concept was initially widely used but due to the high expense of the sorbent cartridges it was surpassed by single pass dialyzers using a continuous flow of reverse osmosis treated water 8 9 however with the current emphasis on circular economy and recyclability sorbent dialyzers are experiencing a renaissance they offer high water efficiency portability and wearability and on going efforts in system miniaturization make them increasingly attractive to the patients the sorbent cartridge contains a number of layers to remove solutes transferred from the blood into the dialysates namely i a scavenger layer of activated carbon to remove particulates heavy metals oxidizing substances and organic metabolites ii a second layer containing immobilized urease to convert urea into ammonium ions and carbon dioxide iii a layer with zirconium phosphate to exchange nh4 k and other cations with na and h and iv hydrous zirconium oxide and zirconium carbonate to remove phosphate and fluoride 10 11 amorphous zirconium phosphate zrp is used as the cation exchanger in current sorbent systems however the lack of long range order poses difficulties in characterization so that batch to batch variations are difficult to detect moreover due to irregular positioning of the phosphate groups in the amorphous crystal lattice the cavities in the gel vary in their dimensions 12 13 in contrast the crystalline form possesses uniform cavities which are essential for reproducible performance and especially desired for use in a medical device different crystalline phases of zirconium phosphate have been reported such as zr hpo4 2 h2o θ zr hpo4 2 6h2o and γ zr po4 h2po4 2h2o 14 16 in α zirconium phosphate coplanar zirconium atoms are sandwiched between two layers of monohydrogen phosphate groups fig 1a 17 three of the oxygen atoms in each hpo4 2 are coordinated to zirconium whereas the fourth oxygen points towards the interlayer space and is associated with a hydrogen the basal spacing is 7 6 å and access to the microporous cavities is limited by the maximum opening of 2 62 å between zr o from two adjacent layers 18 replacement of h with na gives zr napo4 2 h2o which has a similar structure to α zr hpo4 2 h2o but with a larger basal spacing of 8 59 å fig 1b 19 however to accommodate the na ions and water the phosphate groups are skewed away from the perpendicular direction of the layer resulting in one enlarged and one constricted cavity unlike α zirconium phosphate γ zirconium phosphate does not contain hpo4 2 groups but rather has po4 3 and h2po4 the formula can be expressed as zr po4 h2po4 2h2o where the zirconium atom is octahedrally coordinated to four oxygen atoms of the po4 3 and two oxygen of the h2po4 group fig 1c 16 20 the remaining two oxygen atoms of h2po4 are bound to hydrogen atoms and project into the interlayer space where they interact with the water molecules through hydrogen bonding compared to the α zrp analogues γ zrp has a larger basal spacing of 12 25 å and a corresponding larger interlayer spacing which reduces diffusion constraints to the ion exchange sites 21 the synthesis of crystalline zirconium phosphates requires excess phosphates and is energy intensive and time consuming requiring reflux or hydrothermal treatment for days to weeks to achieve the desired crystallinity 22 25 recently our laboratory has successfully developed a convenient protocol to prepare crystalline zirconium phosphates of different phases α and γ 19 21 26 using this mechanochemistry assisted protocol bulk quantities of highly crystalline zirconium phosphates can be readily formed without involving solvents or large over stoichiometry of reactants for this study we synthesized h and na forms of zirconium phosphates with the γ and α structures and investigated their sorption capabilities for two ions of relevance to treatment of dialysates nh4 and k however because the material is obtained in the form of fine powders there are problems of pressure drop when packed into sorbent cartridges carryover of fines and difficulties in recovery for regeneration to address these practical considerations we investigated their encapsulation in polyacrylonitrile pan the spherical beads formed should overcome operational problems such as pressure build up and clogging in the dialyzer 27 29 polyacrylonitrile possesses pelletizing properties strong adhesive forces with inorganic materials and good chemical stability 30 31 importantly it is highly porous which is necessary to allow easy access to the zirconium phosphate ion exchanger composites of pan with octyl phenyl n n diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide

and transferred to a 30 cm3 polypropylene container nalgene which was then tightly closed 21 after heating at 120 c for 24 h the solid was thoroughly washed by resuspension in deionized water collected by centrifugation and dried at 60 c to form na2zrp zrocl2 8h2o na2hpo4 and naf 1 3 0 3 molar ratio were used the half na exchanged nahzrp was obtained by treating na2zrp to ph 5 using 0 3 m hcl a mixture of zrocl2 8h2o nah2po4 h2o and naf 1 4 0 3 molar ratio was used to synthesize γ nahzrp this was converted to γ h2zrp by stirring in 0 3 m hcl for 24 h at room temperature to compare the ion exchange properties the amorphous zirconium phosphate was synthesized by precipitation of an aqueous solution of 0 2 m zrocl2 8h2o 30 cm3 with an equal volume of 0 5 m h3po4 solution under vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature after aging at room temperature for 6 h the resulting gelatinous precipitate was vacuum filtered and thoroughly washed with 0 1 m h3po4 aqueous solution until free of chloride ions 2 3 pan encapsulation of zirconium phosphate powders the encapsulation of zirconium phosphate with pan was carried out following a reported procedure 33 35 a mixture of 0 8 g zirconium phosphate 10 cm3 dmf and 0 2 cm3 tween 80 was stirred for 2 h at 60 c next 0 4 g of pan was added to the homogeneous solution and the stirring continued for another 2 h before cooling down to room temperature the cooled solution was loaded into a syringe and expressed through needles of 18 to 22 gauge size nominal i d 0 84 0 39 mm into a beaker of deionized water to form spherical composite beads of various sizes the beads were aged overnight washed by stirring in 0 5 m hcl for γ zrp and 0 5 m nacl for na2zrp 0 8 g beads to 250 cm3 solution for an hour and finally rinsed with deionized water the water was removed by freeze drying 2 4 characterization powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained using a bruker d8 avance diffractometer 40 kv 40 ma equipped with a copper anode and a lynxeye xe detector the diffractograms were measured over 2θ from 5 to 60 using a step size of 0 02 at 0 5 s step with sample rotation speed of 30 rpm the morphology of the materials was determined by scanning electron microscopy sem using a jeol jsm 6701f instrument samples were sputter coated with platinum prior to measurements for thermogravimetric analysis tga the samples were heated at 10 c min 1 to 1000 c under flowing air at 25 cm3 min 1 nitrogen isotherms were measured using a micromeritics tristar 3000 after degassing the samples for 12 h under flowing nitrogen at 30 c the pore size distributions were obtained from the desorption isotherms using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method the particle size distribution was obtained by dynamic light scattering dls with a malvern zetasizer zen 3600 2 5 ion exchange properties about 50 mg of the material were dispersed into 25 cm3 of an aqueous solution containing the cation of interest nh4 k na mg2 and ca2 at different concentrations 1 25 mm and gently shaken using an orbital shaker heidolph multi reax at room temperature for 20 h the concentration of the ions in the solution was determined by ion chromatography using a dionex ics 1100 equipped with a cs12a 4 mm cation exchange column the amount of ions adsorbed onto the zirconium phosphate was calculated from the concentration difference in the solution before and after the ion exchange the adsorbed amount q mmol g is given by the equation 1 q c o c e v m where co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration mm respectively v is the volume of the solution and m is the mass of the ion exchanger used the removal efficiency r of a cation was calculated using 2 r c o c e c o 100 the distribution coefficient kd cm3 g is defined as the moles of ions adsorbed per gram of sorbent to the moles of ions remaining in solution at equilibrium and expressed as 36 3 k d c o c e c e v m the variation of the adsorbed ion with concentration was fitted with the langmuir isotherm 4 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e where kl the langmuir constant is related to the free energy of adsorption and qe and qmax are the equilibrium and maximum adsorbed amount respectively the model assumes that all the adsorption sites are identical and energetically equivalent with negligible interaction between molecules 37 38 the langmuir isotherm is the simplest model that adequately describes the observed ion uptake by the zirconium phosphates the equation can be rearranged into a linear form to obtain the langmuir constant by linear regression 39 5 c e q e 1 q max c e 1 k l q max to follow the kinetics of the adsorption 50 mg of the beads was stirred in 25 cm3 of a solution v m 500 cm3 g containing the cation of interest at different time intervals 0 5 cm3 aliquots were removed for analysis by ion chromatography the competitive uptake of nh4 k na mg2 and ca2 ions was evaluated by using solutions with equimolar concentrations of these ions 0 5 6 mmol l the spent sorbents were regenerated by washing with either 0 1 m hno3 or nacl depending on their nature and their ion exchange properties were retested another three more times 3 results and discussion 3 1 zirconium phosphates and encapsulation the syntheses of crystalline α and γ zirconium phosphate use different phosphate sources for α zirconium phosphate h3po4 is used and the initial compound obtained is α h2zrp the xrd of α h2zrp is shown in fig 2a the peak at 2θ 11 71 corresponds to the basal spacing d of 7 55 å icdd 01 085 6081 with na substitution this peak moved to smaller angles indicating an increase in the basal spacing to 7 89 å for α nahzrp and 8 60 å for fully exchanged α na2zrp on the other hand the synthesis of the γ structure uses nah2po4 as the phosphate source which forms sodium zirconium hydrogen phosphate as the initial compound this compound exists with different degrees of hydration as indicated by xrd peaks corresponding to nahzr po4 2 xh2o icdd 00 033 1311 and nahzr po4 2 2 5h2o icdd 00 032 1217 fig s1 irrespective of the state of hydration γ nahzrp transforms to γ h2zrp icdd 04 012 1442 upon acid treatment fig 2b in the xrd pattern of γ h2zrp the peak at 2θ 7 23 corresponds to a basal distance of 12 21 å which is larger than in the α analogues encapsulation of the zirconium phosphate powders by pan formed spherical beads of different sizes from 1 92 mm to 3 75 mm depending on the needle diameter used figs s2 s3 the xrd results show that the structures of the crystalline zirconium phosphates were unaffected by the encapsulation fig 2 the morphology of zrp was examined by scanning electron microscopy na2zrp formed small platelets of irregular shapes 0 2 0 4 μm as well as nanorods fig 3 in contrast γ h2zrp crystallized as rectangular platelets of 0 3 0 8 1 1 3 μm the particle size distributions for na2zrp and γ h2zrp as determined by dls measurements were relatively narrow with a mean size of 301 50 and 1021 127 nm respectively fig s4 this is in good agreement with the particle sizes measured by sem after pan encapsulation the electron micrographs show a highly porous polymer network with the particles embedded in it as a result the surface area of the pan zrp beads increased by about fivefold while the pore volume rose from 0 04 to 0 08 cm3 g in the unencapsulated na2zrp and γ h2zrp to 0 15 0 24 cm3 g table 1 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the pan zrp beads show hysteresis loops at p po between 0 58 0 95 which indicate the presence of mesopores from 5 to 30 nm fig 4 the formation of a porous network around the zrp particles is necessary for ease of diffusion to the ion exchange sites of zrp the stability of the pan zrp composites was studied by tga fig 5 the total weight loss in γ h2zrp was 15 8 and occurred in three steps below 160 c the weight loss can be attributed to the desorption of water from the crystal structure and this amounted to 2 mol h2o mol zrp a second weight loss of 1 mol h2o mol zrp was observed at 350 c and the third weight loss at 700 c can be assigned to the condensation of hydroxyl groups during the transformation of zrp to zirconium pyrophosphate 21 the weight loss for the encapsulated γ h2zrp was bigger and the additional 31 5 can be attributed to pyrolysis of the polymer as only zirconium pyrophosphate remains at the end of the tga analysis eq 6 the zr pan ratio can be calculated in the same way the fraction of polymer in pan na2zrp was calculated from the tga curve eq 7 the zr pan weight ratio was 2 01 for γ h2zrp and 2 06 for na2zrp both values are in good agreement with the ratio of precursors used in the synthesis zr pan 2 polymer content 33 6 zr po 4 h 2 po 4 2h 2 o zrp 2 o

with a typical dietary protein intake of 1 g kg generates around 9 10 g urea per day 40 in patients with impaired kidney functions urea is the compound with the highest concentration found in the blood 41 42 in sorbent dialysis systems urea is enzymatically converted to nh4 which then can be removed by ion exchange potassium levels are also high in such patients and its removal to maintain safe levels of 3 5 mmol l is necessary to prevent hyperkalemia therefore the ion exchange capabilities for nh4 and k by the different zirconium phosphates were evaluated amongst the α zirconium phosphates h2zrp was a poor ion exchanger for nh4 and k table 2 in contrast both nahzrp and na2zrp readily take up these ions notably the uptake of nh4 by na2zrp was 5 5 mmol g which is close to the theoretical value of 5 8 mmol g based on its formula with both na being exchangeable the experimental points fit well with the langmuir adsorption model where the sorption is limited to the sites at the surface fig s5 the poor ion exchange behaviour of h2zrp can be attributed to its small interlayer space and narrow zeolitic cavities 43 44 by substituting the protons in h2zrp with larger cations such as na either partially or fully the interlayer space is expanded this resulted in significant increases in the nh4 and k uptake fig s6a b γ zirconium phosphates have larger basal spacings than the α structure and both γ nahzrp and γ h2zrp show indeed good uptake of nh4 and k fig s6c d the maximum uptake for these ions was 2 9 mmol g for γ h2zrp as the theoretical ion exchange capacity for γ h2zrp is 6 3 mmol g it appears that only half the hydrogen ions can be readily exchanged one reason may be the big disparity in the first and second dissociation constants for h2po4 6 31 10 8 and 4 22 10 13 mol l respectively the measured nh4 and k distribution coefficients kd for nahzrp and na2zrp γ h2zrp and γ nahzrp are all above 100 cm3 g which is characteristic of good sorbents 45 47 the highest kd values were observed for γ h2zrp compared to these crystalline zirconium phosphates the amorphous zrp gel had significantly lower ion exchange capacity the maximum nh4 and k uptake by the latter was only 1 5 and 1 2 mmol g respectively fig s7 this agrees with earlier findings by clearfield and hunter who reported an nh4 uptake of only 0 5 mmol g by amorphous h2zrp table s1 48 49 a compilation of other nh4 and k ion exchangers is listed in table s1 the naturally occurring mineral clinoptilolite na4k4 al18si40o96 24h2o has been evaluated as nh4 exchanger and the maximum uptake was 0 6 mmol g table s1 entry 4 50 however its use in a dialyser would be problematic as it contains other metal ions like k na al and ca which will leach into the dialysate for agricultural applications i e to remove nh4 from soil biochar a carbon rich material produced during pyrolysis has been proposed the best performing biochar is an activated form which has a maximum nh4 uptake of 1 5 mmol g table s1 entry 5 51 kadirova et al prepared a material from industrial wastes spent alumina catalyst and steel convertor slag by mixing them in appropriate ratios and calcining at 1000 c 52 a 7 3 ratio gave the highest nh4 adsorption capacity of 2 2 mmol g table s1 entry 6 there are fewer sorbents reported for k ion exchange hydrous titanium dioxide is selective to k with a capacity of 0 5 mmol g for ion exchange under ambient conditions table s1 entry 7 53 clearfield et al found that crystalline h2zrp had low uptake of k with the maximum adsorption capacity of only 0 1 mmol g table s1 entry 8 25 wester et al compared the uptake of k from blood plasma by commercially available zirconium phosphate zeolite and a cationic sodium polystyrene divinylbenzene sulfonate exchanger resonium a 54 zirconium phosphate had the highest k uptake of 0 44 mmol g whereas for resonium a which is used in treatment for hyperkalemia the uptake was only 0 16 mmol g in comparison our synthesized na2zrp and γ h2zrp have much higher sorption capacities for nh4 and k furthermore they can simultaneously sorb both nh4 and k so that it is not required to use separate ion specific sorbents although the crystalline zirconium phosphates show good ion exchange properties for nh4 and k the small particle size leads to high pressure drop and clogging when applied in dialysate cartridges hence to improve the operational properties their encapsulation with pan to form spherical beads was attempted na2zrp and γ h2zrp which have good uptakes for nh4 and k were chosen composites with 27 33 and 38 pan were evaluated to find an optimal composition for the beads it is desirable to use as little pan as possible since the polymer does not contribute to any ion exchange as shown in fig 6 the nh4 sorption capacity was little affected by the encapsulation the composite with 33 pan appears to be optimum as it resulted in spherical beads that were more robust than those obtained with a lower polymer content of 27 the preparation of the beads involves the use of dmf as solvent for the pan polymer it has been reported that dmf can intercalate into the interlayer spacing of zirconium phosphate 33 this can impede the ion exchange ability due to its interaction with the h or na exchange sites of zrp moreover even traces of the solvent can be detrimental for biomedical applications therefore complete removal of dmf is important to address this a washing step with dilute hcl or nacl depending on the ionic form of the zirconium phosphate was introduced the maximum adsorption capacity qmax for nh4 and k of the γ h2zrp beads increased from 1 9 mmol g to 2 9 mmol g after washing with hcl fig 7 for the na2zrp beads after washing with nacl the qmax for nh4 increased from 3 2 mmol g to 5 5 mmol g while the k uptake increased from 1 2 mmol g to 1 5 mmol g the qmax values as well as the shape of the isotherms are very similar to those of the pure zirconium phosphates indicating that the washing treatment is effective in regaining the ion exchange properties in the encapsulated beads the presence of other electrolytes in the dialysate can affect the efficiency of sorption for the targeted ions besides nh4 and k other electrolytes of interest are na mg2 and ca2 55 56 the sorption of nh4 and k was evaluated using solutions initially containing equimolar amounts of these ions at different starting concentrations fig 8 the total ion capacity was 2 9 and 5 5 mmol gzrp for pan γ h2zrp and pan na2zrp respectively which are similar to the qmax values obtained during single ion adsorption both the encapsulated γ h2zrp and na2zrp show high selectivity for nh4 and k despite the presence of the other ions at a low concentration of 0 5 mm for each of the ions some mg2 and ca2 were also removed by pan γ h2zrp however the removal efficiency for these ions was only 20 compared to 84 88 for nh4 and k there was negligible sorption for na when the concentrations of the ions were higher essentially only nh4 and k were removed the selective sorption of nh4 and k may be related to the ionic size although other parameters such as hydrogen bonding may be relevant in the case of nh4 in the hydrated form na radius of 3 6 å mg2 4 3 å and ca2 4 1 å are all bigger than nh4 and k both 3 3 å 57 hence there is greater steric hindrance for the diffusion of na mg2 or ca2 into the interlayer spaces of the zirconium phosphates limiting their access to the ion exchange sites the selectivity for k and nh4 depends on the type of zirconium phosphate while both ions are adsorbed with almost equal efficiency by γ h2zrp α na2zrp shows a distinct preference for nh4 ions using equimolar solutions of only these two ions fig s8 the selectivity of pan γ h2zrp was found to be similar for k and nh4 at low concentrations but above 6 mm k is preferentially adsorbed with a k nh4 selectivity factor 1 64 on the other hand pan α na2zrp is about 4 times more selective for nh4 than for k independent of concentration a fast rate of ion exchange is important to avoid lengthy dialysis times 8 commercially available wearable sorbent dialysis devices typically remove 2 g urea per hour for every 250 g zirconium phosphate used this amounts to a sorption capacity of 0 27 mmol nh4 per gram per hour 40 the kinetics of ion exchange for the synthesized zirconium phosphates was investigated using 3 mm nh4 and k solutions fig s9 the initial rate of nh4 sorption was 9 6 mmol g h for γ h2zrp and 5 9 mmol g h for na2zrp fig 9 these values are higher than the reported rates for commercial sorbents although to be fair the conditions under which the latter had been measured were not disclosed and may differ both γ h2zrp and na2zrp showed similar rates for the sorption of k which were generally lower than for nh4 compared to the crystalline zirconium phosphates the rate of ion uptake and the capacity of the amorphous zrp was much lower this effect is particularly noticeable for nh4 where its rate was only 1 6 that of crystalline γ h2zrp a high rate of sorption ensures a shorter treatment time and also reduces the risk of potential bacterial contamination a clear advantage of using the composite beads as sorbents compared to powders is its recoverability and recyclability the zirconium phosphate beads are easy to handle and can be regenerated without difficulty by washing with either dilute hno3 or nacl the ion uptake capacity of the thrice regenerated γ h2zrp and na2zrp beads compares very well with the fresh samples fig 10 this is useful in the design of reusable sorbent cartridges especially for ion exchange purposes other than for medical treatment where single use cartridges are generally preferred to ensure sterility 4 conclusion crystalline sodium and hydrogen zirconium phosphates with α and γ structures were synthesized via a liquid assisted mechanochemistry based route for α crystalline forms the ion uptake correlated with the basal spacing α h2zrp with the smallest basal spacing of 7 55 å had negligible uptake of nh4 and k ions whereas α nahzrp and α na2zrp with bigger basal spacings were good ion exchangers the total uptake of nh4 by α na2zrp was 5 5 mol g which is very close to its theoretical exchange capacity for the γ forms both γ h2zrp and γ nahzrp are good exchangers for nh4 and k with total ion uptakes of 2 9 and 2 4 mmol g respectively the spherical beads formed by encapsulating the zirconium phosphate powders with pan polymer improve the flow behaviour by greatly reducing the pressure drop through the sorbent bed the ion exchange properties of the zirconium phosphates were unaffected by the polymer encapsulation interestingly the pan γ h2zrp beads show preferential uptake of k while pan na2zrp was more selective for nh4 over k replacement of the amorphous zrp typically used as a sorbent in dialysate cartridges by these crystalline forms with their higher sorption capacities will be beneficial as portability is a prime consideration in wearable artificial kidney devices a higher capacity of the sorbent directly translates into smaller and lighter devices declaration of competing interest the authors

and transferred to a 30 cm3 polypropylene container nalgene which was then tightly closed 21 after heating at 120 c for 24 h the solid was thoroughly washed by resuspension in deionized water collected by centrifugation and dried at 60 c to form na2zrp zrocl2 8h2o na2hpo4 and naf 1 3 0 3 molar ratio were used the half na exchanged nahzrp was obtained by treating na2zrp to ph 5 using 0 3 m hcl a mixture of zrocl2 8h2o nah2po4 h2o and naf 1 4 0 3 molar ratio was used to synthesize γ nahzrp this was converted to γ h2zrp by stirring in 0 3 m hcl for 24 h at room temperature to compare the ion exchange properties the amorphous zirconium phosphate was synthesized by precipitation of an aqueous solution of 0 2 m zrocl2 8h2o 30 cm3 with an equal volume of 0 5 m h3po4 solution under vigorous magnetic stirring at room temperature after aging at room temperature for 6 h the resulting gelatinous precipitate was vacuum filtered and thoroughly washed with 0 1 m h3po4 aqueous solution until free of chloride ions 2 3 pan encapsulation of zirconium phosphate powders the encapsulation of zirconium phosphate with pan was carried out following a reported procedure 33 35 a mixture of 0 8

to room temperature the cooled solution was loaded into a syringe and expressed through needles of 18 to 22 gauge size nominal i d 0 84 0 39 mm into a beaker of deionized water to form spherical composite beads of various sizes the beads were aged overnight washed by stirring in 0 5 m hcl for γ zrp and 0 5 m nacl for na2zrp 0 8 g beads to 250 cm3 solution for an hour and finally rinsed with deionized water the water was removed by freeze drying 2 4 characterization powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained using a bruker d8 avance diffractometer 40 kv 40 ma equipped with a copper anode and a lynxeye xe detector the diffractograms were measured over 2θ from 5 to 60 using a step size of 0 02 at 0 5 s step with sample rotation speed of 30 rpm the morphology of the materials was determined by scanning electron microscopy sem using a jeol jsm 6701f instrument samples were sputter coated with platinum prior to measurements for thermogravimetric analysis tga the samples were heated at 10 c min 1 to 1000 c under flowing air at 25 cm3 min 1 nitrogen isotherms were measured using a micromeritics tristar 3000 after degassing the samples for 12 h under flowing nitrogen at 30 c the pore size distributions were obtained from the desorption isotherms using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method the particle size distribution was obtained by dynamic light scattering dls with a malvern zetasizer zen 3600 2 5 ion exchange properties about 50 mg of the material were dispersed into 25 cm3 of an aqueous solution containing the cation of interest nh4 k na mg2 and ca2 at different concentrations 1 25 mm and gently shaken using an orbital shaker heidolph multi reax at room temperature for 20 h the concentration of the ions in the solution was determined by ion chromatography using a dionex ics 1100 equipped with a cs12a 4 mm cation exchange column the amount of ions adsorbed onto the zirconium phosphate was calculated from the concentration difference in the solution before and after the ion exchange the adsorbed amount q mmol g is given by the equation 1 q c o c e v m where co and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration mm respectively v is the volume of the solution and m is the mass of the ion exchanger used the removal efficiency r of a cation was calculated using 2 r c o c e c o 100 the distribution coefficient kd cm3 g is defined as the moles of ions adsorbed per gram of sorbent to the moles of ions remaining in solution at equilibrium and expressed as 36 3 k d c o c e c e v m the variation of the adsorbed ion with concentration was fitted with the langmuir isotherm 4 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e where kl the langmuir constant is related to the free energy of adsorption and qe and qmax are the equilibrium and maximum adsorbed amount respectively the model assumes that all the adsorption sites are identical and energetically equivalent with negligible interaction between molecules 37 38 the langmuir isotherm is the simplest model that adequately describes the observed ion uptake by the zirconium phosphates the equation can be rearranged into a linear form to obtain the langmuir constant by linear regression 39 5 c e q e 1 q max c e 1 k l q max to follow the kinetics of the adsorption 50 mg of the beads was stirred in 25 cm3 of a solution v m 500 cm3 g containing the cation of interest at

concentrations of these ions 0 5 6 mmol l the spent sorbents were regenerated by washing with either 0 1 m hno3 or nacl depending on their nature and their ion exchange properties were retested another three more times 3 results and discussion 3 1 zirconium phosphates and encapsulation the syntheses of crystalline α and γ zirconium phosphate use different phosphate sources for α zirconium phosphate h3po4 is used and the initial compound obtained is α h2zrp the xrd of α h2zrp is shown in fig 2a the peak at 2θ 11 71 corresponds to the basal spacing d of 7 55 å icdd 01 085 6081 with na substitution this peak moved to smaller angles indicating an increase in the basal spacing to 7 89 å for α nahzrp and 8 60 å for fully exchanged α na2zrp on the other hand the synthesis of the γ structure uses nah2po4 as the phosphate source which forms sodium zirconium hydrogen phosphate as the initial compound this compound exists with different degrees of hydration as indicated by xrd peaks corresponding to nahzr po4 2 xh2o icdd 00 033 1311 and nahzr po4 2 2 5h2o icdd 00 032 1217 fig s1 irrespective of the state of hydration γ nahzrp transforms to γ h2zrp icdd 04 012 1442 upon acid treatment fig 2b in the xrd pattern of γ h2zrp the peak at 2θ 7 23 corresponds to a basal distance of 12 21 å which is larger than in the α analogues encapsulation of the zirconium phosphate powders by pan formed spherical beads of different sizes from 1 92 mm to 3 75 mm depending on the needle diameter used figs s2 s3 the xrd results show that the structures of the crystalline zirconium phosphates were unaffected by the encapsulation fig 2 the morphology of zrp was examined by scanning electron microscopy na2zrp formed small platelets of irregular shapes 0 2 0 4 μm as well as nanorods fig 3 in contrast γ h2zrp crystallized as rectangular platelets of 0 3 0 8 1 1 3 μm the particle size distributions for na2zrp and γ h2zrp as determined by dls measurements were relatively narrow with a mean size of 301 50 and 1021 127 nm respectively fig s4 this is in good agreement with the particle sizes measured by sem after pan encapsulation the electron micrographs show a highly porous polymer network with the particles embedded in it as a result the surface area of the pan zrp beads increased by about fivefold while the pore volume rose from 0 04 to 0 08 cm3 g in the unencapsulated na2zrp and γ h2zrp to 0 15 0 24 cm3 g table 1 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the pan zrp beads show hysteresis loops at p po between 0 58 0 95 which indicate the presence of mesopores from 5 to 30 nm fig 4 the formation of a porous network around the zrp particles is necessary for ease of diffusion to the ion exchange sites of zrp the stability of the pan zrp composites was studied by tga fig 5 the total weight loss in γ h2zrp was 15 8 and occurred in three steps below 160 c the weight loss can be attributed to the desorption of water from the crystal structure and this amounted to 2 mol h2o mol zrp a second weight loss of 1 mol h2o mol zrp was observed at 350 c and the third weight loss at 700 c can be assigned to the condensation of hydroxyl groups during the transformation of zrp to zirconium pyrophosphate 21 the weight loss for the encapsulated γ h2zrp was bigger and the additional 31 5 can be attributed to pyrolysis of the polymer as only zirconium pyrophosphate remains at the end of the tga analysis eq 6 the zr pan ratio can be calculated in the same way the fraction of polymer in pan na2zrp was calculated from the tga curve eq 7 the zr pan weight ratio was 2 01 for γ h2zrp and 2 06 for na2zrp both values are in good agreement with the ratio of precursors used in the synthesis zr pan 2 polymer content 33 6 zr po 4 h 2 po 4 2h 2 o zrp 2 o

with a typical dietary protein intake of 1 g kg generates around 9 10 g urea per day 40 in patients with impaired kidney functions urea is the compound with the highest concentration found in the blood 41 42 in sorbent dialysis systems urea is enzymatically converted to nh4 which then can be removed by ion exchange potassium levels are also high in such patients and its removal to maintain safe levels of 3 5 mmol l is necessary to prevent hyperkalemia therefore the ion exchange capabilities for nh4 and k by the different zirconium phosphates were evaluated amongst the α zirconium phosphates h2zrp was a poor ion exchanger for nh4 and k table 2 in contrast both nahzrp and na2zrp readily take up these ions notably the uptake of nh4 by na2zrp was 5 5 mmol g which is close to the theoretical value of 5 8 mmol g based on its formula with both na being exchangeable the experimental points fit well with the langmuir adsorption model where the sorption is limited to the sites at the surface fig s5 the poor ion exchange behaviour of h2zrp can be attributed to its small interlayer space and narrow zeolitic cavities 43 44 by substituting the protons in h2zrp with larger cations such as na either partially or fully the interlayer space is expanded this resulted in significant increases in the nh4 and k uptake fig s6a b γ zirconium phosphates have larger basal spacings than the α structure and both γ nahzrp and γ h2zrp show indeed good uptake of nh4 and k fig s6c d the maximum uptake for these ions was 2 9 mmol g for γ h2zrp as the theoretical ion exchange capacity for γ h2zrp is 6 3 mmol g it appears that only half the hydrogen ions can be readily exchanged one reason may be the big disparity in the first and second dissociation constants for h2po4 6 31 10 8 and 4 22 10 13 mol l respectively the measured nh4 and k distribution coefficients kd for nahzrp and na2zrp γ h2zrp and γ nahzrp are all above 100 cm3 g which is characteristic of good sorbents 45 47 the highest kd values were observed for γ h2zrp compared to these crystalline zirconium phosphates the amorphous zrp gel had significantly lower ion exchange capacity the maximum nh4 and k uptake by the latter was only 1 5 and 1 2 mmol g respectively fig s7 this agrees with earlier findings by clearfield and hunter who reported an nh4 uptake of only 0 5 mmol g by amorphous h2zrp table s1 48 49 a compilation of other nh4 and k ion exchangers is listed in table s1 the naturally occurring mineral clinoptilolite na4k4 al18si40o96 24h2o has been evaluated as nh4 exchanger and the maximum uptake was 0 6 mmol g table s1 entry 4 50 however its use in a dialyser would be problematic as it contains other metal ions like k na al and ca which will leach into the dialysate for agricultural applications i e to remove nh4 from soil biochar a carbon rich material produced during pyrolysis has been proposed the best performing biochar is an activated form which has a maximum nh4 uptake of 1 5 mmol g table s1 entry 5 51 kadirova et al prepared a material from industrial wastes spent alumina catalyst and steel convertor slag by mixing them in appropriate ratios and calcining at 1000 c 52 a 7 3 ratio gave the highest nh4 adsorption capacity of 2 2 mmol g table s1 entry 6 there are fewer sorbents reported for k ion exchange hydrous titanium dioxide is selective to k with a capacity of 0 5 mmol g for ion exchange under ambient conditions table s1 entry 7 53 clearfield et al found that crystalline h2zrp had low uptake of k with the maximum adsorption capacity of only 0 1 mmol g table s1 entry 8 25 wester et al compared the uptake of k from blood plasma by commercially available zirconium phosphate zeolite and a cationic sodium polystyrene divinylbenzene sulfonate exchanger resonium a 54 zirconium phosphate had the highest k uptake of 0 44 mmol g whereas for resonium a which is used in treatment for hyperkalemia the uptake was only 0 16 mmol g in comparison our synthesized na2zrp and γ h2zrp have much higher sorption capacities for nh4 and k furthermore they can simultaneously sorb both nh4 and k so that it is not required to use separate ion specific sorbents although the crystalline zirconium phosphates show good ion exchange properties for nh4 and k the small particle size leads to high pressure drop and clogging when applied in dialysate cartridges hence to improve the operational properties their encapsulation with pan to form spherical beads was attempted na2zrp and γ h2zrp which have good uptakes for nh4 and k were chosen composites with 27 33 and 38 pan were evaluated to find an optimal composition for the beads it is desirable to use as little pan as possible since the polymer does not contribute to any ion exchange as shown in fig 6 the nh4 sorption capacity was little affected by the encapsulation the composite with 33 pan appears to be optimum as it resulted in spherical beads that were more robust than those obtained with a lower polymer content of 27 the preparation of the beads involves the use of dmf as solvent for the pan polymer it has been reported that dmf can intercalate into the interlayer spacing of zirconium phosphate 33 this can impede the ion exchange ability due to its interaction with the h or na exchange sites of zrp moreover even traces of the solvent can be detrimental for biomedical applications therefore complete removal of dmf is important to address this a washing step with dilute hcl or nacl depending on the ionic form of the zirconium phosphate was introduced the maximum adsorption capacity qmax for nh4 and k of the γ h2zrp beads increased from 1 9 mmol g to 2 9 mmol g after washing with hcl fig 7 for the na2zrp beads after washing with nacl the qmax for nh4 increased from 3 2 mmol g to 5 5 mmol g while the k uptake increased from 1 2 mmol g to 1 5 mmol g the qmax values as well as the shape of the isotherms are very similar to those of the pure zirconium phosphates indicating that the washing treatment is effective in regaining the ion exchange properties in the encapsulated beads the presence of other electrolytes in the dialysate can affect the efficiency of sorption for the targeted ions besides nh4 and k other electrolytes of interest are na mg2 and ca2 55 56 the sorption of nh4 and k was evaluated using solutions initially containing equimolar amounts of these ions at different starting concentrations fig 8 the total ion capacity was 2 9 and 5 5 mmol gzrp for pan γ h2zrp and pan na2zrp respectively which are similar to the qmax values obtained during single ion adsorption both the encapsulated γ h2zrp and na2zrp show high selectivity for nh4 and k despite the presence of the other ions at a low concentration of 0 5 mm for each of the ions some mg2 and ca2 were also removed by pan γ h2zrp however the removal efficiency for these ions was only 20 compared to 84 88 for nh4 and k there was negligible sorption for na when the concentrations of the ions were higher essentially only nh4 and k were removed the selective sorption of nh4 and k may be related to the ionic size although other parameters such as hydrogen bonding may be relevant in the case of nh4 in the hydrated form na radius of 3 6 å mg2 4 3 å and ca2 4 1 å are all bigger than nh4 and k both 3 3 å 57 hence there is greater steric hindrance for the diffusion of na mg2 or ca2 into the interlayer spaces of the zirconium phosphates limiting their access to the ion exchange sites the selectivity for k and nh4 depends on the type of zirconium phosphate while both ions are adsorbed with almost equal efficiency by γ h2zrp α na2zrp shows a distinct preference for nh4 ions using equimolar solutions of only these two ions fig s8 the selectivity of pan γ h2zrp was found to be similar for k and nh4 at low concentrations but above 6 mm k is preferentially adsorbed with a k nh4 selectivity factor 1 64 on the other hand pan α na2zrp is about 4 times more selective for nh4 than for k independent of concentration a fast rate of ion exchange is important to avoid lengthy dialysis times 8 commercially available wearable sorbent dialysis devices typically remove 2 g urea per hour for every 250 g zirconium phosphate used this amounts to a sorption capacity of 0 27 mmol nh4 per gram per hour 40 the kinetics of ion exchange for the synthesized zirconium phosphates was investigated using 3 mm nh4 and k solutions fig s9 the initial rate of nh4 sorption was 9 6 mmol g h for γ h2zrp and 5 9 mmol g h for na2zrp fig 9 these values are higher than the reported rates for commercial sorbents although to be fair the conditions under which the latter had been measured were not disclosed and may differ both γ h2zrp and na2zrp showed similar rates for the sorption of k which were generally lower than for nh4 compared to the crystalline zirconium phosphates the rate of ion uptake and the capacity of the amorphous zrp was much lower this effect is particularly noticeable for nh4 where its rate was only 1 6 that of crystalline γ h2zrp a high rate of sorption ensures a shorter treatment time and also reduces the risk of potential bacterial contamination a clear advantage of using the composite beads as sorbents compared to powders is its recoverability and recyclability the zirconium phosphate beads are easy to handle and can be regenerated without difficulty by washing with either dilute hno3 or nacl the ion uptake capacity of the thrice regenerated γ h2zrp and na2zrp beads compares very well with the fresh samples fig 10 this is useful in the design of reusable sorbent cartridges especially for ion exchange purposes other than for medical treatment where single use cartridges are generally preferred to ensure sterility 4 conclusion crystalline sodium and hydrogen zirconium phosphates with α and γ structures were synthesized via a liquid assisted mechanochemistry based route for α crystalline forms the ion uptake correlated with the basal spacing α h2zrp with the smallest basal spacing of 7 55 å had negligible uptake of nh4 and k ions whereas α nahzrp and α na2zrp with bigger basal spacings were good ion exchangers the total uptake of nh4 by α na2zrp was 5 5 mol g which is very close to its theoretical exchange capacity for the γ forms both γ h2zrp and γ nahzrp are good exchangers for nh4 and k with total ion uptakes of 2 9 and 2 4 mmol g respectively the spherical beads formed by encapsulating the zirconium phosphate powders with pan polymer improve the flow behaviour by greatly reducing the pressure drop through the sorbent bed the ion exchange properties of the zirconium phosphates were unaffected by the polymer encapsulation interestingly the pan γ h2zrp beads show preferential uptake of k while pan na2zrp was more selective for nh4 over k replacement of the amorphous zrp typically used as a sorbent in dialysate cartridges by these crystalline forms with their higher sorption capacities will be beneficial as portability is a prime consideration in wearable artificial kidney devices a higher capacity of the sorbent directly translates into smaller and lighter devices declaration of competing interest the authors

12821,the integration of microalgae in the municipal wastewater treatment scheme could certainly be an interesting option to reduce the carbon footprint of the process the obtained microalgae could be valorized through hydrothermal carbonization htc producing a sorbent material to be used as an alternative to activated carbon however htc of microalgae does produce potentially harmful byproducts the present work aims to investigate the possibility of using the effluent derived from the hydrothermal carbonization of microalgae htc lf performed to produce microalgal based carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles me nfe as a growth medium for the microalgae since this raw effluent was proved to be toxic for allivibrio fisheri ec50 1 8 the microalgal activity was studied also for detoxification a 20 dilution of the htc lf using municipal centrate as the diluent was proved to be suitable for microalgal growth without affecting the photochemical efficiency in a continuous test a community made of chlorella spp and euglena gracilis was able to grow with and without co2 addition with average productivity of 62 5 and 43 8 mg l 1 d 1 respectively the treatment led to a 60 cod removal suggesting that the htc lf was not harmful to the microalgae bacteria consortia which was also able to decrease its toxicity environmental implications the liquid byproduct of the hydrothermal carbonization htc lf is a known toxic for the water compartment the possibility to exploit its nutrient content for microalgal growth was already proved by different studies using strong dilution with synthetic medium to perform batch cultivations here the htc lf was diluted with the blackwater from biosolid dewatering without adding any microelements or main nutrients to perform a continuous cultivation a microalgal community was grown consuming nutrients and the cod lowering the toxicity the obtained biomass was used to produce second generation nanoparticles designing our process as a cycle in an eco sustainable way graphical abstract unlabelled image 1 introduction hydrothermal carbonization htc is a low impact thermochemical process that can be used to enhance the properties of different biomasses including microalgae providing new options for their valorization 1 htc is a wet conversion process occurring under moderate temperature conditions 180 250 c in a compressed environment which causes different chain like chemical reactions transforming the starting biomass into a carbon enriched material hydrochar 2 during the process the hydrochar which is the solid fraction is not the only product as a liquid and a gaseous stream is also formed given the operative conditions involving a relatively low final pressure the hydrothermal gaseous fraction htc gf is minor 3 however the liquid fraction htc lf is a byproduct that needs precise characterization and proper management the htc lf is produced in a considerable amount and can be toxic so it could represent a severe limitation for the sustainability of the htc process 4 the chemical composition of the htc lf is strongly influenced by the htc settings temperature final pressure and organic feedstock 2 5 this means that the qualitative and quantitative composition of these types of wastewater is highly variable making it very difficult to identify a general strategy of disposal literature concerning this topic is still quite poor however the presence of inorganic nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus but also of volatile fatty acids vfas and organic aromatic compounds in these wastewaters is recognized 6 7 those compounds which are formed during the partial combustion of the biomass might determine severe toxicity not only for the water compartment but also for plants and algae 4 that is why the htc lf must be treated as a hazardous pollutant however finding new strategies for its management could be interesting coupling the recovery of nutrients and other compounds with organic matter degradation especially in the perspective of the circular economy in this respect anaerobic digestion could be a valuable possibility to remove cod in different htc wastewaters 8 9 given the htc lf nutrient content microalgae based treatment can also be proposed to recover nitrogen and phosphorus however the high cod in these wastewaters as well as the high variability in the other chemical characteristics which depends also on the starting biomass make the htc lf a difficult media to be dealt with chlorella spp was effectively grown on diluted fractions of htc wastewater however such strategy was tested only on short batch tests 25 26 here we propose the characterization and the potential valorization of the htc lf obtained during the production of microalgal based carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles me nfe to be used for wastewater treatment in the presented case the microalgal biomass used as htc substrate to produce me nfe was grown on the liquid fraction of municipal digestate centrate to close the loop the hypothesis of using htc lf mixed with centrate as an algal growth medium was tested the novelty of the proposal is given by the integration of different aspects the microalgae can be used directly in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp as an unconventional biological treatment due to their ability to uptake nutrients while sustaining the biological nitrification the biomass produced alongside the treatment of the centrate can be valorized through htc to produce a nanomaterial with interesting adsorbent and reducing power which can be valuable to polish wwtp effluents the htc lf can be finally redirected to a microalgal cultivation unit to produce new microalgae designing the entire process as a cycle as indicated in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 biomass cultivation harvesting and htc synthesis the microalgae used as feedstock for the htc process were collected from the pilot scale high rate algal pond hrap located at the bresso niguarda wwtp as was described in mantovani et al 10 to produce me nfe 6 g of dried microalgae were resuspended in 200 ml of distilled water and mixed with 15 g of iron iii nitrate nonahydrate fe no3 3 9h2o and treated by htc the reactor temperature was set at 225 c for a 3 h residence time the htc lf was recovered after vacuum filtration washing the nanoparticles with 200 ml of distilled water at the end of the process 400 ml of htc lf were recovered and stored in glass bottles for the subsequent steps of the work 2 2 htc lf characterization the htc lf produced with the me nfe is an ochre or transparent straw yellow liquor having a pungent smell related to the presence of dissolved volatile substances table 1 reports the average characterization in terms of nutrient concentrations ph and solids content tss and turbidity of the htc lf the analyzed samples had relatively high concentrations of nh4 n and high values of cod deriving from the liquid phase reactions occurring during the htc process also the low solids content and turbidity are features that could make the htc lf interesting for microalgal cultivation since they allow light penetration on the other hand the high cod stands out as the main critical point as it could be an energy source for heterotrophic microorganisms competing with microalgae for nutrients the observed variability in the nutrient concentration could depend on differences in the composition of the microalgae that were used this must always be considered as the hrap is an outdoor cultivation system based on centrate and changes in the composition of the centrate as well as of the community are common and fast 2 3 microtox assay microtox is an in vitro testing system which uses bioluminescent bacteria allivibrio fischeri to investigate the acute toxicity of water and solid samples toxicity is detected as a decrease of the bioluminescence after 5 and 15 min of exposure acute toxicity was performed using a microtox m500 analyzer modern water inc delaware usa for the detection of the luminescence inhibition on vibrio fischeri according to bs en iso 11348 1 11 tests were performed following the 81 9 basic test protocol which consists of a control and serial dilutions of the sample the inhibitory effect was determined first on the raw sample of htc lf as median effect concentration ec50 then pretreatments were done on the sample to understand if the overall toxicity was related to the iron content of the htc lf or to some other heavy metal coming from the used microalgal biomass that was grown on centrate or to the presence of organic compounds derived from the htc conditions the first hypothesis was studied by inducing chemical precipitation of the metals as hydroxides possibly present in the sample naoh 1 m was used to increase ph the supernatant was recovered and its toxicity was tested by microtox after hcl 1 m addition to restore the ph centrifugation at 5000 rpm 10 min was also performed as an alternative pretreatment the second hypothesis was studied by adsorption through jar tests having a 4 h contact time carried out using a commercial wood derived activated carbon norit ca1 sigma aldrich saint louis usa two doses of activated carbons were used 2 and 3 g l 1 after adsorption the activated carbons were separated from the supernatant through centrifugation 10 min at 5000 rpm 2 4 toxicity assay chlorella vulgaris was grown on different htc lf dilutions 60 40 20 and 5 to perform a 72 h batch test the pure microalgal culture was provided by istituto spallanzani rivolta d adda cr italy basal bold medium bbm was used as a control and diluent 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks were put on an orbital shaker at 120 rpm and artificially illuminated at 100 μmol m

quantify and characterize the algal biomass sytox green assay measures the viability of the microalgal communities by sytox green nucleic acid staining dead cells where the dye can penetrate emit a bright green fluorescence when excited by light at the wavelength of 450 490 nm on the contrary living microalgae can be easily distinguished for their red color induced by the autofluorescence of chlorophyll 12 as sytox green cannot penetrate the cell for the staining step the microalgal suspension 1 ml of each sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 rpm the pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of distilled water and sytox green was added 0 5 μl the dye labeled samples were then kept in the dark for 10 min and observed using a zeiss fluorescence microscope axio scope hbo 50 on average 300 cells were counted randomly through the slide noting the proportion between dead and living cells green and red respectively the viability of every sample was obtained as follows v g r g 100 where v is the cell viability percentage g is the number of observed green cells dead and r is the number of red cells alive the effect of htc lf on photosynthetic efficiency was measured at different exposure times 0 1 24 48 and 72 h using phyto pam ii heinz walz gmbh eeltrich germany aliquots of the algal suspension were diluted to reach an od 680 nm of 0 1 and then kept in the dark for 20 min f0

and dissolved oxygen each column is connected to a stirring bloc with a magnetic rotor providing mechanical mixing asteroid 40 2mag ag muenchen germany and is fed by an independent peristaltic pump in reactors 3 and 4 co2 was supplied in a ph controlled mode with a ph set point range between 6 5 and 7 5 while in reactors 1 and 2 no ph control occurred the pbrs dedicated software idea biotech was used to automatically control a system of solenoid valves connected to a co2 cylinder every time that the ph probe would register values higher than 7 5 due to the photosynthesis the software would open the solenoid valves letting the co2 bubble through the microalgal suspension the closing of the valves was an automatic response every time ph was below 6 5 the culturing system was also equipped with artificial illumination 100 μmol m 2 s 1 working on a 12 12 h cycle as previously specified in section 2 4 the columns were filled with the htc lf centrate solution 20 80 v v and inoculated with a mixed microalgal community made mostly of chlorella spp and euglena gracilis from bresso hrap to reach a starting od680 value of 0 1 all the pbrs were first maintained in batch for 10 days to allow microalgae to adapt to the new conditions then they were fed continuously setting a hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 days corresponding to the hrt of bresso hrap the discharged microalgal suspension of each pbr was collected and centrifuged daily the biomass was dried at 50 c and stored for future analysis 2 7 analytical determinations inorganic nitrogen nh4 n no3 n and no2 n phosphate po4 p and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod were analyzed by spectrophotometric test kits hach lange düsseldorf germany lck303 lck 340 lck 342 lck 348 and lck1414 respectively on filtered samples 0 45 μm ph and temperature were measured by a laboratory probe xs pc 510 eutech instruments during the preliminary growth test and the batch cultivation during the continuous cultivation ph and temperature were measured online and recorded microalgal concentration was assessed by measuring the total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss according to standard methods 15 optical density od680 using a dr 3900 hach lange germany spectrophotometer and by algal cell counts microalgae were counted using an optical microscope 40 b 350 optika italy and a hemocytometer marienfeld germany morphology and size were used as indicators to distinguish different strains the cell concentration was obtained as the mean of 72 square observations 0 04 mm2 and expressed as cell ml 1 nutrients and biomass evolution over time were monitored two times per week over 35 days while phyto pam analyses were carried out once per week as was previously described the microalgae were kept fed for five additional days when the last samples for phyto pam analysis and microtox test were collected before the final harvesting of all the biomass contained in the pbrs microalgal growth rates rtss were calculated considering the mass balance across each pbr as shown in the formula tss ti 1 tss ti δt tss in tss ti hrt rtss where tss ti and tss ti 1 are the tss concentrations at time ti and ti 1 in the pbrs tssin is the tss of the influent centrate δt is the time between the samplings the same formula was used to calculate nitrite and nitrate production rates rno2 and rno3 the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria r aob was then evaluated indirectly and expressed as the sum of rno2 and rno3 as described in pizzera et al 16 free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna concentrations were calculated according to the following formulas using the data of ph temperature nh4 n and no2 n concentrations obtained during the monitoring of the pbrs fa nh 4 n 1 10 ph e 6344 273 t fna no 2 n 10 ph e 2300 273 t 2 8 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out using r project software 27 the t test for unpaired data was performed to highlight differences between the results obtained in pbrs with and without co2 for po4 p cod and nh4 n percent removal efficiencies η for microalgal growth rate rtss and ammonia oxidizing bacteria growth rate raob p values 0 05 were deemed to be significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 microtox assay fig 2 shows the results of the microtox assay on the raw htc lf the effect was very strong even at high dilutions in the experiment 1 ec50 was 1 8 after 15 min this was not an unexpected result as the toxicity of effluent from the htc of different biomass is reported in the literature mihajlović et al 17 tested the effluent produced during the htc of miscanthus x giganteus performed at the temperature of 180 200 and 220 c obtaining ec50 comparable to the one of the present work 1 29 1 05 and 0 69 respectively unfortunately no reports on the microtox test using htc liquid fraction from microalgae were found for a direct comparison as previously mentioned the test was repeated after a pre treatment step to remove iron or other heavy metals but only a slight reduction of toxicity was obtained proving that the problem was not the dissolved metal but the presence of some toxic organic compounds or maybe the combination of both in experiment 2 ec50 was 6 8 after 15 min a centrifugation step 10 min at 5000 rpm was also tested but did not produce better results exp 3 ec50 6 5 after 15 min the most effective pre treatment was certainly the adsorption on activated carbon both the tested concentrations 2 g l 1 and 3 g l 1 were able to significantly reduce the htc lf toxicity the best result was achieved with 3 g l 1 exp 4 ec50 60 after 15 min proving that the adsorption with activated carbons could be effective for the sustainable management of htc lf 3 2 microalgal growth and toxicity evaluation during the preliminary test all the microalgae were able to grow and the only sensible inhibition was observed in the sample with the highest htc lf concentration 60 fig 3 highlights the maximal photochemical efficiency trend over time fv fm all the samples were characterized by values higher than 0 5 suggesting good photosynthetic efficiencies 18 however samples grown on the highest htc lf concentration showed an evident decrease of fv fm on the other hand the viability assay with sytox green did not show differences between the samples and the control even after 72 h table 2 table 2 also reports the microalgal concentration at the end of the test as for the cell counts the samples and the control gave comparable results with the only exception of the microalgae grown on the 5 htc lf that reached the highest concentration however tss values were very different among the samples and the control in particular the higher the htc lf percentage in the growth media the higher was the tss concentration those differences were explained by the development of bacteria which could be observed at the optical microscope especially in samples d and e those samples were the ones in which nutrients and cod were higher due to the higher percentage of htc lf the availability of organic matter and o2 produced by microalgae might have promoted heterotrophic bacteria leading to an increase in the total biomass the phenomenon observed in those samples was indeed curios but still very interesting proving that some bacteria could be more resistant than allivibrio fischeri based on such results the 20 dilution was chosen as the best compromise for further analyses 3 3 preliminary batch cultivation the test lasted almost 40 days showing interesting results which are reported in fig 4 the first graph on the left is the trend of tss over time which is a good proxy for the microalgal concentration in a medium a long lag phase was observed in both samples as high flocculation even after sonication occurred the microalgal concentration seems lower at days 7 and 14 than at time zero but this was mainly due to flocculation making it difficult to collect a representative sample however chlorella was able to adapt to the new environment and did grow after two weeks reaching tss concentration over 1 g l 1 at the end of the test nh4 n and po4 p were rapidly consumed in the control but the trend was much slower in the samples as the algae were not fully adapted however after 20 days during the exponential growth phase the consumption of nutrients became very fast also in a1 and a2 as expected from past studies 10 14 the cod of the bresso centrate is not very degradable so it was constant over time in the control however the starting cod was higher in samples a1 and a2 due to the htc lf contribution in such samples cod was rapidly consumed after two weeks of acclimation till cod values reached the one in the control this was very interesting as it shows that the cod fraction of the htc lf could be removed by the algae bacteria consortium 3 4 continuous cultivation microalgae were able to grow both with and without co2 during the continuous cultivation having an average growth rate rtss of 62 5 and 43 8 mg l 1 d 1 respectively the trend of tss concentration including both microalgae and bacteria biomass and od680 of the samples can be observed in fig 5 graphs a and b respectively looking at the graphs it is evident that the trend of the two proxies for microalgal concentration agree only in part on the left the tss trend would suggest that the microalgae could grow better in the pbrs with co2 on the right the od680 had similar evolution only at the beginning of the test microalgae were able to double their od level after 10 days when co2 was bubbled while microalgae needed more time without co2 however after day 17 a strong drop of the od680 occurred only for samples grown under co2 while the other ones could still increase their concentration reaching a final od value of 1 7 the presence of bacteria biomass alone is less convincing this time to explain the difference between the trend of tss and the other variables nevertheless a shift in microalgal community composition was observed during the trial in the pbrs without co2 chlorella spp became dominant and euglena gracilis disappeared euglena gracilis is known to prefer ph between 4 and 8 19 and this condition was not respected in pbrs without co2 which had higher ph at least in the first part of the test on the contrary pbrs with co2 maintained the original microalgal composition as ph was stable around 7 5 since euglena cells are larger than chlorella ones the overall tss in pbr with co2 was probably higher even when the od680 was not as high as in pbr without co2 the microscope cell counts ranged between 106 and 107 cells ml 1 throughout the test the trends over time which are reported in fig 5c are very similar to the ones of od680 at first the microalgal concentration was higher in the pbr with co2 intake but the situation was reversed during the second part of the trial a fair correlation between total cell counts and optical density was indeed highlighted both in pbrs with and without co2 r2 0 85 and r2 0 83 respectively however no correlation was observed between tss and total algal counts fig 6 temperature ph and dissolved oxygen trends over time are plotted in fig 7 the temperature in the reactors strongly changed during the test following the environmental temperature in the laboratory the probes registered a maximum of 27 7 c at the beginning of the cultivation and a minimum of 18 c on day 31 ph control worked quite fine in the samples grown under co2 and was very stable around the set point of 7 5 of course the ph value was higher in the samples grown without co2 and it was very stable during the first two weeks after day 15 as can be noticed in fig 5g partial nitrification started and lead ph to decrease from 8 8 to 7 8 and n no2 to accumulate dissolved oxygen was similar in the first days of the test however in the second half a difference in the two groups of pbrs started to enhance probably due to the contribution of ammonia oxidizing bacteria which started to use oxygen to convert nh4 n to no2 n especially in the pbrs without co2 phyto pam analyses suggested that the microalgae were able to adapt to the 20 htc lf as the photosynthetic efficiency was high and stable during all the cultivation at first fv fm was only 0 5 suggesting that the microalgae still needed to adapt properly to their new media however as reported in fig 8 after just a few days of continuous feeding the fv fm increased remaining between 0 6 and 0 7 afterward this trend could be also confirmed by considering the free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna concentrations in the pbrs fa concentrations were never particularly high even in the group without ph control maximum fa was 51 2 mg l 1 at the beginning to gradually decrease up to 0 2 2 1 mg l 1 and were even smaller in the pbrs with ph control maximum fa concentration was 3 6 0 1 mg l 1 at the beginning to gradually decrease up to 1 9 0 1 mg l 1 fna concentrations were always lower than 0 1 mg l 1 in both groups as shown in fig 5d effective removal of phosphorus was achieved rapidly and maintained during the whole test with average values of 91 and 94 for the microalgae grown without and with co2 respectively cod removal fig 5f was interesting too with an average percentage of 62 and 65 for the microalgae grown without and with co2 respectively these data confirmed the ones found during the batch cultivation step on the other hand the nh4 n removal fig 5e was low in all the reactors at least till day 20 when partial nitrification started especially in the community grown without co2 fig 5g the t test for unpaired data showed that the microalgal growth rate rtss and the ammonia oxidizing bacteria growth rate raob were significantly different between samples fig 9 of course higher microalgal productivity was expected where co2 was bubbled with the double aim of sustaining the photosynthesis and maintaining the ph under a certain level to limit nitrogen stripping however the community grown without co2 was still able to grow without limitation probably exploiting the co2 produced during the oxidation of cod nevertheless what is less clear is why partial nitrification was relevant in the pbrs without co2 and not in the other ones it is known that nitrifying bacteria are very sensitive to ph skadsen 20 report an optimum ph range for nitrosomonas between 7 and 8 however ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob can be deeply influenced also by other parameters such as free ammonia temperature and light making it difficult to predict the nitrification process 21 the t tests for unpaired data were performed also on p po4 cod and nh4 n removal efficiency η po4 p η cod and η nh4 n however the differences were not statistically relevant as shown by the boxplots in fig 10 due to previous experience 10 the interaction between microalgae and bacteria seems crucial to achieve high performance in nutrient removal from municipal centrate this consideration seems valuable also in the present case the increasing nitrite concentration in the pbrs was very interesting showing that aob could grow even in the 20 dilution of the htc lf of course raob was relevant only in the samples grown without co2 however an increase of no2 n started in the other pbrs as well fig 5h from day 29 furthermore the cod removal was also evidence of intense heterotrophic bacteria activity still compatible with the htc lf leading to the release of co2 which could be used by microalgae but also by aobs finally a sample of each microalgal suspension has been collected at the end of the cultivation day 40 and the liquid fractions obtained after centrifugation were then tested via microtox comparing their toxicity with the one of the htc lf centrate solution used as the growth medium as shown in the graph in fig 11 a substantial decrease in toxicity was observed after microalgal cultivation the ec50 rose from 20 in the htc lf centrate solution in to 30 in the samples co2 and no co2 of course the supernatants were still toxic after the microalgal treatment highlighting the need to further treatments before safe disposal however other toxicity assays involving different trophic levels could provide a better knowledge of the situation based on the obtained result using the htc lf as a growth medium for microalgae seems promising the possibility to grow microalgae on htc wastewater was already tested by different authors precisely for the presence of a high concentration of nutrients however the tests were mainly performed as short batch experiments on very diluted wastewaters comparisons are not that simple as the htc wastewaters might greatly differ depending on the nature of the starting biomass and the htc conditions du et al 2012 tested the potential of chlorella vulgaris to grow in different dilutions from 50 to 200 times of the htc lf the microalgae were able to grow and remove 45 5 59 9 of total nitrogen tn 85 8 94 6 of total phosphorus tp and 50 0 60 9 of cod a similar approach was evaluated by belete et al 2019 using the liquid fraction of htc of activated sludge to enrich the brackish water from the sede boker saline aquifer israel to cultivate coelastrella spp and chlorella spp however the mixture was also enriched with micronutrients 1 ml l 1 of the a5 solution from the zarrouk medium the microalgae were able to grow during short term batch tests 5 days having growth rates similar to the one of the control grown on bg11 medium overall the presented study could provide an interesting option for the management of the effluent produced with the me nfe the entire production of iron nanoparticles could be designed as a cycle where the liquid byproduct is redirected in a new microalgal cultivation unit and used to obtain new biomass for the synthesis of second generation me nfe considering the magnetic power of the me nfe the separation from the treated effluent is easy and allows the use of the same batch of nanoparticles for various cycles after being used as a growth medium the htc lf could be treated through adsorption with activated carbons to decrease its toxicity allowing a final and safer disposal 4 conclusions the htc lf obtained during the synthesis of me nfe was proved to be toxic for allivibrio fisheri suggesting a harmful potential against the water compartment however the overall toxicity was reduced through adsorption with wood derived activated carbons on the other hand the possibility to grow microalgae on the htc lf was demonstrated as no sensible inhibition in the photochemical activities was detected for chlorella vulgaris given the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus a 20 dilution of the htc lf was tested both in batch and continuous experiments as a growth medium for microalgae using both pure cultures and mixed microalgal community grown on the supernatant of municipal digestate the experiments demonstrated that the microalgae could grow in the htc lf with or without co2 addition to foster photosynthesis the microalgal treatment was able to reduce the nutrient concentration and partial nitrification also occurred proving that aob could resist in the htc lf at 20 dilution cod removal which was around 60 was particularly interesting demonstrating that some organic components of the htc lf could be degraded by the synergy of microalgae and bacteria leading to a slight decrease in terms of toxicity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the study was supported by perform water 2030 funded by european community through fesr

12821,the integration of microalgae in the municipal wastewater treatment scheme could certainly be an interesting option to reduce the carbon footprint of the process the obtained microalgae could be valorized through hydrothermal carbonization htc producing a sorbent material to be used as an alternative to activated carbon however htc of microalgae does produce potentially harmful byproducts the present work aims to investigate the possibility of using the effluent derived from the hydrothermal carbonization of microalgae htc lf performed to produce microalgal based carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles me nfe as a growth medium for the microalgae since this raw effluent was proved to be toxic for allivibrio fisheri ec50 1 8 the microalgal activity was studied also for detoxification a 20 dilution of the htc lf using municipal centrate as the diluent was proved to be suitable for microalgal growth without affecting the photochemical efficiency in a continuous test a community made of chlorella spp and euglena gracilis was able to grow with and without co2 addition with average productivity of 62 5 and 43 8 mg l 1 d 1 respectively the treatment led to a 60 cod removal suggesting that the htc lf was not harmful to the microalgae bacteria consortia which was also able to decrease its toxicity environmental implications the liquid byproduct of the hydrothermal carbonization htc lf is a known toxic for the water compartment the possibility to exploit its nutrient content for microalgal growth was already proved by different studies using strong dilution with synthetic medium to perform batch cultivations here the htc lf was diluted with the blackwater from biosolid dewatering without adding any microelements or main nutrients to perform a continuous cultivation a microalgal community was grown consuming nutrients and the cod lowering the toxicity the obtained biomass was used to produce second generation nanoparticles designing our process as a cycle in an eco sustainable way graphical abstract unlabelled image 1 introduction hydrothermal carbonization htc is a low impact thermochemical process that can be used to enhance the properties of different biomasses including microalgae providing new options for their valorization 1 htc is a wet conversion process occurring under moderate temperature conditions 180 250 c in a compressed environment which causes different chain like chemical reactions transforming the starting biomass into a carbon enriched material hydrochar 2 during the process the hydrochar which is the solid fraction is not the only product as a liquid and a gaseous stream is also formed given the operative conditions involving a relatively low final pressure the hydrothermal gaseous fraction htc gf is minor 3 however the liquid fraction htc lf is a byproduct that needs precise characterization and proper management the htc lf is produced in a considerable amount and can be toxic so it could represent a severe limitation for the sustainability of the htc process 4 the chemical composition of the htc lf is strongly influenced by the htc settings temperature final pressure and organic feedstock 2 5 this means that the qualitative and quantitative composition of these types of wastewater is highly variable making it very difficult to identify a general strategy of disposal literature concerning this topic is still quite poor however the presence of inorganic nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus but also of volatile fatty acids vfas and organic aromatic compounds in these wastewaters is recognized 6 7 those compounds which are formed during the partial combustion of the biomass might determine severe toxicity not only for the water compartment but also for plants and algae 4 that is why the htc lf must be treated as a hazardous pollutant however finding new strategies for its management could be interesting coupling the recovery of nutrients and other compounds with organic matter degradation especially in the perspective of the circular economy in this respect anaerobic digestion could be a valuable possibility to remove cod in different htc wastewaters 8 9 given the htc lf nutrient content microalgae based treatment can also be proposed to recover nitrogen and phosphorus however the high cod in these wastewaters as well as the high variability in the other chemical characteristics which depends also on the starting biomass make the htc lf a difficult media to be dealt with chlorella spp was effectively grown on diluted fractions of htc wastewater however such strategy was tested only on short batch tests 25 26 here we propose the characterization and the potential valorization of the htc lf obtained during the production of microalgal based carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles me nfe to be used for wastewater treatment in the presented case the microalgal biomass used as htc substrate to produce me nfe was grown on the liquid fraction of municipal digestate centrate to close the loop the hypothesis of using htc lf mixed with centrate as an algal growth medium was tested the novelty of the proposal is given by the integration of different aspects the microalgae can be used directly in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp as an unconventional biological treatment due to their ability to uptake nutrients while sustaining the biological nitrification the biomass produced alongside the treatment of the centrate can be valorized through htc to produce a nanomaterial with interesting adsorbent and reducing power which can be valuable to polish wwtp effluents the htc lf can be finally redirected to a microalgal cultivation unit to produce new microalgae designing the entire process as a cycle as indicated in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 biomass cultivation harvesting and htc synthesis the microalgae used as feedstock for the htc process were collected from the pilot scale high rate algal pond hrap located at the bresso niguarda wwtp as was described in mantovani et al 10 to produce me nfe 6 g of dried microalgae were resuspended in 200 ml of distilled water and mixed with 15 g of iron iii nitrate nonahydrate fe no3 3 9h2o and treated by htc the reactor temperature was set at 225 c for a 3 h residence time the htc lf was recovered after vacuum filtration washing the nanoparticles with 200 ml of distilled water at the end of the process 400 ml of htc lf were recovered and stored in glass bottles for the subsequent steps of the work 2 2 htc lf characterization the htc lf produced with the me nfe is an ochre or transparent straw yellow liquor having a pungent smell related to the presence of dissolved volatile substances table 1 reports the average characterization in terms of nutrient concentrations ph and solids content tss and turbidity of the htc lf the analyzed samples had relatively high concentrations of nh4 n and high values of cod deriving from the liquid phase reactions occurring during the htc process also the low solids content and turbidity are features that could make the htc lf interesting for microalgal cultivation since they allow light penetration on the other hand the high cod stands out as the main critical point as it could be an energy source for heterotrophic microorganisms competing with microalgae for nutrients the observed variability in the nutrient concentration could depend on differences in the composition of the microalgae that were used this must always be considered as the hrap is an outdoor cultivation system based on centrate and changes in the composition of the centrate as well as of the community are common and fast 2 3 microtox assay microtox is an in vitro testing system which uses bioluminescent bacteria allivibrio fischeri to investigate the acute toxicity of water and solid samples toxicity is detected as a decrease of the bioluminescence after 5 and 15 min of exposure acute toxicity was performed using a microtox m500 analyzer modern water inc delaware usa for the detection of the luminescence inhibition on vibrio fischeri according to bs en iso 11348 1 11 tests were performed following the 81 9 basic test protocol which consists of a control and serial dilutions of the sample the inhibitory effect was determined first on the raw sample of htc lf as median effect concentration ec50 then pretreatments were done on the sample to understand if the overall toxicity was related to the iron content of the htc lf or to some other heavy metal coming from the used microalgal biomass that was grown on centrate or to the presence of organic compounds derived from the htc conditions the first hypothesis was studied by inducing chemical precipitation of the metals as hydroxides possibly present in the sample naoh 1 m was used to increase ph the supernatant was recovered and its toxicity was tested by microtox after hcl 1 m addition to restore the ph centrifugation at 5000 rpm 10 min was also performed as an alternative pretreatment the second hypothesis was studied by adsorption through jar tests having a 4 h contact time carried out using a commercial wood derived activated carbon norit ca1 sigma aldrich saint louis usa two doses of activated carbons were used 2 and 3 g l 1 after adsorption the activated carbons were separated from the supernatant through centrifugation 10 min at 5000 rpm 2 4 toxicity assay chlorella vulgaris was grown on different htc lf dilutions 60 40 20 and 5 to perform a 72 h batch test the pure microalgal culture was provided by istituto spallanzani rivolta d adda cr italy basal bold medium bbm was used as a control and diluent 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks were put on an orbital shaker at 120 rpm and artificially illuminated at 100 μmol m 2 s 1 with a 12 h 12 h light dark cycle for 72 h lamps were connected to a timer so that it was possible to simulate the natural light cycle of outdoor conditions every htc lf dilution was prepared in duplicate chlorella spp was inoculated in the flasks to reach a starting optical density od680 of 0 1 after 72 h od680 total suspended solids tss algal counts and sytox green assay were performed to quantify and characterize the algal biomass sytox green assay measures the viability of the microalgal communities by sytox green nucleic acid staining dead cells where the dye can penetrate emit a bright green fluorescence when excited by light at the wavelength of 450 490 nm on the contrary living microalgae can be easily distinguished for their red color induced by the autofluorescence of chlorophyll 12 as sytox green cannot penetrate the cell for the staining step the microalgal suspension 1 ml of each sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 rpm the pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of distilled water and sytox green was added 0 5 μl the dye labeled samples were then kept in the dark for 10 min and observed using a zeiss fluorescence microscope axio scope hbo 50 on average 300 cells were counted randomly through the slide noting the proportion between dead and living cells green and red respectively the viability of every sample was obtained as follows v g r g 100 where v is the cell viability percentage g is the number of observed green cells dead and r is the number of red cells alive the effect of htc lf on photosynthetic efficiency was measured at different exposure times 0 1 24 48 and 72 h using phyto pam ii heinz walz gmbh eeltrich germany aliquots of the algal suspension were diluted to reach an od 680 nm of 0 1 and then kept in the dark for 20 min f0

f 0 f m 2 5 preliminary batch cultivation a batch cultivation test of 40 days was performed at lab scale on the 20 diluted htc lf reproducing the same conditions of the toxicity assay i e using the same reactor erlenmeyer flasks illumination and mixing however for the batch cultivation bresso centrate was used to dilute htc lf 20 80 v v instead of bbm to evaluate the possibility to recirculate the htc lf in a microalgal cultivation unit to grow fresh microalgal biomass to be processed by htc batch cultivation was carried out in duplicate a1 and a2 with chlorella vulgaris as inoculum with a starting od680 value of 0 3 a control c was also prepared using only centrate as a growth medium 2 6 continuous cultivation a continuous cultivation test of 40 days was performed using four specifically designed lab scale column photobioreactors pbrs idea bioprocess technology srls dalmine bg italy having a working volume of 1 5 l equipped with probes for the monitoring of temperature ph and dissolved oxygen each column is connected to a stirring bloc with a magnetic rotor providing mechanical mixing asteroid 40 2mag ag muenchen germany and is fed by an independent peristaltic pump in reactors 3 and 4 co2 was supplied in a ph controlled mode with a ph set point range between 6 5 and 7 5 while in reactors 1 and 2 no ph control occurred the pbrs dedicated software idea biotech was used to automatically control a system of solenoid valves connected to a co2 cylinder every time that the ph probe would register values higher than 7 5 due to the photosynthesis the software would open the solenoid valves letting the co2 bubble through the microalgal suspension the closing of the valves was an automatic response every time ph was below 6 5 the culturing system was also equipped with artificial illumination 100 μmol m 2 s 1 working on a 12 12 h cycle as previously specified in section 2 4 the columns were filled with the htc lf centrate solution 20 80 v v and inoculated with a mixed microalgal community made mostly of chlorella spp and euglena gracilis from bresso hrap to reach a starting od680 value of 0 1 all the pbrs were first maintained in batch for 10 days to allow microalgae to adapt to the new conditions then they were fed continuously setting a hydraulic retention time hrt of 10 days corresponding to the hrt of bresso hrap the discharged microalgal suspension of each pbr was collected and centrifuged daily the biomass was dried at 50 c and stored for future analysis 2 7 analytical determinations inorganic nitrogen nh4 n no3 n and no2 n phosphate po4 p and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod were analyzed by spectrophotometric test kits hach lange düsseldorf germany lck303 lck 340 lck 342 lck 348 and lck1414 respectively on filtered samples 0 45 μm ph and temperature were measured by a laboratory probe xs pc 510 eutech instruments during the preliminary growth test and the batch cultivation during the continuous cultivation ph and temperature were measured online and recorded microalgal concentration was assessed by measuring the total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss according to standard methods 15 optical density od680 using a dr 3900 hach lange germany spectrophotometer and by algal cell counts microalgae were counted using an optical microscope 40 b 350 optika italy and a hemocytometer marienfeld germany morphology and size were used as indicators to distinguish different strains the cell concentration was obtained as the mean of 72 square observations 0 04 mm2 and expressed as cell ml 1 nutrients and biomass evolution over time were monitored two times per week over 35 days while phyto pam analyses were carried out once per week as was previously described the microalgae were kept fed for five additional days when the last samples for phyto pam analysis and microtox test were collected before the final harvesting of all the biomass contained in the pbrs microalgal growth rates rtss were calculated considering the mass balance across each pbr as shown in the formula tss ti 1 tss ti δt tss in tss ti hrt rtss where tss ti and tss ti 1 are the tss concentrations at time ti and ti 1 in the pbrs tssin is the tss of the influent centrate δt is the time between the samplings the same formula was used to calculate nitrite and nitrate production rates rno2 and rno3 the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria r aob was then evaluated indirectly and expressed as the sum of rno2 and rno3 as described in pizzera et al 16 free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna concentrations were calculated according to the following formulas using the data of ph temperature nh4 n and no2 n concentrations obtained during the monitoring of the pbrs fa nh 4 n 1 10 ph e 6344 273 t fna no 2 n 10 ph e 2300 273 t 2 8 statistical analyses statistical analyses were carried out using r project software 27 the t test for unpaired data was performed to highlight differences between the results obtained in pbrs with and without co2 for po4 p cod and nh4 n percent removal efficiencies η for microalgal growth rate rtss and ammonia oxidizing bacteria growth rate raob p values 0 05 were deemed to be significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 microtox assay fig 2 shows the results of the microtox assay on the raw htc lf the effect was very strong even at high dilutions in the experiment 1 ec50 was 1 8 after 15 min this was not an unexpected result as the toxicity of effluent from the htc of different biomass is reported in the literature mihajlović et al 17 tested the effluent produced during the htc of miscanthus x giganteus performed at the temperature of 180 200 and 220 c obtaining ec50 comparable to the one of the present work 1 29 1 05 and 0 69 respectively unfortunately no reports on the microtox test using htc liquid fraction from microalgae were found for a direct comparison as previously mentioned the test was repeated after a pre treatment step to remove iron or other heavy metals but only a slight reduction of toxicity was obtained proving that the problem was not the dissolved metal but the presence of some toxic organic compounds or maybe the combination of both in experiment 2 ec50 was 6 8 after 15 min a centrifugation step 10 min at 5000 rpm was also tested but did not produce better results exp 3 ec50 6 5 after 15 min the most effective pre treatment was certainly the adsorption on activated carbon both the tested concentrations 2 g l 1 and 3 g l 1 were able to significantly reduce the htc lf toxicity the best result was achieved with 3 g l 1 exp 4 ec50 60 after 15 min proving that the adsorption with activated carbons could be effective for the sustainable management of htc lf 3 2 microalgal growth and toxicity evaluation during the preliminary test all the microalgae were able to grow and the only sensible inhibition was observed in the sample with the highest htc lf concentration 60 fig 3 highlights the maximal photochemical efficiency trend over time fv fm all the samples were characterized by values higher than 0 5 suggesting good photosynthetic efficiencies 18 however samples grown on the highest htc lf concentration showed an evident decrease of fv fm on the other hand the viability assay with sytox green did not show differences between the samples and the control even after 72 h table 2 table 2 also reports the microalgal concentration at the end of the test as for the cell counts the samples and the control gave comparable results with the only exception of the microalgae grown on the 5 htc lf that reached the highest concentration however tss values were very different among the samples and the control in particular the higher the htc lf percentage in the growth media the higher was the tss concentration those differences were explained by the development of bacteria which could be observed at the optical microscope especially in samples d and e those samples were the ones in which nutrients and cod were higher due to the higher percentage of htc lf the availability of organic matter and o2 produced by microalgae might have promoted heterotrophic bacteria leading to an increase in the total biomass the phenomenon observed in those samples was indeed curios but still very interesting proving that some bacteria could be more resistant than allivibrio fischeri based on such results the 20 dilution was chosen as the best compromise for further analyses 3 3 preliminary batch cultivation the test lasted almost 40 days showing interesting results which are reported in fig 4 the first graph on the left is the trend of tss over time which is a good proxy for the microalgal concentration in a medium a long lag phase was observed in both samples as high flocculation even after sonication occurred the microalgal concentration seems lower at days 7 and 14 than at time zero but this was mainly due to flocculation making it difficult to collect a representative sample however chlorella was able to adapt to the new environment and did grow after two weeks reaching tss concentration over 1 g l 1 at the end of the test nh4 n and po4 p were rapidly consumed in the control but the trend was much slower in the samples as the algae were not fully adapted however after 20 days during the exponential growth phase the consumption of nutrients became very fast also in a1 and a2 as expected from past studies 10 14 the cod of the bresso centrate is not very degradable so it was constant over time in the control however the starting cod was higher in samples a1 and a2 due to the htc lf contribution in such samples cod was rapidly consumed after two weeks of acclimation till cod values reached the one in the control this was very interesting as it shows that the cod fraction of the htc lf could be removed by the algae bacteria consortium 3 4 continuous cultivation microalgae were able to grow both with and without co2 during the continuous cultivation having an average growth rate rtss of 62 5 and 43 8 mg l 1 d 1 respectively the trend of tss concentration including both microalgae and bacteria biomass and od680 of the samples can be observed in fig 5 graphs a and b respectively looking at the graphs it is evident that the trend of the two proxies for microalgal concentration agree only in part on the left the tss trend would suggest that the microalgae could grow better in the pbrs with co2 on the right the od680 had similar evolution only at the beginning of the test microalgae were able to double their od level after 10 days when co2 was bubbled while microalgae needed more time without co2 however after day 17 a strong drop of the od680 occurred only for samples grown under co2 while the other ones could still increase their concentration reaching a final od value of 1 7 the presence of bacteria biomass alone is less convincing this time to explain the difference between the trend of tss and the other variables nevertheless a shift in microalgal community composition was observed during the trial in the pbrs without co2 chlorella spp became dominant and euglena gracilis disappeared euglena gracilis is known to prefer ph between 4 and 8 19 and this condition was not respected in pbrs without co2 which had higher ph at least in the first part of the test on the contrary pbrs with co2 maintained the original microalgal composition as ph was stable around 7 5 since euglena cells are larger than chlorella ones the overall tss in pbr with co2 was probably higher even when the od680 was not as high as in pbr without co2 the microscope cell counts ranged between 106 and 107 cells ml 1 throughout the test the trends over time which are reported in fig 5c are very similar to the ones of od680 at first the microalgal concentration was higher in the pbr with co2 intake but the situation was reversed during the second part of the trial a fair correlation between total cell counts and optical density was indeed highlighted both in pbrs with and without co2 r2 0 85 and r2 0 83 respectively however no correlation was observed between tss and total algal counts fig 6 temperature ph and dissolved oxygen trends over time are plotted in fig 7 the temperature in the reactors strongly changed during the test following the environmental temperature in the laboratory the probes registered a maximum of 27 7 c at the beginning of the cultivation and a minimum of 18 c on day 31 ph control worked quite fine in the samples grown under co2 and was very stable around the set point of 7 5 of course the ph value was higher in the samples grown without co2 and it was very stable during the first two weeks after day 15 as can be noticed in fig 5g partial nitrification started and lead ph to decrease from 8 8 to 7 8 and n no2 to accumulate dissolved oxygen was similar in the first days of the test however in the second half a difference in the two groups of pbrs started to enhance probably due to the contribution of ammonia oxidizing bacteria which started to use oxygen to convert nh4 n to no2 n especially in the pbrs without co2 phyto pam analyses suggested that the microalgae were able to adapt to the 20 htc lf as the photosynthetic efficiency was high and stable during all the cultivation at first fv fm was only 0 5 suggesting that the microalgae still needed to adapt properly to their new media however as reported in fig 8 after just a few days of continuous feeding the fv fm increased remaining between 0 6 and 0 7 afterward this trend could be also confirmed by considering the free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna concentrations in the pbrs fa concentrations were never particularly high even in the group without ph control maximum fa was 51 2 mg l 1 at the beginning to gradually decrease up to 0 2 2 1 mg l 1 and were even smaller in the pbrs with ph control maximum fa concentration was 3 6 0 1 mg l 1 at the beginning to gradually decrease up to 1 9 0 1 mg l 1 fna concentrations were always lower than 0 1 mg l 1 in both groups as shown in fig 5d effective removal of phosphorus was achieved rapidly and maintained during the whole test with average values of 91 and 94 for the microalgae grown without and with co2 respectively cod removal fig 5f was interesting too with an average percentage of 62 and 65 for the microalgae grown without and with co2 respectively these data confirmed the ones found during the batch cultivation step on the other hand the nh4 n removal fig 5e was low in all the reactors at least till day 20 when partial nitrification started especially in the community grown without co2 fig 5g the t test for unpaired data showed that the microalgal growth rate rtss and the ammonia oxidizing bacteria growth rate raob were significantly different between samples fig 9 of course higher microalgal productivity was expected where co2 was bubbled with the double aim of sustaining the photosynthesis and maintaining the ph under a certain level to limit nitrogen stripping however the community grown without co2 was still able to grow without limitation probably exploiting the co2 produced during the oxidation of cod nevertheless what is less clear is why partial nitrification was relevant in the pbrs without co2 and not in the other ones it is known that nitrifying bacteria are very sensitive to ph skadsen 20 report an optimum ph range for nitrosomonas between 7 and 8 however ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob can be deeply influenced also by other parameters such as free ammonia temperature and light making it difficult to predict the nitrification process 21 the t tests for unpaired data were performed also on p po4 cod and nh4 n removal efficiency η po4 p η cod and η nh4 n however the differences were not statistically relevant as shown by the boxplots in fig 10 due to previous experience 10 the interaction between microalgae and bacteria seems crucial to achieve high performance in nutrient removal from municipal centrate this consideration seems valuable also in the present case the increasing nitrite concentration in the pbrs was very interesting showing that aob could grow even in the 20 dilution of the htc lf of course raob was relevant only in the samples grown without co2 however an increase of no2 n started in the other pbrs as well fig 5h from day 29 furthermore the cod removal was also evidence of intense heterotrophic bacteria activity still compatible with the htc lf leading to the release of co2 which could be used by microalgae but also by aobs finally a sample of each microalgal suspension has been collected at the end of the cultivation day 40 and the liquid fractions obtained after centrifugation were then tested via microtox comparing their toxicity with the one of the htc lf centrate solution used as the growth medium as shown in the graph in fig 11 a substantial decrease in toxicity was observed after microalgal cultivation the ec50 rose from 20 in the htc lf centrate solution in to 30 in the samples co2 and no co2 of course the supernatants were still toxic after the microalgal treatment highlighting the need to further treatments before safe disposal however other toxicity assays involving different trophic levels could provide a better knowledge of the situation based on the obtained result using the htc lf as a growth medium for microalgae seems promising the possibility to grow microalgae on htc wastewater was already tested by different authors precisely for the presence of a high concentration of nutrients however the tests were mainly performed as short batch experiments on very diluted wastewaters comparisons are not that simple as the htc wastewaters might greatly differ depending on the nature of the starting biomass and the htc conditions du et al 2012 tested the potential of chlorella vulgaris to grow in different dilutions from 50 to 200 times of the htc lf the microalgae were able to grow and remove 45 5 59 9 of total nitrogen tn 85 8 94 6 of total phosphorus tp and 50 0 60 9 of cod a similar approach was evaluated by belete et al 2019 using the liquid fraction of htc of activated sludge to enrich the brackish water from the sede boker saline aquifer israel to cultivate coelastrella spp and chlorella spp however the mixture was also enriched with micronutrients 1 ml l 1 of the a5 solution from the zarrouk medium the microalgae were able to grow during short term batch tests 5 days having growth rates similar to the one of the control grown on bg11 medium overall the presented study could provide an interesting option for the management of the effluent produced with the me nfe the entire production of iron nanoparticles could be designed as a cycle where the liquid byproduct is redirected in a new microalgal cultivation unit and used to obtain new biomass for the synthesis of second generation me nfe considering the magnetic power of the me nfe the separation from the treated effluent is easy and allows the use of the same batch of nanoparticles for various cycles after being used as a growth medium the htc lf could be treated through adsorption with activated carbons to decrease its toxicity allowing a final and safer disposal 4 conclusions the htc lf obtained during the synthesis of me nfe was proved to be toxic for allivibrio fisheri suggesting a harmful potential against the water compartment however the overall toxicity was reduced through adsorption with wood derived activated carbons on the other hand the possibility to grow microalgae on the htc lf was demonstrated as no sensible inhibition in the photochemical activities was detected for chlorella vulgaris given the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus a 20 dilution of the htc lf was tested both in batch and continuous experiments as a growth medium for microalgae using both pure cultures and mixed microalgal community grown on the supernatant of municipal digestate the experiments demonstrated that the microalgae could grow in the htc lf with or without co2 addition to foster photosynthesis the microalgal treatment was able to reduce the nutrient concentration and partial nitrification also occurred proving that aob could resist in the htc lf at 20 dilution cod removal which was around 60 was particularly interesting demonstrating that some organic components of the htc lf could be degraded by the synergy of microalgae and bacteria leading to a slight decrease in terms of toxicity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12822,incorporation of granular activated carbon gac in rapid media filtration has been shown to serve as an effective means to mitigate cyanotoxin exposure via extracellular adsorption control of organics including dissolved organic carbon doc may also improve via adsorption followed by biological treatment although beneficial complete replacement of filter media with gac is often associated with high capital costs a seven month pilot study conducted at a water treatment facility located in eugene oregon examined the benefits of replacing the top 15 cm of anthracite media with gac caps to enhance control of a cyanotoxin as well as doc disinfection by product formation potential dbp fp and chlorine demand removal of cylindrospermopsin by gac cap adsorption was assessed via simulated cyanotoxin events utilizing orange ii dye as a surrogate over a 4 month period a pilot scale filter incorporating a gac cap demonstrated up to 40 higher reduction throughout the study when compared to a control this reduction however decreased to 9 as operation time increased while installation of a gac cap increased biomass density atp concentration it did not improve doc or dbp fp removal or chlorine demand at this facility likely due to the low ebct 1 2 min in the gac layer this study presents evidence that incorporation of gac caps may provide a cost efficient albeit low capacity barrier for cylindrospermopsin exposure following several months of continuous operation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords gac cap cyanobacteria surrogate orange ii dye cylindrospermopsin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanotoxins are a major concern for drinking water utilities especially as climate change creates conditions that promote cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms 1 in response to health threats associated with drinking water exposure the us environmental protection agency us epa has established non regulatory health advisories for the cyanotoxins cylindrospermopsin and total microcystins in addition three states ohio oregon and minnesota have implemented drinking water related guidelines 2 3 cyanotoxin reduction at drinking water treatment facilities is typically addressed through a multi barrier approach which may include removal of extracellular cyanotoxins via powdered or granular activated carbon pac gac 4 6 while pac at an optimized dose has been reported to be successful for both microcystin and cylindrospermopsin reduction on an as needed basis utilities experiencing chronic issues may employ gac 5 7 however adsorption related performance of gac can come at a significant cost when compared to the use of conventional filtration media anthracite or sand recent studies have reported dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection by product dbp precursor removal to be predominant in the upper regions of a gac filter as opposed to occurring evenly throughout media depth 8 10 in addition when considering mass transfer zones in gac adsorbers removal is anticipated to be localized in the upper region when newly installed 11 as such replacing the top layer of an anthracite sand filter with a gac cap may optimize its use however a need exists to characterize the extent to which it can provide cyanotoxin reduction gac caps have been successfully employed over short durations 2 years to address taste and odour events at water treatment facilities 12 in addition bridgehouse 13 reported a 10 38 reduction in dbp formation potential dbp fp when replacing the top 12 of filter media with virgin gac biofilms may develop as adsorption capacity decreases potentially allowing for increased removal of biological material including dbp precursors 14 15 use of gac caps however has not been examined in detail as a means of reducing cyanotoxins in addition to reducing doc and dbp fp the primary objective of the current study was to evaluate gac caps as a cost effective treatment barrier for cylindrospermopsin at pilot scale as well as determine additional benefits with regards to the reduction of doc and dbp fp associated with four trihalomethanes thms and nine haloacetic acids haas pilot scale filters with and without gac caps were assessed over 7 months in terms of removal of a cylindrospermopsin surrogate as well as doc dbp fp and chlorine demand use of a surrogate was required as it was deemed prohibitively expensive to conduct trials using spiked cyanotoxins at pilot scale selection of an appropriate surrogate was based on a study that suggested breakthrough of orange ii dye in a gac mini column at a concentration of 10 mg l was similar to that of the cyanotoxin microcystin rr at 0 5 μg l 16 this cyanotoxin has been reported to exhibit adsorptive behaviour similar to cylindrospermopsin adsorption by pac 17 filter media adenosine triphosphate atp concentrations were monitored to characterize filter biomass results suggest that gac caps may be considered as a cost efficient option for cylindrospermopsin control throughout a season of algae blooms 2 methods and materials 2 1 source water and full scale treatment facility the hayden bridge filtration

prior to commencing organics sampling both filters were backwashed approximately every 24 h using dechlorinated water following addition of ascorbic acid 2 3 surrogate dye trials it was not feasible to spike cylindrospermopsin into the influent of the pilot scale filters due to the cost of toxin standards as such a surrogate that exhibited similar adsorption behaviour was employed ho et al 17

filter influent total organic carbon 2 064 0 032 mg l and reported results to be within 12 of each other indicating similar adsorption by gac utilizing these relationships orange ii dye was applied as a surrogate for cylindrospermopsin to assess reduction surrogate trials began approximately 2 5 months following gac cap installation orange ii dye was spiked into both the gac capped and control pilot filters eight times over the course of four months in an effort to mimic a season of typical algal blooms a dye solution was prepared by dissolving 32 g of powdered orange ii sodium salt orange ii sigma aldrich oakville on 85 purity in 1 l of distilled water this solution was then spiked into pilot filter influent using a peristaltic pump at 500 ml h to obtain a concentration of 1 mg l for a period of 2 h influent and effluent samples were collected as well as samples from ports located immediately below the 15 cm of gac and 30 cm of anthracite in the capped filter additional trials were conducted with 2 5 5 and 10 mg l dosages such that removal could be evaluated as either mass or rate limited consistent trial durations of 2 h were selected to ensure each dose was evaluated under similar conditions absorbance at 485 nm was determined using a hach dr2700 spectrophotometer loveland co and converted to a mg l orange ii concentration using a calibration curve all trials were conducted at least four days prior to sampling of doc and dbp fp to reduce any potential carryover 2 4 organics sampling procedure doc dbps and atp sampling was conducted over seven months to address the impact of seasonal changes organics loading temperature samples were collected every other week for the first three months of the study to track initial changes in an effort to assess the transition from adsorptive to biological removal subsequent sampling was conducted monthly based on historical data at this location it was anticipated that biological acclimation would occur within 2 3 months approximately 1 g of media was collected from the top 5 cm of each filter for atp analyses which were performed on site an additional sample was collected from the top of the anthracite layer in the gac capped filter all samples not analyzed on site were shipped on ice to the university of toronto laboratory where they were stored at 4 c and analyzed within 48 h of receipt 2 5 analytical

hq411d laboratory single input ph meter loveland co were determined on site by facility personnel 2 6 statistical analysis a two sided paired t test at 95 significance was used to determine if a gac cap improved removal significant removal by pre treatment and media filters was determined using one sided t tests 95 significance 15 potential outliers were identified as those beyond a region established using an interquartile range iqr rule first and third quartile 1 5 iqr 18 19 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of cylindrospermopsin surrogate incorporation of a gac cap was observed to significantly p 0 05 improve overall orange ii dye reduction removal ranged from 9 to 39 depending on the influent dose and operation time but remained consistently higher than the control filter 1 3 fig 2 increased influent concentration and operation time were associated with reduced removal extended operation of the gac cap resulted in decreasing reduction that was linearly correlated with bed volumes treated r2 0 62 0 97 fig 2 on a mass basis however reduction was greater for higher influent doses due to stronger competition with background organics for adsorption sites as well as a stronger driving force for adsorption kinetics fig 3 these outcomes were anticipated as removal by gac adsorption has been reported to decrease as adsorption sites become occupied by natural organic matter 20 22 as well gac capacity is impacted by adsorbate concentration impacts on cyanotoxin control associated with gac operational time have been reported by others 1 6 wang et al 22 reported removal of microcystins lr and la using fixed bed gac adsorbers to decrease from near 100 to approximately 70 and 40 respectively following six months of operation as such long term monitoring is needed to determine when gac cap adsorption capacity is exhausted breakthrough of saxitoxins through gac media has been shown to be a function of influent concentration as well as operating time with reductions approaching initially 100 then decreasing to 20 during 300 days of operation using an experimentally validated homogenous surface diffusion model breakthrough may also be predicted for a range of influent concentrations empty bed contact times ebcts and operating times 23 in this study removal was independently impacted by both influent concentration and bed volumes treated suggesting that an older gac cap treating a lower toxin level may provide similar reduction to a virgin gac cap treating a higher level strategic installation of a new or regenerated gac cap prior to an anticipated bloom period could compensate for higher toxin levels subsequently improving removal this strategy would help ensure that removal is maximized during the period where highest toxin concentrations are expected the fraction of orange ii dye removed by the gac capped filter decreased linearly with increasing influent dose fig 3 suggesting lower loadings may be more efficiently treated by a gac cap this finding is in agreement with previous studies that have reported removal by gac media to be dependent on influent concentration for a range of micropollutants 24 26 the mass retained by the filter increased in response to spike concentration suggesting gac adsorption rate as a limiting factor 27 fig 3 as such removal may be improved by increasing the ebct similarly the us epa 28 highlighted challenges in the removal of influent cyanotoxins within a gac mass transfer zone resulting from insufficient ebcts ultimately resulting in early breakthrough depth wise comparisons revealed approximately 50 11 of all dye removal to be associated with the shallow gac layer indicating a short mass transfer zone fig 4 the lower anthracite sand layers 9 2 14 5 also reduced dye to a greater degree than observed in a control filter which contained similar media considering dye characteristics 29 and control filter outcomes removal can only reasonably be attributed to adsorption as such an explanation for increased removal in the non adsorbent layers is challenging however it is evident that incorporation of a gac cap in a granular media filter may provide an additional treatment barrier for low levels of cylindrospermopsin 0 2 0 8 μg l 16 over the course of the study gac became less efficient at removing the cylindrospermopsin surrogate for all influent dosages reduction in dye concentration in the 15 cm gac layer ranged from 16 to 19 in the first two months of trials decreasing to 5 to 10 during months 3 4 fig 4 this suggests the mass transfer zone may widen with extended operation similar findings have been reported whereby mass transfer zones for geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib in gac media broadened and removals decreased over 7 weeks following installation 11 it is not known whether dye removal would continue to decrease beyond the study period as a result of organics loading and exhaustion of adsorptive capacity which would impact the use of a gac cap over multiple algae bloom seasons these findings illustrate the potential to use gac caps as a barrier for cylindrospermopsin although future work is needed to explore in detail the relationship between the dye and the toxin the impact of ebct on removal and long term gac cap performance 3 2 biological characterization atp concentrations observed in the top 5 cm of media in all filters surpassed the threshold for biological filtration of 80 ng g media 30 throughout the majority of the study period fig 5 minor operational factors among pilot and full scale filters may have resulted in unintended discrepancies when considering atp concentrations in the control 183 199 ng g media and full scale filter 285 63 ng g media fig 5 irrespective of any differences the gac cap 392 255 ng g media surpassed both the control and full scale filter s biomass densities within 3 and 9 weeks respectively maintaining higher levels for the remainder of the study fig 5 sharma et al 31 reported similar results when comparing dual media anthracite 107 38 ng media and gac filters 246 75 ng g media attributing the difference in biomass to an increased surface roughness associated with gac another study reported that a conventional gac filter cultivated biomass to a degree which ensured biological treatment while a conventional anthracite filter did not 32 although all filters were considered to be biologically active in the current study their comparative atp concentrations are a promising indicator that gac caps may induce partial biofiltration at a facility struggling to implement biological filtration i e surpass 80 ng atp g media biodegradation of cylindrospermopsin by species native to drinking water sources has been reported 33 34 future work should identify surrogates for cyanotoxins that are representative in terms of both adsorption and biodegradation mechanisms 35 3 3 doc and dbp fp reduction doc reduction by both full scale pre treatment in line coagulation and sedimentation 0 35 mg l as well as media filtration 0 14 mg l was relatively low throughout the study period likely due to a very low influent concentration 0 6 0 11 mg l fig 6 in addition granular media filtration did not have a statistically significant p 0 05 impact on doc regardless of the filter in question average 14 23 0 04 0 07 mg l thm and haa fps in the raw water averaged 40 4 6 4 μg l and 30 5 6 7 μg l respectively which are within the thm 80 μg l and haa 60 μg l us regulatory limits 36 in line coagulation and sedimentation reduced thm fp to 27 5 6 5 μg l but had no impact on haa fp unlike doc biologically active filters were observed to significantly reduce haa and thm fp 60 5 16 7 3 5 μg l and 49 7 13 3 4 1 μg l respectively p 0 05

decreased to approximately 0 10 after four months of operation similarly nemani et al 37 reported full bed filters with fresh gac 30 removed doc to a significantly higher degree than those with exhausted gac at the onset of a study but following four months of operation 13 000 bed volumes removal was similar at 8 in addition specific doc fractions which serve as dbp precursors humic like substances 38 have been reported to be removed by gac via adsorption 10 39 liao et al 40 recently reported thm and haa fp in gac filter effluent to increase as adsorption capacity presumably decreased with time following the transition from predominantly adsorptive to biological removal mechanisms minor improvements were anticipated with the addition of a gac cap mature gac filters have been reported to obtain moderately higher doc thm fp and haa fp removals than those of anthracite filters 14 15 32 although enhanced pre treatment e g pre ozonation may be required to obtain significant removals 8 15 improvements associated with mature gac have been attributed to higher biomass densities when compared to other filter media thus ensuring biological treatment as well as potential residual or bio rejuvenated adsorption capacity following extended operation 14 31 32 however a study by stoddart and gagnon 41 which investigated mature gac caps 8 months of operation as a means of enhancing organics treatment reported no significant improvements to doc nor dbp fp removal similar to the findings in the current study the authors theorized deeper gac beds i e higher ebct may be

gac adsorption and biodegradation play a substantial role in decreasing effluent chlorine demand a direct depth wise comparison to the control was not examined as previously mentioned the impact of

12822,incorporation of granular activated carbon gac in rapid media filtration has been shown to serve as an effective means to mitigate cyanotoxin exposure via extracellular adsorption control of organics including dissolved organic carbon doc may also improve via adsorption followed by biological treatment although beneficial complete replacement of filter media with gac is often associated with high capital costs a seven month pilot study conducted at a water treatment facility located in eugene oregon examined the benefits of replacing the top 15 cm of anthracite media with gac caps to enhance control of a cyanotoxin as well as doc disinfection by product formation potential dbp fp and chlorine demand removal of cylindrospermopsin by gac cap adsorption was assessed via simulated cyanotoxin events utilizing orange ii dye as a surrogate over a 4 month period a pilot scale filter incorporating a gac cap demonstrated up to 40 higher reduction throughout the study when compared to a control this reduction however decreased to 9 as operation time increased while installation of a gac cap increased biomass density atp concentration it did not improve doc or dbp fp removal or chlorine demand at this facility likely due to the low ebct 1 2 min in the gac layer this study presents evidence that incorporation of gac caps may provide a cost efficient albeit low capacity barrier for cylindrospermopsin exposure following several months of continuous operation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords gac cap cyanobacteria surrogate orange ii dye cylindrospermopsin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanotoxins are a major concern for drinking water utilities especially as climate change creates conditions that promote cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms 1 in response to health threats associated with drinking water exposure the us environmental protection agency us epa has established non regulatory health advisories for the cyanotoxins cylindrospermopsin and total microcystins in addition three states ohio oregon and minnesota have implemented drinking water related guidelines 2 3 cyanotoxin reduction at drinking water treatment facilities is typically addressed through a multi barrier approach which may include removal of extracellular cyanotoxins via powdered or granular activated carbon pac gac 4 6 while pac at an optimized dose has been reported to be successful for both microcystin and cylindrospermopsin reduction on an as needed basis utilities experiencing chronic issues may employ gac 5 7 however adsorption related performance of gac can come at a significant cost when compared to the use of conventional filtration media anthracite or sand recent studies have reported dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection by product dbp precursor removal to be predominant in the upper regions of a gac filter as opposed to occurring evenly throughout media depth 8 10 in addition when considering mass transfer zones in gac adsorbers removal is anticipated to be localized in the upper region when newly installed 11 as such replacing the top layer of an anthracite sand filter with a gac cap may optimize its use however a need exists to characterize the extent to which it can provide cyanotoxin reduction gac caps have been successfully employed over short durations 2 years to address taste and odour events at water treatment facilities 12 in addition bridgehouse 13 reported a 10 38 reduction in dbp formation potential dbp fp when replacing the top 12 of filter media with virgin gac biofilms may develop as adsorption capacity decreases potentially allowing for increased removal of biological material including dbp precursors 14 15 use of gac caps however has not been examined in detail as a means of reducing cyanotoxins in addition to reducing doc and dbp fp the primary objective of the current study was to evaluate gac caps as a cost effective treatment barrier for cylindrospermopsin at pilot scale as well as determine additional benefits with regards to the reduction of doc and dbp fp associated with four trihalomethanes thms and nine haloacetic acids haas pilot scale filters with and without gac caps were assessed over 7 months in terms of removal of a cylindrospermopsin surrogate as well as doc dbp fp and chlorine demand use of a surrogate was required as it was deemed prohibitively expensive to conduct trials using spiked cyanotoxins at pilot scale selection of an appropriate surrogate was based on a study that suggested breakthrough of orange ii dye in a gac mini column at a concentration of 10 mg l was similar to that of the cyanotoxin microcystin rr at 0 5 μg l 16 this cyanotoxin has been reported to exhibit adsorptive behaviour similar to cylindrospermopsin adsorption by pac 17 filter media adenosine triphosphate atp concentrations were monitored to characterize filter biomass results suggest that gac caps may be considered as a cost efficient option for cylindrospermopsin control throughout a season of algae blooms 2 methods and materials 2 1 source water and full scale treatment facility the hayden bridge filtration

chlorine to provide disinfection following coagulant addition caustic soda 4 mg l and a coagulant aid diallyldimethylammonium chloride may also be added in response to sudden increases in turbidity cylindrospermopsin has been historically observed and identified as the dominant cyanotoxin in the mckenzie watershed a full scale filter consisting of anthracite 45 cm over sand 25 cm in operation

prior to commencing organics sampling both filters were backwashed approximately every 24 h using dechlorinated water following addition of ascorbic acid 2 3 surrogate dye trials it was not feasible to spike cylindrospermopsin into the influent of the pilot scale filters due to the cost of toxin standards as such a surrogate that exhibited similar adsorption behaviour was employed ho et al 17 reported the cyanotoxins cylindrospermopsin and microcystin rr to have near identical adsorption behaviour in multiple jar tests configurations using two commercially different pacs 5 pac

filter influent total organic carbon 2 064 0 032 mg l and reported results to be within 12 of each other indicating similar adsorption by gac utilizing these relationships orange ii dye was applied as a surrogate for cylindrospermopsin to assess reduction surrogate trials began approximately 2 5 months following gac cap installation orange ii dye was spiked into both the gac capped and control pilot filters eight times over the course of four months in an effort to mimic a season of typical algal blooms a dye solution was prepared by dissolving 32 g of powdered orange ii sodium salt orange ii sigma aldrich oakville on 85 purity in 1 l of distilled water this solution was then spiked into pilot filter influent using a peristaltic pump at 500 ml h to obtain a concentration of 1 mg l for a period of 2 h influent and effluent samples were collected as well as samples from ports located immediately below the 15 cm of gac and 30 cm of anthracite in the capped filter additional trials were conducted with 2 5 5 and 10 mg l dosages such that removal could be evaluated as either mass or rate limited consistent trial durations of 2 h were selected to ensure each dose was evaluated under similar conditions absorbance at 485 nm was determined using a hach dr2700 spectrophotometer loveland co and converted to a mg l orange ii concentration using a calibration curve all trials were conducted at least four days prior to sampling of doc and dbp fp to reduce any potential carryover 2 4 organics sampling procedure doc dbps and atp sampling was conducted over seven months to address the impact of seasonal changes organics loading temperature samples were collected every other week for the first three months of the study to track initial changes in an effort to assess the transition from adsorptive to biological removal subsequent sampling was conducted monthly based on historical data at this location it was anticipated that biological acclimation would occur within 2 3 months approximately 1 g of media was collected from the top 5 cm of each filter for atp analyses which were performed on site an additional sample was collected from the top of the anthracite layer in the gac capped filter all samples not analyzed on site were shipped on ice to the university of toronto laboratory where they were stored at 4 c and analyzed within 48 h of receipt 2 5 analytical

chlorinated using a sodium hypochlorite solution 12 naocl stock bioshop canada inc burlington on to target an initial 0 7 mg l free chlorine concentration and subsequently monitored for 72 1 h at 20 c influent and settled waters were chlorinated to target 1 5 mg l free chlorine following one month of organics sampling to accommodate increased chlorine demand bottles were made chlorine demand free by soaking them in a solution containing 1 5 ml 7 sodium hypochlorite in 250 ml of distilled water for at least 24 h prior to thoroughly rinsing with distilled water following a 72 1 hour reaction

hq411d laboratory single input ph meter loveland co were determined on site by facility personnel 2 6 statistical analysis a two sided paired t test at 95 significance was used to determine if a gac

established using an interquartile range iqr rule first and third quartile 1 5 iqr 18 19 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of cylindrospermopsin surrogate incorporation of a gac cap was observed to significantly p 0 05 improve overall orange ii dye reduction removal ranged from 9 to 39 depending on the influent dose and operation time but remained consistently higher than the control filter 1 3 fig 2 increased influent concentration and operation time were associated with reduced removal extended operation of the gac cap resulted in decreasing reduction that was linearly correlated with bed volumes treated r2 0 62 0 97 fig 2 on a mass basis however reduction was greater for higher influent doses due to stronger competition with background organics for adsorption sites as well as a stronger driving force for adsorption kinetics fig 3 these outcomes were anticipated as removal by gac adsorption has been reported to decrease as adsorption sites become occupied by natural organic matter 20 22 as well gac capacity is impacted by adsorbate concentration impacts on cyanotoxin control associated with gac operational time have been reported by others 1 6 wang et al 22 reported removal of microcystins lr and la using fixed bed gac adsorbers to decrease from near 100 to approximately 70 and 40 respectively following six months of operation as such long term monitoring is needed to determine when gac cap adsorption capacity is exhausted breakthrough of saxitoxins through gac media has been shown to be a function of influent concentration as well as operating time with reductions approaching initially 100 then decreasing to 20 during 300 days of operation using an experimentally validated homogenous surface diffusion model breakthrough may also be predicted for a range of influent concentrations empty bed contact times ebcts and operating times 23 in this study removal was independently impacted by both influent concentration and bed volumes treated suggesting that an older gac cap treating a lower toxin level may provide similar reduction to a virgin gac cap treating a higher level strategic installation of a new or regenerated gac cap prior to an anticipated bloom period could compensate for higher toxin levels subsequently improving removal this strategy would help ensure that removal is maximized during the period where highest toxin concentrations are expected the fraction of orange ii dye removed by the gac capped filter decreased linearly with increasing influent dose fig 3 suggesting lower loadings may be more efficiently treated by a gac cap this finding is in agreement with previous studies that have reported removal by gac media to be dependent on influent concentration for a range of micropollutants 24 26 the mass retained by the filter increased in response to spike concentration suggesting gac adsorption rate as a limiting factor 27 fig 3 as such removal may be improved by increasing the ebct similarly the us epa 28 highlighted challenges in the removal of influent cyanotoxins within a gac mass transfer zone resulting from insufficient ebcts ultimately resulting in early breakthrough depth wise comparisons revealed approximately 50 11 of all dye removal to be associated with the shallow gac layer indicating a short mass transfer zone fig 4 the lower anthracite sand layers 9 2 14 5 also reduced dye to a greater degree than observed in a control filter which contained similar media considering dye characteristics 29 and control filter outcomes removal can only reasonably be attributed to adsorption as such an explanation for increased removal in the non adsorbent layers is challenging however it is evident that incorporation of a gac cap in a granular media filter may provide an additional treatment barrier for low levels of cylindrospermopsin 0 2 0 8 μg l 16 over the course of the study gac became less efficient at removing the cylindrospermopsin surrogate for all influent dosages reduction in dye concentration in the 15 cm gac layer ranged from 16 to 19 in the first two months of trials decreasing to 5 to 10 during months 3 4 fig 4 this suggests the mass transfer zone may widen with extended operation similar findings have been reported whereby mass transfer zones for geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib in gac media broadened and removals decreased over 7 weeks following installation 11 it is not known whether dye removal would continue to decrease beyond the study period as a result of organics loading and exhaustion of adsorptive capacity which would impact the use of a gac cap over multiple algae bloom seasons these findings illustrate the potential to use gac caps as a barrier for cylindrospermopsin although future work is needed to explore in detail the relationship between the dye and the toxin the impact of ebct on removal and long term gac cap performance 3 2 biological characterization atp concentrations observed in the top 5 cm of media in all filters surpassed the threshold for biological filtration of 80 ng g media 30 throughout the majority of the study period fig 5 minor operational factors among pilot and full scale filters may have resulted in unintended discrepancies when considering atp concentrations in the control 183 199 ng g media and full scale filter 285 63 ng g media fig 5 irrespective of any differences the gac cap 392 255 ng g media surpassed both the control and full scale filter s biomass densities within 3 and 9 weeks respectively maintaining higher levels for the remainder of the study fig 5 sharma et al 31 reported similar results when comparing dual media anthracite 107 38 ng media and gac filters 246 75 ng g media attributing the difference in biomass to an increased surface roughness associated with gac another study reported that a conventional gac filter cultivated biomass to a degree which ensured biological treatment while a conventional anthracite filter did not 32 although all filters were considered to be biologically active in the current study their comparative atp concentrations are a promising indicator that gac caps may induce partial biofiltration at a facility struggling to implement biological filtration i e surpass 80 ng atp g media biodegradation of cylindrospermopsin by species native to drinking water sources has been reported 33 34 future work should identify surrogates for cyanotoxins that are representative in terms of both adsorption and biodegradation mechanisms 35 3 3 doc and dbp fp reduction doc reduction by both full scale pre treatment in line coagulation and sedimentation 0 35 mg l as well as media filtration 0 14 mg l was relatively low throughout the study period likely due to a very low influent concentration 0 6 0 11 mg l fig 6 in addition granular media filtration did not have a statistically significant p 0 05 impact on doc regardless of the filter in question average 14 23 0 04 0 07 mg l thm and haa fps in the raw water averaged 40 4 6 4 μg l and 30 5 6 7 μg l respectively which are within the thm 80 μg l and haa 60 μg l us regulatory limits 36 in line coagulation and sedimentation reduced thm fp to 27 5 6 5 μg l but had no impact on haa fp unlike doc biologically active filters were observed to significantly reduce haa and thm fp 60 5 16 7 3 5 μg l and 49 7 13 3 4 1 μg l respectively p 0 05 when compared to settled water influent fig 6 as such dbp precursors appear to be more amenable to removal by biofiltration in agreement with previous findings 15 31 37 doc and dbp fp removals were similar for the gac capped control and full scale filters with no statistically significant differences p 0 05 observed fig 6 in contrast adsorption was anticipated to provide initial improvements to

12823,although the promotion of magnetite in anaerobic ad has been widely reported the role of magnetite plays in the ad of waste activated sludge was and the mechanism of the promotion effect are still needed to be explored this study investigated the effects of magnetite in ad of was with thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp from four aspects including reactor performances sludge characteristics microbial community structures and gene abundance results showed that magnetite is able to enhance the consumption of soluble protein spn and soluble polysaccharide sps by increasing the activities of α glucosidase and protease with the addition of 0 5 5 g l magnetite the cumulative ch4 production could be increased by 38 25 85 34 the sludge electrical conductivity ec grew with the increase of magnetite dosage which were 3 02 8 65 13 00 15 46 and 17 97 μs cm for g0 g4 respectively in the presence of magnetite the abundance of proteobacteria increased which contained many genera of electroactive bacteria such as pseudomonas by further metagenomics analysis hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway was shown to be enhanced with the addition of magnetite the increasing abundance of pila genes from clostridium and pseudomonas in bacteria and methanospirillum in archaea confirmed that magnetite stimulated diet in the ad of was keywords magnetite anaerobic digestion waste activated sludge diet pila genes 1 introduction as the residual product of sewage treatment waste activated sludge was has drawn much attention due to its huge yield and intractability since the rapid urbanization during the last decades 1 2 anaerobic digestion ad is an effective method to tackle the problem with the merits of high loading rates and low disposal cost 3 4 in addition methane can be collected as the terminal product of ad which is regarded as a renewable energy and able to partly compensate the consumption of energy in wastewater treatment plants 5 however ad is a multi step biochemical process requiring the coordination of various fermenting bacteria and methanogenic archaea during ad complex organic matters are first hydrolyzed to simple ones and then to volatile fatty acids vfas and hydrogen by fermenting bacteria after that methanogens will be able to use acetic acid or hydrogen produced to generate methane 6 7 in the traditional theory of interspecies electron transfer iet electrons in organic matters are transferred from fermenting bacteria to methanogens by hydrogen as the carrier and this is called interspecies hydrogen transfer iht 8 ad process can easily collapse no matter when fermenting bacteria don t produce enough substrates for methanogens to grow or methanogens don t consume the hydrogen quickly enough leading to the accumulation of vfas 9 10 instead of iht direct interspecies electron transfer diet is a promising pathway with e pili or c type cytochrome serving as electron bridges between fermenting bacteria and methanogens 11 12 after morita 13 proposed the potential for diet in methanogenic wastewater digester aggregates it was first confirmed by rotaru 14 15 that diet existed in the co cultures of geobacter metallireducens with methanosaeta harundinacea or methanosarcina barkeri without diffusion limitations of the electron carriers diet 44 9 103 e cp 1 s 1 exhibits external electron transfer rate per cell pair cp than iht 5 24 103 e cp 1 s 1 16 resulting in faster conversions from vfas to methane and thus higher methane productions subsequently it was reported that conductive materials could promote the efficiency of ad by stimulating diet 17 19 common conductive materials including carbon based material i e activated carbon biochar carbon nanotubes and graphite 20 23 and iron materials i e zero valent iron ferrihydrite and magnetite 24 27 were all found to enhance the methane production during ad among all the conductive materials much attention has been paid to magnetite due to its active chemical properties and ubiquitousness 28 29 kato 30 reported that magnetite could reduce the onset time and promote production rate of the ad of acetate or ethanol in zhao s study 31 with the addition of 10 g l magnetite the methane production was improved by 29 9 and the total chemical oxygen demand tcod removal efficiency was improved by 8 7 compared with the blank however the mechanisms of magnetite effects in ad are still needed to be clarified some researchers believe that magnetite acting as a conductor can stimulate diet and enrich syntrophic microbes that are able to participate in diet 32 33 while others argue that magnetite mainly improves ad by enhancing the activities of hydrolytic enzymes 31 34 35 in addition most studies focus on magnetite effects in ad of simple substrates such as acetate propionate and glucose 31 36 37 how magnetite impacts the ad of was and the mechanism of that are still unknown in this study experiments were conducted with magnetite of

number srp365395 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performances 3 1 1 organic substrates and ph the consumption of organic substrates is a vital index to evaluate the ad efficiency on day 2 the scod of g0 g4 all saw a slight growth where g1 g4 had gained a higher increase of 41 207 80 and 210 mg l compared with g0 respectively fig 1a however as the main contents of scod spn and sps showed a substantial drop on day 2 fig 1b and c the spn of g0 g4 were 1150 1320 1300 1333 and 1380 mg l respectively and the sps of g0 g4 were 398 399 403 402 and 410 mg l respectively this is because that spn and sps can be easily used by fermenting bacteria to produce vfas which is another form of scod but no longer spn or sps it can be inferred that magnetite could promote the hydrolysis of was on day 2 and thus lead to the increase of scod meanwhile as more organic matters released from the hydrolysis of was in the forms of spn and sps g1 g4 had a smaller decrease compared with g0 from day 2 to day 22 scod as well as spn and sps all showed a downward trend at the end of the experiment the scod removal of g1 g4 were 77 36 79 20 slightly higher than that of g0 76 34 consistently the spn removal of g0 g4 were 87 04 87 99 88 13 88 42 and 88 71 respectively and the sps of g0 g4 were 89 36 90 01 90 18 90 49 and 90 77 respectively magnetite is able to enhance the consumption of spn and sps and with dosages increasing there is a growing trend of its promoting effect during ad ph is also a nonnegligible parameter which is closely related to the contents of vfas and will directly influence the growth and metabolism of microorganisms from day 0 to day 4 the ph of g0 g4 dropped from 6 86 to 6 64 6 61 6 59 6 59 and 6 54 respectively fig 1d in accordance with it on day 4 the vfas contents of g0 g4 increased from 2106 mg l to 2824 2896 2976 3028 and 3111 mg l fig 2 acetic acid was main composition which accounted for 41 97 42 96 followed by propionic acid with a proportion of 21 40 22 26 it means that with the addition of magnetite the acidization process was promoted and the more magnetite was added the stronger the enhancement was from day 4 to day 22 the ph of g0 g4 gradually rose to 7 59 7 61 7 62 7 61 and 7 64 respectively since the production of methane is a h consuming process a higher ph is always indicated a more complete methanogenesis 42 on day 12 propionic acid has replaced acetic acid as the most abundant vfa with the proportion of 88 52 90 50 it has been reported that propionic acid is the most easily accumulated vfa in ad with a positive gibbs free energy of 76 1 kj mol to generate methane 43 on day 22 the vfas contents of g0 g4 declined to 160 139 112 105 and 101 mg l respectively compared with g0 magnetite decreased the residual vfas contents by 13 36 37 09 it indicated that magnetite has a positive effect on microbes consumption of vfas 3 1 2 methane production cumulative ch4 production and ch4 yield rate of g0 g4 can be seen in fig 3 before day 6 g0 g4 were all during the lag phase as no more than 30 ml ch4 was produced in the first 6 d on day 8 the ch4 yield rates grew sharply as those of g0 g4 reached 35 28 33 47 35 02 40 96 and 42 40 ml d respectively however after day 8 the ch4 yield rate of g0 began to decrease while g1 g4 achieved their highest ch4 yield rates of 37 58 60 12 67 50 and 72 60 ml d respectively on day 10 what is more with enough addition of magnetite the methanogenesis process also finished early g0 took 20 d to stop the methane production reaction while g2 g4 only needed 18 d in terms of the cumulative ch4 production at the end of the experiment g0 achieved a cumulative ch4 production of 188 54 ml however the cumulative ch4 production of g1 g4 were increased by 38 25 56 60 75 57 and 85 34 respectively it indicated that magnetite can not only promote cumulative ch4 production but also increase ch4 yield rate and shorten the digestion time it is also worth noting that when magnetite dosages varied from 0 to 5 g l the specific incremental cumulative methane productions were 144 22 106 71 71 24 and 32 18 ml g magnetite respectively which decreased with the growth of magnetite dosage taking economic cost into consideration 2 g l should be the optimal dosage for the ad of was 3 2 sludge characteristics the relative activities of α glucosidase and protease can be seen in fig 4 since spn and sps are the main components of the organic matters in was the activities of α glucosidase and protease can be regarded as the hydrolysis ability of ad sludge with the addition of magnetite both α glucosidase and protease activities were improved however to different degrees compared with g0 the activities of α glucosidase were increased by 11 46 15 50 18 65 and 20 46 in g1 g4 respectively nevertheless magnetite enhanced protease activity more significantly the activities of protease in g1 g4 were increased by 67 67 81 55 98 65 and 112 40 respectively compared with g0 it indicated that magnetite could promote the hydrolysis ability of ad especially for spn by increasing the relative enzyme activities and the promotion effect grew with the magnetite dosage coenzyme f420 is a special enzyme existing in methanogens which plays an important role in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis when the dosage of magnetite was 0 5 g l the relative concentration of coenzyme f420 grew by 24 24 compared with the blank group fig 4 however as the dosage continued to increase the relative concentrations of coenzyme f420 didn t grow in proportion which were 31 99 35 80 and 34 55 higher than the blank group respectively compared with g0 the relative ets activities of g0 g4 were increased by 67 94 82 07 99 10 and 102 34 respectively fig 4 ets is an essential index to quantify the intensity of anaerobic respiration including methanogenesis when magnetite dosages increased from 0 to 2 g l the ets activities grew rapidly but when the magnetite dosage was 5 g l only an increase of 3 24 was observed in ets activity magnetite can enhance ets activity and increase coenzyme f420 concentration to facilitate the process of methanogenesis which is consistent with the results in section 3 1 2 ec is one of the most direct physical properties to characterize the presence of diet in order to eliminate the error caused by normal saline nacl 0 85 during the sludge cleaning process we also tested the ec of the normal saline which was 0 63 μs cm the sludge ec grew with the increase of magnetite dosage which were 3 02 8 65 13 00 15 46 and 17 97 μs cm for g0 g4 respectively fig 4 there are two main reasons accounting for the growth of sludge ec 1 magnetite mixed in the sludge can lead to a higher ec 2 magnetite stimulates diet causing electroactive microorganisms to multiply in the sludge and thus increasing the sludge ec considering that the magnetite we used in the experiment had an average diameter of 50 μm it is unlikely that it will distribute widely in suspended sludge so we can draw the conclusion that it is magnetite that stimulates diet in the ad process of was thus giving rise to a higher sludge ec it is further evidenced by sem and eds images where microbes attached on magnetite particles and connected each other with conductive nanowires fig s1 3 3 microbial communities on day 22 at the end of the batch experiment sludge samples from g0 g4 were collected to analyze microbial communities on phylum level there were few changes in bacteria communities of g0 g4 firmicutes had the highest abundance ranging from 38 15 43 15 in g0 g4 followed by bacteroidota which accounted for 19 01 22 47 fig 5 a firmicutes are one of the most common bacteria phyla detected in ad which play an important role in the hydrolysis of complex organic matters and the formation of vfas 44 bacteroidota have the function of degrading macromolecular carbohydrates to generate acid 45 it is worth noting that proteobacteria had a slight increase with the addition of magnetite compared with blank group g0 4 15 the abundances of proteobacteria grew to 4 18 4 27 4 46 and 4 57 respectively in g1 g4 many genera of electroactive bacteria such as geobacter shewanella pseudomonas and desulfovibrio all belong to proteobacteria phylum 46 the growth in the abundance of proteobacteria may imply the existence of diet fig 5a different from bacteria the compositions of archaea in g0 g4 showed a much more obvious change fig 5b on genus level methanosarcina dominated in all five groups and its abundance increased with the addition of magnetite in g0 the proportion of methanosarcina was 34 08 while it grew to 36 32 38 36 40 62 and 39 63 respectively in g1 g4 methanosarcina is able to perform both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis and has been confirmed to be able to perform diet by the coculture with geobacter metallireducens 14 however as an obligate acetoclastic methanogen which is also able to undertake diet 15 the abundance of methanosaeta decreased with the addition of magnetite in g0 g4 the abundance of methanosaeta was 25 01 17 23 17 80 17 55 and 13 39 respectively methanobacterium is also a common genus of methanogens found in ad which is a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen using co2 and h2 to produce ch4 47 during the experiment methanobacterium was the second most abundant genus in g0 g4 accounting for 23 40 31 73 it is worth noting that the abundance of methanospirillum also increased with the addition of magnetite in g0 its proportion was only 0 20 while it increased to 0 91 1 45 2 01 and 2 15 respectively in g1 g4 methanospirillum is a genus of hydrogenotrophic methanogen and is reported to participate in diet in anaerobic co digestion of kitchen wastes and was 48 3 4 metagenomics analysis in order to clarify how magnetite promotes the ad of was more clearly dna extracted from the optimal dosage group g3 and the blank group was further analyzed by the means of metagenomics the abundance of genes related to methanogenesis process can be seen in fig 6 part i contained enzyme genes involved in common methanogenesis pathway ec 1 8 7 3 represented heterodisulfide reductase subunit a1 ec 1 8 98 1 represented heterodisulfide reductase subunit d ec 1 8 98 4 1 8 98 5 and 1 8 98 6 all represented heterodisulfide reductase subunit a2 ec 2 8 4 1 represented methyl coenzyme m reductase alpha subunit and ec 2 1 1 86 represented tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase subunit a these enzymes gene abundance all increased in g3 compared with g0 though not obviously 2 92 19 09 in part ii acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 showed a slightly higher gene abundance in g3 2 61 higher than g0 while phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 1 had an decrease of 1 18 and 0 96 respectively these three enzymes were all involved in acetoclastic methanogenesis only and this phenomenon indicated that magnetite didn t enhance acetoclastic methanogenesis and even impeded it enzyme genes in part iii only functioned in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase ec 1 5 98 1 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase ec 1 5 98 2 and formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase subunit a ec 1 2 7 12 had a gene abundance increase of 15 79 20 29 and 17 81 respectively in g3 compared with g0 gene abundance of methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase ec 3 5 4 27 and formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin n formyltransferase ec 2 3 1 101 showed a substantial growth of 90 60 and 70 74 respectively in g3 compared with g0 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis mainly included the capture and reduction of co2 and these increasing gene abundances indicated that magnetite improved the capacity of methanogens to use co2 to produce ch4 as diet consists of the process of methanogen s reducing co2 by the electrons directly getting from fermenting bacteria it can be inferred that magnetite may promote the ad of was by stimulating diet in order to further confirm the microbes participating in diet the abundance of pila genes in g0 and g3 was counted on genus level fig 7 lovley and his colleagues 49 have reported that geobacter sulfurreducens could complete long range electron transport by e pili whose main composition was pila electrons are transferred in e pili by hopping between incoherent aromatic clusters of pila protein 50 as an indispensable composition of e pili the abundance of pila genes could be an effective index to characterize diet in bacteria g3 showed a greater pila genes abundance of 78 65 rpkm than g0 of 69 89 rpkm it means that microbes in g3 are able to produce more pila protein to assemble e pili transferring electrons as is shown in fig 7 there was no geobacter detected for pila genes however the absence of geobacter didn t mean that diet couldn t be established many other electroactive bacteria that have be suggested participating in diet such as clostridium and pseudomonas could be found with a higher abundance of pila genes in g3 51 52 compared with g0 the pila genes abundance of clostridium and pseudomonas increased by 64 71 and 127 93 clostridium contain a variety of fe iii reducing genus and are shown to be electrochemically active 51 zhao 53 reported that the abundance of clostridia sensu stricto was enriched with addition of fe3o4 pseudomonas are capable of transferring electrons to insoluble electron acceptors and accepting electrons from a variety of extracellular electron donors 52 it is reported that with the addition of 100 g l magnetite the proportion of pseudomonas sequences was two times greater than the blank reactor 52 it can be inferred that clostridium and pseudomonas may be enriched by magnetite to ferment organics and transfer electrons to methanogens using their e pili in archaea g3 16 05 rpkm had a 22 62 higher pila genes abundance than g0 12 42 rpkm methanosarcina contributed the most pila genes abundances in g0 and g3 10 73 and 11 89 rpkm respectively which was coexistent with the microbial community analysis in section 3 3 the main difference was resulted by methanospirillum compared with g0 0 64 rpkm the pila genes abundance increased by 4 35 times in g3 3 45 rpkm although the filament of archaea is different from that of bacteria in structure and composition walker has proved that the archaellum of methanospirillum hungatei shares a lot in common with type iv pili of bacteria and is electrically conductive 54 the rise in the pila genes abundance of methanospirillum indicated that it may involve in the diet process stimulated by magnetite 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that magnetite could promote the ad of was with thp by stimulating diet at the optimal dosage of 2 g l the cumulative ch4 production was increased by 75 57 compared with the blank group magnetite could increase the activities of hydrolysis enzymes including α glucosidase and protease and enhance methanogenesis by improving the concentration of coenzyme f420 and ets activity by further high throughput 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and metagenomic sequencing it revealed that magnetite mainly enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway by establishing diet process analysis of pila genes abundance showed that clostridium and pseudomonas in bacteria and methanospirillum in archaea were enriched by magnetite to participate in diet declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12823,although the promotion of magnetite in anaerobic ad has been widely reported the role of magnetite plays in the ad of waste activated sludge was and the mechanism of the promotion effect are still needed to be explored this study investigated the effects of magnetite in ad of was with thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp from four aspects including reactor performances sludge characteristics microbial community structures and gene abundance results showed that magnetite is able to enhance the consumption of soluble protein spn and soluble polysaccharide sps by increasing the activities of α glucosidase and protease with the addition of 0 5 5 g l magnetite the cumulative ch4 production could be increased by 38 25 85 34 the sludge electrical conductivity ec grew with the increase of magnetite dosage which were 3 02 8 65 13 00 15 46 and 17 97 μs cm for g0 g4 respectively in the presence of magnetite the abundance of proteobacteria increased which contained many genera of electroactive bacteria such as pseudomonas by further metagenomics analysis hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway was shown to be enhanced with the addition of magnetite the increasing abundance of pila genes from clostridium and pseudomonas in bacteria and methanospirillum in archaea confirmed that magnetite stimulated diet in the ad of was keywords magnetite anaerobic digestion waste activated sludge diet pila genes 1 introduction as the residual product of sewage treatment waste activated sludge was has drawn much attention due to its huge yield and intractability since the rapid urbanization during the last decades 1 2 anaerobic digestion ad is an effective method to tackle the problem with the merits of high loading rates and low disposal cost 3 4 in addition methane can be collected as the terminal product of ad which is regarded as a renewable energy and able to partly compensate the consumption of energy in wastewater treatment plants 5 however ad is a multi step biochemical process requiring the coordination of various fermenting bacteria and methanogenic archaea during ad complex organic matters are first hydrolyzed to simple ones and then to volatile fatty acids vfas and hydrogen by fermenting bacteria after that methanogens will be able to use acetic acid or hydrogen produced to generate methane 6 7 in the traditional theory of interspecies electron transfer iet electrons in organic matters are transferred from fermenting bacteria to methanogens by hydrogen as the carrier and this is called interspecies hydrogen transfer iht 8 ad process can easily collapse no matter when fermenting bacteria don t produce enough substrates for methanogens to grow or methanogens don t consume the hydrogen quickly enough leading to the accumulation of vfas 9 10 instead of iht direct interspecies electron transfer diet is a promising pathway with e pili or c type cytochrome serving as electron bridges between fermenting bacteria and methanogens 11 12 after morita 13 proposed the potential for diet in methanogenic wastewater digester aggregates it was first confirmed by rotaru 14 15 that diet existed in the co cultures of geobacter metallireducens with methanosaeta harundinacea or methanosarcina barkeri without diffusion limitations of the electron carriers diet 44 9 103 e cp 1 s 1 exhibits external electron transfer rate per cell pair cp than iht 5 24 103 e cp 1 s 1 16 resulting in faster conversions from vfas to methane and thus higher methane productions subsequently it was reported that conductive materials could promote the efficiency of ad by stimulating diet 17 19 common conductive materials including carbon based material i e activated carbon biochar carbon nanotubes and graphite 20 23 and iron materials i e zero valent iron ferrihydrite and magnetite 24 27 were all found to enhance the methane production during ad among all the conductive materials much attention has been paid to magnetite due to its active chemical properties and ubiquitousness 28 29 kato 30 reported that magnetite could reduce the onset time and promote production rate of the ad of acetate or ethanol in zhao s study 31 with the addition of 10 g l magnetite the methane production was improved by 29 9 and the total chemical oxygen demand tcod removal efficiency was improved by 8 7 compared with the blank however the mechanisms of magnetite effects in ad are still needed to be clarified some researchers believe that magnetite acting as a conductor can stimulate diet and enrich syntrophic microbes that are able to participate in diet 32 33 while others argue that magnetite mainly improves ad by enhancing the activities of hydrolytic enzymes 31 34 35 in addition most studies focus on magnetite effects in ad of simple substrates such as acetate propionate and glucose 31 36 37 how magnetite impacts the ad of was and the mechanism of that are still unknown in this study experiments were conducted with magnetite of different dosages research methods from four levels including reactor performances sludge characteristics microbial community structures and gene abundance were applied to investigate the methane promotion of magnetite and assess the role of magnetite in ad of was our goal is to provide reference for magnetite s possible future application in ad of was 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge and

scod of g0 g4 all saw a slight growth where g1 g4 had gained a higher increase of 41 207 80 and 210 mg l compared with g0 respectively fig 1a however as the main contents of scod spn and sps showed a substantial drop on day 2 fig 1b and c the spn of g0 g4 were 1150 1320 1300 1333 and 1380 mg l respectively and the sps of g0 g4 were 398 399 403 402 and 410 mg l respectively this is because that spn and sps can be easily used by fermenting bacteria to produce vfas which is another form of scod but no longer spn or sps it can be inferred that magnetite could promote the hydrolysis of was on day 2 and thus lead to the increase of scod meanwhile as more organic matters released from the hydrolysis of was in the forms of spn and sps g1 g4 had a smaller decrease compared with g0 from day 2 to day 22 scod as well as spn and sps all showed a downward trend at the end of the experiment the scod removal of g1 g4 were 77 36 79 20 slightly higher than that of g0 76 34 consistently the spn removal of g0 g4 were 87 04 87 99 88 13 88 42 and 88 71 respectively and the sps of g0 g4 were 89 36 90 01 90 18 90 49 and 90 77 respectively magnetite is able to enhance the consumption of spn and sps and with dosages increasing there is a growing trend of its promoting effect during ad ph is also a nonnegligible parameter which is closely related to the contents of vfas and will directly influence the growth and metabolism of microorganisms from day 0 to day 4 the ph of g0 g4 dropped from 6 86 to 6 64 6 61 6 59 6 59 and 6 54 respectively fig 1d in accordance with it on day 4 the vfas contents of g0 g4 increased from 2106 mg l to 2824 2896 2976 3028 and 3111 mg l fig 2 acetic acid was main composition which accounted for 41 97 42 96 followed by propionic acid with a proportion of 21 40 22 26 it means that with the addition of magnetite the acidization process was promoted and the more magnetite was added the stronger the enhancement was from day 4 to day 22 the ph of g0 g4 gradually rose to 7 59 7 61 7 62 7 61 and 7 64 respectively since the production of methane is a h consuming process a higher ph is always indicated a more complete methanogenesis 42 on day 12 propionic acid has replaced acetic acid as the most abundant vfa with the proportion of 88 52 90 50 it has been reported that propionic acid is the most easily accumulated vfa in ad with a positive gibbs free energy of 76 1 kj mol to generate methane 43 on day 22 the vfas contents of g0 g4 declined to 160 139 112 105 and 101 mg l respectively compared with g0 magnetite decreased the residual vfas contents by 13 36 37 09 it indicated that magnetite has a positive effect on microbes consumption of vfas 3 1 2 methane production cumulative ch4 production and ch4 yield rate of g0 g4 can be seen in fig 3 before day 6 g0 g4 were all during the lag phase as no more than 30 ml ch4 was produced in the first 6 d on day 8 the ch4 yield rates grew sharply as those of g0 g4 reached 35 28 33 47 35 02 40 96 and 42 40 ml d respectively however after day 8 the ch4 yield rate of g0 began to decrease while g1 g4 achieved their highest ch4 yield rates of 37 58 60 12 67 50 and 72 60 ml d respectively on day 10 what is more with enough addition of magnetite the methanogenesis process also finished early g0 took 20 d to stop the methane production reaction while g2 g4 only needed 18 d in terms of the cumulative ch4 production at the end of the experiment g0 achieved a cumulative ch4 production of 188 54 ml however the cumulative ch4 production of g1 g4 were increased by 38 25 56 60 75 57 and 85 34 respectively it indicated that magnetite can not only promote cumulative ch4 production but also increase ch4 yield rate and shorten the digestion time it is also worth noting that when magnetite dosages varied from 0 to 5 g l the specific incremental cumulative methane productions were 144 22 106 71 71 24 and 32 18 ml g magnetite respectively which decreased with the growth of magnetite dosage taking economic cost into consideration 2 g l should be the optimal dosage for the ad of was 3 2 sludge characteristics the relative activities of α glucosidase and protease can be seen in fig 4 since spn and sps are the main components of the organic matters in was the activities of α glucosidase and protease can be regarded as the hydrolysis ability of ad sludge with the addition of magnetite both α glucosidase and protease activities were improved however to different degrees compared with g0 the activities of α glucosidase were increased by 11 46 15 50 18 65 and 20 46 in g1 g4 respectively nevertheless magnetite enhanced protease activity more significantly the activities of protease in g1 g4 were increased by 67 67 81 55 98 65 and 112 40 respectively compared with g0 it indicated that magnetite could promote the hydrolysis ability of ad especially for spn by increasing the relative enzyme activities and the promotion effect grew with the magnetite dosage coenzyme f420 is a special enzyme existing in methanogens which plays an important role in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis when the dosage of magnetite was 0 5 g l the relative concentration of coenzyme f420 grew by 24 24 compared with the blank group fig 4 however as the dosage continued to increase the relative concentrations of coenzyme f420 didn t grow in proportion which were 31 99 35 80 and 34 55 higher than the blank group respectively compared with g0 the relative ets activities of g0 g4 were increased by 67 94 82 07 99 10 and 102 34 respectively fig 4 ets is an essential index to quantify the intensity of anaerobic respiration including methanogenesis when magnetite dosages increased from 0 to 2 g l the ets activities grew rapidly but when the magnetite dosage was 5 g l only an increase of 3 24 was observed in ets activity magnetite can enhance ets activity and increase coenzyme f420 concentration to facilitate the process of methanogenesis which is consistent with the results in section 3 1 2 ec is one of the most direct physical properties to characterize the presence of diet in order to eliminate the error caused by normal saline nacl 0 85 during the sludge cleaning process we also tested the ec of the normal saline which was 0 63 μs cm the sludge ec grew with the increase of magnetite dosage which were 3 02 8 65 13 00 15 46 and 17 97 μs cm for g0 g4 respectively fig 4 there are two main reasons accounting for the growth of sludge ec 1 magnetite mixed in the sludge can lead to a higher ec 2 magnetite stimulates diet causing electroactive microorganisms to multiply in the sludge and thus increasing the sludge ec considering that the magnetite we used in the experiment had an average diameter of 50 μm it is unlikely that it will distribute widely in suspended sludge so we can draw the conclusion that it is magnetite that stimulates diet in the ad process of was thus giving rise to a higher sludge ec it is further evidenced by sem and eds images where microbes attached on magnetite particles and connected each other with conductive nanowires fig s1 3 3 microbial communities on day 22 at the end of the batch experiment sludge samples from g0 g4 were collected to analyze microbial communities on phylum level there were few changes in bacteria communities of g0 g4 firmicutes had the highest abundance ranging from 38 15 43 15 in g0 g4 followed by bacteroidota which accounted for 19 01 22 47 fig 5 a firmicutes are one of the most common bacteria phyla detected in ad which play an important role in the hydrolysis of complex organic matters and the formation of vfas 44 bacteroidota have the function of degrading macromolecular carbohydrates to generate acid 45 it is worth noting that proteobacteria had a slight increase with the addition of magnetite compared with blank group g0 4 15 the abundances of proteobacteria grew to 4 18 4 27 4 46 and 4 57 respectively in g1 g4 many genera of electroactive bacteria such as geobacter shewanella pseudomonas and desulfovibrio all belong to proteobacteria phylum 46 the growth in the abundance of proteobacteria may imply the existence of diet fig 5a different from bacteria the compositions of archaea in g0 g4 showed a much more obvious change fig 5b on genus level methanosarcina dominated in all five groups and its abundance increased with the addition of magnetite in g0 the proportion of methanosarcina was 34 08 while it grew to 36 32 38 36 40 62 and 39 63 respectively in g1 g4 methanosarcina is able to perform both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis and has been confirmed to be able to perform diet by the coculture with geobacter metallireducens 14 however as an obligate acetoclastic methanogen which is also able to undertake diet 15 the abundance of methanosaeta decreased with the addition of magnetite in g0 g4 the abundance of methanosaeta was 25 01 17 23 17 80 17 55 and 13 39 respectively methanobacterium is also a common genus of methanogens found in ad which is a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen using co2 and h2 to produce ch4 47 during the experiment methanobacterium was the second most abundant genus in g0 g4 accounting for 23 40 31 73 it is worth noting that the abundance of methanospirillum also increased with the addition of magnetite in g0 its proportion was only 0 20 while it increased to 0 91 1 45 2 01 and 2 15 respectively in g1 g4 methanospirillum is a genus of hydrogenotrophic methanogen and is reported to participate in diet in anaerobic co digestion of kitchen wastes and was 48 3 4 metagenomics analysis in order to clarify how magnetite promotes the ad of was more clearly dna extracted from the optimal dosage group g3 and the blank group was further analyzed by the means of metagenomics the abundance of genes related to methanogenesis process can be seen in fig 6 part i contained enzyme genes involved in common methanogenesis pathway ec 1 8 7 3 represented heterodisulfide reductase subunit a1 ec 1 8 98 1 represented heterodisulfide reductase subunit d ec 1 8 98 4 1 8 98 5 and 1 8 98 6 all represented heterodisulfide reductase subunit a2 ec 2 8 4 1 represented methyl coenzyme m reductase alpha subunit and ec 2 1 1 86 represented tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase subunit a these enzymes gene abundance all increased in g3 compared with g0 though not obviously 2 92 19 09 in part ii acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 showed a slightly higher gene abundance in g3 2 61 higher than g0 while phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 1 had an decrease of 1 18 and 0 96 respectively these three enzymes were all involved in acetoclastic methanogenesis only and this phenomenon indicated that magnetite didn t enhance acetoclastic methanogenesis and even impeded it enzyme genes in part iii only functioned in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase ec 1 5 98 1 5 10 methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase ec 1 5 98 2 and formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase subunit a ec 1 2 7 12 had a gene abundance increase of 15 79 20 29 and 17 81 respectively in g3 compared with g0 gene abundance of methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase ec 3 5 4 27 and formylmethanofuran tetrahydromethanopterin n formyltransferase ec 2 3 1 101 showed a substantial growth of 90 60 and 70 74 respectively in g3 compared with g0 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis mainly included the capture and reduction of co2 and these increasing gene abundances indicated that magnetite improved the capacity of methanogens to use co2 to produce ch4 as diet consists of the process of methanogen s reducing co2 by the electrons directly getting from fermenting bacteria it can be inferred that magnetite may promote the ad of was by stimulating diet in order to further confirm the microbes participating in diet the abundance of pila genes in g0 and g3 was counted on genus level fig 7 lovley and his colleagues 49 have reported that geobacter sulfurreducens could complete long range electron transport by e pili whose main composition was pila electrons are transferred in e pili by hopping between incoherent aromatic clusters of pila protein 50 as an indispensable composition of e pili the abundance of pila genes could be an effective index to characterize diet in bacteria g3 showed a greater pila genes abundance of 78 65 rpkm than g0 of 69 89 rpkm it means that microbes in g3 are able to produce more pila protein to assemble e pili transferring electrons as is shown in fig 7 there was no geobacter detected for pila genes however the absence of geobacter didn t mean that diet couldn t be established many other electroactive bacteria that have be suggested participating in diet such as clostridium and pseudomonas could be found with a higher abundance of pila genes in g3 51 52 compared with g0 the pila genes abundance of clostridium and pseudomonas increased by 64 71 and 127 93 clostridium contain a variety of fe iii reducing genus and are shown to be electrochemically active 51 zhao 53 reported that the abundance of clostridia sensu stricto was enriched with addition of fe3o4 pseudomonas are capable of transferring electrons to insoluble electron acceptors and accepting electrons from a variety of extracellular electron donors 52 it is reported that with the addition of 100 g l magnetite the proportion of pseudomonas sequences was two times greater than the blank reactor 52 it can be inferred that clostridium and pseudomonas may be enriched by magnetite to ferment organics and transfer electrons to methanogens using their e pili in archaea g3 16 05 rpkm had a 22 62 higher pila genes abundance than g0 12 42 rpkm methanosarcina contributed the most pila genes abundances in g0 and g3 10 73 and 11 89 rpkm respectively which was coexistent with the microbial community analysis in section 3 3 the main difference was resulted by methanospirillum compared with g0 0 64 rpkm the pila genes abundance increased by 4 35 times in g3 3 45 rpkm although the filament of archaea is different from that of bacteria in structure and composition walker has proved that the archaellum of methanospirillum hungatei shares a lot in common with type iv pili of bacteria and is electrically conductive 54 the rise in the pila genes abundance of methanospirillum indicated that it may involve in the diet process stimulated by magnetite 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that magnetite could promote the ad of was with thp by stimulating diet at the optimal dosage of 2 g l the cumulative ch4 production was increased by 75 57 compared with the blank group magnetite could increase the activities of hydrolysis enzymes including α glucosidase and protease and enhance methanogenesis by improving the concentration of coenzyme f420 and ets activity by further high throughput 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing and metagenomic sequencing it revealed that magnetite mainly enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway by establishing diet process analysis of pila genes abundance showed that clostridium and pseudomonas in bacteria and methanospirillum in archaea were enriched by magnetite to participate in diet declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12824,artificial intelligence ai is an emerging powerful novel technology that can model real time problems involving numerous intricacies the modeling capabilities of ai techniques are quite advantageous in water purification and wastewater treatment processes because the automation of such facilities resulted in easy and low cost operations in addition to the significant reduction in the occurrence of human errors ai technologies involve multi linear or non linear relationships and process dynamics that are usually impractical to model by conventional methodologies this review presents a compendious synopsis of recent advancements and discoveries in various ai technologies applied to source water quality determination coagulation flocculation disinfection membrane

simple average ensemble tmp trans membrane pressure wwtps wastewater treatment plants wae weighted average ensemble xgboost extreme gradient boosting keywords water purification artificial intelligence wastewater treatment machine learning 1 introduction three quarters of the earth surface is covered with water which is one of the essential elements to sustain human life despite this abundance the availability of fresh water is only about 1 the global water demand is expected to surge from 4200 bm3 in 2015 to 6900 bm3 by 2030 1 industrial and other anthropogenic activities introduce many impurities and hazardous materials of variable compositions and nature 2 several methods have been employed to analyze and predict water quality and wastewater quality including coagulation flocculation techniques desalination membrane filtration biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod 3 these techniques mainly utilize mathematical models and linear regression algorithms as predictive models to simulate and determine the parametric relationships among various process variables of operating systems 4 however these conventional methodologies are time consuming require lengthy procedures and are unable to map the massive non linearity and complexity of systems furthermore they are typically simplified based on assumptions and ideal considerations that are not practical although the empirical and statistical regression models are capable of showing acceptable predictions the overall nonlinear relationships and complicated dynamics which largely exist in water treatment processes cannot be dealt with by these regression models 5 certain parameters must be carefully scrutinized and fixed during water treatment for example the coagulant dosage needs to be efficiently determined to acquire adequate sedimentation of contaminants and a required level of purity 6 the complex coagulants chemistry and their uncertain interaction with water pollutants 7 overrule the traditional tests and methods such as the jar test which illustrates the coagulation flocculation process of wastewater treatment plants wwtps to determine the optimum coagulant dosage for the process the process requires the use of chemicals and is time consuming 8 moreover membrane technology has presented a viable solution for wastewater treatment and reuse applications 9 process parameters such as flow rate temperature pressure and ph are adjusted in a timely manner by automatic control systems that ensure smooth plant operations however current systems are typically based on conventional models that utilize theoretical formulas and empirical correlations as predictive models 10 the theoretical models are based on certain assumptions while the empirical correlations are derived from a particular experimental dataset that is not intuitively applicable to other systems owing to the difference in operating conditions 11 similarly wwtps involve complicated biological and chemical processes influents to wwtps are widely variable and categorical because wastewaters have various origins including industrial effluents domestic discharges and commercial and public wastes which consequently result in varying composition ph and flow rate influents to wwtps and their operation becomes quite complex studies have shown that bod and cod of water are the main parameters for assessing the performance of wwtps these parameters along with total suspended solids tss and total nitrogen tn content are important quality determining factors for drinkable and sustainable water bod and cod help determine the oxygen level in wastewater which evaluates the aeration time to optimize its oxygen level 12 therefore system specific and effective models based on real datasets and operating conditions are required to efficiently determine the degree of variability of parameters for optimal results ai technologies have largely revolutionized today s industrial sector termed industry 4 0 and has triggered research in many science and engineering fields such as intelligent robotics 13 natural language processing material design 14 disease diagnosis and medicine 15 the natural intelligence of humans and certain behaviors are impersonated in technical systems that constitute non parametric algorithms imitating natural human brain functions such as learning and interpreting 16 ai technologies such as artificial neural networks anns deep learning dl support vector machine svm genetic algorithm ga and fuzzy logic fl can perform independent analysis evaluation and prediction according to the input data optimize the system variables or send out warning signals to analyze parameters and adjust the output accordingly this greatly reduces human errors and improves productivity the recent focus of ai in water purification includes common processes such as coagulation flocculation analysis of source water disinfection desalination and membrane filtration 17 intelligent methods are also implemented in wwtps because they involve complex process dynamics and nonlinearity ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and svm technologies are generally utilized to measure water quality by predicting bod cod tss and total dissolved solids tds concentrations in wwtps ai technologies such as anns constitute a self adaptive nonlinear data driven approach comprising three layers 1 input layer 2 one or more hidden layers depending upon the algorithm requirement and 3 one output layer that processes the weighted average and bias in hidden layers to generate a specific output like the human coordination system anns constitute various combinations of computational units called neurons that are interconnected in the form of a network a flowchart for designing codes for developing an ann model is presented in fig 1 18 over the years few review articles have focused on the importance and applicability of ai in water treatment processes for instance li et al reviewed the most recent developments and applications of ai technologies in drinking water treatment plants 17 likewise innovations in the desalination process by ai were comprehended 19 generally previous studies have considered a single ai technology such as ann in a specific water treatment process and delineated the detailed modeling steps 20 22 however there is no review article available till now which comprehensively focuses on the most recent applications of ai in water purification and wastewater treatment processes in this short review a recent and comprehensive study of the literature outlines the major applications of different ai technologies and process automation in various water purification and wastewater treatment processes it provides detailed insights into the introduction of different ai methods in the field of water treatment aiming to redefine the major processes of plants including the analysis and characterization of source water quality coagulation flocculation disinfection and desalination prediction of membrane fouling decontamination bod and cod monitoring and determination 2 development and applications of ai models for water purification 2 1 application of ai in source water quality determination in recent decades water quality prediction approaches have been heavily researched to develop effective management strategies and enhanced early warning systems nevertheless dealing with water related data is the next challenge owing to nonlinearity variability and ambiguous features caused by human influence and unpredictable natural changes ai models have shown exceptional success and superiority in handling such nonlinear data due to their robustness and problem solving capabilities 23 an increasing research interest on ai technique in water treatment modeling is evident from the increasing number of research articles in recent years fig 2 to determine the performance of a water treatment plant water quality index wqi is the most commonly used indicator that includes individual water quality variable magnitudes i e dissolved oxygen do temperature turbidity tss bod calcium cod and ph 24 based on the literature different types of ai models such as ann multi linear regression mlr ga radial basis function rbf particle swarm optimization pso and svm were employed in the prediction and monitoring of water quality parameters with satisfactory outcomes most studies have used neural networks nns to monitor and assess surface water quality ann and mlr approaches were used to estimate groundwater quality from the shivganga river basin 25 thirty four typical groundwater samples were examined to determine the wqi during the pre and post monsoon seasons of 2015 a levenberg marquardt three layer back propagation algorithm bpa was employed in the ann architecture to generate a consistent and precise model for wqi based groundwater quality prediction the wavelet de noising technique wdt anfis surpassed all of the suggested models and accurately predicted all of the water quality metrics with r2 values equal to or 0 9 26 ai based ensemble techniques were utilized to create single and multi step forward prediction models for do 12 27 in light of its possible ability to address nonlinear cycles neural network ensemble nne strength in multi step advance simulation of do was used moreover elkiran et al used distinctive ai models namely back propagation nn bpnn svm and adaptive anfis as well as a classic linear model a linear auto regressive integrated moving average arima 27 the prediction performance of the single models was further improved using three ensemble approaches simple average ensemble sae weighted average ensemble wae and nne the findings of the ensemble techniques demonstrated that nne could boost the average performance of single models by up to 14 in the verification phase nourani et al used three non linear models the feed forward nn ffnn anfis svm approaches and mlr method to predict the effluent bod cod and tn sae wae and nne strategies were introduced in ensemble modeling to increase the performance of single models 12 despite the reliable results for all the ensemble techniques nne was found to be more accurate followed by wae and sae in uncertain imprecise and dynamic contexts these systems are capable of reasoning and learning 3 for example by integrating ann and ga a hybrid statistical model known as a hybrid ann hann was created by zhang et al with the goal of forecasting the overall performance of dwtps across china 28 data from 45 dwtps in china were used on a monthly basis the hann model structure was optimized using the lowest mean squared error mse as an indication sensitivity analysis was performed using garson sensitivity analysis and analysis of variance to investigate the function and relative importance of the input factors by feeding more training data to the hann model its performance improved dramatically from 0 71 to 0 93 r2 indicating that the hann model had the ability to evolve the coefficient of determination r2 indicated that it was capable of dealing with nonlinear patterns similarly different hybrid intelligence models based on adaptive anfis combined with fuzzy c means data clustering fcm grid partitioning gp and subtractive clustering sc models were utilized by yaseen et al to simulate river wqi based on a variety of biological physical and chemical water quality characteristics 24 the need of information is the essential imperative to broaden the utilization of scientific models for the design and optimization purpose the dynamic nature of wastewater treatment operations along with the complicated usage of online sensors might lead to frequent erroneous readings might increase data scarcity issues the effect of information shortage on wastewater advancement and calibration is examined and a straightforward technique is proposed to address the challenges related with data quality and amount issues in displaying of a biological nutrient removal activated sludge systems bnras within the largest italian wwtp found in castiglione italy 29 monte carlo analysis mca was utilized to evaluate the model s instability and additional testing sampling and measurements were recommended in light of the mca results in order to enhance the modeling results to decrease the need for water quality variables tiyasha et al evaluated the reliability of four feature selector algorithms namely extreme gradient boosting xgboost boruta multi variate adaptive regression splines mars and ga 30 furthermore while the xgboost predictive model had the best performance among all applied predictive models when the features selected by the mars and xgboost algorithms with coefficients of determination r2 values of 0 84 and 0 85 respectively 2 2 coagulation flocculation coagulation flocculation is one of the most extensively used technologies for producing clean and safe drinking water owing to its simplicity coagulation is the aggregation of tiny colloidal particle suspensions in water following the addition of a coagulant aggregation occurs resulting in the loss of colloidal stability in the water the colloidal particles clump together and form flocs which are tiny flowers or globules of colloidal particles 31 typically a laboratory jar test is used to establish the required coagulant dosage this process is time consuming and requires chemicals to conduct the jars test and establish the optimal coagulant dose many measurements of variables collected by sensing devices such as turbidity level do ph conductivity and temperature are required raw water quality is altered regularly and a variety of circumstances can influence the removal rate in the coagulation flocculation processes therefore in order to predict the optimal coagulant dosage accurately during the water treatment process over the years researchers have used different ai modeling techniques such as ann ga pso elm rbf mlp rsm adaptive anfis self organizing map som and statistical regression to develop models also it was concluded that mlp anfis and grnn could greatly facilitate operators in determining the optimal coagulant dosage 32 different types of coagulant used and the inputs outputs and model performance variables are summarized in table 1 mlp nns are the most commonly used tool for determining the coagulant dosage for example using a data driven approach wang et al evaluated the optimal performance of coagulation flocculation in terms of cu removal and sludge level for the treatment of an industrial wastewater plant 33 according to the findings of this investigation ga outperformed pso in terms of outgoing cu and sludge level compliance rates mlp nns are the most commonly used tool for determining the coagulant dosage yel et al employed an ann mlp to predict the performance of zeolites sepiolites and pumice in the treatment of andesite marble processing wastewater 34 however the elm rbf model was a better option than the mlp model according to jayaweera et al 35 baidhani et al developed a mathematical model using an ann that was capable of predicting the optimal alum dosage required to treat effluent water turbidity from the simulation of a pilot plant for the coagulation flocculation sedimentation process in a conventional water treatment plant 36 real et al used electrochemical coagulation as a treatment and used ann to simulate the efficiency of cod adsorption in cold meat industry wastewater with current density as the main control parameter 37 najib et al used ann to examine and detect the tss tur and cod removal efficiency of the coagulation flocculation process utilizing fenugreek okra in treating palm oil mill effluent pome under four operating conditions fenugreek dosage okra dosage ph and mixing speed 38 with an r2 value of 0 8629 the ann model was shown to be successful in predicting tss tur and cod in this investigation karam et al investigated the possibility of using the coagulation flocculation technique to treat industrial textile wastewater 39 gadekar and ahammed used the rsm ann approach to optimize disperse dye removal by adsorption using aluminum based water treatment residuals 40 the creation of an upgraded coagulation environmental decision support systems edsss for drinking water production was presented by suquet et al with the goal of assisting daily decision making 41 the model was designed to remove 62 21 and 25 of turbidity total organic carbon toc and uv254 respectively under normal conditions reducing the risk of disinfection by product dbp development bobadilla et al applied rsm based on a central composite design ccd to investigate the effects of the main process variables such as initial turbidity natural coagulant dosage process temperature mixing speed and mixing time in the treatment of raw domestic wastewater using three different and emerging natural coagulants ecotan bio 90d ecotan bio 100 and ecotan bio g150 42 kim and parnichkun used a hybrid of k means anfis technique to estimate settling water turbidity and the best coagulant dosage using data obtained from the bansong water treatment plant in korea 32 the hybrid strategy of k means clustering and anfis was also evaluated using the anfis and ann models the k means anfis outperformed the conventional anfis and ann in all evaluation indices including root mean square error rmse mape r2 and r to identify the appropriate amount of alum and poly aluminum chloride pac coagulant in the hamadan water treatment the anfis based on the subtractive clustering sub approach was used by narges et al 44 heddam et al proposed a new ai technique model called the dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system denfis for modeling the coagulant dosage rate employed in the coagulation stage which was based on an evolving clustering algorithm 45 wadkar et al used the cascade feed forward nn cffnn model to predict the coagulant dose and compared it with ffnn 46 the best results were obtained by the cffnn model with r2 0 945 for training and 0 947 for testing using the bayesian regularization training algorithm wang et al proposed the elman nn enn to determine the flocculant dose and compared it with four representative models mlr radial basis function nn rbfnn least square support vector machine lssvm and enn using six water quality variables do oxygen consumption ph temperature water flow and raw water turbidity 47 with the enn model of flocculant dosage the rmse mape and r2 of the test data were 1 8917 5 0067 and 0 8999 respectively which were improved by 36 9 41 5 and 14 0 respectively compared with the best rbfnn of the other three models thus the enn model is simple to construct and has a good nonlinear approximation ability for modeling the flocculation process in drinking water purification 48 the internet of things iot is a wide scale technology that enables devices to collect and transmit data furthermore combining iot and ai tools to model and anticipate water quality metrics can serve as a guide in monitoring and decision making leading to better water quality for users other technologies such as deep learning tools and gas should also be used in hydrological research coagulation is a vital step in the water quality control process it involves the use of various biological and physical phenomena to remove impurities evolutionary algorithms have garnered considerable attention in the field of water quality treatment they have various advantages such as the ability to produce acceptable solutions that are close to the optimum in case of a lack of data an unsupervised algorithm must be used the concept of the self organizing map is a widely used nn model that allows for unsupervised learning a hybrid sensor system has been developed to collect data and researchers can analyze the data by establishing a som for the data entry process machine learning and ai have enhanced the accuracy of prediction of coagulant dose and water quality prediction for the coagulation flocculation process each year emerging models are introduced to promote courses of action for establishing intelligent systems for water process management and optimization moreover deep learning is a popular discipline of ai and it is an ideal approach for exploring further implicit relationships between variables its robust features and high level data mining capacity make it a great choice for water purification in various industries 2 3 disinfection the applications of ai technologies to different types of disinfection by products are summarized in table 2 ann is an artificial modeling technique that predicts optimizes and performs regression analysis for complex problems it is constructed based on the analogy of a human brain consisting of neuron like interconnected processing units 49 singh et al developed three different models namely ann svm and gene expression programming gep to predict the formation potential of trihalomethanes thms in water due to chlorination 50 it was found that ann svm and gep successfully predicted the non linear relationship between disinfection conditions and thm formation the values for ann svm and gep were 0 09 and 0 998 0 70 and 0 998 and 3 07 and 0 990 for training and 4 05 and 0 918 3 66 and 0 935 and 3 63 and 0 933 for validation set respectively sensitivity analysis revealed that thm formation during chlorination was affected by initial ph contact time and temperature svm was slightly more efficient than the other two ai models 50 moradi et al proposed a hybrid ga method for sensing n nitrosodi methylamine ndma concentration in chlorinated water 51 the two models contained feed forward and feed backward control elements which were integrated through edss for decision making of plants with 85 5 validation 52 the rbf ann is a feed forward nn with an efficient learning algorithm which has a simpler structure compared to other models it possesses a

and time respectively hussain et al developed a novel hybrid model for the dead end uf process by coalescing ann predictive models and the first principle equation of darcy s law on cake filtration 97 this model revealed promising results in forecasting the scr and tss of the feed water with good accuracy an ann model was used to predict the relationship between the separation performance of the mgal co3 2 nanolayered double hydroxide nldh nanocomposite membrane and the composition components nldh polyvinylpyrrolidone and pvdf concentrations 98 furthermore the effects of the separation performance parameters of uf and the interaction between the parameters using the contour plot forecast with the established model were studied this ann model was presented to ga as a bioinspired optimizer to evaluate the best values of input parameters leading to enhanced separation performance of the membrane schmitt et al developed an ann model for the prediction of membrane fouling in an anoxic aerobic mbr 68 they treated domestic wastewater using the developed ann model while maintaining 10 parameters this model had high potential to predict transmembrane pressure in an anoxic aerobic mbr an ann model was introduced from a six year process database to enumerate the causes of membrane fouling in the first stage of a full scale three stage ro which found good predictors for total chlorine electrical conductance tds ammonia and cartridge filter pressure drop for phase 1 fouling 99 however turbidity nitrate organic nitrogen nitrite and total chlorine were predictors of phase 2 fouling renowned ann models such as mlp with levenberg marquardt training can predict membrane fouling with an r2 0 99 with zero error 97 fl was used to model various membrane fouling and correspondingly develop automated systems for the preferable command and organization of membrane fouling 100 101 rahimzadeh et al used an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system for the prediction of

compared to the four individual and five combined blocking models 106 3 3 removal of heavy metals and dyes heavy metal ions present in the water chain are a prodigious hazard to the natural environment and public health heavy metals such as cadmium cd copper cu zinc zn chromium cr and lead pb are highly toxic and non biodegradable 110 they can enter the food chain via the contact of waste in water channels and accumulate by organisms due to their non biodegradability these are harmful even at low concentrations and are the major inorganic contaminants in the environment because of their mobility non biodegradability and toxicity thus their destructive impacts are more evident in living organisms at higher trophic levels 111 conventional physicochemical procedures for the removal of toxic heavy metal ions are either insufficient or very expensive particularly at low concentrations 112 there are numerous ai techniques for simulating predicting and evaluating the removal of toxic heavy metal ions from wastewater using various adsorbents without increasing the cost as reported in the literature 74 83 among all the ai techniques anns are commonly used for the removal of toxic metal ions 113 anns are used to model the removal of as3 and as5 from synthetic wastewater 114 experimental data and model outputs showed a high r2 of 0 9998 and revealed that the model was proficient in forecasting phytoremediation 115 an ann4 model is the best technique for the prediction of the removal percentage of hg2 ions with r2 0 996 normalized root mean square error 0 028 and

revealed exceptional skill for forecasting breakthrough curves and model coefficients 117 the remediation of zn2 cu2 cd2 fe3 pb2 as3 and hg2 using various adsorbents was evaluated using numerous ai tools mostly ann 110 118 126 the typical input variables used in ai techniques were ph metal ion concentration contact time adsorbent dosage and temperature whereas the removal efficiency was taken as the output some reports also employed the box behnken model coupled with ann for cu2 and cd2 removal 127 128 a feed forward ann with a topology optimized by rsm was used for the ultrasound assisted simultaneous removal of pb2 ions and malachite green mg dye 129 ai techniques were also used to evaluate the simultaneous removal of multiple metal ions 130 previous studies have estimated the performance of various adsorbents for the removal of dyes and heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions using ann and anfis techniques 131 136 other ai models such as adaptive neural based fuzzy

temperature initial ph and time however adsorption efficiency of the bone ash was used as the output the hybrid thomas and anfis model were used to estimate the performance of breakthrough curves for the dynamic cd2 adsorption by ostrich bone ash supported nzvi particles 138 oladipo et al presented the application of a novel adsorber for the removal of nickel ions from freshwaters bentonite encapsulated within an alginate biopolymer matrix showed excellent adsorptivity and regeneration capacity the complex ion exchange process occurring during the adsorption has been modeled with ann and central composite design ccd that efficiently predicted the influence of variables on the treatment process 32 and 16 experimental datasets were used for the training of ann and ccd respectively a three layered feed forward ann network with 4 input layers and 2 output layers including uptake capacity and removal efficiency resulted in efficient ni ii predictions avg relative error 0 056 139 ann techniques have been applied for the modeling and simultaneous adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for quaternary dyes by observing the sonication time solution ph amount of sorbent and dye concentrations 140 the ann model provided a good predictive performance for the adsorption of methyl violet 2 b with an excellent value of r2 0 9946 141 the adsorption of anionic azo dye on chitosan al2o3 fe3o4 core shell was predicted by multilayer perceptron ann and exhibited promising results with experimental data high adsorption of methyl orange mo was exhibited in a wide ph range of 4 10 and optimum adsorbent dosage 0 6 g l 142 the removal of brilliant green bg eosin b eb congo red mg methylene blue mb and sunset yellow sy using several adsorbent materials was successfully modeled using ai techniques mainly ann 143 145 the value of the predicted adsorption capacities was close to the experimental results the ai techniques used for modeling the prediction of removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of heavy metals dyes and performance indicators recently reported in the literature are summarized in table 4 cook et al developed an effective potential approach with greater hyporheic exchange rates that can pull off the flow limited effects of biofilm obstruction which is boosted in systems with larger sediment sizes 146 furthermore emerging pollutants such as microplastics can be treated with recognizing the key physical driving mechanisms of mixing and transport 147 3 4 bod and cod monitoring bod and cod represent the amount of dissolved oxygen required for the decomposition of pollutants organic material and inorganic nutrients in water lakes rivers or wastewater by oxidation 114 the main application of bod and cod is the substitution of the degree of organic pollution in water wastewater 151 production of highly toxic effluents from extremely polluting industries such as pulp paper textile and pharmaceuticals require efficient technologies for treatment 152 the bod and cod are the commonly regulated wastewater effluent parameters for evaluating the performance of wwtps controlling the energy consumption of wwtps remains a huge challenge the measurement of bod and cod is limited due to practical acceptances such as cost and intricacy of quantifying methods moreover it is difficult to predict bod and cod due to the intricacy of the treatment process that includes several simultaneous nonlinear mechanisms to overcome these problems ai techniques provide a superior performance to simulate nonlinear and complex engineering complications the advantage of using ai techniques as data driven method is not required to recognize the full physics of a structure therefore the development of advanced ai technology is essential 75 many ai models such as ann and fl have been used to simulate predict and optimize bod and cod removal in the biochemical and physicochemical treatment processes of wwtps 83 huang et al applied a new multi objective control strategy to instantaneously enhance the effluent cod and biogas flow rate in an anaerobic bioreactor using non dominated sorting ga ii nsga ii and ga ann 153 this model displayed a lower mse a higher average absolute percentage error a higher rmse and a higher r2 compared to the ann model in another study rsm and ann were applied to examine the fenton process performance in landfill leachate treatment 154 these models were assessed based on r2 rmse and average error and the observed results were 0 97 0 98 for r2 1 45 1 86 for rmse and 2 4 for average error indicating the relative superiority of ann compared to rsm the bpnn theory was employed to develop a mathematical model for the simulation of an anaerobic mbr for the biodegradation of cod and antibiotics to treat real pharmaceutical wastewater fig 6 a 155 this model showed a high cod removal efficiency 94 0 and volatile fatty acid accumulation nourani et al developed a new model using different ai based non linear techniques such as ffnn adaptive anfis svm approaches and a classical mlr and predicted the performance of the nicosia wwtp fig 6 b 12 they found that the nne technique was a more robust and consistent collective method for forecasting the nicosia wwtp performance because of its nonlinear averaging kernel nadiri et al predicted the effluent quality parameters of a wwtp using a supervised committee fl model 156 this model used an ann to combine the predicted water quality results from the individual fl models it reduced the mean absolute percentage error to 4 in the testing step and found an alternative for predicting the quality of the effluent water parameters the auto regressive moving average arma algorithm and the vector auto regression var algorithm combined model were used for sewage inflow and cod forecasting respectively 157 this hybrid model showed 99 accuracy for prediction performance and revealed its superiority compared to other forecasting models for future application in wwtps lotf et al reported a novel hybrid linear nonlinear methodology that combines a linear autoregressive integrated moving average arima and a nonlinear outlier robust extreme learning machine orelm to predict the quality parameters of effluent wastewater 158 this hybrid model enhanced the forecast competency of all excellent parameters with the top performance by the effluent bod model r2 0 99 a statistical stability metric and composite statistical machine learning ammonia forecasting model showed improved accuracy of municipal wwtp 159 in this model diurnal linear and diurnal linear ann forecasts were found to be the most accurate forecasts for ammonia it improved ammonia measurement with diurnal linear and diurnal linear ann by up to 32 and 46 respectively as compared to the ann model forecast which improved ammonia measurement by 8 sharafati et al used three different models namely ada boost regression abr gradient boost regression gbr and random forest regression rfr to predict effluent quality parameters 160 they found that the abr model was the best for predicting tds whereas the gbr provided improved accuracy in simulating the bod and cod parameters 4 current gap of knowledge and future prospects of ai technologies ai has undoubtedly shown superior performance than conventional modeling procedures in various water treatment processes the successful implementation of these technologies stimulates further research and innovation in the model structures to overcome some of the limitations paved in the way of effective operation of these in water treatment industries the shortcomings of the state of the art ai technologies include 1 real world processes experience a lot of fluctuations in operating conditions mainly due to natural limitations and varying process dynamics the variability in training data leads to inaccurate results of the model trained with historical data 2 the random bias and weight between neurons leads to poor reproducibility of the model and the analysis often results in local optimum rather than coverage of process dynamics as a whole in addition converging locally and inability to detect overfitting are other disadvantages the future study in the field of automation needs to focus on the development of models that analyze the whole treatment plants including several processes in series like coagulation disinfection bod and cod determination etc so that the overall dynamics can be modeled developing hybrid models showed outstanding interpretability by the synergistic performance of resulting model therefore in addition to already developed hybrid ai model structures the in depth analysis for reducing limitations by introducing hybrid structures should be proposed 5 conclusions water quality modeling and prediction are difficult because of the non linearity and complex process dynamics therefore many research disciplines consider the use of enhanced ai models as a feasible method for processing previous data models and forecasts of water quality parameters can help improve the treatment efficiency and safety of water consumption for end users wastewater treatment is essential to protect environmental pollution and living beings membrane filtration and adsorption are efficient and low cost techniques used for the removal of heavy metals and dyes from waste effluents the treatment of zn2 cu2 cd2 fe3 pb2 as3 hg2 bg eb congo red mg mb and sy using various membranes and adsorbents was assessed using numerous ai tools mostly ann ai techniques

12824,artificial intelligence ai is an emerging powerful novel technology that can model real time problems involving numerous intricacies the modeling capabilities of ai techniques are quite advantageous in water purification and wastewater treatment processes because the automation of such facilities resulted in easy and low cost operations in addition to the significant reduction in the

intelligence wastewater treatment machine learning 1 introduction three quarters of the earth surface is covered with water which is one of the essential elements to sustain human life despite this abundance the availability of fresh water is only about 1 the global water demand is expected to surge from 4200 bm3 in 2015 to 6900 bm3 by 2030 1 industrial and other anthropogenic activities introduce many impurities and hazardous materials of variable compositions and nature 2 several methods have been employed to analyze and predict water quality and wastewater quality including coagulation flocculation techniques desalination membrane filtration biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod 3 these techniques mainly utilize mathematical models and linear regression algorithms as predictive models to simulate and determine the parametric relationships among various process variables of operating systems 4 however these conventional methodologies are time consuming require lengthy procedures and are unable to map the massive non linearity and complexity of systems furthermore they are typically simplified based on assumptions and ideal considerations that are not practical although the empirical and statistical regression models are capable of showing acceptable predictions the overall nonlinear relationships and complicated dynamics which largely exist in water treatment processes cannot be dealt with by these regression models 5 certain parameters must be carefully scrutinized and fixed during water treatment for example the coagulant dosage needs to be efficiently determined to acquire adequate sedimentation of contaminants and a required level of purity 6 the complex coagulants chemistry and their uncertain interaction with water pollutants 7 overrule the traditional tests and methods such as the jar test which illustrates the coagulation flocculation process of wastewater treatment plants wwtps to determine the optimum coagulant dosage for the process the process requires the use of chemicals and is time consuming 8 moreover membrane technology has presented a viable solution for wastewater treatment and reuse applications 9 process parameters such as flow rate temperature pressure and ph are adjusted in a timely manner by automatic control systems that ensure smooth plant operations however current systems are typically based on conventional models that utilize theoretical formulas and empirical correlations as predictive models 10 the theoretical models are based on certain assumptions while the empirical correlations are derived from a particular experimental dataset that is not intuitively applicable to other systems owing to the difference in operating conditions 11 similarly wwtps involve complicated biological and chemical processes influents to wwtps are widely variable and categorical because wastewaters have various origins including industrial effluents domestic discharges and commercial and public wastes which consequently result in varying composition ph and flow rate influents to wwtps and their operation becomes quite complex studies have shown that bod and cod of water are the main parameters for assessing the performance of wwtps these parameters along with total suspended solids tss and total nitrogen tn content are important quality determining factors for drinkable and sustainable water bod and cod help determine the oxygen level in wastewater which evaluates the aeration time to optimize its oxygen level 12 therefore system specific and effective models based on real datasets and operating conditions are required to efficiently determine the degree of variability of parameters for optimal results ai technologies have largely revolutionized today s industrial sector termed industry 4 0 and has triggered research in many science and engineering fields such as intelligent robotics 13 natural language processing material design 14 disease diagnosis and medicine 15 the natural intelligence of humans and certain behaviors are impersonated in technical systems that constitute non parametric algorithms imitating natural human brain functions such as learning and interpreting 16 ai technologies such as artificial neural networks anns deep learning dl support vector machine svm genetic algorithm ga and fuzzy logic fl can perform independent analysis evaluation and prediction according to the input data optimize the system variables or send out warning signals to analyze parameters and adjust the output accordingly this greatly reduces human errors and improves productivity the recent focus of ai in water purification includes common processes such as coagulation flocculation analysis of source water disinfection desalination and membrane filtration 17 intelligent methods are also implemented in wwtps because they involve complex process dynamics and nonlinearity ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and svm technologies are generally utilized to measure water quality by predicting bod cod tss and total dissolved solids tds concentrations in wwtps ai technologies such as anns

coagulation flocculation is one of the most extensively used technologies for producing clean and safe drinking water owing to its simplicity coagulation is the aggregation of tiny colloidal particle suspensions in water following the addition of a coagulant aggregation occurs resulting in the loss of colloidal stability in the water the colloidal particles clump together and form flocs which are tiny flowers or globules of colloidal particles 31 typically a laboratory jar test is used to establish the required coagulant dosage this process is time consuming and requires chemicals to conduct the jars test and establish the optimal coagulant dose many measurements of variables collected by sensing devices such as turbidity level do ph conductivity and temperature are required raw water

techniques have been applied for the modeling and simultaneous adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for quaternary dyes by observing the sonication time solution ph amount of sorbent and dye concentrations 140 the ann model provided a good predictive performance for the adsorption of methyl violet 2 b with an excellent value of r2 0 9946 141 the adsorption of anionic azo dye on chitosan al2o3 fe3o4 core shell was predicted by multilayer perceptron ann and exhibited promising results with experimental data high adsorption of methyl orange mo was exhibited in a wide ph range of 4 10 and optimum adsorbent dosage 0 6 g l 142 the removal of brilliant green bg eosin b eb congo red mg methylene blue mb and sunset yellow sy using several adsorbent materials was successfully modeled using ai techniques mainly ann 143 145 the value of the predicted adsorption capacities was close to the experimental results the ai techniques used for modeling the prediction of removal efficiency and adsorption capacity of heavy metals dyes and performance indicators recently reported in the literature are summarized in table 4 cook et al developed an effective potential approach with greater hyporheic exchange rates that can pull off the flow limited effects of biofilm obstruction which is boosted in systems with larger sediment sizes 146 furthermore emerging pollutants such as microplastics can be treated with recognizing the key physical driving mechanisms of mixing and transport 147 3 4 bod and cod monitoring bod and cod represent the amount of dissolved oxygen required for the decomposition of pollutants organic material and inorganic nutrients in water lakes rivers or wastewater by oxidation 114 the main application of bod and cod is the substitution of the degree of organic pollution in water wastewater 151 production of highly toxic effluents from extremely polluting industries such as pulp paper textile and pharmaceuticals require efficient technologies for treatment 152 the bod and cod are the commonly regulated wastewater effluent parameters for evaluating the performance of wwtps controlling the energy consumption of wwtps remains a huge challenge the measurement of bod and cod is limited due to practical acceptances such as cost and intricacy of quantifying methods moreover it is difficult to predict bod and cod due to the intricacy of the treatment process that includes several simultaneous nonlinear mechanisms to overcome these problems ai techniques provide a superior performance to simulate nonlinear and complex engineering complications the advantage of using ai techniques as data driven method is not required to recognize the full physics of a structure therefore the development of advanced ai technology is essential 75 many ai models such as ann and fl have been used to simulate predict and optimize bod and cod removal in the biochemical and physicochemical treatment processes of wwtps 83 huang et al applied a new multi objective control strategy to instantaneously enhance the effluent cod and biogas flow rate in an anaerobic bioreactor using non dominated sorting ga ii nsga ii and ga ann 153 this model displayed a lower mse a higher average absolute percentage error a higher rmse and a higher r2 compared to the ann model in another study rsm and ann were applied to examine the fenton process performance in landfill leachate treatment 154 these models were assessed based on r2 rmse and average error and the observed results were 0 97 0 98 for r2 1 45 1 86 for rmse and 2 4 for average error indicating the relative superiority of ann compared to rsm the bpnn theory was employed to develop a mathematical model for the simulation of an anaerobic mbr for the biodegradation of cod and antibiotics to treat real pharmaceutical wastewater fig 6 a 155 this model showed a high cod removal efficiency 94 0 and volatile fatty acid accumulation nourani et al developed a new model using different ai based non linear techniques such as ffnn adaptive anfis svm approaches and a classical mlr and predicted the performance of the nicosia wwtp fig 6 b 12 they found that the nne technique was a more robust and consistent collective method for forecasting the nicosia wwtp performance because of its nonlinear averaging kernel nadiri et al predicted the effluent quality parameters of a wwtp using a supervised committee fl model 156 this model used an ann to combine the predicted water quality results from the individual fl models it reduced the mean absolute percentage error to 4 in the testing step and found an alternative for predicting the quality of the effluent water parameters the auto regressive moving average arma algorithm and the vector auto regression var algorithm combined model were used for sewage inflow and cod forecasting respectively 157 this hybrid model showed 99 accuracy for prediction performance and revealed its superiority compared to other forecasting models for future application in wwtps lotf et al reported a novel hybrid linear nonlinear methodology that combines a linear autoregressive integrated moving average arima and a nonlinear outlier robust extreme learning machine orelm to predict the quality parameters of effluent wastewater 158 this hybrid model enhanced the forecast competency of all excellent parameters with the top performance by the effluent bod model r2 0 99 a statistical stability metric and composite statistical machine learning ammonia forecasting model showed improved accuracy of municipal wwtp 159 in this model diurnal linear and diurnal linear ann forecasts were found to be the most accurate forecasts for ammonia it improved ammonia measurement with diurnal linear and diurnal linear ann by up to 32 and 46 respectively as compared to the ann model forecast which improved ammonia measurement by 8 sharafati et al used three different models namely ada boost regression abr gradient boost regression gbr and random forest regression rfr to predict effluent quality parameters 160 they found that the abr model was the best for predicting tds whereas the gbr provided improved accuracy in simulating the bod and cod parameters 4 current gap of knowledge and future prospects of ai technologies ai has undoubtedly shown superior performance than conventional modeling procedures in various water treatment processes the successful implementation of these technologies stimulates further research and innovation in the model structures to overcome some of the limitations paved in the way of effective operation of these in water treatment industries the shortcomings of the state of the art ai technologies include 1 real world processes experience a lot of fluctuations in operating conditions mainly due to natural limitations and varying process dynamics the variability in training data leads to inaccurate results of the model trained with historical data 2 the random bias and weight between neurons leads to poor reproducibility of the model and the analysis often results in local optimum rather than coverage of process dynamics as a whole in addition converging locally and inability to detect overfitting are other disadvantages the future study in the field of automation needs to focus on the development of models that analyze the whole treatment plants including several processes in series like coagulation disinfection bod and cod determination etc so that the overall dynamics can be modeled developing hybrid models showed outstanding interpretability by the synergistic performance of resulting model therefore in addition to already developed hybrid ai model structures the in depth analysis for reducing limitations by introducing hybrid structures should be proposed 5 conclusions water quality modeling and prediction are difficult because of the non linearity and complex process dynamics therefore many research disciplines consider the use of enhanced ai models as a feasible method for processing previous data models and forecasts of water quality parameters can help improve the treatment efficiency and safety of water consumption for end users wastewater treatment is essential to protect environmental pollution and living beings membrane filtration and adsorption are efficient and low cost techniques used for the removal of heavy metals and dyes from waste effluents the treatment of zn2 cu2 cd2 fe3 pb2 as3 hg2 bg eb congo red mg mb and sy using various membranes and adsorbents was assessed using numerous ai tools mostly ann ai techniques offer a superior performance to simulate nonlinear and complex engineering complications the typical input variables used in ann were ph concentration treatment time effective area of membrane and adsorbent and temperature whereas the removal efficiency was taken as the output in this review the application of anns svm ga and dl etc in various water treatment processes such as source water quality determination coagulation flocculation disinfection desalination and bod and cod determination are comprehensively presented which showed that ai is an upcoming tool in the sector of water and
