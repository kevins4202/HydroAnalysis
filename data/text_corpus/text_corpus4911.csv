24555,cooperation is a fundamental requirement for the population dynamics of group living organisms despite the substantial research work in cooperative breeding birds the dependence of the population dynamics is unidentified on young or adult helpers in migratory populations the existing mathematical models mostly ignore the migratory property for predicting the birds cooperative dynamics the cooperative breeding birds have three groups in their population viz immature or primary helpers mature or secondary helpers and breeders we ask three questions to study migratory cooperative birds population structure and dynamics through mathematical modeling under changing environments which group is the key to the population dynamics of cooperative migratory birds does the mature helper compensate young helpers helping does the hierarchical structure of the population vary for variable migratory rates we explore the answers based on the mathematical model s simulation experiment a potential alternative to the game theory approach this study estimates the parameters associated with the proposed model through the field survey and obtains the rest from existing literature although the study uses blue tailed bee eater as the test bed species the model is helpful for analyzing other avian species behavioral property the model as a tool can determine whether the primary helpers of blue tailed bee eater are the key to population dynamics the model can also classify the adults help as an addition or compensate to primary helpers help the model can predict any alteration in the cooperative breeding birds hierarchy sizes for variable migration rates under changing climate graphical abstract keywords cooperation migration delay differential system altruism maturation delay 1 introduction cooperation between individuals is the yardstick for the population dynamics of group living animals ranging from insects to birds in the evolutionary timeline holman 2014 brahma et al 2018 wong and balshine 2011 cant 2012 griesser et al 2017 thorley 2020 the substantial research work on birds cooperation focuses majorly on cooperative breeding where non breeding subordinate helps breeding pairs stacey and koenig 1990 emlen 1995 kokko and johnstone 2001 ornithologists and behavioral ecologists are interested in finding an association between the bird population dynamics and the helping rate of the subordinate cooperators reyer 1980 1984 1989 identifying the most necessary social group between breeders and different helpers is another exciting research arena to be explored for behavioral ecologists surprisingly the existing mathematical framework poorly demonstrates the cooperative behavior associated with migration breeding and population dynamics mathematical models on cooperative breeding determine the behavior s stability and frequency as the opposing force to the darwinian selection from an evolutionary perspective reyer 1989 stacey and koenig 1990 jennions and macdonald 1994 the cooperative breeding behavior is an essential driver of a group living organism to eusociality over the evolutionary period crespi and yanega 1995 holman 2014 so far the mathematical models enlighten the variation in bird populations fitness components with a single group of helpers in general the research on the cooperative behavior of birds has two domains the domain of genetic research identifies the genes responsible for inducing cooperation and the helper breeder relatedness magrath and whittingham 1997 emlen 1982 the identification of the cooperative genes is out of the research concern of this article according to the geneticists other findings an animal tends to cooperate with its genetically related kin hamilton 1964 however in many birds non related adult helpers also cooperate with breeders besides the sexually immature genetically related helpers dunn et al 1995 heinsohn and legge 1999 hatchwell and komdeur 2000 on the other hand game theorists focus on the evolutionary stability and repayment of the cooperation against darwinian selection in avian society mathematical ethologists quantified adult cooperators helping rate for specific environmental conditions zahavi 1977 dunn and cockburn 1998 kokko and johnstone 2001 overall the theoretical studies ensure that the adult subordinate birds cooperate as a result of environmental constraints their sacrifice in reproductive fitness is repaid almost in the same amount for survival defense future breeding opportunities and social status up gradation reyer 1989 stacey and koenig 1990 jennions and macdonald 1994 still their study does not reveal the population dynamics with variation in the helping rates for both types of helpers under different environments the output of evolutionary and cooperative game theory proves the helping behavior s evolutionary stability in the social group with multiple strategic situations under natural selection however both the sexually mature and immature helpers have the same strategy i e helping breeders to produce and nurture chicks suppose two groups of a single population have adopted the same strategy for survival in that case the game theory cannot explain further two helpers role to sustain the population dugatkin 1997 the lacunae in the present theoretical models motivate us to aims at four major questions in cooperative breeding birds we use blue tailed bee eater merops philippinus as the model species for this study because of their high cooperativeness and long distance migratory nature the residence of this bird is far apart from the breeding zone the model birds geographic and behavioral distribution allows us to build a model to investigate our objectives in the breeding zone eliminating residential birds effect the other cooperatively breeding birds have different birth and maturation rates note that a similar model can understand other birds behavior with the tuning of the parameter values the model serves as a general toolbox to study all the cooperative breeding avian societies ethology when either population size data or the bird s birth rate and maturation rate is known commonly any known cooperative bird s hierarchical classification consists of breeder primary or immature helpers and secondary or adult helper in this present study we would like to explore three objectives a whether the dynamics of the model species depend on either primary or secondary helpers b whether the secondary helpers can compensate the primary helpers cooperation under changing environment if the primary helpers greatly reduce significantly c how does the variation immigration pattern manifest in bird populations hierarchy sizes our theoretical model uses the concept of a nonlinear delayed differential system for breeders primary helpers secondary helpers and prey we developed a rigorous simulation experiment based on a set of parameter values to obtain this differential equation s solution these parameter values are not arbitrary but we obtain most of them from the field survey we consider most of the remaining parameter values from the existing literature and an online database the choice of parameter values and its estimation procedure are in section 3 elaborately and summarized in table 1 2 model for cooperative breeding birds we consider three compartments or state variables to represent three social statuses of the cooperatively breeding bird populations and an additional compartment to represent their prey for our model the fig 1 visualizes the four state variables and their interactions in the model b t h p t and h s t represent breeders primary helpers chicks and secondary helpers or adult helpers respectively the breeders and the secondary helpers immigrate to the breeding ground at rates i b and i s respectively we assume a breeding site can only support b m a x number of immigrant breeders and h s m a x number of adult immigrating helpers due to limited resource most long distance migratory birds including the blue tailed bee eater migrate asynchronously for the pre breeding and breeding period arai et al 2009 decandido robert and deborah 2010 bauer et al 2016 therefore immigration is not necessarily rapid but sigmoid in most cases so we consider a logistic equation to capture the immigrating population on the other hand we observed an average rapid emigration of birds from the breeding ground hence we denote e b and e s as emigration rates for the b t and h s t respectively the equation for immigrant breeders and secondary helpers in the breeding ground is as follows d b t d t i b b t 1 b t b m a x e b b t 1 d h s t d t i s h s t 1 h s t h s m a x e s h s t the breeders b t produce chicks or primary helpers h p t at a rate of b in the breeding ground the secondary helpers are sexually mature but they are recessive to the breeders this helper population cannot find a mate to form a breeding pair for the breeding season kokko and johnstone 2001 emlen and wrege 1989 however sometimes one bird of the breeding pair may cheat on its partner with an secondary helper dickinson and hatchwell 2004 reyer 1984 stacey and koenig 1990 this opportunity of polygamy and assurance of gene transfer keeps the secondary breeder altruistic they do not turn into breeder in the breeding site however a bird may emigrate from the breeding site as a secondary helper in a breeding season and immigrate to the breeding site as a breeder in another season thus the gene pool of secondary helpers are never lost from the population the chick production rate b includes the contributions from other primary and secondary helpers as the sum of cooperation rate per individual helpers kokko and johnstone 2001 if the primary helpers h p t and the secondary helpers h s t cooperates at rate h p and h s respectively the chick production rate b can be expressed as 2 b b i 1 h p t h p i j 1 h s t h s j o r b b h p h p t h s h s t here the b is the chick production rate in absence of helpers the immature birds leave the breeding ground at a rate of e p and do not come back until they are sexually mature koenig et al 1992 primary helpers h p t turn into either breeders b t or an secondary helpers h s t upon sexual maturation at respective rate λ b and λ s in the residential zone since the maturation takes longer than the migration time the model has a delay term τ representing the maturation time thus the absolute growth rates of breeders secondary helpers and primary helpers are 3

secondary helpers in many birds may breed opportunistically they do not necessarily form a true breeding pair during breeding season stacey and koenig 1990 primary helpers helping rate h p involves rates of food sharing warmth sharing and parasites removal resulting in better survival of the chicks secondary helpers helping rate h s is the cumulative measure of the increase in mate finding rate extra pair fecundity for breeders rate of food bringing to chicks and defending chicks from a predator dunn and cockburn 1998 we could not track down the death of birds as it occurs mostly during migration hence the birds death rates are embedded in the emigration rates so the h s do not only represent the helping in terms of alloparenting or food sharing only but it includes the contribution from opportunistic breeding too therefore we do not consider a further secondary helpers to breeders turning rate the birds need one or more prey populations as the food source in both breeding and residential ground many cooperative species especially insectivores have an extensive range of overlapping prey preferences so we consider a nontaxonomic prey population p t p t is an assemble of both migratory and non migratory insects since the insects can come to a breeding site from the nearby sites we consider a constant introduction rate g p for them however the species death rate d p is constant per individual only due to the predation pressure by other co habiting species of the cooperative breeding population breeders primary helpers and secondary helpers need a different amount of energy as their works in the population are not the same we consider c b c p c s as the breeder s prey consumption rates primary or young helper and adult or secondary helper respectively the consumed prey will be converted to biomass to sustain the population sizes at different rates too let us assume the conversion rate of consumed prey are α b α p and α s in order so the prey population dynamics

appendices a and b the stability analyses of the model find two stable equilibria of the model appendix c one equilibrium is trivial i e no birds exist in the habitat as there is no prey at the other equilibrium all populations coexist at different sizes the theorem lemma and proofs for the uniqueness non negativity and equilibrium points are in the appendices 3 parameter choice using field data and literature we chose blue tailed bee eater as the testbed species however the species population size data is unavailable in avian databases so we surveyed seven sites in the breeding grounds of the blue tailed bee eaters situated in west bengal sites at noachhar 23 63912755 n 88 16554276 e agrwadip 23 57026444 n 88 25164003 e and purbasthali 23 46373831 n 88 37236078 e are in the banks of the river ganges nabagram 23 66866386 n 88 09044712 e and bhedia 23 61562858 n 87 69968921 e are on the riverbank ajay kalijani 26 38523545 n 89 53102312 e and dinhata 26 13019108 n 89 47253215 e are the rest two survey sites from the north of the state west bengal for data collection the observed habitat in dinhata and agradwip are newly forming breeding sites we surveyed from march of 2018 to october of 2019 at sites we generate fig 2 through r software using mapview package appelhans et al 2016 for visualization of our survey map at all survey sites we counted the number of birds coming and leaving per day by point count method the average of the per hour incoming bird counts are the sum of immigration rates for both helpers and breeders we determined the ratio of the secondary helpers and breeders by counting active nest without and with eggs respectively the helpers and breeders immigration rates were determined by dividing the sum of migration rates by the ratio we estimated the emigration rates in a similar way from field survey we observed a breeding pair lay six eggs in an average per nest from our survey however all the survey area has adult helpers hence the production rate of chicks or the primary helpers from the field survey has already the increment due to helpers we could not observe the maturation rates of chicks into breeders and helpers in the breeding ground also the rates may vary over different breeding seasons and different environments fry 1969 stacey and koenig 1990 kokko and johnstone 2001 so we could not collect any data on maturation rates from the field survey the initial values of the rates collected from fields and literature for the model simulation are in table 1 4 simulations to meet the objectives we have simulated the numerical solution for the model through the dde23 solver in matlab software and parameter values from table 1 note that the birds population size differs in various sites the parameter values may vary for different species too so our models numerical solution with table 1 values best describe the blue tailed bee eaters population dynamics in the gangetic delta plain particularly the maturation time τ varies for different species it may alter due to the presence of sex hormone analogs in the environment as a species specific property it determines the time to establish a species equilibrium in a new habitat however we check the models predictability on other species with different maturation times through simulation we recorded time to reach the steady state and size of the steady state to evaluate the generalization and the species specificity of the model under changing environment the birds helping rates maturation rates and immigration rates may differ we perform a series of simulation experiments to check our objectives for the populations characteristic under different environmental setups 4 1 experiment 1 population dynamics depends on the primary and secondary helpers a sustainable population maintains its equilibrium size even under variation in environmental factors we simulate each populations equilibrium sizes for a range of helping rates h p and h s we change one helping rate at a time to observe the change in equilibrium size for each helping rate the population dynamics depend more on the helper whose helping rate causes more difference in the equilibrium sizes 4 2 experiment 2 secondary helpers compensate the primary helpers the maturation rates into breeder and secondary helpers are both species specific and environmentally variable an increased maturation rate from chicks to breeders and secondary helpers can reduce the total help from primary helpers sibling chicks we simulate each populations equilibrium sizes for a range of maturation rates λ b and λ s we change one maturation rate at a time if the difference in equilibrium sizes is greater for the range of λ s than it is for the range of λ b the secondary helpers compensate the primary helpers help 4 3 experiment 3 populations hierarchical sizes varies for variable migratory rates a new habitat may be colonized by a higher number of helpers or a higher number of breeders randomly for a given cooperative bird population hence the immigration rate of breeders and helpers is variable in a new habitat during colonization we simulate each populations equilibrium sizes for a range of immigration rates i b and i s the population hierarchical sizes depend on immigration rate if the differences in equilibrium sizes changes greatly with all three bird populations 5 result 5 1 hierarchy sizes of the population at our models coexistence equilibrium all cooperative breeding bird and prey populations exist together in the habitat according to our simulated population sizes the density of the blue tailed bee eater s different social hierarchies is different from each other the primary or the sexually immature helpers are present highest in number followed by breeders adult or secondary helpers are present at the lowest count fig 3 note that the simulated solution has been 100 times downfolded for better visualization therefore the 3 4 number scale of the breeder indicates 340 breeding pairs on average to be expected within 90 breeding seasons at a random site after the immigration starts fig 3 approximately 890 juvenile helpers can sustain after the first formation of the blue tailed bee eater colony the secondary helper count is around 37 and the prey density is around 9200 per site at the equilibrium the simulated age structure shows the number of sexually mature birds is less than young birds b t h s t h p t such an age structure is demographically stable in temporal scale murphy et al 2020 the solution also indicates that the breeders and primary helpers achieve a greater bird count value than the equilibrium before reaching the steady state however the cooperative breeding society s secondary or adult helper class decreases rapidly immediately after the first immigration it then again increases over the period to reach its equilibrium on the other hand the birds prey population shows a rapid increase due to high growth and invasion rate followed by a fall due to the birds subsequent high prey consumption rate finally converging into equilibrium these population dynamics are likely to be observed in emerging colonies of the birds at the breeding zone the old residential colonies are in equilibrium conditions already 5 2 species specificity of the model the variable τ as checked by stability analyses does not affect the equilibrium sizes appendix d however the time to achieve a steady state is indeed affected by variable τ fig 4 an extended sexual development period delays the time to reach equilibrium we find the bird population sizes are large and the prey population size is low for a species with a short maturation time than blue tailed bee eater fig 4 5 3 dynamics of the bird population on different helpers our first simulation experiment suggests that the increasing helping rate from sexually immature helpers causes a great change in the equilibria of all social groups of the bird population and prey size the higher helping rate from sibling birds raises both the primary helper and secondary helper count however it declines the breeder counts and the prey density fig 5 even with the low breeder and prey number the total bird population keeps increasing till the helping rate is 0 08 per bird fig 5 after that prey population drops to zero the bird population dynamics depend only on the immigration and the reproduction after the prey population goes to extinction on the contrary the steady states of all populations in our model changes to a little extent for different helping rates from secondary or adult helpers fig 6 we observed almost no changes in the steady state sizes up to the helping rate of 0 08 per secondary helper but the helping rate can be further extended therefore the secondary helpers are not necessary for the change in bird population dynamics 5 4 compensation of primary helpers help by secondary helper we find a higher value of chicks to breeder maturation rate λ b raises the equilibrium sizes of a breeder and primary helper to a great extent in our second simulation experiment in the same experiment the prey abundance markedly at the equilibrium the change in secondary helper count for increasing λ b is negligible in our second simulation experiment fig 7 so the secondary helpers do not add a considerable amount of compensation to primary helpers if the breeder population is large also birds will tend to increase the breeder population size given a larger prey population in the environment again for increasing chicks to secondary helpers maturation rate λ s the change in the breeder and prey count s equilibrium size is very little in the simulation experiment however the primary helper count drops as the secondary helper count increases at the equilibrium in our experiment fig 8 therefore the secondary helper may compensate primary helpers only if both breeders and primary are limited in the habitat 5 5 effect of migration on helper breeder ratio increased breeder immigration remarkably decreases the prey population at the equilibrium in our third simulation experiment it notably increases all bird populations at the equilibrium in the experiment see fig 9 hence a change in breeders migratory pattern can alter the equilibrium sizes of bird populations hierarchies a nine fold increment of secondary helpers immigration rate can increase secondary helpers equilibrium size to a very little extent we observe an negligible downregulation of the breeder s equilibrium size for an increased secondary helper immigration rate i s in a habitat at the equilibrium the primary helper count increases for an increase in adult helpers immigration rate however this change in population sizes are marginal so the populations hierarchy sizes stay approximately same for variable immigration of helpers in a new habitat see fig 10 6 discussion our models trivial equilibrium suggested an absence of birds without prey in the habitat a birds natural habitat usually have prey continuous deforestation and pesticide application cause a high death rate of insects and other prey species as a consequence prey species go extinct from some habitats the cooperative breeding population collapses when the prey population goes extinct in the breeding or residential habitat one can observe the trivial equilibrium in a habitat before prey comes or after the prey s extinction a bird will be eliminated from the habitat fast if its prey preference is small for the equilibrium of coexistence the model can simulate the bird populations social hierarchy and portrays the interactions between them our simulation is based on blue tailed bee eater but the model is adjustable to all species by putting species specific maturation time τ the steady state sizes of the cooperative breeding birds sooner in a habitat with an environment full of sex hormone analogs e g bisphenol a for estrogen sashihara et al 2001 ropero et al 2008 than other ones our proposed model can compare and assess dependency of population dynamics on different helping rates under different environmental conditions previous studies on the cooperation rate under different environmental conditions proved that the cooperation increases under restricted resources and greater sex bias emlen 1995 kokko and johnstone 2001 our theoretical study confirms that the primary helpers play an essential role to support a cooperative breeding bird population the secondary or adult helpers are inconsiderable contributors to the dynamics of the avian cooperative breeding system the increased equilibrium sizes of primary helpers require high consumption of prey to ensure the juveniles survivability since the secondary helpers can survive on a lower diet their survival is not threatened by the high prey consumption of primary helpers and breeders this survival strategy may be an explanation of increased equilibrium sizes of secondary breeder in figs 7 and 8 the adult helpers share their prey with juveniles and breeders in opposition the breeders require several preys to reproduce more koenig et al 1992 so the number of breeders decreases following the increased primary and secondary helper count in the habitats despite a secondary helpers constant low cooperation the primary helper can increase their count by helping their siblings and increasing adult helpers the secondary helpers opportunistic breeding may be less frequent as their contribution is not essential for the population dynamics note that we do not consider any secondary helper to breeder conversion rate in the model because of this opportunistic breeding secondary helpers are individuals which are either recessive or altruistic to the breeders emlen and wrege 1989 emlen 1982 reyer 1980 kokko and johnstone 2001 they sneak into breeders nests and opportunistically mate with any of the breeders generally female but never form a true breeding pair the breeder cheats on its partner in order to increase the clutch size dickinson and hatchwell 2004 stacey and koenig 1990 one or two chicks in the clutch thus may be half sibling of others reyer 1980 1984 so the gene pool of the secondary breeder does not go to extinction since the secondary helpers contributes to the clutch size thus to the survivality of the chicks without forming a true breeding pair ignoring the secondary helper to breeder turnover does not hamper the efficiency of the model further from the hamiltonian concept of kin selection we know that secondary helpers share a percentage of genetic relatedness with breeders and the primary helpers the presence of prey species with essential fatty acids in some habitats increases maturation rate into breeder jetz and rubenstein 2011 on the other hand constraints in nesting resources and mates unavailability force juveniles to mature into non breeding adult helpers more than into breeders in a sex biased population our model exhibits the same behavior upon simulation upon sexual maturation a high breeder count drops the prey abundance at equilibrium in our model simulation our model does not only justify the observations in the existing literature it also shows that a variable maturation rate into adult helper does not change the prey abundance so irrespective of prey abundance the increased maturation rate can be caused due to species specificity or other demographic effects for example catastrophic mass death occurs under low spatial resources breeding conditions and maturation inducing foods in a small population kokko and johnstone 2001 already stated that a changed ratio of breeders and helpers might occur due to environmental changes their study suggested the biased breeder helper ratio increases birds cooperation by increasing either the helper number or the helping rate their study was specific to a closed population hence the literature so far neglects the bottleneck effect on helper breeder ratio for the migratory population in a given environment our simulated bottleneck effect confirms that the helper breeder ratio differs only through a high breeder immigration rate under two environments for a new habitat as the population s age structure is sustainable for both in favor of immigration of helpers and breeders both the helper and breeder may colonize a new habitat at a higher immigration rate although the increased breeder immigration increases the total bird population sizes it may collapse due to a detrimental effect on its prey abundance hence a cooperative breeding population must have high breeder immigration regardless of the additive or compensatory help from each secondary helper a high secondary helper immigration rate always increases the primary helper or the chick population at equilibrium thus the age structure of the population tends to have more young individuals and the population becomes more stable in terms of age structure since different maturation time delay τ does not change populations overall equilibrium sizes this model can be generalized for all cooperatively breeding birds therefore the model can be used for classifying the adult helpers helping rate from any avian population as an additive or compensatory to the juvenile helpers helping rate in a given environment 7 conclusion the study confirms the cooperative breeding blue tailed bee eater population dynamics majorly rely on the primary helpers only the environmental changes force the secondary helper to increase populations fitness and their natural fitness the populations hierarchy sizes majorly vary for migratory pattern changes this model has fundamental implications in understanding dynamics through the cooperative behavior of similar species with cooperative breeding and migration credit authorship contribution statement sinchan ghosh conceptualization methodology software writing original draft field survey

population must survive the survival of a population in mathematical modeling is possible under the non negative solution of the model the results established in hale 1977 for multidimensional models suggests that the solution of our system of equations exists in the region r 4 following the condition the non negativity of the solution can be interpreted and proved using the lemma in bodnar 2000 in this respect we have the following theorem theorem 1 all the solution of model with the positive initial condition 8 are positive for all t 0 and are ultimately bounded proof if eq 7 with solution x θ r 4 has trivial points viz b 0 h p 0 h s 0 p 0 then we have f i x x i 0 x r 4 0 where x 1 t b t x 2 t h p t x 3 t h s t x 4 t p t and f i are right sides of system equation 7 for example f 1 i b b t 1 b t b m a x e b b t c b α b b t p t λ b h p t now using lemma 1 of bodnar 2000 we conclude that any solution x t of our eq 7 with x θ c where c τ 0 r 4 is the banach space of continuous functions with sup norm say x t x t x λ is such that x θ r 4 for all t 0 therefore the set r 4 is an invariant region for system the existence of non negative solution of our proposed model can now be used for the ethological study if we know the boundedness of our models solution appendix b boundedness of solution the boundedness of the solution is useful to depict the model can be described as the region of attraction for the model and provided using the following set r b t h p t h s t p t c τ 0 r 4 0 b t h p t h s t m e m 0 p t g p d p where m i b b m a x 4 i s h s m a x 4 e min e p e b e s m max h p h s each solution that starts in r are ultimately bounded in r so in r we can find the equilibrium points of all the populations in this model the equilibrium points play an important role to under stand the change of dynamics under varying ethological parameters in the model appendix c existence of the equilibrium point we have checked that the system has one trivial and one equilibrium namely the coexisting equilibrium e b h p h s p where b h p h s p t is a solution of the following system i b b 1 b b m a x e b b λ b h p c b α b p b 0 i s h s 1 h s h s m a x e s h s λ s h p c s α s p h s 0

steady state values of system is complicated to be determine analytically a complicated expression of steady states is less interpretable and less efficient as a tool so we have determined the steady state numerically while performing the numerical stability analysis on matlab software appendix d stability of the equilibrium point the steady states as checked for our model is either a trivial or a coexistence of all populations as in trivial points no population exist the useful steady state from our model is the coexisting one still the model will be only useful if the coexistence equilibrium is stable for the stability of the equilibrium we need the jacobian matrix at the interior equilibrium point at any steady state the jacobian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium point e b h p h s p

24555,cooperation is a fundamental requirement for the population dynamics of group living organisms despite the substantial research work in cooperative breeding birds the dependence of the population dynamics is unidentified on young or adult helpers in migratory populations the existing mathematical models mostly ignore the migratory property for predicting the birds cooperative dynamics the cooperative breeding birds have three groups in their population viz immature or primary helpers mature or secondary helpers and breeders we ask three questions to study migratory cooperative birds population structure and dynamics through mathematical modeling under changing environments which group is the key to the population dynamics of cooperative migratory birds does the mature helper compensate young helpers helping does the hierarchical structure of the population vary for variable migratory rates we explore the answers based on the mathematical model s simulation experiment a potential alternative to the game theory approach this study estimates the parameters associated with the proposed model through the field survey and obtains the rest from existing literature although the study uses blue tailed bee eater as the test bed species the model is helpful for analyzing other avian species behavioral property the model as a tool can determine whether the primary helpers of blue tailed bee eater are the key to population dynamics the model can also classify the adults help as an addition or compensate to primary helpers help the model can predict any alteration in the cooperative breeding birds hierarchy sizes for variable migration rates under changing climate graphical abstract keywords cooperation migration delay differential system altruism maturation delay 1 introduction cooperation between individuals is the yardstick for the population dynamics of group living animals ranging from insects to birds in the evolutionary timeline holman 2014 brahma et al 2018 wong and balshine 2011 cant 2012 griesser et al 2017 thorley 2020 the substantial research work on birds cooperation focuses majorly on cooperative breeding where non breeding subordinate helps breeding pairs stacey and koenig 1990 emlen 1995 kokko and johnstone 2001 ornithologists and behavioral ecologists are interested in finding an association between the bird population dynamics and the helping rate of the subordinate cooperators reyer 1980 1984 1989 identifying the most necessary social group between breeders and different helpers is another exciting research arena to be explored for behavioral ecologists surprisingly the existing mathematical framework poorly demonstrates the cooperative behavior associated with migration breeding and population dynamics mathematical models on cooperative breeding determine the behavior s stability and frequency as the opposing force to the darwinian selection from an evolutionary perspective reyer 1989 stacey and koenig 1990 jennions and macdonald 1994 the cooperative breeding behavior is an essential driver of a group living organism to eusociality over the evolutionary period crespi and yanega 1995 holman 2014 so far the mathematical models enlighten the variation in bird populations fitness components with a single group of helpers in general the research on the cooperative behavior of birds has two domains the domain of genetic research identifies the genes responsible for inducing cooperation and the helper breeder relatedness magrath and whittingham 1997 emlen 1982 the identification of the cooperative genes is out of the research concern of this article according to the geneticists other findings an animal tends to cooperate with its genetically related kin hamilton 1964 however in many birds non related adult helpers also cooperate with breeders besides the sexually immature genetically related helpers dunn et al 1995 heinsohn and legge 1999 hatchwell and komdeur 2000 on the other hand game theorists focus on the evolutionary stability and repayment of the cooperation against darwinian selection in avian society mathematical ethologists quantified adult cooperators helping rate for specific environmental conditions zahavi 1977 dunn and cockburn 1998 kokko and johnstone 2001 overall the theoretical studies ensure that the adult subordinate birds cooperate as a result of environmental constraints their sacrifice in reproductive fitness is repaid almost in the same amount for survival defense future breeding opportunities and social status up gradation reyer 1989 stacey and koenig 1990 jennions and macdonald 1994 still their study does not reveal the population dynamics with variation in the helping rates for both types of helpers under different environments the output of evolutionary and cooperative game theory proves the helping behavior s evolutionary stability in the social group with multiple strategic situations under natural selection however both the sexually mature and immature helpers have the same strategy i e helping breeders to produce and nurture chicks suppose two groups of a single population have adopted the same strategy for survival in that case the game theory cannot explain further two helpers role to sustain the population dugatkin 1997 the lacunae in the present theoretical models motivate us to aims at four major questions in cooperative breeding birds we use blue tailed bee eater merops philippinus as the model species for this study because of their high cooperativeness and long distance migratory nature the residence of this bird is far apart from the breeding zone the model birds geographic and behavioral distribution allows us to build a model to investigate our objectives in the breeding zone eliminating residential birds effect the other cooperatively breeding birds have different birth and maturation rates note that a similar model can understand other birds behavior with the tuning of the parameter values the model serves as a general toolbox to study all the cooperative breeding avian societies ethology when either population size data or the bird s birth rate and maturation rate is known commonly any known cooperative bird s hierarchical classification consists of breeder primary or immature helpers and secondary or adult helper in this present study we would like to explore three objectives a whether the dynamics of the model species depend on either primary or secondary helpers b whether the secondary helpers can compensate the primary helpers cooperation under changing environment if the primary helpers greatly reduce significantly c how does the variation immigration pattern manifest in bird populations hierarchy sizes our theoretical model uses the concept of a nonlinear delayed differential system for breeders primary helpers secondary helpers and prey we developed a rigorous simulation experiment based on a set of parameter values to obtain this differential equation s solution these parameter values are not arbitrary but we obtain most of them from the field survey we consider most of the remaining parameter values from the existing literature and an online database the choice of parameter values and its estimation procedure are in section 3 elaborately and summarized in table 1 2 model for cooperative breeding birds we consider three compartments or state variables to represent three social statuses of the cooperatively breeding bird populations and an additional compartment to represent their prey for our model the fig 1 visualizes the four state variables and their interactions in the model b t h p t and h s t represent breeders primary helpers chicks and secondary helpers or adult helpers respectively the breeders and the secondary helpers immigrate to the breeding ground at rates i b and i s respectively we assume a breeding site can only support b m a x number of immigrant breeders and h s m a x number of adult immigrating helpers due to limited resource most long distance migratory birds including the blue tailed bee eater migrate asynchronously for the pre breeding and breeding period arai et al 2009 decandido robert and deborah 2010 bauer et al 2016 therefore immigration is not necessarily rapid but sigmoid in most cases so we consider a logistic equation to capture the immigrating population on the other hand we observed an average rapid emigration of birds from the breeding ground hence we denote e b and e s as emigration rates for the b t and h s t respectively the equation for immigrant breeders and secondary helpers in the breeding ground is as follows d b t d t i b b t 1 b t b m a x e b b t 1 d h s t d t i s h s t 1 h s t h s m a x e s h s t the breeders b t produce chicks or primary helpers h p t at a rate of b in the breeding ground the secondary helpers are sexually mature but they are recessive to the breeders this helper population cannot find a mate to form a breeding pair for the breeding season kokko and johnstone 2001 emlen and wrege 1989 however sometimes one bird of the breeding pair may cheat on its partner with an secondary helper dickinson and hatchwell 2004 reyer 1984 stacey and koenig 1990 this opportunity of polygamy and assurance of gene transfer keeps the secondary breeder altruistic they do not turn into breeder in the breeding site however a bird may emigrate from the breeding site as a secondary helper in a breeding season and immigrate to the breeding site as a breeder in another season thus the gene pool of secondary helpers are never lost from the population the chick production rate b includes the contributions from other primary and secondary helpers as the sum of cooperation rate per individual helpers kokko and johnstone 2001 if the primary helpers h p t and the secondary helpers h s t cooperates at rate h p and h s respectively the chick production rate b can be expressed as 2 b b i 1 h p t h p i j 1 h s t h s j o r b b h p h p t h s h s t here the b is the chick production rate in absence of helpers the immature birds leave the breeding ground at a rate of e p and do not come back until they are sexually mature koenig et al 1992 primary helpers h p t turn into either breeders b t or an secondary helpers h s t upon sexual maturation at respective rate λ b and λ s in the residential zone since the maturation takes longer than the migration time the model has a delay term τ representing the maturation time thus the absolute growth rates of breeders secondary helpers and primary helpers are 3

secondary helpers in many birds may breed opportunistically they do not necessarily form a true breeding pair during breeding season stacey and koenig 1990 primary helpers helping rate h p involves rates of food sharing warmth sharing and parasites removal resulting in better survival of the chicks secondary helpers helping rate h s is the cumulative measure of the increase in mate finding rate extra pair fecundity for breeders rate of food bringing to chicks and defending chicks from a predator dunn and cockburn 1998 we could not track down the death of birds as it occurs mostly during migration hence the birds death rates are embedded in the emigration rates so the h s do not only represent the helping in terms of alloparenting or food sharing only but it includes the contribution from opportunistic breeding too therefore we do not consider a further secondary helpers to breeders turning rate the birds need one or more prey populations as the food source in both breeding and residential ground many cooperative species especially insectivores have an extensive range of overlapping prey preferences so we consider a nontaxonomic prey population p t p t is an assemble of both migratory and non migratory insects since the insects can come to a breeding site from the nearby sites we consider a constant introduction rate g p for them however the species death rate d p is constant per individual only due to the predation pressure by other co habiting species of the cooperative breeding population breeders primary helpers and secondary helpers need a different amount of energy as their works in the population are not the same we consider c b c p c s as the breeder s prey consumption rates primary or young helper and adult or secondary helper respectively the consumed prey will be converted to biomass to sustain the population sizes at different rates too let us assume the conversion rate of consumed prey are α b α p and α s in order so the prey population dynamics

appendices a and b the stability analyses of the model find two stable equilibria of the model appendix c one equilibrium is trivial i e no birds exist in the habitat as there is no prey at the other equilibrium all populations coexist at different sizes the theorem lemma and proofs for the uniqueness non negativity and equilibrium points are in the appendices 3 parameter choice using field data and literature we chose blue tailed bee eater as the testbed species however the species population size data is unavailable in avian databases so we surveyed seven sites in the breeding grounds of the blue tailed bee eaters situated in west bengal sites at noachhar 23 63912755 n 88 16554276 e agrwadip 23 57026444 n 88 25164003 e and purbasthali 23 46373831 n 88 37236078 e are in the banks of the river ganges nabagram 23 66866386 n 88 09044712 e and bhedia 23 61562858 n 87 69968921 e are on the riverbank ajay kalijani 26 38523545 n 89 53102312 e and dinhata 26 13019108 n 89 47253215 e are the rest two survey sites from the north of the state west bengal for data collection the observed habitat in dinhata and agradwip are newly forming breeding sites we surveyed from march of 2018 to october of 2019 at sites we generate fig 2 through r software using mapview package appelhans et al 2016 for visualization of our survey map at all survey sites we counted the number of birds coming and leaving per day by point count method the average of the per hour incoming bird counts are the sum of immigration rates for both helpers and breeders we determined the ratio of the secondary helpers and breeders by counting active nest without and with eggs respectively the helpers and breeders immigration rates were determined by dividing the sum of migration rates by the ratio we estimated the emigration rates in a similar way from field survey we observed a breeding pair lay six eggs in an average per nest from our survey however all the survey area has adult helpers hence the production rate of chicks or the primary helpers from the field survey has already the increment due to helpers we could not observe the maturation rates of chicks into breeders and helpers in the breeding ground also the rates may vary over different breeding seasons and different environments fry 1969 stacey and koenig 1990 kokko and johnstone 2001 so we could not collect any data on maturation rates from the field survey the initial values of the rates collected from fields and literature for the model simulation are in table 1 4 simulations to meet the objectives we have simulated the numerical solution for the model through the dde23 solver in matlab software and parameter values from table 1 note that the birds population size differs in various sites the parameter values may vary for different species too so our models numerical solution with table 1 values best describe the blue tailed bee eaters population dynamics in the gangetic delta plain particularly the maturation time τ varies for different species it may alter due to the presence of sex hormone analogs in the environment as a species specific property it determines the time to establish a species equilibrium in a new habitat however we check the models predictability on other species with different maturation times through simulation we recorded time to reach the steady state and size of the steady state to evaluate the generalization and the species specificity of the model under changing environment the birds helping rates maturation rates and immigration rates may differ we perform a series of simulation experiments to check our objectives for the populations characteristic under different environmental setups 4 1 experiment 1 population dynamics depends on the primary and secondary helpers a sustainable population maintains its equilibrium size even under variation in environmental factors we simulate each populations equilibrium sizes for a range of helping rates h p and h s we change one helping rate at a time to observe the change in equilibrium size for each helping rate the population dynamics depend more on the helper whose helping rate causes more difference in the equilibrium sizes 4 2 experiment 2 secondary helpers compensate the primary helpers the maturation rates into breeder and secondary helpers are both species specific and environmentally variable an increased maturation rate from chicks to breeders and secondary helpers can reduce the total help from primary helpers sibling chicks we simulate each populations equilibrium sizes for a range of maturation rates λ b and λ s we change one maturation rate at a time if the difference in equilibrium sizes is greater for the range of λ s than it is for the range of λ b the secondary helpers compensate the primary helpers help 4 3 experiment 3 populations hierarchical sizes varies for variable migratory rates a new habitat may be colonized by a higher number of helpers or a higher number of breeders randomly for a given cooperative bird population hence the immigration rate of breeders and helpers is variable in a new habitat during colonization we simulate each populations equilibrium sizes for a range of immigration rates i b and i s the population hierarchical sizes depend on immigration rate if the differences in equilibrium sizes changes greatly with all three bird populations 5 result 5 1 hierarchy sizes of the population at our models coexistence equilibrium all cooperative breeding bird and prey populations exist together in the habitat according to our simulated population sizes the density of the blue tailed bee eater s different social hierarchies is different from each other the primary or the sexually immature helpers are present highest in number followed by breeders adult or secondary helpers are present at the lowest count fig 3 note that the simulated solution has been 100 times downfolded for better visualization therefore the 3 4 number scale of the breeder indicates 340 breeding pairs on average to be expected within 90 breeding seasons at a random site after the immigration starts fig 3 approximately 890 juvenile helpers can sustain after the first formation of the blue tailed bee eater colony the secondary helper count is around 37 and the prey density is around 9200 per site at the equilibrium the simulated age structure shows the number of sexually mature birds is less than young birds b t h s t h p t such an age structure is demographically stable in temporal scale murphy et al 2020 the solution also indicates that the breeders and primary helpers achieve a greater bird count value than the equilibrium before reaching the steady state however the cooperative breeding society s secondary or adult helper class decreases rapidly immediately after the first immigration it then again increases over the period to reach its equilibrium on the other hand the birds prey population shows a rapid increase due to high growth and invasion rate followed by a fall due to the birds subsequent high prey consumption rate finally converging into equilibrium these population dynamics are likely to be observed in emerging colonies of the birds at the breeding zone the old residential colonies are in equilibrium conditions already 5 2 species specificity of the model the variable τ as checked by stability analyses does not affect the equilibrium sizes appendix d however the time to achieve a steady state is indeed affected by variable τ fig 4 an extended sexual development period delays the time to reach equilibrium we find the bird population sizes are large and the prey population size is low for a species with a short maturation time than blue tailed bee eater fig 4 5 3 dynamics of the bird population on different helpers our first simulation experiment suggests that the increasing helping rate from sexually immature helpers causes a great change in the equilibria of all social groups of the bird population and prey size the higher helping rate from sibling birds raises both the primary helper and secondary helper count however it declines the breeder counts and the prey density fig 5 even with the low breeder and prey number the total bird population keeps increasing till the helping rate is 0 08 per bird fig 5 after that prey population drops to zero the bird population dynamics depend only on the immigration and the reproduction after the prey population goes to extinction on the contrary the steady states of all populations in our model changes to a little extent for different helping rates from secondary or adult helpers fig 6 we observed almost no changes in the steady state sizes up to the helping rate of 0 08 per secondary helper but the helping rate can be further extended therefore the secondary helpers are not necessary for the change in bird population dynamics 5 4 compensation of primary helpers help by secondary helper we find a higher value of chicks to breeder maturation rate λ b raises the equilibrium sizes of a breeder and primary helper to a great extent in our second simulation experiment in the same experiment the prey abundance markedly at the equilibrium the change in secondary helper count for increasing λ b is negligible in our second simulation experiment fig 7 so the secondary helpers do not add a considerable amount of compensation to primary helpers if the breeder population is large also birds will tend to increase the breeder population size given a larger prey population in the environment again for increasing chicks to secondary helpers maturation rate λ s the change in the breeder and prey count s equilibrium size is very little in the simulation experiment however the primary helper count drops as the secondary helper count increases at the equilibrium in our experiment fig 8 therefore the secondary helper may compensate primary helpers only if both breeders and primary are limited in the habitat 5 5 effect of migration on helper breeder ratio increased breeder immigration remarkably decreases the prey population at the equilibrium in our third simulation experiment it notably increases all bird populations at the equilibrium in the experiment see fig 9 hence a change in breeders migratory pattern can alter the equilibrium sizes of bird populations hierarchies a nine fold increment of secondary helpers immigration rate can increase secondary helpers equilibrium size to a very little extent we observe an negligible downregulation of the breeder s equilibrium size for an increased secondary helper immigration rate i s in a habitat at the equilibrium the primary helper count increases for an increase in adult helpers immigration rate however this change in population sizes are marginal so the populations hierarchy sizes stay approximately same for variable immigration of helpers in a new habitat see fig 10 6 discussion our models trivial equilibrium suggested an absence of birds without prey in the habitat a birds natural habitat usually have prey continuous deforestation and pesticide application cause a high death rate of insects and other prey species as a consequence prey species go extinct from some habitats the cooperative breeding population collapses when the prey population goes extinct in the breeding or residential habitat one can observe the trivial equilibrium in a habitat before prey comes or after the prey s extinction a bird will be eliminated from the habitat fast if its prey preference is small for the equilibrium of coexistence the model can simulate the bird populations social hierarchy and portrays the interactions between them our simulation is based on blue tailed bee eater but the model is adjustable to all species by putting species specific maturation time τ the steady state sizes of the cooperative breeding birds sooner in a habitat with an environment full of sex hormone analogs e g bisphenol a for estrogen sashihara et al 2001 ropero et al 2008 than other ones our proposed model can compare and assess dependency of population dynamics on different helping rates under different environmental conditions previous studies on the cooperation rate under different environmental conditions proved that the cooperation increases under restricted resources and greater sex bias emlen 1995 kokko and johnstone 2001 our theoretical study confirms that the primary helpers play an essential role to support a cooperative breeding bird population the secondary or adult helpers are inconsiderable contributors to the dynamics of the avian cooperative breeding system the increased equilibrium sizes of primary helpers require high consumption of prey to ensure the juveniles survivability since the secondary helpers can survive on a lower diet their survival is not threatened by the high prey consumption of primary helpers and breeders this survival strategy may be an explanation of increased equilibrium sizes of secondary breeder in figs 7 and 8 the adult helpers share their prey with juveniles and breeders in opposition the breeders require several preys to reproduce more koenig et al 1992 so the number of breeders decreases following the increased primary and secondary helper count in the habitats despite a secondary helpers constant low cooperation the primary helper can increase their count by helping their siblings and increasing adult helpers the secondary helpers opportunistic breeding may be less frequent as their contribution is not essential for the population dynamics note that we do not consider any secondary helper to breeder conversion rate in the model because of this opportunistic breeding secondary helpers are individuals which are either recessive or altruistic to the breeders emlen and wrege 1989 emlen 1982 reyer 1980 kokko and johnstone 2001 they sneak into breeders nests and opportunistically mate with any of the breeders generally female but never form a true breeding pair the breeder cheats on its partner in order to increase the clutch size dickinson and hatchwell 2004 stacey and koenig 1990 one or two chicks in the clutch thus may be half sibling of others reyer 1980 1984 so the gene pool of the secondary breeder does not go to extinction since the secondary helpers contributes to the clutch size thus to the survivality of the chicks without forming a true breeding pair ignoring the secondary helper to breeder turnover does not hamper the efficiency of the model further from the hamiltonian concept of kin selection we know that secondary helpers share a percentage of genetic relatedness with breeders and the primary helpers the presence of prey species with essential fatty acids in some habitats increases maturation rate into breeder jetz and rubenstein 2011 on the other hand constraints in nesting resources and mates unavailability force juveniles to mature into non breeding adult helpers more than into breeders in a sex biased population our model exhibits the same behavior upon simulation upon sexual maturation a high breeder count drops the prey abundance at equilibrium in our model simulation our model does not only justify the observations in the existing literature it also shows that a variable maturation rate into adult helper does not change the prey abundance so irrespective of prey abundance the increased maturation rate can be caused due to species specificity or other demographic effects for example catastrophic mass death occurs under low spatial resources breeding conditions and maturation inducing foods in a small population kokko and johnstone 2001 already stated that a changed ratio of breeders and helpers might occur due to environmental changes their study suggested the biased breeder helper ratio increases birds cooperation by increasing either the helper number or the helping rate their study was specific to a closed population hence the literature so far neglects the bottleneck effect on helper breeder ratio for the migratory population in a given environment our simulated bottleneck effect confirms that the helper breeder ratio differs only through a high breeder immigration rate under two environments for a new habitat as the population s age structure is sustainable for both in favor of immigration of helpers and breeders both the helper and breeder may colonize a new habitat at a higher immigration rate although the increased breeder immigration increases the total bird population sizes it may collapse due to a detrimental effect on its prey abundance hence a cooperative breeding population must have high breeder immigration regardless of the additive or compensatory help from each secondary helper a high secondary helper immigration rate always increases the primary helper or the chick population at equilibrium thus the age structure of the population tends to have more young individuals and the population becomes more stable in terms of age structure since different maturation time delay τ does not change populations overall equilibrium sizes this model can be generalized for all cooperatively breeding birds therefore the model

confirms the cooperative breeding blue tailed bee eater population dynamics majorly rely on the primary helpers only the environmental changes force the secondary helper to increase populations

109728 sinchan ghosh reports financial support was provided by council of scientific industrial research appendix a non negativity of solutions to use the model for a real avian population the population must survive the survival of a population in mathematical modeling is possible under the non negative solution of the model the results established in hale 1977 for multidimensional models suggests that the solution of our system of equations exists in the region r 4 following the condition the non negativity of the solution can be interpreted and proved using the lemma in bodnar 2000 in this respect we have the following theorem theorem 1 all the solution of model with the positive initial condition 8 are positive for all t 0 and are ultimately bounded proof if eq 7 with solution x θ r 4 has trivial points viz b 0 h p 0 h s 0 p 0 then we have f i x x i 0 x r 4 0 where x 1 t b t x 2 t h p t x 3 t h s t x 4 t p t and f i are right sides of system equation 7 for example f 1 i b b t 1 b t b m a x e b b t c b α b b t p t λ b h p t now using lemma 1 of bodnar 2000 we conclude that any solution x t of our eq 7 with x θ c where c τ 0 r 4 is the banach space of continuous functions with sup norm say x t x t x λ is such that x θ r 4 for all t 0 therefore the set r 4 is an invariant region for system the existence of non negative solution of our proposed model can now be used for the ethological study if we know the boundedness of our models solution appendix b boundedness of solution the boundedness of the solution is useful to depict the model can be described as the region of attraction for the model and provided using the following set r b t h p t h s t p t c τ 0 r 4 0 b t h p t h s t m e m 0 p t g p d p where m i b b m a x 4 i s h s m a x 4 e min e p e b e s m max h p h s each solution that starts in r are ultimately bounded in r so in r we can find the equilibrium points of all the populations in this model the equilibrium points play an important role to under stand the change of dynamics under varying ethological parameters in the model appendix c existence of the equilibrium point we have checked that the system has one trivial and one equilibrium namely the coexisting equilibrium e b h p h s p where b h p h s p t is a solution of the following system i b b 1 b b m a x e b b λ b h p c b α b p b 0 i s h s 1 h s h s m a x e s h s λ s h p c s α s p h s 0 b b h p h p h s h s e p h p h p λ b λ s c p α p p h p 0 9 g p d p p p c b α b b c p α p h p c s α s h s 0 since the proposed equation is four dimensional system with multiple interactive mechanism the steady state values of system is complicated to be determine analytically a complicated expression of steady states is less interpretable and less efficient as a tool so we have determined the steady state numerically while performing the numerical stability analysis on matlab software appendix d stability of the equilibrium point the steady states as checked for our model is either a trivial or a coexistence of all populations as in trivial points no population exist the useful steady state from our model is the coexisting one still the model will be only useful if the coexistence equilibrium is stable for the stability of the equilibrium we need the jacobian matrix at the interior equilibrium point at any steady state the jacobian matrix evaluated at the equilibrium point e b h p h s p

24556,crop models are usually developed using a test set of data and simulations representing a range of environment soil management and genotype combinations previous studies demonstrated that errors in the configuration of test simulations and aggregation of observed data sets are common and can cause major problems for model development however the extent and effect of such errors using agricultural production system simulator next generation apsim crop models are not usually considered as a source of model uncertainty this is a methodological paper describing several approaches for testing the apsim simulation configuration to detect anomalies in the input and observed data in this study we assess the simulation configuration process through i quality control analysis based on a standardised climate dataset ii outlier identification and iii a palette of visualization tools a crop model apsim potato is described to demonstrate the main sources of error during the simulation configuration and data collation processes input data from 426 experiments conducted from 1970 to 2019 in 19 countries were collected and configured to run a model simulation plots were made comparing simulation configuration data and observed data across the entire test set so these values could be checked relative to others in the test set and with independent datasets errors were found in all steps of the simulation configuration process climate soil crop management and observed data we identified a surprising number of errors and inappropriate assumptions that had been made which could influence model predictions the approach presented here moved the bulk of the effort from fitting model processes to setting up broad simulation configuration testing and detailed interrogation to identify current gaps for further model development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data visualization apsim uncertainty potato model inputs crop models 1 introduction crop simulation models are increasingly used in agricultural decision making seidel et al 2018 in the last two decades they have intensively contributed to crop management holzworth et al 2018 environmental impact studies sándor et al 2018 climate risk assessment zheng et al 2018 and climate change adaptation analysis challinor et al 2018 the number of crop models and model users is increasing brown et al 2018a di paola et al 2016 and several studies have been intensively focused on model development i e building or improving the science behind the model brown et al 2019 2014 multi model ensembles asseng et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2013 and model applications seyoum et al 2018 these models have been developed to capture complex interactions of genotype management and environment however error propagation in input data during simulation configuration or simulation settings i e the processes to implement a simulation run a simulation and control the quality of simulations creates difficulties in assessing model performance the lack of quality control of input data during simulation configuration generates uncertainty in crop model outputs confalonieri et al 2016a the main sources of uncertainty in crop model outputs are due to human errors palosuo et al 2011 model inputs model structure and model parameters palosuo et al 2011 thorburn 2017 the minimizing of the latter two is the focus of model development activities using test sets including a wide range of field experiments orange panels in fig 1 for further model applications green panels in fig 1 by contrast quality control in model inputs need to be addressed in the process of building a robust test set to reduce sources of uncertainties this should involve identifying errors and outliers in model inputs and observed data blue panels in fig 1 the focus of this paper so these can be minimized to ensure they do not confound the process of model development crop model inputs typically include climate variables e g daily solar radiation temperature and rainfall soil profile properties e g wilting point or field capacity crop management practices e g planting date initial soil conditions e g initial soil water and crop data i e crop observations to test the model previous efforts have been focused on the assessment of model input uncertainty due to data sources challinor et al 2013 van wart et al 2013 and data resolution ojeda et al 2020 2021b rezaei et al 2015 however the uncertainties related to human errors as addressed by palosuo et al 2011 simulation configuration and data collation procedures e g unit conversion and errors in the data aggregation and manipulation has received less attention confalonieri et al 2016b palosuo et al 2011 most of the modelling efforts have been dedicated to identify robust experimental dataset for calibration and validation procedures asseng et al 2013 however experience in the process of model calibration and validation demonstrated that errors and poor assumptions in the simulation configuration procedure are a major and often undetected source of poor model performance palosuo et al 2011 during simulation configuration a rigorous process is needed to ensure simulation quality this requires building simulations that mimic the real crop growing conditions e g at experiment or field scale including management records weather and soil conditions brown et al 2018a fig 1 due to the nature of this procedure uncertainties related to simulation configuration could be influenced by the modeller i e mistakes made by the operators during configuration and propagated by copying and altering existing simulations to make new ones confalonieri et al 2016b climate information ojeda et al 2021a van wart

lokupitiya et al 2006 considerable effort is needed to ensure quality of observed data such as consistent units white et al 2013 and attributed to the correct date and treatment things that can easily go astray when collating large data sets more efficient and easy to use modelling tools have been created for producing and improving crop models one clear example is the agricultural production system simulator next generation model apsim https www apsim info holzworth et al 2018 which has in part been developed to accelerate the collation of test sets for crop model developments through a single user interface however apsim lacks an automatic system to test the quality of simulation configurations in such test sets in this paper we suggest using all input datasets available to scrutinize the test set and guide subsequent model development the aim of this study was to identify the main sources of error during the simulation configuration process of apsim potato solanum tuberosum l using a global dataset of potato field experiments although this methodology was applied for a single crop potato and model apsim it is applicable to other crops and crop models firstly we briefly describe apsim the input requirements for this crop model section 2 1 and the field experiments used in this study section 2 2 secondly we explain in detail the steps to configurate the model simulations as a part of the model set up section 2 3 and the approaches used to identify the errors during the simulation configuration section 2 4 thirdly we present a quantification of the errors using statistical and visualization methods and discuss future improvements in techniques for data curation and simulation configuration before model development section 3 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the model is based on the existing potato model in apsim next generation version 2019 11 30 4421 built 2019 11 30 holzworth et al 2018 potato model 2 2 https apsimnextgeneration netlify com modeldocumentation thereafter called the model implemented in the plant modelling framework brown et al 2019 2014 the model inputs are daily climate data soil profile parameters at a layer level cultivar parameters and crop management information the model has been extensively described by brown et al 2011 and brown et al 2018b phenological and physiological model parameters has been explained in detail by ojeda et al 2020 for this paper we have made no attempt to change the model beyond that which is described in the release documentation our efforts have been focused on building an extensive evaluation set over a broad range of variables to identify errors due to the simulation configuration the novelty of this approach is the application of intense rigour to simulation configuration and data scrutinisation before model development out of scope for this paper can be targeted 2 2 field experiments and measured observed variables the experimental data chosen for testing simulation configuration included those used in the previous released potato model brown et al 2018b 2011 these were extended to include test sets from a wider range of environments cultivars and crop management practices see references for each dataset in table 1 the number of experiments used to test the released model was 42 and this has been increased to 426 covering a wide range of cultivars crop management practices and environments these experiments were conducted from 1970 to 2019 across 19 countries 55 locations consisting of 44 potato cultivars fig 2 fig s1 the experiments have been carried out to study dry matter allocation yield response to various treatments including nitrogen n fertiliser rates and fertilisation timing irrigation rates time of planting population

facilities table 1 in this paper we assembled three main data sources from australia new zealand and from a global field experiment dataset for potato simulations raymundo et al 2018 the latest hereafter called substor dataset was previously used to develop the substor potato model in dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer and it included experiments from other countries than australia and new zealand except for the canberra location table 1 datasets were included if they achieved minimum data requirements to setup and run a model simulation i e climate data soil data crop management records crop soil observations etc we analysed 27 measured variables which included crop e g leaf stem and tuber and soil soil water observations table s1 the type amount and frequency of measurements differed by country and location within each country due to differences in experiments objectives table 1 for example tuber dry weight tuber fresh weight above ground weight and leaf weight were the four most measured variables measured in 51 43 36 and 36 locations respectively table s2 most experiments had in season crop growth measurements often with more than two measurements australia new zealand and united states had the maximum number of measured variables i e sum across locations for a given country 120 78 and 48 respectively in total we included 20 045 observations from potato field experiments and commercial fields to test the simulation configuration a complete description of the measurements by location can be found in table s2 2 3 simulation configuration 2 3 1 climate for australian experiments climate data were obtained from the point based silo database 3 3 https www longpaddock qld gov au silo point data jeffrey et al 2001 which is derived from observed data from the bureau of meteorology adam australian data archive for meteorology database for new zealand experiments climate data were obtained from meteorological stations located near to each experiment for experiments included in the substor dataset climate data were taken from raymundo et al 2017 and raymundo 2018 and converted from the substor potato to apsim file format climate files known as met files in apsim included daily measurements of solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature and rainfall at a minimum three location specific values must be included in the climate file latitude tav and amp the last two of these refer to the annual average air temperature and annual amplitude in mean monthly temperature the model uses latitude to calculate daily day length hours of plant photosensitive light similarly the model uses tav and amp to estimate the average soil temperature by soil layer for each day of the year for australia tav and amp were derived from the climate data but the methods used to calculate these parameters in other locations were unknown longitude is not required by apsim i e the model runs without this value in the climate file however it is used in the auto documentation procedure of the model to show where the data sets are located therefore longitude was included in the climate file so it could be used as an analysis variable 2 3 2 soil to generate the soil profile for each experiment bulk density bd organic carbon oc soil ph and soil hydraulic parameters air dry crop lower limit ll drained upper limit dul saturated water content sat and swcon were used the parameters air dry and swcon indicate the moisture limit for dry evaporation of the soil and the rate at which water drains when soil water content is above dul saturated flow respectively for each soil layer within each soil profile the water extraction coefficient kl i e the maximum rate of extraction of soil water and the root exploration factor xf were configured for australia dul ll and sat were measured in field experiments while for commercial farms these parameters derived from the water for profit project hinton et al 2018 archived in the natural values atlas of tasmania 4 4 https www naturalvaluesatlas tas gov au and the apsoil 5 5 https www apsim info products apsoil aspx database dalgliesh et al 2012 air dry was estimated as 0 5 ll in 0 0 15 m soil layer and 0 9 ll in 0 15 0 3 m soil layer and equal to ll at depths 0 3 m cresswell et al 2009 swcon was estimated from dul and bd jones and kiniry 1986 values of xf were provided by local agronomist based on regional knowledge kl was configured using default values from the apsoil database for the new zealand experiments soil parameters were estimated from experience with modelling local soils soil parameters from the substor dataset were measured or estimated using the sbuild soil parameter estimation tool available in dssat raymundo et al 2017 this tool estimates soil root growth factor based on an exponential function described by ma et al 2009 soil water dynamics were simulated using the apsim soilwat module vogeler and cichota 2018 which use a cascade approach to simulate water movement addiscott and whitmore 1991 potential evapotranspiration was calculated using an equilibrium evaporation concept as modified by priestley and taylor 1972 dynamics of both carbon c and n in soil were simulated using apsim soiln and apsim residue for below ground and above ground crop residues respectively probert and dimes 2004 2 3 3 crop management management operations irrigation and fertilization were configured for the crop season and to reproduce those applied in the field planting harvesting dates and spatial crop configuration were specified using a crop manager rule which included spacing between plant within rows spacing between rows and depth tubers are planted model simulations were started at planting date a complete description of the crop management by experiment is provided in table s3 2 4 quality control of simulation configuration we identified and quantified the errors in simulation configuration following three steps i visualising all model inputs climate soil and crop management together ii using a standardized dataset to verify the quality of the climate data and iii analysing and quantifying the proportion of outliers in crop and soil observed measurements outliers were defined as values lesser than the lower limit l1 q1 1 5 q3 q1 and bigger than the upper limit l2 q3 1 5 q3 q1 where q1 and q3 are the first 0 25 and third 0 75 quartile respectively 2 4 1 visualising all model inputs together multi location analysis to assess simulation configuration model simulations were configured and model inputs crop and soil observations were written to a database file brown et al 2018a this file was read by a script written in python 3 7 6 6 6 https docs python org 3 7 using jupyter notebook 7 7 https jupyter org to generate a series of plots a complete list of python packages and modules used to develop the visualization tools is presented in table 2 based on the plots generated by this script we conducted a detailed interrogation of simulation configuration and sources of error looking for systematic effects related to location climate and soil information and crop management practices 2 4 2 climate data verification using a standardised global dataset a global climate dataset was used to check the quality of the daily weather data grid based climate data daily rainfall maximum and minimum temperature and global solar radiation at 0 5 0 5 resolution were retrieved for each location fig 2 using the bestiapop python package 8 8 pypi org project bestiapop ojeda et al 2020 2021b which allows download from the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource nasa power database 9 9 power larc nasa gov in an apsim format nasa power was designed to provide web based access to climate variables for input to crop models contained within agricultural decision support systems in a standardised format we compared daily maximum and minimum temperature global solar radiation and rainfall during the growing season from the climate files generated for the 426 experiments described in section 2 3 1 and nasa power the comparison was done for 46 grid cells due to the proximity of some locations n 55 was less that the maximum spatial resolution 0 5 0 5 of the nasa power i e some locations fell in the same grid cell we calculated the tav and amp using long term daily climate data daily rainfall maximum and minimum temperature and global solar radiation of 35 years from 1983 to 2018 n 13 149 retrieved from nasa power we then compared the deviation between the tav and amp calculated using the nasa power dataset and the tav and amp provided with the climate files from each experimental location to quantify the error associated with climate variables we calculated the normalised nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse from 0 to 1 nossent and bauwens 2012 and the concordance correlation coefficient ccc from 1 to 1 lawrence and lin 1989 ojeda et al 2017 between the two climate data sources using the scikit learn 10 10 github com scikit learn scikit learn module and numpy 11 11 numpy org python package 2 4 3 field experimental data integrity to check integrity of the observed data file crop soil measurements table s1 as a key step of the simulation configuration process before testing the model performance out of scope of this paper we i visually identified the outliers looking at the complete data set together using the plotly 12 12 plotly github io plotly py docs index html python graphing library and ii calculated summary statistics and the proportion of outliers for each measured variable table s1 soil water data were not considered in the outlier analysis since absolute values can have a completely different range of values accordingly to the soil type of the field experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate 3 1 1 visualising all model inputs together multi location analysis latitude and co2 concentration values were plotted to identify errors fig 3 allowed easy identification of errors associated with errant values of latitude and check the correct geographical position of each location the analysis of this data is important due to apsim uses latitude to calculate day length which could affect model processes related to photoperiod most experiments were configured with the apsim default co2 concentration 350 ppm however otc and face experiments obtained from the global field experiments for potato simulations raymundo et al 2018 were set up at co2 concentrations ranging from 350 ppm to 708 ppm these experiments belong to the changing climate and potential impact on potato yield and quality chip project de temmerman et al 2002 that investigated the effects of increasing atmospheric co2 on potato production across europe using the cultivar bintje the observed distribution of co2 concentration as indicated by fig 3 identified an error associated with the co2 setup of the model using the cultivar russet burbank in 1998 at giessen germany while the unique cultivar included in the chip project was bintje we found that a simulation was configured using the cultivar russet burbank with co2 concentration values higher than 350 ppm daily solar radiation and a theoretical maximum clear sky radiation q m a x calculated by the model were plotted together to check solar radiation data quality fig 4 q m a x is calculated from the day of the year latitude and vapour pressure thornton and running 1999 while daily solar radiation was q m a x for most locations it was q m a x at some locations e g lincoln and chertsey new zealand la molina peru and huhhot jining and zhalan china fig 4 highlighting the need to further scrutinize the met files from these locations san gabriel ecuador also showed an unusual pattern with many values clustered at very low values and this requires further scrutiny also fig 4 the methods used to generate climate data greatly affects their spatio temporal patterns for example the solar radiation pattern in australia was consistent between locations this is not surprising as these data sets were generated using the same interpolation approach kriging method to complete missing data at daily step jeffrey et al 2001 and never seems to go below a value for atmospheric transmissivity of about 25 however weather station measurements have days that go closer to zero similarly the solar radiation pattern in tylstrup denmark was extremely consistent across the year which could be explained due to this data could be estimated using the angtrom prescott model prescott 1940 based on sunshine hours i e heliophany fig 4 this highlights the need to carefully evaluate the methodologies applied to generate climate data before it can be inputted in crop models mean air annual temperature was calculated in the python script based on air minimum temperature and air maximum temperature generally the patterns of daily minimum and maximum temperatures during the growing season and mean annual temperature did not show outliers for any specific location fig 5 the yellow line in fig 5 shows the mean air temperature estimated from the data in the met file tav amp and latitude and shows good agreement with the pattern of observed data in most cases fig 5 there were also several locations where the sign of the estimated average temperature curve was the opposite of the observations identifying cases where the sign of the latitude in the met file was incorrect fig 6 was created by accumulating a count of rainfall days rainfall 0 against the accumulated daily fractional or relative radiation loss accrradnloss days accrradnloss was calculates as follows 1 accrradnloss d 1 d n q max radn q max where q m a x is the theoretical maximum clear sky radiation mj m 2 and radn mj m 2 is the total solar radiation accrradnloss is accumulated over days d from the start of the crop d 1 to the given day under consideration d n a slope 1 in fig 6 means for each day that rainfall occurs more than 1 day worth of radiation is lost this is possible for locations that encounter frequent dry cloud cover such as san gabriel ecuador and this explains the peculiar pattern of radiation noted lower slopes would be typical of areas where cloud forms and dissipates quickly before and after rainfall events branxholm australia is most notable in this respect with nearly 200 rain days but a 40 loss of potential radiation suggesting some rain and significant clear periods each day differences in slope are likely between locations but less likely for different seasons at the same location and the graph for lincoln new zealand highlights some seasons where the climate data is questionable and needs further checking fig 6 rainfall patterns were also checked plotting rainfall amount vs day of the year fig s2 in general there were not rainfall events higher than 125 mm for a given day 3 1 2 climate data verification using a standardised global dataset overall the accuracy between climate data from the met files climate data provided with the field experimental datasets used as model inputs and the nasa power data varied accordingly with the location and climate variable figs s3 s6 on average the nnse and ccc values between both data sources were higher for daily solar radiation nnse 0 60 ccc 0 63 daily maximum temperature nnse 0 58 ccc 0 58 and daily minimum temperature nnse 0 52 ccc 0 52 compared to daily rainfall nnse 0 45 ccc 0 31 table 3 the ccc ranged from 1 giessen germany sutton bonington england hasting united states to 0 02 koari toralapa bolivia for daily solar radiation from 0 96 hermiston united states to 0 07 la molina lima peru for daily maximum temperature from 0 96 suwanee united states to 0 02 kalengyere uganda belen bolivia for daily minimum temperature and from 0 87 huhhot china hastings united states to 0 02 kalangadoo australia belen bolivia for daily rainfall the range of statistical indicators table 3 indicated that the input climate for the model was collected and generated using different methods and approaches for example the analysis showed that daily solar radiation from the met files generated for model input were almost the same than the retrieved from nasa power for giessen germany sutton bonington england and hastings united states fig s3 which could be associated with the calculation method for this variable in both data sources and the percentage of interpolated climate data for each location duarte and sentelhas 2020 for example van wart et al 2015 highlighted that daily temperature data are often measured instrumentation to measure solar radiation is rare and there can be large gaps of missing data in recorded daily rainfall this raises a critical point commonly neglected when multi location model comparisons are carried out in the modelling community future crop modelling studies with multi environmental analysis should include a pre calibration test system to assess the quality of the climate input data before being inputted in the models in this study we focused on the quality control of the met files generated to run a crop model before model calibration or development there is a key limitation related with the spatial resolution of the standardised datasets used to conduct the quality control due to the difficulty of predicting the spatial variation of climate variables within a grid cell most standardised data products such as nasa power at a global scale or silo 13 13 www longpaddock qld gov au silo gridded data scientific information for land owners jeffrey et al 2001 and dailygridded xavier et al 2016 at country scale australia and brazil respectively offer daily values but they differ in their spatial resolution which brings uncertainties related with the spatial variability of the variable of analysis tozer et al 2012 therefore there is a need to provide detailed information about the errors associated with the up and down scaling of the climate inputs ojeda et al 2020 when climate data is collected from different locations to develop crop models the comparison between the tav and amp provided in the met files collected by each data provider and the tav and amp calculated with long term climate data from nasa power showed high deviations nnse 0 37 and ccc 0 47 for tav and nnse 0 6 and ccc 0 72 for amp fig 7 a and fig 7b associated with the number of daily observations included in the met file table s4 i e when the numbers of observations used to calculated the tav and amp was high the deviation was reduced fig 7c and fig 7d mainly for tav these differences are critical due to apsim uses tav and amp to estimate the average soil temperature by soil layer for each day of the year this reinforces the need to use standardised climate dataset to calculate both parameters tav and amp in future apsim studies where several locations are used to calibrate models 3 2 soil apsim uses a multi layer soil profile to simulate soil processes in each layer separately soil parameters for each soil layer were plotted by location and checked against the rest of the locations included in the test set the visualization assessment included model parameters associated with root exploration xf soil water dynamics ll dul and kl soluble inorganic n components nh4n and no3n and organic carbon fresh organic matter fom which contains roots from the previous crop and crop residues if they have been incorporated into the soil by tillage an example for lincoln new zealand is provided in fig 8 the complete set of soil configuration plots for all locations are provided in the supplementary material figs s7 s13 the methods used to set up the soil parameters across the soil profile differed with the location and experiment for most experiments the xf 0 1 was set to 1 at the first soil layer and then decreased exponentially to the bottom soil layer e g jokionen finland and toralapa bolivia fig s7 no clear methodology was identified to set up the maximum rooting depth although for some locations such as chertsey hastings palmerston north pukekohe ruakura temuka new zealand and coonawarra kalangadoo and mt benson australia impediments to crop rooting were considered on the other hand some experiments showed a constant value of xf 1 across the entire soil profile simplot dataset from australia e g latrobe fig s7 the inconsistencies to estimate this soil parameter could be explained because some users relate root intensity with xf rather than root front velocity ll is a soil specific parameter therefore it varied between locations and experiments at the same location e g sheffield and deloraine australia fig s8 we found differences in ll mainly in australian locations simplot datasets which are in tasmania fig s8 tasmania contains a diverse range of soil orders australian soil classification isbell 2016 due to variations in climate landscape and geology ojeda et al 2020 which reflects the high variability of ll and other soil parameters in these environments we also identified abrupt reductions e g from 0 1 to 0 01 mm 1 below 60 cm soil depth in coonawarra australia and increments e g from 0 059 to 0 455 mm 1 below 51 cm soil depth in westbury australia of ll values for specific locations below a given soil depth fig s8 previous studies have demonstrated that pawc is one of the most sensible inputs in crop models mensegue et al 2021 shelia et al 2018 and particularly in apsim ojeda et al 2020 2021b wu et al 2019 due to the soil profile has a characterization by layer soil depth and ll and dul values have a critical impact on the estimated pawc at a profile level in this study we were not able to compare the soil inputs reported by the field experiments with a global soil standardised dataset such as the harmonized world soil database 14 14 www fao org land water land land governance land resources planning toolbox category details en c 1028012 nachtergaele et al 2010 due to these databases provides soil texture information usually percentage of sand clay and silt which need to be converted to ll and dul to be inputted in apsim this conversion brings uncertainties related with the estimation method to do this conversion due to its dependence on the soil type e g differences in organic matter content and region saxton and rawls 2006 in addition the maximum soil depth for the standardised datasets is homogeneous across grid cells which is not the case for the reported soil profiles in the field experiments used in this study our results demonstrated that there is i a lack of documentation or large uncertainty in methods used to estimate soil parameters amongst data sources and ii a large amount of copying or guessing where soil parameters are not known 3 3 crop management crop management data used to set up the complete set of simulations is showed in fig 9 these plots identify outliers and irregularities associated with the crop management parameters used to create the simulations errors associated with crop management configuration were mainly related with units and names of variables incorrect dates typing errors and assumptions made by the data collector when data was not available for some experiments row spacing and row spacing were inverted in the substor dataset it was not clear whether row spacing was the distance between rows or between plants within rows we identified outliers of row spacing values for some locations fig 9 for example in san gabriel ecuador the row spacing was 1200 mm it was explained by a high variability of stolon elongation in the andean tropics that is related with row spacing in otc experiments chip project de temmerman et al 2002 the row spacing was less than 400 mm therefore the plant population was higher than 12 pl m 2 fig 9 a common human error was the use of different units to set up the model for instance planting depth was entered in cm when the model needed mm for some australian experiments simplot dataset from commercial fields plant population should be 6 but 20 was entered in the model we also found inconsistencies associated with data sources the level of detail and quality of field observations for example for australia we used two main data sources field experiments from research organisations e g universities and commercial fields from industry simplot dataset table 1 the industry database is a large yield dataset of potato available but it does not include descriptions of irrigation regimes we were uncertain if these trials were even irrigated and if so how much therefore an on farm average irrigation management for these experiments was applied personal communication from farm advisors and agronomists to interpret our results in the future this assumption needs to be considered if data about irrigation regime is available at farm level obtaining irrigation datasets from commercial fields will be key to increase the values of these datasets and to supporting model developments 3 4 measured observed variables the scrutinisation of observed field data is a critical step during simulation configuration before calculating the prediction error comparison between observed and simulated data thorburn 2017 due to the presence of anomalies in the data can create noise during the model development several studies have highlighted the need to quantify the error associated with observed data during model calibration confalonieri et al 2016a 2016b our observed dataset presented 1 25 of outliers table 4 crop cover total tuber live n concentration and specific leaf area showed the maximum number of outliers 8 02 5 06 and 3 05 respectively fig 10 table 4 this could be related with the methodologies used to measure crop cover e g use of different devices in the field and to estimate tuber live n concentration and specific leaf area the latter two variables have an implicit uncertainty because they are calculated as derivatives from other variables from tuber weight for tuber live n concentration and from leaf weight and size for specific leaf area although it is relatively low percentage of outliers for such big field experimental dataset it is critical to calculate and identify the number and reason of outliers for data curation before testing the model performance as a critical step in the model development this is required to reduce the uncertainties related with anomalies on data collation and methods used to record field experimental data 4 concluding remarks sources of error were identified in the whole simulation configuration process associated with climate soil management records and observed crop soil data table 5 our results demonstrated that standard criteria are required to identify and quantify the uncertainties associated with input data and field observations during simulation configuration in this study we presented several approaches to assess the quality of the simulation configuration process i quality control analysis based on a standardised climate dataset ii outlier identification and iii a palette of visualization tools we identified and quantified the errors discussed their main drivers and sources and proposed recommendations for future studies upcoming modelling studies need to focus on the definition of predefined criteria to identify outliers and errors on simulation configuration processes before any model calibration or development is conducted this will allow model user to discriminate the weight of this errors on model outputs there were several studies that used substantial observed datasets across many cultivar environmental and crop management combinations to test crop model performance brown et al 2018a ojeda et al 2018 2017 2016 raymundo et al 2017 as far as we are aware this study is one of the first to explicitly describe the cause of error during a simulation configuration process as a key preparatory step before model development the approach presented here moved the bulk of the effort from fitting model processes to setting up broad simulation configuration testing and detailed interrogation to identify current gaps for further model development this highlights the importance of high levels of rigour for configuring test sets and thorough consideration of the model performance so that subsequent model development can be effectively targeted we also found weaknesses in the presented methodology although our approach was applied to a single crop potato and using a specific crop model apsim it is applicable to other crops and crop models future research will be also required to automatically implement the approaches presented here

24556,crop models are usually developed using a test set of data and simulations representing a range of environment soil management and genotype combinations previous studies demonstrated that errors in the configuration of test simulations and aggregation of observed data sets are common and can cause major problems for model development however the extent and effect of such errors using agricultural production system simulator next generation apsim crop models are not usually considered as a source of model uncertainty this is a methodological paper describing several approaches for testing the apsim simulation configuration to detect anomalies in the input and observed data in this study we assess the simulation configuration process through i quality control analysis based on a standardised climate dataset ii outlier identification and iii a palette of visualization tools a crop model apsim potato is described to demonstrate the main sources of error during the simulation configuration and data collation processes input data from 426 experiments conducted from 1970 to 2019 in 19 countries were collected and configured to run a model simulation plots were made comparing simulation configuration data and observed data across the entire test set so these values could be checked relative to others in the test set and with independent datasets errors were found in all steps of the simulation configuration process climate soil crop management and observed data we identified a surprising number of errors and inappropriate assumptions that had been made which could influence model predictions the approach presented here moved the bulk of the effort from fitting model processes to setting up broad simulation configuration testing and detailed interrogation to identify current gaps for further model development graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data visualization apsim uncertainty potato model inputs crop models 1 introduction crop simulation models are increasingly used in agricultural decision making seidel et al 2018 in the last two decades they have intensively contributed to crop management holzworth et al 2018 environmental impact studies sándor et al 2018 climate risk assessment zheng et al 2018 and climate change adaptation analysis challinor et al 2018 the number of crop models and model users is increasing brown et al 2018a di paola et al 2016 and several studies have been intensively focused on model development i e building or improving the science behind the model brown et al 2019 2014 multi model ensembles asseng et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2013 and model applications seyoum et al 2018 these models have been developed to capture complex interactions of genotype management and environment however error propagation in input data during simulation configuration or simulation settings i e the processes to implement a simulation run a simulation and control the quality of simulations creates difficulties in assessing model performance the lack of quality control of input data during simulation configuration generates uncertainty in crop model outputs confalonieri et al 2016a the main sources of uncertainty in crop model outputs are due to human errors palosuo et al 2011 model inputs model structure and model parameters palosuo et al 2011 thorburn 2017 the minimizing of the latter two is the focus of model development activities using test sets including a wide range of field experiments orange panels in fig 1 for further model applications green panels in fig 1 by contrast quality control in model inputs need to be addressed in the process of building a robust test set to reduce sources of uncertainties this should involve identifying errors and outliers in model inputs and observed data blue panels in fig 1 the focus of this paper so these can be minimized to ensure they do not confound the process of model development crop model inputs typically include climate variables e g daily solar radiation temperature and rainfall soil profile properties e g wilting point or field capacity crop management practices e g planting date initial soil conditions e g initial soil water and crop data i e crop observations to test the model previous efforts have been focused on the assessment of model input uncertainty due to data sources challinor et al 2013 van wart et al 2013 and data resolution ojeda et al 2020 2021b rezaei et al 2015 however the uncertainties related to human errors as addressed by palosuo et al 2011 simulation configuration and data collation procedures e g unit conversion and errors in the data aggregation and manipulation has received less attention confalonieri et al 2016b palosuo et al 2011 most of the modelling efforts have been dedicated to identify robust experimental dataset for calibration and validation procedures asseng et al 2013 however experience in the process of model calibration and validation demonstrated that errors and poor assumptions in the simulation configuration procedure are a major and often undetected source of poor model performance palosuo et al 2011 during simulation configuration a rigorous process is needed to ensure simulation quality this requires building simulations that mimic the real crop growing conditions e g at experiment or field scale including management records weather and soil conditions brown et al 2018a fig 1 due to the nature of this procedure uncertainties related to simulation configuration could be influenced by the modeller i e mistakes made by the operators during configuration and propagated by copying and altering existing simulations to make new ones confalonieri et al 2016b climate information ojeda et al 2021a van wart

lokupitiya et al 2006 considerable effort is needed to ensure quality of observed data such as consistent units white et al 2013 and attributed to the correct date and treatment things that can easily go astray when collating large data sets more efficient and easy to use modelling tools have been created for producing and improving crop models one clear example is the agricultural production system simulator next generation model apsim https www apsim info holzworth et al 2018 which has in part been developed to accelerate the collation of test sets for crop model developments through a single user interface however apsim lacks an automatic system to test the quality of simulation configurations in such test sets in this paper we suggest using all input datasets available to scrutinize the test set and guide subsequent model development the aim of this study was to identify the main sources of error during the simulation configuration process of apsim potato solanum tuberosum l using a global dataset of potato field experiments although this methodology was applied for a single crop potato and model apsim it is applicable to other crops and crop models firstly we briefly describe apsim the input requirements for this crop model section 2 1 and the field experiments used in this study section 2 2 secondly we explain in detail the steps to configurate the model simulations as a part of the model set up section 2 3 and the approaches used to identify the errors during the simulation configuration section 2 4 thirdly we present a quantification of the errors using statistical and visualization methods and discuss future improvements in techniques for data curation and simulation configuration before model development section 3 2 materials and methods 2 1

netlify com modeldocumentation thereafter called the model implemented in the plant modelling framework brown et al 2019 2014 the model inputs are daily climate data soil profile parameters at a layer level cultivar parameters and crop management information the model has been extensively described by brown et al 2011 and brown et al 2018b phenological and physiological model parameters has been explained in detail by ojeda et al 2020 for this paper we have made no attempt to change the model beyond that which is described in the release documentation our efforts have been focused on building an extensive evaluation set over a broad range of variables to identify errors due to the simulation configuration the novelty of this approach is the application of intense rigour to simulation configuration and data scrutinisation before model development out of scope for this paper can be targeted 2 2 field experiments and measured observed variables the experimental data chosen for testing simulation configuration included those used in the previous released potato model brown et al 2018b 2011 these were extended to include test sets from a wider range of environments cultivars and crop management practices see references for each dataset in table 1 the number of experiments used to test the released model was 42 and this has been increased to 426 covering a wide range of cultivars crop management practices and environments these experiments were conducted from 1970 to 2019 across 19 countries 55 locations consisting of 44 potato cultivars fig 2 fig s1 the experiments have been carried out to study dry matter allocation yield response to various treatments including nitrogen n fertiliser rates and fertilisation timing irrigation rates time of planting population the adaptability of cultivars across locations and years and the effect of increased atmospheric co2 concentrations on crop development in open top chambers otc and free air co2 enrichment face facilities table 1 in this paper we assembled three main data sources from australia new zealand and from a global field experiment dataset for potato simulations raymundo et al 2018 the latest hereafter called substor dataset was previously used to develop the substor potato model in dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer and it included experiments from other countries than australia and new zealand except for the canberra location table 1 datasets were included if they achieved minimum data requirements to setup and run a model simulation i e climate data soil data crop management records crop soil observations etc we analysed 27 measured variables which included crop e g leaf stem and tuber and soil soil water observations table s1 the type amount and frequency of measurements differed by country and location within each country due to differences in experiments objectives table 1 for example tuber dry weight tuber fresh weight above ground weight and leaf weight were the four most measured variables measured in 51 43 36 and 36 locations respectively table s2 most experiments had in season crop growth measurements often with more than two measurements australia new zealand and united states had the maximum number of measured variables i e sum across locations for a given country 120 78 and 48 respectively in total we included 20 045 observations from potato field experiments and commercial fields to test the simulation configuration a complete description of the measurements by location can be found in table s2 2 3 simulation configuration 2 3 1 climate for australian experiments climate data were obtained from the point based silo database 3 3 https www longpaddock qld gov au silo point data jeffrey et al 2001 which is derived from observed data from the bureau of meteorology adam australian data archive for meteorology database for new zealand experiments climate data were obtained from meteorological stations located near to each experiment for experiments included in the substor dataset climate data were taken from raymundo et al 2017 and raymundo 2018 and converted from the substor potato to apsim file format climate files known as met files in apsim included daily measurements of solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature and rainfall at a minimum three location specific values must be included in the climate file latitude tav and amp the last two of these refer to the annual average air temperature and annual amplitude in mean monthly temperature the model uses latitude to calculate daily day length hours of plant photosensitive light similarly the model uses tav and amp to estimate the average soil temperature by soil layer for each day of the year for australia tav and amp were derived from the climate data but the methods used to calculate these parameters in other locations were unknown longitude is not required by apsim i e the model runs without this value in the climate file however it is used in the auto documentation procedure of the model to show where the data sets are located therefore longitude was included in the climate file so it could be used as an analysis variable 2 3 2 soil to generate the soil profile for each experiment bulk density bd organic carbon oc soil ph and soil hydraulic parameters air dry crop lower limit ll drained upper limit dul saturated water content sat and swcon were used the parameters air dry and swcon indicate the moisture limit for dry evaporation of the soil and the rate at which water drains when soil water content is above dul saturated flow respectively for each soil layer within each soil profile the water extraction coefficient kl i e the maximum rate of extraction of soil water and the root exploration factor xf were configured for australia dul ll and sat were measured in field experiments while for commercial farms these parameters derived from the water for profit project hinton et al 2018 archived in the natural values atlas of tasmania 4 4 https www naturalvaluesatlas tas gov au and the apsoil 5 5 https www apsim info products apsoil aspx database dalgliesh et al 2012 air dry was estimated as 0 5 ll in 0 0 15 m soil layer and 0 9 ll in 0 15 0 3 m soil layer and equal to ll at depths 0 3 m cresswell et al 2009 swcon was estimated from dul and bd jones and kiniry 1986 values of xf were provided by local agronomist based on regional knowledge kl was configured using default values from the apsoil database for the new zealand experiments soil parameters were estimated from experience with modelling local soils soil parameters from the substor dataset were measured or estimated using the sbuild soil parameter estimation tool available in dssat raymundo et al 2017 this tool estimates soil root growth factor based on an exponential function described by ma et al 2009 soil water dynamics were simulated using the apsim soilwat module vogeler and cichota 2018 which use a cascade approach to simulate water movement addiscott and whitmore 1991 potential evapotranspiration was calculated using an equilibrium evaporation concept as modified by priestley and taylor 1972 dynamics of both carbon c and n in soil were simulated using apsim soiln and apsim residue for below ground and above ground crop residues respectively probert and dimes 2004 2 3 3 crop management management operations irrigation and fertilization were configured for the crop season and to reproduce those applied in the field planting harvesting dates and spatial crop configuration were specified using a crop manager rule which included spacing between plant within rows spacing between rows and depth tubers are planted model simulations were started at planting date a complete description of the crop management by experiment is provided in table s3 2 4 quality control of simulation configuration we identified and quantified the errors in simulation configuration following three steps i visualising all model inputs climate soil and crop management together ii using a standardized dataset to verify the quality of the climate data and iii analysing and quantifying the proportion of outliers in crop and soil observed measurements outliers were defined as values lesser than the lower limit l1 q1 1 5 q3 q1 and bigger than the upper limit l2 q3 1 5 q3 q1 where q1 and q3 are the first 0 25 and third 0 75 quartile respectively 2 4 1 visualising all model inputs together multi location analysis to assess simulation configuration model simulations were configured and model inputs crop and soil observations were written to a database file brown et al 2018a this file was read by a script written in python 3 7 6 6 6 https docs python org 3 7 using jupyter notebook 7 7 https jupyter org to generate a series of plots a complete list of python packages and modules used to develop the visualization tools is presented in table 2 based on the plots generated by this script we conducted a detailed interrogation of simulation configuration and sources of error looking for systematic effects related to location climate and soil information and crop management practices 2 4 2 climate data verification using a standardised global dataset a global climate dataset was used to check the quality of the daily weather data grid based climate data daily rainfall maximum and minimum temperature and global solar radiation at 0 5 0 5 resolution were retrieved for each location fig 2 using the bestiapop python package 8 8 pypi org project bestiapop ojeda et al 2020 2021b which allows download from the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource nasa power database 9 9 power larc nasa gov in an apsim format nasa power was designed to provide web based access to climate variables for input to crop models contained within agricultural decision support systems in a standardised format we compared daily maximum and minimum temperature global solar radiation and rainfall during the growing season from the climate files generated for the 426 experiments described in section 2 3 1 and nasa power the comparison was done for 46 grid cells due to the proximity of some locations n 55 was less that the maximum spatial resolution 0 5 0 5 of the nasa power i e some locations fell in the same grid cell we calculated the tav and amp using long term daily climate data daily rainfall maximum and minimum temperature and global solar radiation of 35 years from 1983 to 2018 n 13 149 retrieved from nasa power we then compared the deviation between the tav and amp calculated using the nasa power dataset and the tav and amp provided with the climate files from each experimental location to quantify the error associated with climate variables we calculated the normalised nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse from 0 to 1 nossent and bauwens 2012 and the concordance correlation coefficient ccc from 1 to 1 lawrence and lin 1989 ojeda et al 2017 between the two climate data sources using the scikit learn 10 10 github com scikit learn scikit learn module and numpy 11 11 numpy org python package 2 4 3 field experimental data integrity to check integrity of the observed data file crop soil measurements table s1 as a key step of the simulation configuration process before testing the model performance out of scope of this paper we i visually identified the outliers looking at the complete data set together using the plotly 12 12 plotly github io plotly py docs index html python graphing library and ii calculated summary statistics and the proportion of outliers for each measured variable table s1 soil water data were not considered in the outlier analysis since absolute values can have a completely different range of values accordingly to the soil type of the field experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate 3 1 1 visualising all model inputs together multi location analysis latitude and co2 concentration values were plotted to identify errors fig 3 allowed easy identification of errors associated with errant values of latitude and check the correct geographical position of each location the analysis of this data is important due to apsim uses latitude to calculate day length which could affect model processes related to photoperiod most experiments were configured with the apsim default co2 concentration 350 ppm however otc and face experiments obtained from the global field experiments for potato simulations raymundo et al 2018 were set up at co2 concentrations ranging from 350 ppm to 708 ppm these experiments belong to the changing climate and potential impact on potato yield and quality chip project de temmerman et al 2002 that investigated the effects of increasing atmospheric co2 on potato production across europe using the cultivar bintje the observed distribution of co2 concentration as indicated by fig 3 identified an error associated with the co2 setup of the model using the cultivar russet burbank in 1998 at giessen germany while the unique cultivar included in the chip project was bintje we found that a simulation was configured using the cultivar russet burbank with co2 concentration values higher than 350 ppm daily solar radiation and a theoretical maximum clear sky radiation q m a x calculated by the model were plotted together to check solar radiation data quality fig 4 q m a x is calculated from the day of the year latitude and vapour pressure thornton and running 1999 while daily solar radiation was q m a x for most locations it was q m a x at some locations e g lincoln and chertsey new zealand la molina peru and huhhot jining and zhalan china fig 4 highlighting the need to further scrutinize the met files from these locations san gabriel ecuador also showed an unusual pattern with many values clustered at very low values and this requires further scrutiny also fig 4 the methods used to generate climate data greatly affects their spatio temporal patterns for example the solar radiation pattern in australia was consistent between locations this is not surprising as these data sets were generated using the same interpolation approach kriging method to complete missing data at daily step jeffrey et al 2001 and never seems to go below a value for atmospheric transmissivity of about 25 however weather station measurements have days that go closer to zero similarly the solar radiation pattern in tylstrup denmark was extremely consistent across the year which could be explained due to this data could be estimated using the angtrom prescott model prescott 1940 based on sunshine hours i e heliophany fig 4 this highlights the need to carefully evaluate the methodologies applied to generate climate data before it can be inputted in crop models mean air annual temperature was calculated in the python script based on air minimum temperature and air maximum temperature generally the patterns of daily minimum and maximum temperatures during the growing season and mean annual temperature did not show outliers for any specific location fig 5 the yellow line in fig 5 shows the mean air temperature estimated from the data in the met file tav amp and latitude and shows good agreement with the pattern of observed data in most cases fig 5 there were also several locations where the sign of the estimated average temperature curve was the opposite of the observations identifying cases where the sign of the latitude in the met file was incorrect fig 6 was created by accumulating a count of rainfall days rainfall 0 against the accumulated daily fractional or relative radiation loss accrradnloss days accrradnloss was calculates as follows 1 accrradnloss d 1 d n q max radn q max where q m a x is the theoretical maximum clear sky radiation mj m 2 and radn mj m 2 is the total solar radiation accrradnloss is accumulated over days d from the start of the crop d 1 to the given day under consideration d n a slope 1 in fig 6 means for each day that rainfall occurs more than 1 day worth of radiation is lost this is possible for locations that encounter frequent dry cloud cover such as san gabriel ecuador and this explains the peculiar pattern of radiation noted lower slopes would be typical of areas where cloud forms and dissipates quickly before and after rainfall events branxholm australia is most notable in this respect with nearly 200 rain days but a 40 loss of potential radiation suggesting some rain and significant clear periods each day differences in slope are likely between locations but less likely for different seasons at the same location and the graph for lincoln new zealand highlights some seasons where the climate data is questionable and needs further checking fig 6 rainfall patterns were also checked plotting rainfall amount vs day of the year fig s2 in general there were not rainfall events higher than 125 mm for a given day 3 1 2 climate data verification using a standardised global dataset overall the accuracy between climate data from the met files climate data provided with the field experimental datasets used as model inputs and the nasa power data varied accordingly with the location and climate variable figs s3 s6 on average the nnse and ccc values between both data sources were higher for daily solar radiation nnse 0 60 ccc 0 63 daily maximum temperature nnse 0 58 ccc 0 58 and daily minimum temperature nnse 0 52 ccc 0 52 compared to daily rainfall nnse 0 45 ccc 0 31 table 3 the ccc ranged from 1 giessen germany sutton bonington england hasting united states to 0 02 koari toralapa bolivia for daily solar radiation from 0 96 hermiston united states to 0 07 la molina lima peru for daily maximum temperature from 0 96 suwanee united states to 0 02 kalengyere uganda belen bolivia for daily minimum temperature and from 0 87 huhhot china hastings united states to 0 02 kalangadoo australia belen bolivia for daily rainfall the range of statistical indicators table 3 indicated that the input climate for the model was collected and generated using different methods and approaches for example the analysis showed that daily solar radiation from the met files generated for model input were almost the same than the retrieved from nasa power for giessen germany sutton bonington england and hastings united states fig s3 which could be associated with the calculation method for this variable in both data sources and the percentage of interpolated climate data for each location duarte and sentelhas 2020 for example van wart et al 2015 highlighted that daily temperature data are often measured instrumentation to measure solar radiation is rare and there can be large gaps of missing data in recorded daily rainfall this raises a critical point commonly neglected when multi location model comparisons are carried out in the modelling community future crop modelling studies with multi environmental analysis should include a pre calibration test system to assess the quality of the climate input data before being inputted in the models in this study we focused on the quality control of the met files generated to run a crop model before model calibration or development there is a key limitation related with the spatial resolution of the standardised datasets used to conduct the quality control due to the difficulty of predicting the spatial variation of climate variables within a grid cell most standardised data products such as nasa power at a global scale or silo 13 13 www longpaddock qld gov au silo gridded data scientific information for land owners jeffrey et al 2001 and dailygridded xavier et al 2016 at country scale australia and brazil respectively offer daily values but they differ in their spatial resolution which brings uncertainties related with the spatial variability of the variable of analysis tozer et al 2012 therefore there is a need to provide detailed information about the errors associated with the up and down scaling of the climate inputs ojeda et al 2020 when climate data is collected from different locations to develop crop models the comparison between the tav and amp provided in the met files collected by each data provider and the tav and amp calculated with long term climate data from nasa power showed high deviations nnse 0 37 and ccc 0 47 for tav and nnse 0 6 and ccc 0 72 for amp fig 7 a and fig 7b associated with the number of daily observations included in the met file table s4 i e when the numbers of observations used to calculated the tav and amp was high the deviation was reduced fig 7c and fig 7d mainly for tav these differences are critical due to apsim uses tav and amp to estimate the average soil temperature by soil layer for each day of the year this reinforces the need to use standardised climate dataset to calculate both parameters tav and amp in future apsim studies where several locations are used to calibrate models 3 2 soil apsim uses a multi layer soil profile to simulate soil processes in each layer separately soil parameters for each soil layer were plotted by location and checked against the rest of the locations included in the test set the visualization assessment included model parameters associated with root exploration xf soil water dynamics ll dul and kl soluble inorganic n components nh4n and no3n and organic carbon fresh organic matter fom which contains roots from the previous crop and crop residues if they have been incorporated into the soil by tillage an example for lincoln new zealand is provided in fig 8 the complete set of soil configuration plots for all locations are provided in the supplementary material figs s7 s13 the methods used to set up the soil parameters across the soil profile differed with the location and experiment for most experiments the xf 0 1 was set to 1 at the first soil layer and then decreased exponentially to the bottom soil layer e g jokionen finland and toralapa bolivia fig s7 no clear methodology was identified to set up the maximum rooting depth although for some locations such as chertsey hastings palmerston north pukekohe ruakura temuka new zealand and coonawarra kalangadoo and mt benson australia impediments to crop rooting were considered on the other hand some experiments showed a constant value of xf 1 across the entire soil profile simplot dataset from australia e g latrobe fig s7 the inconsistencies to estimate this soil parameter could be explained because some users relate root intensity with xf rather than root front velocity ll is a soil specific parameter therefore it varied between locations and experiments at the same location e g sheffield and deloraine australia fig s8 we found differences in ll mainly in australian locations simplot datasets which are in tasmania fig s8 tasmania contains a diverse range of soil orders australian soil classification isbell 2016 due to variations in climate landscape and geology ojeda et al 2020 which reflects the high variability of ll and other soil parameters in these environments we also identified abrupt reductions e g from 0 1 to 0 01 mm 1 below 60 cm soil depth in coonawarra australia and increments e g from 0 059 to 0 455 mm 1 below 51 cm soil depth in westbury australia of ll values for specific locations below a given soil depth fig s8 previous studies have demonstrated that pawc is one of the most sensible inputs in crop models mensegue et al 2021 shelia et al 2018 and particularly in apsim ojeda et al 2020 2021b wu et al 2019 due to the soil profile has a characterization by layer soil depth and ll and dul values have a critical impact on the estimated pawc at a profile level in this study we were not able to compare the soil inputs reported by the field experiments with a global soil standardised dataset such as the harmonized world soil database 14 14 www fao org land water land land governance land resources planning toolbox category details en c 1028012 nachtergaele et al 2010 due to these databases provides soil texture information usually percentage of sand clay and silt which need to be converted to ll and dul to be inputted in apsim this conversion brings uncertainties related with the estimation method to do this conversion due to its dependence on the soil type e g differences in organic matter content and region saxton and rawls 2006 in addition the maximum soil depth for the standardised datasets is homogeneous across grid cells which is not the case for the reported soil profiles in the field experiments used in this study our results demonstrated that there is i a lack of documentation or large uncertainty in methods used to estimate soil parameters amongst data sources and ii a large amount of copying or guessing where soil parameters are not known 3 3 crop management crop management data used to set up the complete set of simulations is showed in fig 9 these plots identify outliers and irregularities associated with the crop management parameters used to create the simulations errors associated with crop management configuration were mainly related with units and names of variables incorrect dates typing errors and assumptions made by the data collector when data was not available for some experiments row spacing and row spacing were inverted in the substor dataset it was not clear whether row spacing was the distance between rows or between plants within rows we identified outliers of row spacing values for some locations fig 9 for example in san gabriel ecuador the row spacing was 1200 mm it was explained by a high variability of stolon elongation in the andean tropics that is related with row spacing in otc experiments chip project de temmerman et al 2002 the row spacing was less than 400 mm therefore the plant population was higher than 12 pl m 2 fig 9 a common human error was the use of different units to set up the model for instance planting depth was entered in cm when the model needed mm for some australian experiments simplot dataset from commercial fields plant population should be 6 but 20 was entered in the model we also found inconsistencies associated with data sources the level of detail and quality of field observations for example for australia we used two main data sources field experiments from research organisations e g universities and commercial fields from industry simplot dataset table 1 the industry database is a large yield dataset of potato available but it does not include descriptions of irrigation regimes we were uncertain if these trials were even irrigated and if so how much therefore an on farm average irrigation management for these experiments was applied personal communication from farm advisors and agronomists to interpret our results in the future this assumption needs to be considered if data about irrigation regime is available at farm level obtaining irrigation datasets from commercial fields will be key to increase the values of these datasets and to supporting model developments 3 4 measured observed variables the scrutinisation of observed field data is a critical step during simulation configuration before calculating the prediction error comparison between observed and simulated data thorburn 2017 due to the presence of anomalies in the data can create noise during the model development several studies have highlighted the need to quantify the error associated with observed data during model calibration confalonieri et al 2016a 2016b our observed dataset presented 1 25 of outliers table 4 crop cover total tuber live n concentration and specific leaf area showed the maximum number of outliers 8 02 5 06 and 3 05 respectively fig 10 table 4 this could be related with the methodologies used to measure crop cover e g use of different devices in the field and to estimate tuber live n concentration and specific leaf area the latter two variables have an implicit uncertainty because they are calculated as derivatives from other variables from tuber weight for tuber live n concentration and from leaf weight and size for specific leaf area although it is relatively low percentage of outliers for such big field experimental dataset it is critical to calculate and identify the number and reason of outliers for data curation before testing the model performance as a critical step in the model development this is required to reduce the uncertainties related with anomalies on data collation and methods used to record field experimental data 4 concluding remarks sources of error were identified in the whole simulation configuration process associated with climate soil management records and observed crop soil data table 5 our results demonstrated that standard criteria are required to identify and quantify the uncertainties associated with input data and field observations during simulation configuration in this study we presented several approaches to assess the quality of the simulation configuration process i quality control analysis based on a standardised climate dataset ii outlier identification and iii a palette of visualization tools we identified and quantified the errors discussed their main drivers and sources and proposed recommendations for future studies upcoming modelling studies need to focus on the definition of predefined criteria to identify outliers and errors on simulation configuration processes before any model calibration or development is conducted this will allow model user to discriminate the weight of this errors on model outputs there were several studies that used substantial observed datasets across many cultivar environmental and crop management combinations to test crop model performance brown et al 2018a ojeda et al 2018 2017 2016 raymundo et al 2017 as far as we are aware this study is one of the first to explicitly describe the cause of error during a simulation configuration process as a key preparatory step before model development the approach presented here moved the bulk of the effort from fitting model processes to setting up broad simulation configuration testing and detailed interrogation to identify current gaps for further model development this highlights the importance of high levels of rigour for configuring test sets and thorough consideration of the model performance so that subsequent model development can be effectively targeted we also found weaknesses in the presented methodology although our approach was applied to a single crop potato and using a specific crop model apsim it is applicable to other crops and crop models future research will be also required to automatically implement the approaches presented here

24557,modelling species across vast distributions in remote high mountain regions like the himalayas remains a challenging task challenges include first and foremost large scale sampling of species occurrences and acquisition of sufficient high quality fine scale environmental parameters we compiled a review of 157 himalayan studies published between 2010 and 2021 aiming at identifying their main modelling objective in relation to the conceptualization of their methodological framework evaluating origin of species occurrence data taxonomic groups spatial and temporal scale selection of predictor variables and applied modelling algorithms the majority of the analysed studies 40 attempted to answer questions about potential range changes under future or past climatic conditions the most studied organisms were trees 27 followed by mammals 22 herbaceous plants 20 and birds 9 for almost all studies we noted that a critical investigation and evaluation of input parameters and their ability to account for the species ecological requirements were neglected over 87 of all studies used worldclim climate data as predictor variables while around 50 of these studies solely relied on worldclim climate data climate data from other sources were incorporated in only 7 and an additional 6 solely used remotely sensed predictors only around 2 of all studies attempted to compare the influence of different climate data sources on model performance by far maxent was the most used modelling algorithm with 66 followed by ensemble approaches 16 whereas statistical modelling techniques lagged far behind 9 surprisingly we found in 37 of the studies no interpretation on the relationship between the species and the predictor variables while 27 of all studies included brief information and 36 provided an elaborate detailed interpretation on species ecological needs reflected in the final model with this review we highlight the necessity to identify and reduce biases and uncertainty associated with species occurrence records and environmental data a priori since flawed input parameters produce misleading models without ecological causality their implementation may have detrimental consequences when the best possible adaptation to future climatic conditions is at stake keywords ecological niche models evaluation input parameters high elevation habitats model challenges model comparison modelling mountain species 1 introduction 1 1 modelling species in mountain ecosystems mountain ecosystems are characterized by distinct three dimensional geo ecological differentiation complex topography and a pronounced small scale variation of climatic and edaphic conditions resulting in numerous ecological niches and often representing biodiversity hotspots körner et al 2017 körner 2021 compared to most lowland regions of the world mountain regions have been less transformed by human impact schickhoff 2011 however anthropogenic interferences are ubiquitous and for instance in old world mountain regions near natural treeline sites can hardly be found schickhoff et al 2015 in the course of past climate changes mountain ranges provided refugia for species persistence and biodiversity preservation and even greater importance could be attached to these refugia in future birks willis 2008 malanson et al 2019 progress in remote sensing techniques geographic information systems and modelling techniques shaped modern scientific research on species inhabiting high mountain ecosystems ever since abiotic and biotic factors and processes controlling spatial and temporal species patterns and dynamics have been investigated across mountain ecosystems worldwide pauli halloy 2019 körner 2021 with the combination of results from different disciplines i e ecology vegetation science biogeography environmental sciences and geosciences researchers aim to differentiate disentangle and understand underlying factors controlling current distribution species ranges and compositions to derive forecasts under climate change scenarios franklin 2010 to quantify these effects and identify the drivers species distribution models sdms have become an indispensable tool these correlative modelling approaches are now very popular when it comes to predicting past current and future distribution of species in mountains all over the world e g dullinger et al 2004 thuiller et al 2005 parolo et al 2008 the growing number of publications employing sdms can be attributed to freely accessible databases of species occurrence or abundance records and high resolution environmental data as well as user friendly statistic and gis software to date sdms have become an umbrella term comprising a variety of concepts including species distribution ecological niche habitat suitability habitat preference and climatic envelope models guisan et al 2017 zurell et al 2020 even if this fusion initially sounds reasonable differences between modelling aims interpretation and associated challenges exist soberón nakamura 2009 peterson soberón 2012 peterson et al 2015 guisan et al 2017 however an overarching characteristic of all species distribution modelling approaches are analyses of the underlying environmental factors in relation to the species ecology which in turn constitutes a basic requirement for understanding current past and future species distribution ranges most frequently climatic factors among other abiotic and sometimes biotic parameters are used to estimate species niches and distributions across space and time elith leathwick 2009 irrespective of the model aim of inter or extrapolation understanding of the phenomena of the species occurrences is a precondition to formalize a model and make predictions that hold predictive capability the general interest in understanding underlying factors of species ranges and dynamics as well as forecasting and hindcasting species niches their distribution and composition has increased during the last decades schickhoff 2005 miehe et al 2007 telwala et al 2013 dutta et al 2014 schickhoff et al 2015 holtmeier broll 2019 bobrowski 2021 whereas climate change impacts on european and north american mountain regions are well studied e g theurillat guisan 2001 bell et al 2014 braunisch et al 2016 halofsky et al 2018 scherrer et al 2020 one of the major mountain systems of the world the himalayas is still comparatively under researched over the last decade numerous modelling studies have been published however no review on modelling studies across taxonomic groups exists to date for the himalayan mountain system 1 2 challenges for modelling species in the himalayas modelling ecological niches and species distributions across vast areas in remote high mountain regions like the himalayas constitute a challenging task the main challenges arise from large scale sampling of species occurrences and in rare cases absences and acquisition of sufficient high quality fine scale environmental predictors sampling deficits can be primarily attributed to the difficult accessibility of the terrain and the geographical extent of the himalayan mountain system however the quality and quantity of occurrence data determine the significance of the model the basic assumption of the model is based on uniform or random sampling of the study area royle et al 2012 the selection of an appropriate predictor variable set depends not only on the availability of high quality environmental data but also on the spatial scale the autecology of the species and the degree of complexity of the ecological niche peterson et al 2011 the understanding of the relationship between species specific ecological constraints and its geographic distribution is the key aspect in selecting relevant and meaningful predictor variables if neglected the gap between ecology and model performance could be broadened in favour of high model performance metrics with decreasing real model accuracy and limited ecological explanation of habitat requirements of the species being provided synes osborne 2011 thibaud et al 2014 petitpierre et al 2017 santini et al 2021 this gap could be further widened by the unmindful usage of evaluation metrics like the auc lobo et al 2008 and when these models serve as a baseline for future projections recent general modelling research focussed on quality and quantity of input data such as the number of occurrences in relation to extent and number of generated absences elith et al 2011 barbet massin et al 2012 spatial structure of occurrence data fithian et al 2015 multi collinearity of predictors and spatial autocorrelation of species distributional data braunisch et al 2013 dormann et al 2007 2013 a wide range of publications addressed the effect of choice of modelling algorithm on model performance elith et al 2006 franklin 2010 saupe et al 2012 and compared different evaluation criteria on model performance and projection allouche et al 2006 lobo et al 2008 in this review we do not focus on aforementioned well studied topics but rather concentrate on the rarely considered challenges of high quality input data and the significance of results when modelling species in the himalayas this review aims at addressing key questions related to species occurrence data acquisition and reliable climate data for modelling species in the himalayas we highlight potential challenges identify gaps in modelling studies point out noteworthy trends in the field and summarize recent modelling studies with respect to quality and quantity of input parameters applied model methodology and consideration of the species specific ecological characteristics we aim at pointing out expedient avenues to integrate mechanistic understanding and empirical data for future modelling studies in the himalayan mountain system overcoming the input parameter challenges synthesized in this review will support catalysing advances in ecological models in the himalayas 2 literature review 2 1 literature search to grasp the on going trend of modelling studies in the himalayas using modern sdm techniques we conducted a literature search in web of knowledge und applied the following search strings species distribution model himalaya ecological niche model himalaya habitat suitability model himalaya habitat distribution model himalaya and climatic envelope model himalaya to find publications of the last ten years i e 2010 and today last access march 2021 for each publication the authors names year of publication study region and the following information specified below were extracted all figures were created using ggplot2 wickham 2016 in the programming language r r core team 2020 2 2 aim of the reviewed studies we classified each study according to their modelling aim in current distribution range shifts under future or past climate conditions invasion of species and species phylogeny additionally we noted which modelling approach was used and subsequently evaluated whether proposed research questions were aligned with the applied concept and terminology 2 3 extent of analyses and species occurrence data for each study the extent of the studied region was classified as i micro scale where only small spatial scales at district level were investigated ii meso scale for one country and iii macro scale when the whole himalayan mountain system was analysed additionally we noted all sources of occurrence data and how many occurrences were used in the modelling procedure 2 4 source and selection of environmental data we registered all sources of environmental data and how the predictor variables were selected e g based on statistics and ecology additionally we noted whether different sources of environmental data were compared according to data quality and plausibility 2 5 modelling technique and evaluation because most of the studies applied correlative models we further classified them according to the modelling algorithm e g statistical machine learning similarity and expert rule based mechanistic and process based models were not further considered to account for model accuracy we compiled evaluation metrics e g auc tss kappa r2 3 results discussion 3 1 literature search the literature search strings yielded 567 publications for the period 2010 2021 after removing duplicate publications and publications that applied other methodological frameworks e g dendro ecology genetics regeneration and non empirical modelling approaches 157 publications were used for further analyses we limited our literature search to the collections of web of knowledge to allow for reproducible results all reviewed studies are listed in the supplementary material of this review 3 2 aim of the reviewed studies irrespective of taxa modelling potential range shifts expansion or contraction had the highest proportion with 40 the second most frequent research aim was modelling species current distribution 33 followed by studies where the phylogeny of species was considered to hindcast and or forecast their distributional region 20 considerably less studies attempted to model the potential of invasive species 7 among all analysed studies tree species were the most popular study organism with 27 followed by mammals 22 herbaceous species 20 and birds 9 tab 1 out of all analysed studies 72 focussed on one single species and the remaining 18 addressed multiple species in single species models the review on applied methodological concepts revealed diverging usage regarding the methodology and terminology between sdms and ecological niche models enms whereas 47 used the term sdm 33 enm and 10 referred to both terms an additional 4 of the reviewed studies used the terminology of habitat suitability models hsm and further 6 did not label their approach at all although enm or sdm concepts were applied we included habitat models n 2 in the category sdms and climatic envelope models n 2 in the category of enms generally in sdms it is attempted to model the actual distribution of species in geographic space peterson soberón 2012 whereas enms can be projected in geographic space and time identifying consistent areas with suitable environmental conditions for the species and assessing distributional changes under past or future climate conditions araújo guisan 2006 peterson soberón 2012 it becomes obvious that whenever species potential distributional range shifts are modelled under future or past climate conditions it refers to the conceptual framework of enms however in 73 of the analysed studies using sdm terminology potential range shifts under future or past climatic conditions were modelled even if studies use the collective term sdm the underlying conceptual methodological framework of distribution estimation or niche quantification should always be taken into consideration in order to allow a clear distinction between approaches which will in turn facilitate a consistent interpretation of the results of modelling studies in the himalayas 3 3 extent of analyses the extent of the study area varied greatly from local studies to studies covering the entire himalayan arc and adjacent mountains fig 1 overall 60 of all analysed studies modelled species at local to meso scales whereas 40 operated at macro scales i e along the himalayan arc himalaya hengduan mountains hindukush karakorum himalayas sino himalayas in particular 31 of the studies covered the indian himalayas namely jammu and kashmir ladakh himachal pradesh uttarakhand and sikkim followed by studies extending over the entire himalayan arc 17 and nepal 15 3 4 source of occurrences especially in vast mountain systems like the himalayas sampling species presence and absence locations is limited due to time and financial constraints therefore presence only data was most often used the origin of occurrence data can be separated into directly measured data in the field and collected data bundled in databases herbaria museums and publications fig 2 we found that occurrence data used for modelling the target species were most frequently recorded directly in the field 37 and in several studies accompanied with different sources of collections 10 besides other sources field survey data were supplemented with information from databases 15 and very frequently with data from the global biodiversity information facility gbif https gbif org a platform that hosts freely available species occurrence data covering the entire globe for the himalayan mountain system we found gbif data and combinations with other sources in 19 of the studies for 19 of all studies other database mostly local databases herbaria museums or literature were used to gather information on species locations it was common to combine different sources of species data when large regions were studied whereas solely field survey data or field survey data and additional sources were chosen when local scales were targeted out of 157 studies 139 provided information on number of occurrences used in the final model with large variation in sample sizes among studies compared to number of occurrences sampled in the field mean 80 combinations of different sources resulted in higher number of occurrences in particular when field data literature records and databases were utilized mean 150 when field data were accompanied with gbif data and additional sources a mean of 246 occurrences records were compiled outstanding high average numbers were found when occurrence data was compiled from combinations of gbif with miscellaneous databases local and national herbaria and relevant literature mean 631 for other sources local databases means of occurrences records were comparatively low despite mean records for virtual herbaria and databases resulting in an overall median of 128 occurrence records besides data quantity data quality plays a major role in generating a valuable occurrence data set of mountain species one arising challenge of data derived from existing databases is the consideration of geospatial errors as a precondition to account for sampling errors meyer et al 2016 feng et al 2019 compared to planned systematic field surveys the true error measure remains unknown beck et al 2013 2014 misidentification duplicate records sampling design and purpose oversampling of certain areas and spatial clustering of species constitute possible sources of uncertainty especially in high elevation regions spatial bias leads to environmental bias because of the over representation of certain environmental features of more accessible and extensively surveyed areas kramer schadt et al 2013 furthermore spatial clumping may result in spatial autocorrelation and can reduce the model quality by falsely inflating measures of accuracy veloz 2009 resulting in higher commission error rates dormann et al 2008 furthermore the model may yield misleading parameter estimates kühn 2007 allocating predictor variables that simply reflect the intensively studied area further resulting in spatial extrapolation errors kramer schadt et al 2013 nevertheless in cases of large scale study areas and difficult accessibility of the terrain databases provide a cost and time effective tool however to obtain valuable modelling results in high mountain regions the data have to be thoroughly examined furthermore the compilation of different sources such as databases museums herbaria and species lists national atlases large scale field surveys regional checklists expert range maps and collections from citizen science groups may be beneficial to compose a large dataset jetz et al 2012 especially if the number of occurrences is limited the distributional range covering the environmental gradients of the species occurrences has to be reflected in the data set fei yu 2016 since biased occurrence data lead to biased models generally studies agreed that sampling size especially for n 100 has significant effects on model quality followed by the applied modelling algorithm thibaud et al 2014 soultan safi 2017 meynard et al 2019 for example if species records are clustered in lower more accessible parts of the study area unlike its natural distribution it is highly suspected that the model will show deviated results and predictions of erroneously main distribution range of the target species yackulic et al 2013 fithian et al 2015 furthermore azonal observations e g at both lower and higher elevations should be removed to obtain valuable modelling results of the species niche in the target region e g treeline locations bobrowski et al 2017 when the applied species prevalence is not in accordance with the actual distribution it results in biased assumption on environmental distributional constraints pearson et al 2006a moreover model performance metrics are more dependent on correctly predicting absences than occurrences tessarolo et al 2021 furthermore distortion of models under current climate conditions will subsequently lead to untrustworthy model projections under future climate conditions bobrowski schickhoff 2017 another major pitfall arises when spatial autocorrelation and spatial filtering are wrongly equated with each other sillero barbosa 2021 autocorrelation is essential for modelling as it captures relationships between locations dormann et al 2007 nonetheless it causes biases when evaluating model performance de oliveira et al 2014 in addition spatial autocorrelation between training and testing data peterson soberón 2012 and model residuals de oliveira et al 2014 should be obviated therefore extensive care has to be taken to filter and select the occurrence that will provide the basis for the following model procedure veloz 2009 in mountain regions applying methods like block cross validation procedures to reduce spatial autocorrelation valavi et al 2019 or using autocorrelation prone modelling algorithms provide valuable solutions kramer schadt et al 2013 most modelling algorithms require presence absence data which were not available in most of the reviewed studies besides different pseudo absence generation methods in case of maxent background data phillips et al 2006 the number of recommended pseudo absences depends on the intended modelling algorithm and study sample barbet massin et al 2012 phillips dudík 2008 however model and sample specific requirements are often disregarded in ensemble modelling approaches by fitting all models on the same data set santini et al 2021 3 5 source of environmental data in general 42 of all analysed studies purely relied on one climate data source the remaining 58 of the studies incorporated in addition to climate data mainly remotely sensed predictors with digital elevation models dem and land cover being the most prominent predictor variables in 79 of the analysed studies worldclim 1 4 was utilized in nearly half of these studies no additional predictor variables were incorporated fig 3 among freely available relatively fine scale i e 1 1 km long term climate raster data set with global coverage worldclim 1 4 hijmans et al 2005 is the most frequently used source of climatic variables in sdm and enm studies with 12400 citations in web of knowledge core collection march 2021 especially in europe and north america worldclim shows high accuracy hijmans et al 2005 and is used in numerous biogeographical studies elith et al 2006 hijmans graham 2006 broennimann et al 2012 thibaud et al 2014 in 2017 a new worldclim climate data set was launched fick hijmans 2017 which extends the former version of worldclim 1 4 hijmans et al 2005 by incorporating remotely sensed data as covariates and independent spline variables in the interpolation fick hijmans 2017 in 6 of the studies worldclim 2 was used and in 2 worldclim 1 4 and 2 were combined fig 3 climond which is based on worldclim and cru cl1 0 and cl2 0 data new et al 1999 2002 and exhibits a spatial resolution of 50 by 50 km kriticos et al 2012 was represented in 3 of all studies and used mostly without additional predictor variables modellers predominantly use worldclim however the recently published climate data set chelsa karger et al 2016 2017 offers relatively fine scale i e 1 1 km long term climate raster data set with global coverage and enjoys growing popularity in the himalayas e g bobrowski et al 2017 2018 gilani et al 2020 studies which used chelsa always incorporated additional predictor variables i e dem remotely sensed land cover and land surface temperature lst worldwide only very few researchers attempted to compare the effect of different climate data sets on model performance e g soria auza et al 2010 bedia et al 2013 fernández et al 2013 deblauwe et al 2016 bobrowski schickhoff 2017 suwal et al 2018 datta et al 2020 and only recently first studies for himalayan species were conducted our review revealed only 3 studies attempting to compare the effect of chelsa and worldclim climate data on model performance in the himalayas bobrowski schickhoff 2017 suwal et al 2018 datta et al 2020 predictor variables solely obtained from remote sensing products were used in 6 of the studies studies incorporating solely remotely sensed data e g land cover and lst provided valuable results to describe habitat suitability of mammal species singh kushwaha 2011 bashir et al 2014 2018 qian et al 2014 bhattacharyya et al 2015 2020 paudel et al 2015 khan et al 2016 thinley et al 2019 measured data from climate stations were rarely used 1 in the analysed studies both the temporal and the spatial resolution are highly significant to account for the environmental heterogeneity of mountain regions in the literature reviewed here most of the studies 93 were based on seasonally averaged climate data and 62 of all studies used environmental predictor variables with 1 1 km raster grid cells in 18 of all studies raster at 5 5 km cell size were utilized which might conceal fine scale information of the underlying terrain furthermore in 8 of the studies environmental raster at 10 18 and 340 km² resolution were used as predictor variables respectively in contrast other studies 6 resampled 1 km² grid cell of climate raster to higher resolution e g 20 30 90 250 340 m² simulating artificial high resolution of climate data while 5 of the studies incorporating predictors solely obtained from remote sensing data showed higher resolution e g 30 90 m² grid cell size although this misfit resolution has been widely recognized and described in many high elevation studies when capturing spatio temporal variability in microclimate the use of fine scale environmental data sets 1 km² grid cell size is rather the exception zischg et al 2019 published a high resolution map of climatological indices with a spatial resolution of 25 25 m for the european alps emphasizing the need for expert knowledge in parameter computation shrestha and bawa 2014 emphasized the need for high resolution environmental data that capture microclimates edaphic conditions vegetation dynamics and landscape heterogeneity and kollas et al 2014 also emphasized the use of high spatial resolution temperature data for predictive modelling of temperature based niche envelopes with a resolution of less than 100 m to demonstrate the mechanistic links between species occurrences and the prevailing climatic conditions and consequently enable robust model predictions of biological responses to changing climatic conditions estimates of climate at high spatial and temporal resolution are needed for mountain regions lenoir et al 2017 maclean 2020 3 6 selections of predictor variables the selection of predictor variables represents an essential step as they have to capture species distributional constraints and reflect species eco physiological tolerances and requirements guisan zimmermann 2000 austin 2002 jarnevich et al 2015 selection methods can be subdivided into ecological and statistical approaches with predictors being chosen based either on species specific ecological requirements or on statistical variable selection methods fig 4 overall the majority of studies relied on statistical selection approaches 62 while ecologically based approaches were less applied 23 surprisingly 15 of all analysed studies disclosed no information on how predictor variables were selected to model the ecological niche or distribution this in turn often leads to ambiguity when trying to interpret model predictions in most modelling studies predictor variable selection was solely based on pearson 30 or spearman 5 correlation coefficients to remove highly correlated variables whereas the coefficients ranged between r 0 6 and 0 9 it has been generally proposed that a correlation coefficient r 0 7 detects collinearity among variables dormann et al 2013 further statistical selection approaches comprised combinations of correlations with resampling methods like the jackknife technique 5 variance inflation factor analysis vif 3 or principal component analysis pca 3 in 13 of the studies predictor variable selection were either based on the species ecological requirements or on combinations of ecology and correlations after pearson and spearman respectively in 3 of the studies the species ecology in the variable selection procedure was considered by information retrieved from published literature when modelling species niches or distributions variable selection should lead to a set of predictors that include variables which affect the species directly rather than indirectly guisan zimmermann 2000 furthermore these variables can be sorted by the degree of causality of species responses to environmental factors in proximal i e direct response of the species such as cold temperatures during growing season limiting plant growth and distal responses i e indirect response of the species such as mean annual temperature austin 2002 peterson et al 2011 santini et al 2021 noted the on going trend to use automatic procedures e g vif to exclude collinear variables irrespective of species specific requirements e g manish pandit 2019 to compile an appropriate predictor variable set the ecology of the species should be considered however the model assumption regarding uncorrelated predictor variables should not be violated dormann et al 2013 the usage of modelling approaches handling collinearity such as bioclim nix 1986 enfa hirzel et al 2002 and mahalanobis distance clark et al 1993 represents another option recently the robustness of maxent in terms of collinearity based on empirical data has been discussed see feng et al 2019 for a detailed discussion model performance is highly dependent on input parameter quality consisting of species data and predictor variables e g fernández et al 2013 syfert et al 2013 varela et al 2014 feng et al 2019 explicit knowledge on specific ecological requirements must be available to select relevant high qualitative environmental predictors austin 2002 baker et al 2016 2017 mod et al 2016 descombes et al 2020 santini et al 2021 model quality could be improved by selecting relevant model variables accounting for functional relationships among dependent and independent variables and in parameter estimates houlahan et al 2017 with predictions on anthropogenically induced climate change effects on species and their habitats clark et al 2001 a shift from explanatory models to anticipatory models has been proposed mouquet et al 2015 yates et al 2018 anticipatory models assume that underlying hypotheses are valid while explanatory models are based on hypotheses to be tested with specificities often being overlooked in both prediction approaches mouquet et al 2015 this circumstance may lead to a gap between solid theoretical knowledge of ecological systems and their drivers i e cause effect mechanisms and prediction abilities may lead to vague assumptions when not correctly interpreting the outcomes and communicating their limitations mouquet et al 2015 schuwirth et al 2019 modelling species niches and predicting their potential habitats should be demonstrating understanding of ecological drivers and not acquiring the ecology houlahan et al 2017 a profound understanding of mechanistic processes related to the system and study organism is a precondition to develop models for mountain species with ecological significance although this point seems self evident we only found in 36 of all studies an elaborate detailed interpretation on species ecological needs reflected in the final model and in 27 at least a brief discussion however in 37 of the analysed studies no interpretation on the relationship between the species and the predictor variables was given this may be attributed to the misleading trends of models showing high discrimination accuracy and good predictive ability although they include ecologically not meaningful variables which in turn impedes plausible interpretations fourcade et al 2018 warren et al 2020 santini et al 2021 another explanation of the rather high proportion of analysed studies that implied no reference to species specific requirements could be to the narrow corset of the bioclimatic predictor variables on the one hand they generally reflect monthly and seasonal trends in temperature and precipitation to allow direct comparison among studies but on the other might not contain needed variables that define the ecological niche or the actual distribution of the target species over all analysed studies customized variables e g pre monsoonal drought stress were rarely used but could easily be calculated from average monthly climate data bobrowski et al 2017 further tailored predictor variables obtained from remotely sensed topography land cover and phenological traits may result in a more constrained predicted niche compared to solely climate based models bobrowski et al 2018 to reduce the gap between potential and actual distributions the potential of remotely sensed data to model species over vast remote and heterogeneous mountain regions has been emphasised he et al 2015 in our review we found promising applications of remotely sensed land cover products as predictor variables in studies on animals plants and phylogeny ray et al 2011 forrest et al 2012 yang et al 2013 qian et al 2014 dunn et al 2015 paudel et al 2015 khan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 bobrowski et al 2018 chhetri et al 2018a lamsal et al 2018 he et al 2019 kanagaraj et al 2019 litvinchuk et al 2019 panthi et al 2019 rathore et al 2019 shankhwar et al 2019 bhandari et al 2020 bhattacharya et al 2020 li et al 2020 lu et al 2020 singh et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the usage of dems provides another example of remotely sensed information which was included in 46 of the studies particularly the often utilized variable altitude which serves as a proxy for the prevailing climatic conditions constitutes the ecologically less valuable predictor variable compared to temperature derivates this mismatch can be attributed to the fact that species do not respond directly to elevation but to changes in temperature and other climatic parameters which are affected by elevation peterson et al 2011 furthermore when modelling future range shifts temperature values are likely to change whereas elevation will not and thus contains limited ecological explanation additionally when transferring modelling results to other regions e g for invasive species elevation and related temperature will vary at different latitudes jarnevich et al 2015 chhetri et al 2018b concluded that although elevation may not be directly associated with plant physiology it represents a strong indicator of climatic variables that influence physiology as a consequence variable influence of other temperature related variables may be subsequently blurred as an indirect variable elevation provides a good surrogate for temperature and latitudinal ranges but may be misleading across broader areas peterson et al 2011 3 7 modelling technique and evaluation compared to mechanistic and process based models correlative models are most commonly used to model species distributional ranges across space and time this approach defines the niche based on the assumption that the observed current distribution of a species reflects the species ecological requirements kearney porter 2009 kearney et al 2010 and less than the full fundamental niche is captured since biotic interactions and movement components are not distinguishable peterson et al 2011 all reviewed studies applied correlative modelling techniques which can be separated into statistical machine learning similarity and expert rules based algorithms the vast majority of studies 66 applied the model algorithm maxent which is a machine learning approach philips et al 2006 fig 5 the maxent algorithm can handle presence only data with generated background data to estimate target probability distribution by finding the probability distribution of maximum entropy phillips et al 2006 phillips 2008 another main reason for the popularity of maxent 7700 citations in web of knowledge core collection march 2021 may be traced back to the graphical user interface of the freely available java software that is easy to use for modelers without statistical knowledge required for detailed tuning phillips dudík 2008 furthermore maxent shows high predictive performance elith et al 2006 especially with low sample sizes pearson et al 2006b only recently it became available as a r package maxnet phillips et al 2017 providing options for community extensions and contributions despite its popularity recent publications revealed difficult interpretability and poorly grounded ecological theory of the models e g background point selection highly complex response curves large predictor variable sets and negligence of modelled relationships halvorsen 2013 yackulic et al 2013 vollering et al 2019 sillero barbosa 2021 often maxent models are run on the default parameter setting resulting in countless potential issues yackulic et al 2013 fourcade et al 2018 especially for studies claiming to model the relationship between species occurrences and the environment or projections across space and time these circumstances can be challenging halvorsen 2012 vollering et al 2019 almost all studies reviewed here using the maxent algorithm relied on the default settings without customizing according to their research target to combat caveats of single modelling algorithms and to create more robust predictions ensemble modelling approaches are frequently used in ecological modelling studies we found 16 of all analysed studies using ensembles of multiple algorithms the rising number of publications with ensemble models may be attributable to r package biomod2 thuiller et al 2009 whereas pros and cons are discussed in the literature whether ensemble models are outperforming single algorithms araujo new 2007 marmion et al 2009 dormann et al 2018 hao et al 2019 furthermore 4 of the analysed studies applied generalized linear models glm and 4 compared different modelling algorithms according to their performance to evaluate model performance several threshold independent and dependent evaluation criteria have been established fig 5 however no universal model evaluation criteria exist in this review most studies 63 referred to the area under the curve auc to examine model performance followed by 10 of the studies using two evaluation criteria auc and true skill statistics tss out of all studies 6 combined auc tss and cohen s kappa to account for model performance whereas 6 provided no information on model evaluation although the auc as an exclusive evaluation metric for model performance has come under criticism for an extensive discussion see lobo et al 2008 warren seifert 2011 it is still frequently applied without reservations to report model performance in ecological modelling studies in particular in the himalayas the most severe limitation of this metric is that it is only valid and useful for comparisons among models for a single study species in a single study region peterson et al 2011 3 8 perspectives for future research in remote high elevation regions as most modelling algorithms require presence and absence data wrong occurrences influence the selection of pseudo absences regardless of selection method albeit numerous studies have proven the effect of presence absence data on model accuracy and prediction quality brotons et al 2004 elith leathwick 2009 presence only data are mainly used in modelling procedures especially in regions with a heterogenous terrain like the himalayas sampling species which are distributed along the entire himalayan arc is in most cases not feasible however high quality presence data sets present a valuable option since a presence observation is the result of at least two multi factor processes peterson et al 2011 first the species was observed in a location which exhibits abiotically suitable conditions i e the fundamental niche and is influenced by biotic interactions i e the realized niche according to its movement abilities e g dispersal over space and time secondly the species was collected with certain collection intentions according to its detection abilities i e the species visibility and terrain accessibility in summary presence only data represent estimate indices of relative suitability peterson et al 2011 for local studies however it may be possible to sample species with planned field surveys or even systematic field campaigns for presence absence data sets for macro scale studies covering the entire himalayan mountain system the reliability of species occurrences records obtained from databases could be validated with remotely sensed products he et al 2015 in singh et al 2013 the current alpine treeline ecotone boundary was validated with remote sensing data while bobrowski et al 2018 extracted betula utilis occurrences from satellite images via google earth which were validated by expert knowledge obtained on the basis of many field campaigns and photo documentary of betula sites this method has proven to produce large and high quality datasets at other treeline locations paulsen körner 2014 irl et al 2015 the incorporation of remote sensing data allows to include locations that are remote or hardly accessible such locations are often less disturbed or even undisturbed by anthropogenic influences irl et al 2015 one further advantage of remote sensing data when plants are in focus could be the generation of presence absence data sets by using vegetation classification he et al 2009 2015 in high elevation ecosystems the distinct vegetation zonation with different spectral signals provides an ideal starting point for vegetation classifications to compile a high quality presence absence data set this approach is particularly promising for broadleaved deciduous tree species like betula since phenological traits from adjacent vegetation types which consist mainly of evergreen coniferous and evergreen broadleaved species in the tree layer allow a clear separation in the course of the year bobrowski et al 2018 in many publications basic information on applied climate data sets e g access meta data time span versions data type is not sufficient to allow reproducibility and transparency morueta holme et al 2018 although extensive care is taken in selecting uncorrelated predictor variables differences between available current climate datasets remain largely out of focus for the himalayas and most studies do not critically scrutinize the origin of climate data computation or measurement methods and neglect potential drawbacks and afflicted errors especially in topographically heterogeneous landscapes global climate datasets often do not account for local climatic conditions due to their quantitatively limited weather station density computation method and relatively coarse resolution 1 km bobrowski et al 2021 often it is taken for granted that data available at global scale show equally high quality throughout all regions however the premature use of such data may in turn lead to erroneous models and flawed predictions especially for projections under future climate conditions the need for comparative studies of model performance using different climate data sets have gained interest over the last few years e g heikkinen et al 2006 kriticos et al 2012 watling et al 2014 stoklosa et al 2015 wang et al 2016 baker et al 2016 2017 however effects of different climate data sets on model performance remains largely out of focus for the himalayan mountains bobrowski schickhoff 2017 suwal et al 2018 datta et al 2020 comparison and evaluation of climate data set quality is seldomly considered with potentially severe consequences for range shifts under climate change scenarios baker et al 2016 2017 model uncertainty was found to be related to topographic heterogeneity inter annual variability and distance to the closest climate station fernández et al 2013 depending on spatial and temporal scales global climate datasets like chelsa and worldclim lack precision of local temperature patterns and precipitation regimes of the himalayas and thus may contain flawed climate estimates used in sdm studies bobrowski et al 2021 although climate is not the exclusive factor delimiting species distributions in the himalayas it is an indispensable prerequisite as species occurrences and their dynamics in high elevation habitats are governed by low temperatures and local precipitation regimes bobrowski et al 2021 new opportunities for analysing and modelling species distributions in the himalayas could be derived by incorporating abiotic and biotic data derived from remote sensing since they provide response and predictor variables namely presence absence data sets and tailored environmental data sets e g solar radiation precipitation amounts and snow cover bobrowski et al 2018 he et al 2015 bobrowski 2021 additionally remotely sensed variables are continuous observations without interpolation and geographical bias and therefore with less uncertainty he et al 2015 recent studies have revealed how remotely sensed lst data could improve species distribution modelling studies e g buermann et al 2008 bisrat et al 2012 still et al 2013 bobrowski et al 2018 as time series data of vegetation characteristics i e phenological metrics are becoming more and more readily available changing habitat suitability can be estimated and incorporated into model approaches remote sensing data may lead to refined modelled distributions since they are based on real information of the earth s surface and account for non climatic dimensions i e anthropogenic impacts leading in turn to a more realistic actual distribution the main advantages of high resolution remote sensing data for mountainous areas are the acquisition of climate data at high resolution i e 1 km for differentiation between north and south facing slopes which would in turn lead to more precise modelling results recently numerous studies have been published to promote comparison reproducibility transparency and protocols in order to set out standard procedures for species distribution modelling studies rodríguez castañeda et al 2012 araújo et al 2019 feng et al 2019 merow et al 2019 zurell et al 2020 which will be of extraordinary importance when conservation planning strategies or decision making procedures are targeted araújo et al 2019 garcía díaz et al 2019 rapacciuolo 2019 schuwirth et al 2019 to create a starting point for future studies we synthesized our main findings on challenges and recommendations particularly applicable in high elevation modelling studies in table 2 in this way knowledge can be generated that is particularly important for modelling spatial expansion of invasive species extinction risk assessment and potential range shifts under future climate change in remote areas like the himalayas 4 conclusions modelling species in remote regions like the himalayas faces several challenges it is interesting to note that temporal transferability i e under future or past climate conditions studies represent the majority of recently published studies however problems and difficulties associated with modelling species under current climate conditions are not yet sufficiently resolved if not mastered severe consequences for the validity of the modelling results are to be expected including wrong assumptions when the results serve as a baseline for projections on species potential future range shifts expansions or contractions the opportunity to choose ready to use species occurrence data sets and bioclimatic predictor variables from freely available databases might lead researchers into temptation to regard model performance more important than model quality i e performance metrics versus ecological relevance of predictors additionally the most common and user friendly software maxent may encourage modelling studies without statistical knowledge required for detailed tuning depending on the species ecology in this review the vast majority of studies on species potential range shifts show predictions under future climate change conditions however information on the ecological drivers behind the current distribution was often not the principal focus it appears that researchers are attracted by the idea to model species distributional ranges and their dynamics under future climate conditions often the acquisition of sufficient numbers of species occurrences the evaluation of environmental data quality and their ability to account for the species ecological requirements were neglected this in turn could lead to flawed predictions misinterpretations and biased implications especially when nature conservation strategies and environmental management are in focus often modelling concepts and terminologies predictor variable selection and species specific ecological constraints were not sufficiently taken into account resulting in lacking transparency to comprehend modelling results and their ecological interpretations comprehensive understanding of underlying mechanistic processes and empirical data will reduce biases in modelling results and lead to improved predictions in this review we highlighted possible pitfalls revisited current research gaps and provided potential solutions for ecological models in the himalayas in order to support reaching their full potential in future research we emphasize the need for consistency in applied modelling concepts terminology methodology and ecological theory to obtain robust and expedient results in further modelling applications in the himalayas with this review we provide a starting point irrespective of species group for substantial improvements in input parameter evaluation to catalyse advances in performance and quality of modelling studies in the himalayas declaration of competing

24557,modelling species across vast distributions in remote high mountain regions like the himalayas remains a challenging task challenges include first and foremost large scale sampling of species occurrences and acquisition of sufficient high quality fine scale environmental parameters we compiled a review of 157 himalayan studies published between 2010 and 2021 aiming at identifying their main modelling objective in relation to the conceptualization of their methodological framework evaluating origin of species occurrence data taxonomic groups spatial and temporal scale selection of predictor variables and applied modelling algorithms the majority of the analysed studies 40 attempted to answer questions about potential range changes under future or past climatic conditions the most studied organisms were trees 27 followed by mammals 22 herbaceous plants 20 and birds 9 for almost all studies we noted that a critical investigation and evaluation of input parameters and their ability to account for the species ecological requirements were neglected over 87 of all studies used worldclim climate data as predictor variables while around 50 of these studies solely relied on worldclim climate data climate data from other sources were incorporated in only 7 and an additional 6 solely used remotely sensed predictors only around 2 of all studies attempted to compare the influence of different climate data sources on model performance by far maxent was the most used modelling algorithm with 66 followed by ensemble approaches 16 whereas statistical modelling techniques lagged far behind 9 surprisingly we found in 37 of the studies no interpretation on the relationship between the species and the predictor variables while 27 of all studies included brief information and 36 provided an elaborate detailed interpretation on species ecological needs reflected in the final model with this review we highlight the necessity to identify and reduce biases and uncertainty associated with species occurrence records and environmental data a priori since flawed input parameters produce misleading models without ecological causality their implementation may have detrimental consequences when the best possible adaptation to future climatic conditions is at stake keywords ecological niche models evaluation input parameters high elevation habitats model challenges model comparison modelling mountain species 1 introduction 1 1 modelling species in mountain ecosystems mountain ecosystems are characterized by distinct three dimensional geo ecological differentiation complex topography and a pronounced small scale variation of climatic and edaphic conditions resulting in numerous ecological niches and often representing biodiversity hotspots körner et al 2017 körner 2021 compared to most lowland regions of the world mountain regions have been less transformed by human impact schickhoff 2011 however anthropogenic interferences are ubiquitous and for instance in old world mountain regions near natural treeline sites can hardly be found schickhoff et al 2015 in the course of past climate changes mountain ranges provided refugia for species persistence and biodiversity preservation and even greater importance could be attached to these refugia in future birks willis 2008 malanson et al 2019 progress in remote sensing techniques geographic information systems and modelling techniques shaped modern scientific research on species inhabiting high mountain ecosystems ever since abiotic and biotic factors and processes controlling spatial and temporal species patterns and dynamics have been investigated across mountain ecosystems worldwide pauli halloy 2019 körner 2021 with the combination of results from different disciplines i e ecology vegetation science biogeography environmental sciences and geosciences researchers aim to differentiate disentangle and understand underlying factors controlling current distribution species ranges and compositions to derive forecasts under climate change scenarios franklin 2010 to quantify these effects and identify the drivers species distribution models sdms have become an indispensable tool these correlative modelling approaches are now very popular when it comes to predicting past current and future distribution of species in mountains all over the world e g dullinger et al 2004 thuiller et al 2005 parolo et al 2008 the growing number of publications employing sdms can be attributed to freely accessible databases of species occurrence or abundance records and high resolution environmental data as well as user friendly statistic and gis software to date sdms have become an umbrella term comprising a variety of concepts including species distribution ecological niche habitat suitability habitat preference and climatic envelope models guisan et al 2017 zurell et al 2020 even if this fusion initially sounds reasonable differences between modelling aims interpretation and associated challenges exist soberón nakamura 2009 peterson soberón 2012 peterson et al 2015 guisan et al 2017 however an overarching characteristic of all species distribution modelling approaches are analyses of the underlying environmental factors in relation to the species ecology which in turn constitutes a basic requirement for understanding current past and future species distribution ranges most frequently climatic factors among other abiotic and sometimes biotic parameters are used to estimate species niches and distributions across space and time elith leathwick 2009 irrespective of the model aim of inter or extrapolation understanding of the phenomena of the species occurrences is a precondition to formalize a model and make predictions that hold predictive capability the general interest in understanding underlying factors of species ranges and dynamics as well as forecasting and hindcasting species niches their distribution and composition has increased during the last decades schickhoff 2005 miehe et al 2007 telwala et al 2013 dutta et al 2014 schickhoff et al 2015 holtmeier broll 2019 bobrowski 2021 whereas climate change impacts on european and north american mountain regions are well studied e g theurillat guisan 2001 bell et al 2014 braunisch et al 2016 halofsky et al 2018 scherrer et al 2020 one of the major mountain systems of the world the himalayas is still comparatively under researched over the last decade numerous modelling studies have been published however no review on modelling studies across taxonomic groups exists to date for the himalayan mountain system 1 2 challenges for modelling species in the himalayas modelling ecological niches and species distributions across vast areas in remote high mountain regions like the himalayas constitute a challenging task the main challenges arise from large scale sampling of species occurrences and in rare cases absences and acquisition of sufficient high quality fine scale environmental predictors sampling deficits can be primarily attributed to the difficult accessibility of the terrain and the geographical extent of the himalayan mountain system however the quality and quantity of occurrence data determine the significance of the model the basic assumption of the model is based on uniform or random sampling of the study area royle et al 2012 the selection of an appropriate predictor variable set depends not only on the availability of high quality environmental data but also on the spatial scale the autecology of the species and the degree of complexity of the ecological niche peterson et al 2011 the understanding of the relationship between species specific ecological constraints and its geographic distribution is the key aspect in selecting relevant and meaningful predictor variables if neglected the gap between ecology and model performance could be broadened in favour of high model performance metrics with decreasing real model accuracy and limited ecological explanation of habitat requirements of the species being provided synes osborne 2011 thibaud et al 2014 petitpierre et al 2017 santini et al 2021 this gap could be further widened by the unmindful usage of evaluation metrics like the auc lobo et al 2008 and when these models serve as a baseline for future projections recent general modelling research focussed on quality and quantity of input data such as the number of occurrences in relation to extent and number of generated absences elith et al 2011 barbet massin et al 2012 spatial structure of occurrence data fithian et al 2015 multi collinearity of predictors and spatial autocorrelation of species distributional data braunisch et al 2013 dormann et al 2007 2013 a wide range of publications addressed the effect of choice of modelling algorithm on model performance elith et al 2006 franklin 2010 saupe et al 2012 and compared different evaluation criteria on model performance and projection allouche et al 2006 lobo et al 2008 in this review we do not focus on aforementioned well studied topics but rather concentrate on the rarely considered challenges of high quality input data and the significance of results when modelling species in the himalayas this review aims at addressing key questions related to species occurrence data acquisition and reliable climate data for modelling species in the himalayas we highlight potential challenges identify gaps in modelling studies point out noteworthy trends in the field and summarize recent modelling studies with respect to quality and quantity of input parameters applied model methodology and consideration of the species specific ecological characteristics we aim at pointing out expedient avenues to integrate mechanistic understanding and empirical data for future modelling studies in the himalayan mountain system overcoming the input parameter challenges synthesized in this review will support catalysing advances in ecological models in the himalayas 2 literature review 2 1 literature search to grasp the on going trend of modelling studies in the himalayas using modern sdm techniques we conducted a literature

analyses we limited our literature search to the collections of web of knowledge to allow for reproducible results all reviewed studies are listed in the supplementary material of this review 3 2 aim of the reviewed studies irrespective of taxa modelling potential range shifts expansion or contraction had the highest proportion with 40 the second most frequent research aim was modelling species current distribution 33 followed by studies where the phylogeny of species was considered to hindcast and or forecast their distributional region 20 considerably less studies attempted to model the potential of invasive species 7 among all analysed studies tree species were the most popular study organism with 27 followed by mammals 22 herbaceous species 20 and birds 9 tab 1 out of all analysed studies 72 focussed on one single species and the remaining 18 addressed multiple species in single species models the review on applied methodological concepts revealed diverging usage regarding the methodology and terminology between sdms and ecological niche models enms whereas 47 used the term sdm 33 enm and 10 referred to both terms an additional 4 of the reviewed studies used the terminology of habitat suitability models hsm and further 6 did not label their approach at all although enm or sdm concepts were applied we included habitat models n 2 in the category sdms and climatic envelope models n 2 in the category of enms generally in sdms it is attempted to model the actual distribution of species in geographic space peterson soberón 2012 whereas enms can be projected in geographic space and time identifying consistent areas with suitable environmental conditions for the species and assessing distributional changes under past or future climate conditions araújo guisan 2006 peterson soberón 2012 it becomes obvious that whenever species potential distributional range shifts are modelled under future or past climate conditions it refers to the conceptual framework of enms however in 73 of the analysed studies using sdm terminology potential range shifts under future or past climatic conditions were modelled even if studies use the collective term sdm the underlying conceptual methodological framework of distribution estimation or niche quantification should always be taken into consideration in order to allow a clear distinction between approaches which will in turn facilitate a consistent interpretation of the results of modelling studies in the himalayas 3 3 extent of analyses the extent of the study area varied greatly from local studies to studies covering the entire himalayan arc and adjacent mountains fig 1 overall 60 of all analysed studies modelled species at local to meso scales whereas 40 operated at macro scales i e along the himalayan arc himalaya hengduan mountains hindukush karakorum himalayas sino himalayas in particular 31 of the studies covered the indian himalayas namely jammu and kashmir ladakh himachal pradesh uttarakhand and sikkim followed by studies extending over the entire himalayan arc 17 and nepal 15 3 4 source of occurrences especially in vast mountain systems like the himalayas sampling species presence and absence locations is limited due to time and financial constraints therefore presence only data was most often used the origin of occurrence data can be separated into directly measured data in the field and collected data bundled in databases herbaria museums and publications fig 2 we found that occurrence data used for modelling the target species were most frequently recorded directly in the field 37 and in several studies accompanied with different sources of collections 10 besides other sources field survey data were supplemented with information from databases 15 and very frequently with data from the global biodiversity information facility gbif https gbif org a platform that hosts freely available species occurrence data covering the entire globe for the himalayan mountain system we found gbif data and combinations with other sources in 19 of the studies for 19 of all studies other database mostly local databases herbaria museums or literature were used to gather information on species locations it was common to combine different sources of species data when large regions were studied whereas solely field survey data or field survey data and additional sources were chosen when local scales were targeted out of 157 studies 139 provided information on number of occurrences used in the final model with large variation in sample sizes among studies compared to number of occurrences sampled in the field mean 80 combinations of different sources resulted in higher number of occurrences in particular when field data literature records and databases were utilized mean 150 when field data were accompanied with gbif data and additional sources a mean of 246 occurrences records were compiled outstanding high average numbers were found when occurrence data was compiled from combinations of gbif with miscellaneous databases local and national herbaria and relevant literature mean 631 for other sources local databases means of occurrences records were comparatively low despite mean records for virtual herbaria and databases resulting in an overall median of 128 occurrence records besides data quantity data quality plays a major role in generating a valuable occurrence data set of mountain species one arising challenge of data derived from existing databases is the consideration of geospatial errors as a precondition to account for sampling errors meyer et al 2016 feng et al 2019 compared to planned systematic field surveys the true error measure remains unknown beck et al 2013 2014 misidentification duplicate records sampling design and purpose oversampling of certain areas and spatial clustering of species constitute possible sources of uncertainty especially in high elevation regions spatial bias leads to environmental bias because of the over representation of certain environmental features of more accessible and extensively surveyed areas kramer schadt et al 2013 furthermore spatial clumping may result in spatial autocorrelation and can reduce the model quality by falsely inflating measures of accuracy veloz 2009 resulting in higher commission error rates dormann et al 2008 furthermore the model may yield misleading parameter estimates kühn 2007 allocating predictor variables that simply reflect the intensively studied area further resulting in spatial extrapolation errors kramer schadt et al 2013 nevertheless in cases of large scale study areas and difficult accessibility of the terrain databases provide a cost and time effective tool however to obtain valuable modelling results in high mountain regions the data have to be thoroughly examined furthermore the compilation of different sources such as databases museums herbaria and species lists national atlases large scale field surveys regional checklists expert range maps and collections from citizen science groups may be beneficial to compose a large dataset jetz et al 2012 especially if the number of occurrences is limited the distributional range covering the environmental gradients of the species occurrences has to be reflected in the data set fei yu 2016 since biased occurrence data lead to biased models generally studies agreed that sampling size especially for n 100 has significant effects on model quality followed by the applied modelling algorithm thibaud et al 2014 soultan safi 2017 meynard et al 2019 for example if species records are clustered in lower more accessible parts of the study area unlike its natural distribution it is highly suspected that the model will show deviated results and predictions of erroneously main distribution range of the target species yackulic et al 2013 fithian et al 2015 furthermore azonal observations e g at both lower and higher elevations should be removed to obtain valuable modelling results of the species niche in the target region e g treeline locations bobrowski et al 2017 when the applied species prevalence is not in accordance with the actual distribution it results in biased assumption on environmental distributional constraints pearson et al 2006a moreover model performance metrics are more dependent on correctly predicting absences than occurrences tessarolo et al 2021 furthermore distortion of models under current climate conditions will subsequently lead to untrustworthy model projections under future climate conditions bobrowski schickhoff 2017 another major pitfall arises when spatial autocorrelation and spatial filtering are wrongly equated with each other sillero barbosa 2021 autocorrelation is essential for modelling as it captures relationships between locations dormann et al 2007 nonetheless it causes biases when evaluating model performance de oliveira et al 2014 in addition spatial autocorrelation between training and testing data peterson soberón 2012 and model residuals de oliveira et al 2014 should be obviated therefore extensive care has to be taken to filter and select the occurrence that will provide the basis for the following model procedure veloz 2009 in mountain regions applying methods like block cross validation procedures to reduce spatial autocorrelation valavi et al 2019 or using autocorrelation prone modelling algorithms provide valuable solutions kramer schadt et al 2013 most modelling algorithms require presence absence data which were not available in most of the reviewed studies besides different pseudo absence generation methods in case of maxent background data phillips et al 2006 the number of recommended pseudo absences depends on the intended modelling algorithm and study sample barbet massin et al 2012 phillips dudík 2008 however model and sample specific requirements are often disregarded in ensemble modelling approaches by fitting all models on the same data set santini et al 2021 3 5 source of environmental data in general 42 of all analysed studies purely relied on one climate data source the remaining 58 of the studies incorporated in addition to climate data mainly remotely sensed predictors with digital elevation models dem and land cover being the most prominent predictor variables in 79 of the analysed studies worldclim 1 4 was utilized in nearly half of these studies no additional predictor variables were incorporated fig 3 among freely available relatively fine scale i e 1 1 km long term climate raster data set with global coverage worldclim 1 4 hijmans et al 2005 is the most frequently used source of climatic variables in sdm and enm studies with 12400 citations in web of knowledge core collection march 2021 especially in europe and north america worldclim shows high accuracy hijmans et al 2005 and is used in numerous biogeographical studies elith et al 2006 hijmans graham 2006 broennimann et al 2012 thibaud et al 2014 in 2017 a new worldclim climate data set was launched fick hijmans 2017 which extends the former version of worldclim 1 4 hijmans et al 2005 by incorporating remotely sensed data as covariates and independent spline variables in the interpolation fick hijmans 2017 in 6 of the studies worldclim 2 was used and in 2 worldclim 1 4 and 2 were combined fig 3 climond which is based on worldclim and cru cl1 0 and cl2 0 data new et al 1999 2002 and exhibits a spatial resolution of 50 by 50 km kriticos et al 2012 was represented in 3 of all studies and used mostly without additional predictor variables modellers predominantly use worldclim however the recently published climate data set chelsa karger et al 2016 2017 offers relatively fine scale i e 1 1 km long term climate raster data set with global coverage and enjoys growing popularity in the himalayas e g bobrowski et al 2017 2018 gilani et al 2020 studies which used chelsa always incorporated additional predictor variables i e dem remotely sensed land cover and land surface temperature lst worldwide only very few researchers attempted to compare the effect of different climate data sets on model performance e g soria auza et al 2010 bedia et al 2013 fernández et al 2013 deblauwe et al 2016 bobrowski schickhoff 2017 suwal et al 2018 datta et al 2020 and only recently first studies for himalayan species were conducted our review revealed only 3 studies attempting to compare the effect of chelsa and worldclim climate data on model performance in the himalayas bobrowski schickhoff 2017 suwal et al 2018 datta et al 2020 predictor variables solely obtained from remote sensing products were used in 6 of the studies studies incorporating solely remotely sensed data e g land cover and lst provided valuable results to describe habitat suitability of mammal species singh kushwaha 2011 bashir et al 2014 2018 qian et al 2014 bhattacharyya et al 2015 2020 paudel et al 2015 khan et al 2016 thinley et al 2019 measured data from climate stations were rarely used 1 in the analysed studies both the temporal and the spatial resolution are highly significant to account for the environmental heterogeneity of mountain regions in the literature reviewed here most of the studies 93 were based on seasonally averaged climate data and 62 of all studies used environmental predictor variables with 1 1 km raster grid cells in 18 of all studies raster at 5 5 km cell size were utilized which might conceal fine scale information of the underlying terrain furthermore in 8 of the studies environmental raster at 10 18 and 340 km² resolution were used as predictor variables respectively in contrast other studies 6 resampled 1 km² grid cell of climate raster to higher resolution e g 20 30 90 250 340 m² simulating artificial high resolution of climate data while 5 of the studies incorporating predictors solely obtained from remote sensing data showed higher resolution e g 30 90 m² grid cell size although this misfit resolution has been widely recognized and described in many high elevation studies when capturing spatio temporal variability in microclimate the use of fine scale environmental data sets 1 km² grid cell size is rather the exception zischg et al 2019 published a high resolution map of climatological indices with a spatial resolution of 25 25 m for the european alps emphasizing the need for expert knowledge in parameter computation shrestha and bawa 2014 emphasized the need for high resolution environmental data that capture microclimates edaphic conditions vegetation dynamics and landscape heterogeneity and kollas et al 2014 also emphasized the use of high spatial resolution temperature data for predictive modelling of temperature based niche envelopes with a resolution of less than 100 m to demonstrate the mechanistic links between species occurrences and the prevailing climatic conditions and consequently enable robust model predictions of biological responses to changing climatic conditions estimates of climate at high spatial and temporal resolution are needed for mountain regions lenoir et al 2017 maclean 2020 3 6 selections of predictor variables the selection of predictor variables represents an essential step as they have to capture species distributional constraints and reflect species eco physiological tolerances and requirements guisan zimmermann 2000 austin 2002 jarnevich et al 2015 selection methods can be subdivided into ecological and statistical approaches with predictors being chosen based either on species specific ecological requirements or on statistical variable selection methods fig 4 overall the majority of studies relied on statistical selection approaches 62 while ecologically based approaches were less applied 23 surprisingly 15 of all analysed studies disclosed no information on how predictor variables were selected to model the ecological niche or distribution this in turn often leads to ambiguity when trying to interpret model predictions in most modelling studies predictor variable selection was solely based on pearson 30 or spearman 5 correlation coefficients to remove highly correlated variables whereas the coefficients ranged between r 0 6 and 0 9 it has been generally proposed that a correlation coefficient r 0 7 detects collinearity among variables dormann et al 2013 further statistical selection approaches comprised combinations of correlations with resampling methods like the jackknife technique 5 variance inflation factor analysis vif 3 or principal component analysis pca 3 in 13 of the studies predictor variable selection were either based on the species ecological requirements or on combinations of ecology and correlations after pearson and spearman respectively in 3 of the studies the species ecology in the variable selection procedure was considered by information retrieved from published literature when modelling species niches or distributions variable selection should lead to a set of predictors that include variables which affect the species directly rather than indirectly guisan zimmermann 2000 furthermore these variables can be sorted by the degree of causality of species responses to environmental factors in proximal i e direct response of the species such as cold temperatures during growing season limiting plant growth and distal responses i e indirect response of the species such as mean annual temperature austin 2002 peterson et al 2011 santini et al 2021 noted the on going trend to use automatic procedures e g vif to exclude collinear variables irrespective of species specific requirements e g manish pandit 2019 to compile an appropriate predictor variable set the ecology of the species should be considered however the model assumption regarding uncorrelated predictor variables should not be violated dormann et al 2013 the usage of modelling approaches handling collinearity such as bioclim nix 1986 enfa hirzel et al 2002 and mahalanobis distance clark et al 1993 represents another option recently the robustness of maxent in terms of collinearity based on empirical data has been discussed see feng et al 2019 for a detailed discussion model performance is highly dependent on input parameter quality consisting of species data and predictor variables e g fernández et al 2013 syfert et al 2013 varela et al 2014 feng et al 2019 explicit knowledge on specific ecological requirements must be available to select relevant high qualitative environmental predictors austin 2002 baker et al 2016 2017 mod et al 2016 descombes et al 2020 santini et al 2021 model quality could be improved by selecting relevant model variables accounting for functional relationships among dependent and independent variables and in parameter estimates houlahan et al 2017 with predictions on anthropogenically induced climate change effects on species and their habitats clark et al 2001 a shift from explanatory models to anticipatory models has been proposed mouquet et al 2015 yates et al 2018 anticipatory models assume that underlying hypotheses are valid while explanatory models are based on hypotheses to be tested with specificities often being overlooked in both prediction approaches mouquet et al 2015 this circumstance may lead to a gap between solid theoretical knowledge of ecological systems and their drivers i e cause effect mechanisms and prediction abilities may lead to vague assumptions when not correctly interpreting the outcomes and communicating their limitations mouquet et al 2015 schuwirth et al 2019 modelling species niches and predicting their potential habitats should be demonstrating understanding of ecological drivers and not acquiring the ecology houlahan et al 2017 a profound understanding of mechanistic processes related to the system and study organism is a precondition to develop models for mountain species with ecological significance although this point seems self evident we only found in 36 of all studies an elaborate detailed interpretation on species ecological needs reflected in the final model and in 27 at least a brief discussion however in 37 of the analysed studies no interpretation on the relationship between the species and the predictor variables was given this may be attributed to the misleading trends of models showing high discrimination accuracy and good predictive ability although they include ecologically not meaningful variables which in turn impedes plausible interpretations fourcade et al 2018 warren et al 2020 santini et al 2021 another explanation of the rather high proportion of analysed studies that implied no reference to species specific requirements could be to the narrow corset of the bioclimatic predictor variables on the one hand they generally reflect monthly and seasonal trends in temperature and precipitation to allow direct comparison among studies but on the other might not contain needed variables that define the ecological niche or the actual distribution of the target species over all analysed studies customized variables e g pre monsoonal drought stress were rarely used but could easily be calculated from average monthly climate data bobrowski et al 2017 further tailored predictor variables obtained from remotely sensed topography land cover and phenological traits may result in a more constrained predicted niche compared to solely climate based models bobrowski et al 2018 to reduce the gap between potential and actual distributions the potential of remotely sensed data to model species over vast remote and heterogeneous mountain regions has been emphasised he et al 2015 in our review we found promising applications of remotely sensed land cover products as predictor variables in studies on animals plants and phylogeny ray et al 2011 forrest et al 2012 yang et al 2013 qian et al 2014 dunn et al 2015 paudel et al 2015 khan et al 2016 wang et al 2016 bobrowski et al 2018 chhetri et al 2018a lamsal et al 2018 he et al 2019 kanagaraj et al 2019 litvinchuk et al 2019 panthi et al 2019 rathore et al 2019 shankhwar et al 2019 bhandari et al 2020 bhattacharya et al 2020 li et al 2020 lu et al 2020 singh et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the usage of dems provides another example of remotely sensed information which was included in 46 of the studies particularly the often utilized variable altitude which serves as a proxy for the prevailing climatic conditions constitutes the ecologically less valuable predictor variable compared to temperature derivates this mismatch can be attributed to the fact that species do not respond directly to elevation but to changes in temperature and other climatic parameters which are affected by elevation peterson et al 2011 furthermore when modelling future range shifts temperature values are likely to change whereas elevation will not and thus contains limited ecological explanation additionally when transferring modelling results to other regions e g for invasive species elevation and related temperature will vary at different latitudes jarnevich et al 2015 chhetri et al 2018b concluded that although elevation may not be directly associated with plant physiology it represents a strong indicator of climatic variables that influence physiology as a consequence variable influence of other temperature related variables may be subsequently blurred as an indirect variable elevation provides a good surrogate for temperature and latitudinal ranges but may be misleading across broader areas peterson et al 2011 3 7 modelling technique and evaluation compared to mechanistic and process based models correlative models are most commonly used to model species distributional ranges across space and time this approach defines the niche based on the assumption that the observed current distribution of a species reflects the species ecological requirements kearney porter 2009 kearney et al 2010 and less than the full fundamental niche is captured since biotic interactions and movement components are not distinguishable peterson et al 2011 all reviewed studies applied correlative modelling techniques which can be separated into statistical machine learning similarity and expert rules based algorithms the vast majority of studies 66 applied the model algorithm maxent which is a machine learning approach philips et al 2006 fig 5 the maxent algorithm can handle presence only data with generated background data to estimate target probability distribution by finding the probability distribution of maximum entropy phillips et al 2006 phillips 2008 another main reason for the popularity of maxent 7700 citations in web of knowledge core collection march 2021 may be traced back to the graphical user interface of the freely available java software that is easy to use for modelers without statistical knowledge required for detailed tuning phillips dudík 2008 furthermore maxent shows high predictive performance elith et al 2006 especially with low sample sizes pearson et al 2006b only recently it became available as a r package maxnet phillips et al 2017 providing options for community extensions and contributions despite its popularity recent publications revealed difficult interpretability and poorly grounded ecological theory of the models e g background point selection highly complex response curves large predictor variable sets and negligence of modelled relationships halvorsen 2013 yackulic et al 2013 vollering et al 2019 sillero barbosa 2021 often maxent models are run on the default parameter setting resulting in countless potential issues yackulic et al 2013 fourcade et al 2018 especially for studies claiming to model the relationship between species occurrences and the environment or projections across space and time these circumstances can be challenging halvorsen 2012 vollering et al 2019 almost all studies reviewed here using the maxent algorithm relied on the default settings without customizing according to their research target to combat caveats of single modelling algorithms and to create more robust predictions ensemble modelling approaches are frequently used in ecological modelling studies we found 16 of all analysed studies using ensembles of multiple algorithms the rising number of publications with ensemble models may be attributable to r package biomod2 thuiller et al 2009 whereas pros and cons are discussed in the literature whether ensemble models are outperforming single algorithms araujo new 2007 marmion et al 2009 dormann et al 2018 hao et al 2019 furthermore 4 of the analysed studies applied generalized linear models glm and 4 compared different modelling algorithms according to their performance to evaluate model performance several threshold independent and dependent evaluation criteria have been established fig 5 however no universal model evaluation criteria exist in this review most studies 63 referred to the area under the curve auc to examine model performance followed by 10 of the studies using two evaluation criteria auc and true skill statistics tss out of all studies 6 combined auc tss and cohen s kappa to account for model performance whereas 6 provided no information on model evaluation although the auc as an exclusive evaluation metric for model performance has come under criticism for an extensive discussion see lobo et al 2008 warren seifert 2011 it is still frequently applied without reservations to report model performance in ecological modelling studies in particular in the himalayas the most severe limitation of this metric is that it is only valid and useful for comparisons among models for a single study species in a single study region peterson et al 2011 3 8 perspectives for future research in remote high elevation regions as most modelling algorithms require presence and absence data wrong occurrences influence the selection of pseudo absences regardless of selection method albeit numerous studies have proven the effect of presence absence data on model accuracy and prediction quality brotons et al 2004 elith leathwick 2009 presence only data are mainly used in modelling procedures especially in regions with a heterogenous terrain like the himalayas sampling species which are distributed along the entire himalayan arc is in most cases not feasible however high quality presence data sets present a valuable option since a presence observation is the result of at least two multi factor processes peterson et al 2011 first the species was observed in a location which exhibits abiotically suitable conditions i e the fundamental niche and is influenced by biotic interactions i e the realized niche according to its movement abilities e g dispersal over space and time secondly the species was collected with certain collection intentions according to its detection abilities i e the species visibility and terrain accessibility in summary presence only data represent estimate indices of relative suitability peterson et al 2011 for local studies however it may be possible to sample species with planned field surveys or even systematic field campaigns for presence absence data sets for macro scale studies covering the entire himalayan mountain system the reliability of species occurrences records obtained from databases could be validated with remotely sensed products he et al 2015 in singh et al 2013 the current alpine treeline ecotone boundary was validated with remote sensing data while bobrowski et al 2018 extracted betula utilis occurrences from satellite images via google earth which were validated by expert knowledge obtained on the basis of many field campaigns and photo documentary of betula sites this method has proven to produce large and high quality datasets at other treeline locations paulsen körner 2014 irl et al 2015 the incorporation of remote sensing data allows to include locations that are remote or hardly accessible such locations are often less disturbed or even undisturbed by anthropogenic influences irl et al 2015 one further advantage of remote sensing data when plants are in focus could be the generation of presence absence data sets by using vegetation classification he et al 2009 2015 in high elevation ecosystems the distinct vegetation zonation with different spectral signals provides an ideal starting point for vegetation classifications to compile a high quality presence absence data set this approach is particularly promising for broadleaved deciduous tree species like betula since phenological traits from adjacent vegetation types which consist mainly of evergreen coniferous and evergreen broadleaved species in the tree layer allow a clear separation in the course of the year bobrowski et al 2018 in many publications basic information on applied climate data sets e g access meta data time span versions data type is not sufficient to allow reproducibility and transparency morueta holme et al 2018 although extensive care is taken in selecting uncorrelated predictor variables differences between available current climate datasets remain largely out of focus for the himalayas and most studies do not critically scrutinize the origin of climate data computation or measurement methods and neglect potential drawbacks and afflicted errors especially in topographically heterogeneous landscapes global climate datasets often do not account for local climatic conditions due to their quantitatively limited weather station density computation method and relatively coarse resolution 1 km bobrowski et al 2021 often it is taken for granted that data available at global scale show equally high quality throughout all regions however the premature use of such data may in turn lead to erroneous models and flawed predictions especially for projections under future climate conditions the need for comparative studies of model performance using different climate data sets have gained interest over the last few years e g heikkinen et al 2006 kriticos et al 2012 watling et al 2014 stoklosa et al 2015 wang et al 2016 baker et al 2016 2017 however effects of different climate data sets on model performance remains largely out of focus for the himalayan mountains bobrowski schickhoff 2017 suwal et al 2018 datta et al 2020 comparison and evaluation of climate data set quality is seldomly considered with potentially severe consequences for range shifts under climate change scenarios baker et al 2016 2017 model uncertainty was found to be related to topographic heterogeneity inter annual variability and distance to the closest climate station fernández et al 2013 depending on spatial and temporal scales global climate datasets like chelsa and worldclim lack precision of local temperature patterns and precipitation regimes of the himalayas and thus may contain flawed climate estimates used in sdm studies bobrowski et al 2021 although climate is not the exclusive factor delimiting species distributions in the himalayas it is an indispensable prerequisite as species occurrences and their dynamics in high elevation habitats are governed by low temperatures and local precipitation regimes bobrowski et al 2021 new opportunities for analysing and modelling species distributions in the himalayas could be derived by incorporating abiotic and biotic data derived from remote sensing since they provide response and predictor variables namely presence absence data sets and tailored environmental data sets e g solar radiation precipitation amounts and snow cover bobrowski et al 2018 he et al 2015 bobrowski 2021 additionally remotely sensed variables are continuous observations without interpolation and geographical bias and therefore with less uncertainty he et al 2015 recent studies have revealed how remotely sensed lst data could improve species distribution modelling studies e g buermann et al 2008 bisrat et al 2012 still et al 2013 bobrowski et al 2018 as time series data of vegetation characteristics i e phenological metrics are becoming more and more readily available changing habitat suitability can be estimated and incorporated into model approaches remote sensing data may lead to refined modelled distributions since they are based on real information of the earth s surface and account for non climatic dimensions i e anthropogenic impacts leading in turn to a more realistic actual distribution the main advantages of high resolution remote sensing data for mountainous areas are the acquisition of climate data at high resolution i e 1 km for differentiation between north and south facing slopes which would in turn lead to more precise modelling results recently numerous studies have been published to promote comparison reproducibility transparency and protocols in order to set out standard procedures for species distribution modelling studies rodríguez castañeda et al 2012 araújo et al 2019 feng et al 2019 merow et al 2019 zurell et al 2020 which will be of extraordinary importance when conservation planning strategies or decision making procedures are targeted araújo et al 2019 garcía díaz et al 2019 rapacciuolo 2019 schuwirth et al 2019 to create a starting point for future studies we synthesized our main findings on challenges and recommendations particularly applicable in high elevation modelling studies in table 2 in this way knowledge can be generated that is particularly important for modelling spatial expansion of invasive species extinction risk assessment and potential range shifts under future climate change in remote areas like the himalayas 4 conclusions modelling species in remote regions like the himalayas faces several challenges it is interesting to note that temporal transferability i e under future or past climate conditions studies represent the majority of recently published studies however problems and difficulties associated with modelling species under current climate conditions are not yet sufficiently resolved if not mastered severe consequences for the validity of the modelling results are to be expected including wrong assumptions when the results serve as a baseline for projections on species potential future range shifts expansions or contractions the opportunity to choose ready to use species occurrence data sets and bioclimatic predictor variables from freely available databases might lead researchers into temptation to regard model performance more important than model quality i e performance metrics versus ecological relevance of predictors additionally the most common and user friendly software maxent may encourage modelling studies without statistical knowledge required for detailed tuning depending on the species ecology in this review the vast majority of studies on species potential range shifts show predictions under future climate change conditions however information on the ecological drivers behind the current distribution was often not the principal focus it appears that researchers are attracted by the idea to model species distributional ranges and their dynamics under future climate conditions often the acquisition of sufficient numbers of species occurrences the evaluation of environmental data quality and their ability to account for the species ecological requirements were neglected this in turn could lead to flawed predictions misinterpretations and biased implications especially when nature conservation strategies and environmental management are in focus often modelling concepts and terminologies predictor variable selection and species specific ecological constraints were not sufficiently taken into account resulting in lacking transparency to comprehend modelling results and their ecological interpretations comprehensive understanding of underlying mechanistic processes and empirical data will reduce biases in modelling results and lead to improved predictions in this review we highlighted possible pitfalls revisited current research gaps and provided potential solutions for ecological models in the himalayas in order to support reaching their full potential in future research we emphasize the need for consistency in applied modelling concepts terminology methodology and ecological theory to obtain robust and expedient results in further modelling applications in the himalayas with this review we provide a starting point

24558,the morrison formation of the late jurassic period is characterized by its diverse assemblage of sauropods several species of which reached the size of modern cetaceans while much scientific attention has concerned their biology in life researchers have yet to examine how their massive carcasses may have influenced the evolution of other dinosaurs in their communities such as theropods theropod consumers local to this faunal system are typically described as powerful apex predators at the top of local food webs but instead may have been shaped by competition for carrion resources generated as a byproduct of their giant sauropod neighbors to test this hypothesis we wrote a series of agent based simulations abs specifically we simulated allosaurid consumer behavior versus spatially distributed sauropod carcass resources such as could be expected in ecosystems like that represented in the morrison formation we incorporated conditions to test how competition among consumers seasonality and predation success influenced carnosaur survival both with and without carrion abundant systems trials of the abs resulted in a strong selective advantage for allosaurs as obligate scavengers because of the high metabolic and survival costs associated with predation of large vertebrates allosaurs with increased predatory success over peers failed to succeed competitively unless the probability of scavenging opportunities fell below a certain threshold and a significant proportion of herbivores were available as prey targets which might not have been the case in sauropod dominated systems our results may explain why carnosaurs like allosaurus did not evolve powerful bite forces binocular vision or advanced cursorial adaptations given the enormous supply of sauropod carrion they were under no resource based selective pressure to overpower prey and may have evolved as terrestrial vulture analogues this also may explain why the absence of sauropods in certain environments led to more obvious predatory adaptations in theropods such as tyrannosaurs tyrannosaurs may have been forced to meet their energy budgets by hunting because non sauropod carrion production was too low to support them passively keywords dinosaurs scavenging agent based models theropods ecology evolution sauropods 1 introduction agent based simulations abs are computer models where simulated entities interact with each other governed by programmatically defined behaviors and conditions so observers can test system wide patterns they are especially useful when knowledge of a system is incomplete or when direct observations of a subject are difficult or impossible they also can allow researchers to perform multiple tests in a short timeframe because of this recent decades have seen thousands of different abs models and they have proven valuable in a wide range of disciplines including physiology sociology economics and more particularly ecology fachada et al 2015 they are considered primary tools in ecology bousquet and le page 2004 grimm and railsback 2005 huse et al 2002 parker et al 2003 porte and bartelink 2002 and could likewise help answer paleoecological questions buried in the deep past for instance the morrison formation in western north america laid down between 156 and 147 million years ago has been richly described over many decades but remains only partially understood especially because of its diverse assemblage of giant sauropods at least six species reached 10 000 kg in mass as adults and several exceeded 30 000 kg including species in amphicoelias apatosaurus barosaurus brachiosaurus brontosaurus camarasaurus and diplodocus carpenter 2006 mcnab 2009 sander et al 2011 campione and evans 2012 given taxonomic uncertainties along with temporal stratigraphic and geographical challenges it is possible the number of coexisting sauropod species was as high as 20 carrano and velez juarbe 2006 farlow et al 2010 tschopp et al 2015 gill et al 2018 maltese et al 2018 modern terrestrial biomes have no such biodiverse assemblage of whale sized herbivores to observe so although questions about sauropod biology attract significant research attention most hypotheses about them remain untested foster 2003 carrano and velez juarbe 2006 sander et al 2011 myers et al 2012 carrano et al 2016 further many components of sauropod biology have not been considered such as their postmortem impact on the environment or their potential influence on the evolution of other groups carnosaur foraging ecology is not well understood either despite intense scientific interest van valkenburgh and molnar 2002 henderson 2003 cobos et al 2014 henderson and nichols 2015 gignac and erickson 2017 we developed an abs specifically to test the hypothesis that allosaurus in the morrison formation and potentially carnosaurs elsewhere evolved to capitalize on sauropod carrion as their primary energetic resources and were functionally obligate scavengers we defined agents in the model based on anatomical and physiological data recovered for dinosaurs in order to ground the simulation in realistic parameters carnosaur agents were trialed with metabolic costs of ectotherms mesotherms and endotherms while sauropod agents and their resulting carcasses behaved according to modern estimates of mass and carcass decay rates in this way we were able to reconstruct potential population and community ecology scenarios that are currently unobservable to date one other agent based simulation has been implemented to resolve theropod trophic ecology with respect to carrion resources kane et al 2016 but was fundamentally flawed in specific ways these authors concluded that facultative scavenging would have been favorable for large and middle sized theropods but would not have fully sustained them however their tests simulated the modern serengeti as a correlate of the morrison formation producing carrion at a rate of 4 38 kg per km2 per day the morrison was orders of magnitude more productive than this because of its numerous giant sauropods trammer 2011 the authors also set a maximum carcass detection distance of 2 km in their theropod agents which was probably too conservative given that many modern animals can smell carcasses across distances greater than 10 km finally the carcasses represented in their model persisted on the landscape for only 7 days which is probably unrealistic for most large vertebrate carcasses some have argued that only soaring specialists are able to survive as obligate scavengers given the low cost of soaring flight in carcass detection kane et al 2016 ruxton and houston 2004 results of our abs tests did not support this conclusion birds indeed are extremely efficient and scavenging birds often consume 85 90 of a carcass before mammals arrive making those calories unavailable to other carnivores in the ecosystem the impact of vultures on carnivore communities is measurable vulture absence increases populations of facultative scavengers because abundance of low cost calories is higher without them devault et al 2011 hill et al 2018 markandya et al 2008 ostfeld and keesing 2000 pardo barquin et al 2019 but we did not include soaring specialists in abs trials described here because pterosaurs from the late jurassic were mostly eagle sized animals that were adapted to consume fish frey and tischlinger 2012 their small size alone would have prevented them from competing against large allosaurs at carcass sites in fact soaring carrion specialists have not been conclusively identified from any part of the mesozoic era so we considered them immaterial to this research 2 methods the simulation was written in python 3 8 5 with the mesa library of agent based modeling tools masad and kazil 2015 it also relied on the scientific analysis libraries pandas numpy and networkx hagberg et al 2008 harris et al 2020 reback et al 2020 and was conceptually based on the netlogo wolf sheep predation model tisue and wilensky 2004 our version rested on three main agent types carnosaurs sauropods and the carcasses resulting from their deaths carnosaur agents were divided into three sub types carnosaur scavengers carnosaur predators and carnosaur alphas the simulation ran on a featureless toroidal 70 70 grid meant to represent 4 900 km2 of landscape used by the four principal agent types already mentioned figure 1 aside from this a few other settings differentiated this model from typical wolf sheep models in particular we were primarily concerned with postmortem use of sauropod carcasses by other animals so only carnosaur agent types incurred daily energetic costs but sauropod agents did not sauropod energetic regimes and sauropod population systems themselves were addressed purely as circumstantial matters but we recognize that future modeling projects could improve our knowledge of these aspects of their zoology but because of this we discarded the grass resource for herbivores and capped the population of sauropods against carrying capacity estimates published for these species that is roughly 1 2 km2 farlow et al 2010 we did however distribute the age and size classes of sauropods differently for certain tests within this limitation first to agree with the population biology values in published figures but also to see how changes to the population structures of these animals may have impacted local carnivore consumers each model run was executed on a 365 step interval to loosely conform to days in one year agents reproduced asexually on a continuous basis as in other implementations of the wolf sheep model and weren t reproductively bound by breeding seasons or other factors present in living systems data were gathered and plotted at runtime of each simulation trial and graphs were rendered with matplotlib in pandas 2 1 carnosaur agents carnosaur agents were modeled after individuals of allosaurus by far the most abundant theropod in the morrison formation weighing 2 000 kg each following bates et al 2009 they reproduced at 02 rate and new agents had between 7 and 10 days to find food or they ran out of energy and died each model was initialized with a starting population of 30 individuals regardless of subtype depending on the test carnosaur agents were assigned daily energy needs based on field metabolic rates fmr of three physiologically distinct modern groups mammalian endotherms varanid mesotherms and classically reptilian ectotherms fmr values measure the energy costs animals accrue during routine life activities and are more useful than basal metabolic rate bmr to approximate energy demands bennett and nagy 1977 gazzola et al 2007 hudson et al 2013 fmr equations have been substantiated empirically by numerous authors with confidence above 90 and follow the format of bmr equations peterson et al 1990 west et al 1997 dodds et al 2001 white and seymour 2003 white et al 2006 banavar et al 2010 that is they are based on the model x amb and expressed in kj day 1 where a is the intercept m is the animal s mass in grams and b is the allometric slope variable bennett and nagy 1977 nagy 1999 nagy 2005 because energetic costs in vertebrates are tightly linked to the organism s mass and metabolic engine this means that in our model 2 000 kg allosaurs with reptile metabolism needed 11 kg of meat per day to live mesotherms needed ca 17 kg while expensive endotherms required roughly 28 kg per day for more on how these values were derived see supplementary methods sm1 carnosaur agents were able to consume a maximum of 2 5 days worth of food at each step event a conservative figure given that modern animals can often consume several days worth of calories in a single sitting and can often survive weeks without food mccue et al 2010 adult tigers have been reported to consume 34 kg in a single day ca 4 times their daily requirement nowak and wilson 1999 while komodo dragons can consume 80 of their own body weight in one meal losos and greene 1988 each individual carnosaur agent was assigned a carcass detection radius between 1 and 10 km as an extension of its moore neighborhood if a carnosaur agent located a carcass or carcasses within this radius it moved toward the carcass prioritizing the closest target to itself once an agent reached a carcass object it consumed up to its maximum daily consumption rate at each step until the carcass was depleted or disappeared if no carcass objects were detected the agent moved to a random adjacent grid square see supplementary methods sm2 for additional details carnosaur scavengers were not able to detect or interact with living sauropod agents on the other hand carnosaur predators were given odds to kill living sauropod agents based on certain conditions if a carnosaur predator encountered a sauropod the former had a 35 chance to kill it a 10 chance of being killed by the sauropod and a 55 chance of neither result but see results we varied these values to compare relative value of each attribute these conditions are important to the realism of the model firstly because predation attempts usually fail in modern animals this is true of specialists and generalists alike whether they hunt in groups or solitarily and regardless of prey size preferences orsdol 1984 hayward and kerley 2005 finally we limited carnosaur predators to only attack sauropods below 3 000 kg large sauropods were probably immune to predation of any kind sander et al 2011 and modern predators rarely attack prey significantly larger than themselves de visser et al 2011 so we considered this limitation to be appropriate details presented in supplementary methods sm3 dominance hierarchies at carcass sites are ubiquitous phenomena in carrion ecology in light of this carnosaur alphas were introduced to test the value of dominance to survival in scavenging communities carnosaur scavengers were repelled by carnosaur alphas when both occupied the same carcass site and were unable to return to it as long as the space was occupied by more dominant agents 2 2 sauropod agents each sauropod agent moved randomly throughout the grid by one square per step they reproduced exponentially until population density was between 1 and 1 6 animals per km2 and the simulation enforced this continually throughout the model at any given time the model landscape contained between 4 800 and 7 200 sauropods they did not consume other material for energy and they did not react to other agents except in the case of carnosaur predators which were occasionally able to kill them or be killed by them they were converted to carcass objects at death whether death was caused passively or by carnosaur predators we set their maximum adult mass at 45 000 kg based on estimates of brachiosaurus seebacher 2001 benson et al 2018 but could have represented any collective population of the numerous large sauropods present in the morrison formation population structure reflected age and size class distribution estimated for sauropods by farlow et al 2010 this resulted in roughly 30 of the animals as adults at any given time although we varied this attribute in different tests see results which the authors note is representative of large vertebrates in many wild populations including unrelated taxa with different life history strategies such as ostriches struthio camelus and african elephants loxodonta africana thus we were confident with this assumption importantly sauropod agents experienced odds of mortality between 02 and 05 to account for deaths caused by disease starvation or senescence which were probably significant threats to these giant herbivores just as they are in herbivores of today young and very old sauropods likely were especially vulnerable to the long periods of resource deprivation that typify ecosystems such as those represented in the morrison formation engelmann et al 2004 turner and peterson 2004 parrish et al 2004 noto et al 2010 peterson et al 2017 we also ran the model to simulate seasonal changes in productive output during this cycle odds of sauropod agent mortality increased to 3x the background odds for a total of 60 consecutive steps and following this interval we set 60 steps with no mortality but most sauropods were probably immune to predation so we set our mortality rates to follow modern herbivore populations that experience no predation pressure for more on the rationale behind this see supplementary methods sm4 2 3 carcass objects carcass objects inherited mass and location properties from their parent sauropod agents if an 8 000 kg sauropod agent died whether from passive causes or from predation the resulting carcass object would originate at 8 000 kg as well and would retain its position in the grid for the remainder of its existence carcass objects lost mass either as a result of decay or as carnosaurs consumed them if an allosaur ate 40 kg in a consumption step the carcass lost 40 kg of mass in addition to its decay loss during that step carcasses disappeared if they reached below 15 of their initial mass whether by agent free decay or by consumption from allosaurs sauropod agent deaths caused between 69 and 85 carcasses to appear on the landscape each day remains of dead sauropods likely were present on the landscape for months but possibly more than 6 years bader et al 2009 drumheller et al 2020 mchugh et al 2020 and we viewed this fact as an important albeit self evident component of the model because we calculated mass changes on carcass objects over time as they decayed numerous environmental variables including temperature local insect species and cadaver mass influence decay rates and researchers disagree about the relative importance of each simmons et al 2010 sutherland et al 2013 farwig et al 2014 turner et al 2017 in fact cadaver decay research is not well represented in the literature except for a few species most commonly domestic pigs so we don t have an especially large comparison pool for sauropod carcasses a few principles are generally accepted however for example it is uncommon for invertebrate scavengers to consume appreciable amounts of carrion in wild conditions because mammalian and avian scavengers often rapidly deplete much of a carcass before insects arrive having said that controlled experiments demonstrate that african tropical fly larvae are able to consume 2 kg carcasses in roughly 3 days while carcasses of the same mass in neotropical forests routinely persist on the landscape for more than 10 days houston 1985 north american deer carcasses odocoileus spp take between 18 and 101 days to decompose depending on the season and ambient temperature jennelle et al 2009 african elephant loxodonta africana cadavers are targeted by carnivores for several weeks post mortem even after vultures abandon them douglas hamilton and hillman 1981 bradshaw 2008 white and diedrich 2012 they remain distinguishable on the landscape more than a year after mortality and take between 2 12 years to disappear hanks et al 1973 dudley et al 2001 modern cetaceans are the only animals approaching the mass of ancient sauropods but research on beached whales has heretofore focused on their impact to municipalities and appropriate disposal rather than their decomposition rates it is generally recognized that whale carcasses take months to decay in the absence of vertebrate scavengers tucker et al 2018 and sauropod cadavers likely also decayed over several months as well because pig carcasses are the most studied and because they demonstrate the consistent sigmoidal decomposition pattern recognized for all vertebrate corpses we used a 10 kg pig carcass decay pattern to govern decay of sauropod carcass objects the pig in question was observed in high elevation grassland páramo colombia 3 035 m and decayed to roughly 20 of its live weight in 83 days martinez et al 2007 while we recognize that 83 days is extremely conservative for sauropod sized carcasses it should be noted that a 600 kg european bison carcass bison bonasus approaches 20 of its original mass after ca 106 days in the temperate białowieża primeval forest poland selva et al 2003 the bison carcass only takes 28 more time to decompose than the pig despite more favorable environmental conditions and its 6 000 greater mass but its mass and presumably the mass of all cadavers follow the same sigmoidal decomposition curve there is no reason to believe that sauropod carcasses behaved differently than modern vertebrate corpses either fundamentally or because of environmental factors we plotted cadaver mass of the aforementioned pig as it decomposed then a line of best fit was applied in prism v 8 2 1 and produced the following vertebrate corpse decay equation r 87 1 e 0 208506n 6 12556 100 where r is the percentage of remaining mass n days after mortality and e is euler s number all carcass objects lost mass on a per step basis according to this equation figure 2 3 results 3 1 carnosaur agents carnosaur scavengers had a clear survival advantage when carcass detection range was high when metabolic costs were low or both for example a 2 000 kg carnosaur scavenger with reptilian ectotherm metabolism had a daily meat requirement of 11 kg these agents were cheap enough that even with a detection radius of 3 km carcass resources supported roughly 60 of them at any given time and they did not experience extinction detection range of 5 km carried at least 638 carnosaurs while 6 km detection range supported between 1 210 and 1 456 figure 3 the latter numbers are important because they compute a population density between 4 9 and 5 9 kg of biomass per hectare present day carnivorous reptiles typically occupy 5 5 kg of biomass per hectare lovich et al 2018 so it would be reasonable to accept this as a likely approximation of real conditions at baseline if carnosaurs like allosaurus were ectotherms interestingly this was true even when large adult sauropod agents comprised only 10 of the population so even when the share of large animals was low carnosaur agents were able to survive purely on carrion the 6 km detection radius appears to be a point of diminishing returns on population support for reptilian ectotherms in that there may not have been a significant survival advantage for allosaurs with 7 km detection range versus those with 6 km detection range while those with less than 6 km would have been significantly distressed in comparison table 1 carnosaur alphas with 6 km detection range outcompeted carnosaur scavengers with 7 km detection range albeit not fully the former ended the trial with 617 individuals and the latter 495 this is an overall population minimum of 1 112 carnosaurs on the landscape slightly lower than that supported in non competitive simulations interestingly this appears to mimic the dominance system between turkey vultures cathartes aura and black vultures coragyps attratus turkey vultures often arrive at carcasses first but are driven away by black vultures once the latter arrive buckley 1999 dominance systems were almost certainly important to carnosaur behavior at carcass sites and in the future more complex models could illuminate interrelationships between dominance carcass detection and survival success of allosaurus and kin carnosaur predators were able to exploit additional resources because they were able to profit from a small share of the living sauropods on the landscape and not just the carcasses generated by passive forces their presence in some trials caused a temporary peak in number of carcasses on a landscape as a result of successful kills however they were unable to compete against carnosaur scavengers even as cheap ectotherms and only avoided extinction at this metabolism when carcass detection ranges were 9 km or greater even at 9 km the minimum population of these agents only was 244 at end of runtime versus 1 690 carnosaur scavengers in that trial this also implies that even when carnosaur predators had opportunities to hunt their survival success was leveraged on their ability to detect carcass resources rather than their hunting abilities it is important to note that because carnosaur predators were only able to target sauropods below 3 000 kg in mass less than 10 of the sauropod population was vulnerable to predation at any given time the morrison formation was very diverse and included smaller non sauropod species which could have been more accessible prey targets but given that these included dangerous armored dinosaurs such as ankylosaurs and stegosaurs we suspect that allosaurs probably did not risk their safety attacking them except when forced to by long seasons of very low sauropod mortality overall population support in mesothermic carnosaur scavengers was markedly lower than in ectotherms they went extinct if carcass detection range was below 6 km table 1 exponential growth was not achieved until agents had detection ranges of 9 km or greater at 10 km detection range the carcass producing environment supported between 1 299 and 1 899 animals which also returns a favorable population density compared to that observed in modern carnivorous reptiles when we introduced dominance rules to mesotherm tests carnosaur alphas with 9 km detection radius were able to exercise a survival advantage over non dominant competitors with 10 km detection range alphas numbered 744 while non dominant agents numbered 522 in trials involving predatory mesotherms hunters were at a significant disadvantage against obligate scavenging rivals surviving a maximum of 57 steps figure 4 endothermic carnosaur scavengers were unable to survive unless their carcass detection range was 9 km or greater when detection was limited to 8 km the model generated a maximum of 39 carnosaurs of this type and they went extinct by step 90 with 9 km detection range the minimum population supported was 300 peaking at 465 while 10 km radius supported a minimum of 759 carnosaurs it is possible that if carnosaurs were endotherms they may have benefited from faster traveling speeds afforded by higher activity levels and it is likely that they would have been able to travel many kilometers in a single day anyway population density for large carnivorous mammals is ca 24 kg ha and the lower population of carnosaur scavengers as endotherms here returns 1 24 kg ha this does not rule out the possibility that allosaurus and related taxa were endotherms however because environments like the morrison formation were much more productive than any observed recently it is possible that carnosaurs were able to occupy greater population densities because of this carnosaur predators were not always unsuccessful as mentioned ectothermic predators were able to survive with detection range of 9 km while mesothermic predators went extinct in all carcass detection brackets mesothermic agents were able to avoid extinction only as the maximum size of sauropod agents went down for example when maximum sauropod agent size was limited to 10 000 kg ca 30 of the sauropod agents were targetable prey because the share was still too low predator agents struggled to survive past 100 steps figure 5 this was generally true even when predation success odds were 45 and chance of death on attack was 0 predators survived when sauropod agents were limited to maximum size of 4 000 kg mean carcass mass at death for these animals was 2 067 kg and the population of carnosaur predators reached 122 individuals versus 301 carnosaur scavengers table 2 the overall share of targetable prey was high enough to support predators but carcasses were still large enough and decayed slowly enough to be available for other agents to profit from it also means that if the amount of available carrion was reduced in other ways by superefficient insect species or specialized mesoscavengers carnosaurs would have survived without evolutionary pressure to hunt however endothermic predators were too expensive and were not able to meet their energy budgets in any trial when we trialed the simulation with changes in seasonality mesothermic carnosaur scavengers were exposed to high yield and low yield intervals wherein as previously described a surplus of sauropod carcasses became available followed by a period of scarcity we did this to simulate productivity cycles in modern semi arid biomes and as expected the population of mesothermic carnosaur scavengers grew rapidly from the onset we anticipated the carcass scarcity interval to limit population growth but because sauropod carcasses didn t usually disappear until between 29 and 83 steps after they were generated they served as long term reservoirs of energy because of this mesothermic carnosaur agents experienced no adverse survival events during the scarcity interval 3 2 carcasses carcasses appeared on the landscape at a rate of between 69 and 85 bodies per step and averaged between 21 000 and 25 000 kg except in trials where smaller sauropod agents were implemented they behaved as programmed 3 3 data availability all figures and data can be recreated using our code which has been made publicly available and can be found here https github com cmrn crmns phl abm data aggregation and graphs were created using matplotlib in python 4 discussion if living carnosaurs such as allosaurus behaved according to the variables and circumstances we modeled they were probably able to survive purely on carrion produced as a byproduct of contemporaneous sauropod populations contrary to intuitive expectations carnosaur agents with higher rates of predation success were at a selective disadvantage due to excess metabolic and survival costs they incurred agents with the fewest predation attempts and greatest carcass detection ranges had the highest odds of survival because of this it is possible that carnosaurs were terrestrial analogues of modern vultures this may explain why carnosaurs of the morrison formation and elsewhere developed weak senses zelenitsky et al 2011 including poor to non existent binocular vision stevens 2006 weak bite forces rayfield et al 2001 meers 2002 henderson 2003 bates and falkingham 2012 and no evident locomotor specialization snively 2003 hutchinson and allen 2009 snively et al 2019 because they were not forced to evolve predatory adaptations to survive 4 1 adaptations for scavenging the value of sauropod cadavers in late jurassic communities is perhaps to be expected given that comparably sized whale carcasses often support diverse trophic communities for decades postmortem smith et al 2015 individual beached whale carcasses in the arctic can sustain hundreds of polar bears ursus maritimus over several months laidre et al 2018 sauropod carcasses did not float great distances or descend into harsh abyssal environments so it is likely that they were more predictably available to local vertebrate consumers than whale carcasses are today species evolve toward equilibrium against their primary survival stressors and resource based stressors are among the strongest of these eldredge and gould 1972 it is logical that a group of vertebrate consumers would evolve to exploit a calorie source as abundant and rich as sauropod carcasses and carnosaur adaptations appear to reflect this if viewed as vulture analogues it is also difficult to explain what other environmental processes could have acted on sauropod remains if theropods were for some reason unable to consume them niches often arise because of the competitive exclusion principle which predicts that organisms in a single environment will exploit the most profitable available resources and will specialize to reduce competitive overlap within their communities carbone et al 2011 foster et al 2013 scavengers and predators both specialize according to this principle in modern biomes among scavengers this is most obvious in vultures but is typical in other terrestrial vertebrate groups as well weak jaws are common in these animals and their cervical anatomy is adapted to resist pulling and ripping forces for example vulture guilds are divided into three main groups based on these characteristics with rippers scrappers and gulpers present in old world and new world vultures alike houston 1988 hertel 1994 gomez et al 2008 hille et al 2016 blumstein et al 2017 rippers such as the king vulture sarcorhamphus papa use powerful necks and strain resistant strongly recurved beaks to capitalize on tough carcass units such as skin and hide they employ fast biting scissor motions while feeding fisher 1944 this allows gulpers like the black vulture coragyps atratus which evolved a narrow flexible skull and weak jaws to swallow large chunks of viscera once they become exposed houston 1988 scrappers are well represented in taxa like the turkey vulture cathartes aura which are adapted to consume discarded fleshy elements common to a carcass periphery and have the weakest least developed beak recurvature members of this guild often rely on other birds to expose and distribute viscera it also is likely that because carnosaurs were much larger than birds and had teeth instead of more lightly built beaks they probably did not struggle to open carcasses and were able to exploit cadavers more effectively than today s avian scavengers scavenging adaptations are not limited to avian taxa but are enforced in large mammalian vertebrates as well the saber toothed marsupial thylacosmilus has been traditionally regarded as a form convergent with large prey specialists such as those in smilodon but recent analysis of t atrox concluded that the animal was probably a carrion specialist because of craniodental features including extremely weak bite force and cervical anatomy optimized for ripping and pulling behaviors janis et al 2020 the authors noted that t atrox has probably been shoehorned into the apex predator role by previous investigators because of assumptions but that it was poorly adapted to overpower prey due to its weak jaws and low potential for agility allosaurus also exemplifies many of these key characteristics as seen in gulpers allosaurus demonstrated unusually wide gape and cranial kinesis that probably allowed it to swallow large volumes in a single gulp frazzetta and kardong 2002 henderson 2003 holliday and witmer 2008 lautenschlager 2015 furthermore its neck was designed to apply pulling and ripping forces snively and russell 2007a snively et al 2013 as are the necks of vultures and nearly all vertebrate scavenging specialists böhmer et al 2019 allosaurus bite force specifically was also weak perhaps only ca 5 494 n while more recent work reported a potential maximum of 8 724 n erickson 2001 rayfield 2001 bates and falkingham 2012 these numbers are respectively 23 and 38 of the value predicted for a mammalian predator of its size as determined based on relationships among bite force prey size and body mass in modern taxa meers 2002 wroe et al 2005 slater and van valkenburgh 2009 slater et al 2010 indeed the trend of weak jaws appears broadly applicable to all carnosaurs rayfield et al 2001 meers 2002 henderson 2003 snively et al 2006 mazzetta et al 2009 sakamoto 2010 rayfield 2011 lautenschlager 2015 high bite force is known to reduce prey handling time herrell et al 2007 and it is difficult to explain why feeding systems in carnivorous dinosaurs would favor weak skulls given the powerful attributes of their supposed quarry furthermore allosaurus bite force architecture is characterized by high efficiency fast biting as is common especially to rippers hertel 1994 sakamoto 2010 in felids cranial size is sacrificed to accommodate necessary bite force musculature to kill prey because food processing stresses drove their evolution kitchener et al 2010 hartstone rose et al 2012 evidence suggests that food processing stresses also drove carnosaur evolution but weak craniodental anatomy strongly suggests they were adapted to fundamentally different ecological roles dawkins and krebs 1979 sakamoto 2010 sakamoto et al 2010 morales and giannini 2013 in fact nearly all modern terrestrial large prey specialists employ powerful muscle driven bite forces to kill prey and there is no reason to expect otherwise of mesozoic animals meers 2002 henderson 2003 therrien 2005 wroe et al 2005 christiansen and adolfssen 2005 christiansen et al 2007 wroe et al 2007 wroe and milne 2007 anderson et al 2008 ellis 2009 meachen samuels van valkenburgh 2009 kitchener et al 2010 sakamoto et al 2010 erickson et al 2012 hartstone rose et al 2012 morales and giannini 2013 to expand on this predatory adaptations are well understood and contrast sharply with those of most carnosaurs meachen samuels and van valkenburgh 2009 van valkenburgh and molnar 2002 although authors often claim they employed the same hunting behaviors as modern apex predators hone and rauhut 2010 wallach et al 2015 predators must first recognize and locate a target in space then intercept it and subdue it sergio et al 2014 they overcome these hunting challenges with a predictable suite of features including wide bifocal fields of view bfov and other optical specializations to resolve prey detection problems along with strongly reinforced craniodental features pretterer et al 2004 heesy et al 2008 hornocker and negri 2010 veilleux and kirk 2014 lawson et al 2019 they also employ acute senses of hearing and smell and characteristically use adaptations for speed or agility to capture and dispatch prey iriarte díaz 2002 carbone et al 2007 for example felids have a binocular field of view bfov of ca 130 figure 6 large forward facing eyes curved corneas that maximize visual depth perception and greatly enhanced low light vision kitchener et al 2010 mines and ochieng 2017 selective pressure on felid visual tools is very strong and even influences retinal cone densities specific to each species hunting style ahnelt et al 2006 this is unsurprising given that visual field configuration follows foraging ecology and is not simply a reflection of ancestry or passive forces ahnelt et al 2006 martin 2009 2014 canids are also top predators and possess ca 60 of bfov miller and murphy 1995 byosiere et al 2018 comparable to that of tyrannosaurus rex stevens 2006 stereoscopic prey location systems are not limited to mammalia or to apex predators most snakes occupy low positions in the food web for most of their lives and require laterally facing eyes to detect threats even so diurnal visually hunting species exhibit roughly double the binocular field of view of non visually hunting species walls 1944 hughes 1977 safer and grace 2004 krysko 2005 crotaline boid and pythonid snakes use forward facing thermal pits in lieu of ocular instruments to target prey stereoscopically sichert et al 2006 these snakes retain laterally facing eyes to identify danger but their survival as predators requires accurate prey targeting systems thus several groups independently developed stereoscopic infrared sensing tools indeed much research has focused on the sensitivity of their thermal organs and the improved striking accuracy provided by their forward facing orientation jones et al 2001 krochmal et al 2004 goris 2011 chen et al 2012 chen et al 2017 schraft and clark 2019 even in vultures bfov increases as predatory behavior increases the white headed vulture trigonoceps occipitalis is taxonomically close to the obligate scavenging vultures in gyps the latter have only 20 of binocular overlap the unspecialized condition even though they locate carcasses visually and cannot do so via olfaction but because the white headed vulture regularly captures live prey its bfov is over 30 and averages 2 3x greater overall visual coverage area than its obligate scavenging relatives portugal et al 2017 this is to say nothing of the other raptors in accipitriformes predators thereof which developed bifoveate retinae greater bfov more densely packed retinal cells and larger eyes than their carrion specialist relatives potier et al 2016 2017 falconiformes evolved wide bfov and bifoveate retinae independently as a response to predation needs but their closest relatives the non predatory psittaciformes suh et al 2011 have laterally facing eyes and often lack foveae altogether mitkus et al 2014 comparatively allosaurus had very narrow binocular field of view between 10 and 20 stevens 2006 not only is this value like those reported in modern scavenging birds it is also the baseline condition for unspecialized oreinirostral animals busbey 1995 rayfield and milner 2008 and confirms that allosaurus were under no selective pressure to stereoscopically target objects whether prey or otherwise in three dimensional space there also is no evidence that allosaurs evolved innovative substitutes for stereoscopic vision as snakes did with infrared pits or bats with echolocation adult crocodylians may appear to be a minor exception at first in that they occupy top predator positions and employ ambush tactics to capture prey despite narrow bfov and limited overall agility but they conceal themselves under water to ambush their targets very few dinosaur lineages were semi aquatic so comparison with allosaurs is inappropriate furthermore given their weak jaws it is difficult to reasonably assume that allosaurus and modern crocodylians share niche specific selective pressures because the latter evolved powerful jaws as would be expected of large prey specialists carnosaurs such as allosaurus also had poorly developed auditory senses and were probably unable to detect subtle sounds rogers 1998 witmer and ridgely 2009 zelenitsky et al 2011 this would be a significant anomaly if allosaurus were a predator given that modern apex predators especially those of large terrestrial herbivores rely heavily on their senses of hearing both to locate prey and to recognize stealth challenges they encounter during ambush and stalking activities they have specific auditory adaptations including enlarged external ears greatly expanded auditory bullae and ear canal size when compared to linear scaling expectations and even specialized auditory cortical neurons this is true for pack hunting predators such as lions panthera leo solitary species such as tigers pantheria tigris and for cursorial species like cheetahs acinonyx jubatus and canids heffner 2004 kitchener et al 2010 carr and christiansen dalsgaard 2015 mason 2016 sakai et al 2016 along with specialized night vision and bite force tools these adaptations are enforced genetically because they evolved to overcome hunting challenges huang et al 2000 nummela et al 2013 kim et al 2017 even with these specializations most predation attempts fail this is true whether they hunt in groups or solitarily and irrespective of prey size preferences orsdol 1984 hayward and kerley 2005 if allosaurus and its relatives were under the same predation based evolutionary pressures as felids and canids of today one would predict the presence of excellent auditory and other senses in carnosaur lineages regardless of their hunting behaviors but this is not the case agrawal 2017 wu and wang 2019 it has been argued that olfaction is of principal importance to scavenging specialists in carcass detection it is true that cathartes vultures evolved to recognize odors uniquely present in decaying flesh and this fact has been established since at least the late 1800 s barrows 1887 mammalian facultative scavengers also use olfaction to find corpses across great distances particularly where geographic barriers obfuscate carcass localities kane et al 2016 allosaurus olfactory bulbs were not large for an animal its size zelenitsky et al 2011 but this probably implies very little about its foraging ecology for two reasons first olfactory bulb size is correlated with home range size among modern carnivores so it is a poor signal with respect to foraging ecology gittleman 1991 second most of today s successful vultures lack any olfactory sense vision is the primary carcass detection tool in unrelated species such as the california condor gymnogyps californianus the andean condor vultur gryphus and all members of gyps buechley and sekercioglu 2016 mateo tomas and olea 2018 so odor detection is not a prerequisite adaptation for carrion specialization it is more likely that olfaction evolved in cathartes vultures under selective pressure to find carrion hidden in dense neotropical forests houston 1985 1988 but this might not have been a predominant challenge in morrison formation savannahs further the strong and presumably dense odors produced by multi tonne sauropod carcasses probably required no exceptional odor differentiation abilities and their large size probably rendered them visually conspicuous from great distances as well many large theropods including allosaurus torvosaurus and ceratosaurus in the morrison formation but also monolophosaurus carcharodontosaurus concavenator cryolophosaurus dilophosaurus giganotosaurus and other carnosaurs elsewhere possessed decorative head ornamentation and other elaborate features that would have been obstacles to animals that relied on stealth during ambush stalking or pursuit behaviors gates et al 2016 the same is true of modern vultures which often exhibit bizarre display features that serve to help identify conspecifics and to intimidate competitors at carcass sites and interestingly this also may have been the case in thylacosmilus graves 2016 cuesta et al 2018 janis et al 2020 in some ways morphological features of allosaurus crania and jaws appear to parallel those of komodo dragons varanus komodoensis which also have weak jaws and a craniocervical anatomy designed to resist pull loading for these reasons researchers often consider the two species to be morphologically convergent farlow 1976 moreno et al 2008 d amore and blumensehine 2009 sakamoto 2010 snively et al 2013 mccurry et al 2015 however substantial evidence demonstrates that komodo dragons compensate for weak bite force either with venom septically infectious bites or both and thereby insulate themselves from evolutionary stresses that would otherwise favor strong jaws fry et al 2009 bull et al 2010 mccurry et al 2015 bishop et al 2017 there is no evidence that large theropods produced venom or were able to envenomate others so while possible it is unlikely that morrison carnivores were adapted for komodo dragon style predation nor is it reasonable to assume that they overcame their bite force deficiencies with snake style constriction machairodont dentition or even other unidentified means imaginative hypotheses about allosaurus cranial architecture adapted for hatchet attack behavior have been rightly challenged as unreasonable and scientifically unjustifiable rayfield et al 2001 frazzetta and kardong 2002 antón et al 2003 and considering data reported here will not further be entertained having said that although komodo dragons use chemical means to subdue prey they are not considered specialists of large prey they evolved as generalist carnivores and consume predominantly carrion hocknull et al 2009 shine and somaweera 2019 which could make morphological comparisons to allosaurus more appropriate this is not to argue that allosaurs were unable to hunt nor is it to speculate about hypothetical hunting methods dinosaurs could have used for one thing even obligate scavengers such as the andean condor vultur gryphus have been observed hunting and killing small prey gailey and bolwig 1973 so carnosaurs were also likely able to kill animals if conditions were right but condors possess few obvious adaptations to facilitate predation because they evolved to acquire most of their calories from carrion likewise critical tests of allosaur survival probably were not related to predation but to their ability to access sauropod carrion 4 2 sauropod carrion in other mesozoic systems sauropods and their carcasses were not unique to the morrison formation they dominated herbivore communities on most continents throughout the jurassic and cretaceous periods if they were truly immune to predation their existence may have precluded the evolution of terrestrial obligate predators it appears this may be the case because most well known large carnosaurs mimic the adaptations of allosaurus lacking predatory tools such as binocular vision cranially reinforced bite force architecture speed or agility south american forms in giganotosaurus and majungosaurus possessed weak skulls like in allosaurus coria and currie 2003 mazzetta et al 2004 slater et al 2010 but lived alongside multiple species of titanosaurs that potentially reached 90 000 124 000 kg in mass benson et al 2014 2018 vieira et al 2014 peczkis 1995 apesteguía 2007 novas et al 2013 given current knowledge it is difficult to imagine that the carcasses of these giants would have been ignored or unavailable to local carnivores locating and consuming this carrion would have tested carnosaur survival much more than predation success in part because of the abundance of carrion and in part because there were few opportunities to reliably kill sauropods during most of their lives questions about seemingly lopsided carnivore heavy environments like the kem kem and bahariya formations in north africa delcourt and grillo 2017 ibrahim et al 2020 may also be satisfied by a better understanding of sauropod carrion ecology true to form carcharodontosaurus saharicus also had braincase and skull morphology like that of allosaurus sereno et al 1996 rogers 1998 larsson et al 2000 larsson 2001 eddy and clarke 2011 proportionally weak jaws specialized for fast jaw closure coria and currie 2003 henderson and nicholls 2015 and almost no binocular field of vision stevens 2006 nityananda and read 2017 individuals of the species are estimated to have weighed between 4 000 and 6 000 kg seebacher 2001 therrien and henderson 2007 a 6 000 kg mesothermic theropod such as this would have required 46 6 kg of meat per day to survive if its titanosaur neighbors such as paralititan reached 79 000 kg in mass as has been proposed smith et al 2001 candeiro 2015 the abs predicted population support of between 26 and 52 mesothermic carcharodontosaurus individuals when carcass detection was 8 km this is approximately the same population of mesothermic allosaurus with 6 km carcass detection range 4 3 sauropod free systems if the presence of sauropods influenced the evolution of carnivore groups the lack of sauropod sized animals in other environments probably pressured carnivores to meet their energy budgets differently for example north american tyrannosaurs evolved in the absence of any significant sauropod presence due to the north american sauropod hiatus d emic et al 2010 d emic and foreman 2012 and are recognized as fundamentally unique among large theropods with respect to morphological adaptations because they appear to mirror adaptations present in living apex predators we trialed the abs conditions to compare systems of this type as well with a baseline passive carcass appearance rate of 84 per step dominant carnivores were modeled after tyrannosaurus rex which reached estimated adult mass between 5 000 8 870 kg persons et al 2019 resulting in energy needs of 38 8 65 5 kg of meat per day as a mesotherm and 53 6 79 3 kg as an endotherm the dominant herbivores were modeled after triceratops the most abundant hell creek dinosaur with a maximum mass of 14 000 kg benson et al 2014 and tyrannosaur predators could kill only those under 8 000 kg this means that between 50 and 60 of the triceratops agents were available as prey targets for predator agents at any given time survival as obligate scavengers was not profitable unless tyrannosaur energy needs were below 60 kg of meat per day and carcass detection was 10 km these conditions supported between 10 and 18 tyrannosaur scavengers on the landscape at any given time this computes a density of 29 kg of biomass per hectare which agrees favorably with population densities of today s large carnivorous mammals lovich et al 2018 it also fits into the energy budgets of midrange adult t rex individuals as calculated with respect to mass and metabolic engine estimates having said that t rex was a common dinosaur in its ecosystem comprising between 15 24 of the animals reflected in the hell creek fossil record whereas triceratops comprised at least 40 but up to 69 horner et al 2011 so a population support of 18 tyrannosaurs does not appear high enough to agree with fossil abundance observations tyrannosaur predators were able to avoid extinction even as expensive endotherms with only 6 km carcass detection range their population plateaued between 122 and 203 individuals or at least 2 kg of biomass per hectare carcasses provided to the landscape by predatory activities resulted in as many as 218 cadavers on the gridspace at any one time a surplus of more than 150 above the baseline successful predators were not able to deplete freshly killed carcasses fast enough to eliminate them from the landscape before other agents arrived so the carcass surplus benefited conspecifics by increasing the total available supply of cheap calories this is much different than in modern biomes where fresh carcasses are frequently depleted by avian scavengers in a matter of hours interestingly asian tyrannosaurs such as tarbosaurus have dorsolaterally compressed skulls and reduced binocular vision compared to north american sister taxa hurum and sabath 2003 this might be because they coexisted with titanosaurian sauropods like nemegtosaurus and opisthocoelicaudia which may have provided scavenging resources abundant enough to support them without predatory adaptations as mesotherms the total population of tyrannosaur agents that is both predators and scavengers exceeded 450 individuals by step 140 which computes a population density of 7 4 kg ha in simulations with greater detection ranges the population often rose above 1 000 within 150 steps reaching a plateau between 1 261 and 1 388 these results compute population densities greater than those observed in modern carnivorous reptiles and much greater than for carnivorous mammals according to lovich et al 2018 it is possible that north american tyrannosaurs evolved stereoscopic vision stevens 2006 acute senses witmer and ridgely 2009 brusatte et al 2016 powerful jaws currie et al 2003 snively and russell 2003 hurum and sabath 2003 rayfield 2004 snively and russell 2007a 2007b snively et al 2006 bates and falkingham 2012 werneburg et al 2019 and agility snively et al 2019 under selective pressure to at least partially meet their energy budgets by hunting while carnosaurs may not have experienced similar tests of their survival 5 conclusions allosaurus and relatives have been considered apex predators for more than 100 years but our model demonstrates that these dinosaurs may have evolved to fill a different niche altogether carrion generated by their whale sized sauropod neighbors may have been abundant enough to support them as obligate scavengers adaptive morphological similarities between carnosaurs and modern vultures appear to corroborate this finding this also could explain why the absence of sauropods in certain environments led to more obvious predatory adaptations in theropods such as tyrannosaurs which evolved without access to significant sauropod carrion this may have forced them to meet their energy budgets by hunting and pressured them to evolve differently many variables present among dinosauria remain lost so our model is necessarily incomplete it is possible that scavenging insects of the time were more aggressive or efficient than they are today which could have limited vertebrate access to carcasses it is also true that climate behavioral adaptations or other unknown factors may have changed spatiotemporal availability of sauropod carcasses which could have directed dinosaur foraging ecology differently than is described here future discoveries along with more diverse ecological modelling projects will undoubtedly help to progressively and more accurately

24558,the morrison formation of the late jurassic period is characterized by its diverse assemblage of sauropods several species of which reached the size of modern cetaceans while much scientific attention has concerned their biology in life researchers have yet to examine how their massive carcasses may have influenced the evolution of other dinosaurs in their communities such as theropods theropod consumers local to this faunal system are typically described as powerful apex predators at the top of local food webs but instead may have been shaped by competition for carrion resources generated as a byproduct of their giant sauropod neighbors to test this hypothesis we wrote a series of agent based simulations abs specifically we simulated allosaurid consumer behavior versus spatially distributed sauropod carcass resources such as could be expected in ecosystems like that represented in the morrison formation we incorporated conditions to test how competition among consumers seasonality and predation success influenced carnosaur survival both with and without carrion abundant systems trials of the abs resulted in a strong selective advantage for allosaurs as obligate scavengers because of the high metabolic and survival costs associated with predation of large vertebrates allosaurs with increased predatory success over peers failed to succeed competitively unless the probability of scavenging opportunities fell below a certain threshold and a significant proportion of herbivores were available as prey targets which might not have been the case in sauropod dominated systems our results may explain why carnosaurs like allosaurus did not evolve powerful bite forces binocular vision or advanced cursorial adaptations given the enormous supply of sauropod carrion they were under no resource based selective pressure to overpower prey and may have evolved as terrestrial vulture analogues this also may explain why the absence of sauropods in certain environments led to more obvious predatory adaptations in theropods such as tyrannosaurs tyrannosaurs may have been forced to meet their energy budgets by hunting because non sauropod carrion production was too low to support them passively keywords dinosaurs scavenging agent based models theropods ecology evolution sauropods 1 introduction agent based simulations abs are computer models where simulated entities interact with each other governed by programmatically defined behaviors and conditions so observers can test system wide patterns they are especially useful when knowledge of a system is incomplete or when direct observations of a subject are difficult or impossible they also can allow researchers to perform multiple tests in a short timeframe because of this recent decades have seen thousands of different abs models and they have proven valuable in a wide range of disciplines including physiology sociology economics and more particularly ecology fachada et al 2015 they are considered primary tools in ecology bousquet and le page 2004 grimm and railsback 2005 huse et al 2002 parker et al 2003 porte and bartelink 2002 and could likewise help answer paleoecological questions buried in the deep past for instance the morrison formation in western north america laid down between 156 and 147 million years ago has been richly described over many decades but remains only partially understood especially because of its diverse assemblage of giant sauropods at least six species reached 10 000 kg in mass as adults and several exceeded 30 000 kg including species in amphicoelias apatosaurus barosaurus brachiosaurus brontosaurus camarasaurus and diplodocus carpenter 2006 mcnab 2009 sander et al 2011 campione and evans 2012 given taxonomic uncertainties along with temporal stratigraphic and geographical challenges it is possible the number of coexisting sauropod species was as high as 20 carrano and velez juarbe 2006 farlow et al 2010 tschopp et al 2015 gill et al 2018 maltese et al 2018 modern terrestrial biomes have no such biodiverse assemblage of whale sized herbivores to observe so although questions about sauropod biology attract significant research attention most hypotheses about them remain untested foster 2003 carrano and velez juarbe 2006 sander et al 2011 myers et al 2012 carrano et al 2016 further many components of sauropod biology have not been considered such as their postmortem impact on the environment or their potential influence on the evolution of other groups carnosaur foraging ecology is not well understood either despite intense scientific interest van valkenburgh and molnar 2002 henderson 2003 cobos et al 2014 henderson and nichols 2015 gignac and erickson 2017 we developed an abs specifically to test the hypothesis that allosaurus in the morrison formation and potentially carnosaurs elsewhere evolved to capitalize on sauropod carrion as their primary energetic resources and were functionally obligate scavengers we defined agents in the model based on anatomical and physiological data recovered for dinosaurs in order to ground the simulation in realistic parameters carnosaur agents were trialed with metabolic costs of ectotherms mesotherms and endotherms while sauropod agents and their resulting carcasses behaved according to modern estimates of mass and carcass decay rates in this way we were able to reconstruct potential population and community ecology scenarios that are currently unobservable to date one other agent based simulation has been implemented to resolve theropod trophic ecology with respect to carrion resources kane et al 2016 but was fundamentally flawed in specific ways these authors concluded that facultative scavenging would have been favorable for large and middle sized theropods but would not have fully sustained them however their tests simulated the modern serengeti as a correlate of the morrison formation producing carrion at a rate of 4 38 kg per km2 per day the morrison was orders of magnitude more productive than this because of its numerous giant sauropods trammer 2011 the authors also set a maximum carcass detection distance of 2 km in their theropod agents which was probably too conservative given that many modern animals can smell carcasses across distances greater than 10 km finally the carcasses represented in their model persisted on the landscape for only 7 days which is probably unrealistic for most large vertebrate carcasses some have argued that only soaring specialists are able to survive as obligate scavengers given the low cost of soaring flight in carcass detection kane et al 2016 ruxton and houston 2004 results of our abs tests did not support this conclusion birds indeed are extremely efficient and scavenging birds often consume 85 90 of a carcass before mammals arrive making those calories unavailable to other carnivores in the ecosystem the impact of vultures on carnivore communities is measurable vulture absence increases populations of facultative scavengers because abundance of low cost calories is higher without them devault et al 2011 hill et al 2018 markandya et al 2008 ostfeld and keesing 2000 pardo barquin et al 2019 but we did not include soaring specialists in abs trials described here because pterosaurs from the late jurassic were mostly eagle sized animals that were adapted to consume fish frey and tischlinger 2012 their small size alone would have prevented them from competing against large allosaurs at carcass sites in fact soaring carrion specialists have not been conclusively identified from any part of the mesozoic era so we considered them immaterial to this research 2 methods the simulation was written in python 3 8 5 with the mesa library of agent based modeling tools masad and kazil 2015 it also relied on the scientific analysis libraries pandas numpy and networkx hagberg et al 2008 harris et al 2020 reback et al 2020 and was conceptually based on the netlogo wolf sheep predation model tisue and wilensky 2004 our version rested on three main agent types carnosaurs sauropods and the carcasses resulting from their deaths carnosaur agents were divided into three sub types carnosaur scavengers carnosaur predators and carnosaur alphas the simulation ran on a featureless toroidal 70 70 grid meant to represent 4 900 km2 of landscape used by the four principal agent types already mentioned figure 1 aside from this a few other settings differentiated this model from typical wolf sheep models in particular we were primarily concerned with postmortem use of sauropod carcasses by other animals so only carnosaur agent types incurred daily energetic costs but sauropod agents did not sauropod energetic regimes and sauropod population systems themselves were addressed purely as circumstantial matters but we recognize that future modeling projects could improve our knowledge of these aspects of their zoology but because of this we discarded the grass resource for herbivores and capped the population of sauropods against carrying capacity estimates published for these species that is roughly 1 2 km2 farlow et al 2010 we did however distribute the age and size classes of sauropods differently for certain tests within this limitation first to agree with the population biology values in published figures but also to see how changes to the population structures of these animals may have impacted local carnivore consumers each model run was executed on a 365 step interval to loosely conform to days in one year agents reproduced asexually on a continuous basis as in other implementations of the wolf sheep model and weren t reproductively bound by breeding seasons or other factors present in living systems data were gathered and plotted at runtime of each simulation trial and graphs were rendered with matplotlib in pandas 2 1 carnosaur agents carnosaur agents were modeled after individuals of allosaurus by far the most abundant theropod in the morrison formation weighing 2 000 kg each following bates et al 2009 they reproduced at 02 rate and new agents had between 7 and 10 days to find food or they ran out of energy and died each model was initialized with a starting population of 30 individuals regardless of subtype depending on the test carnosaur agents were assigned daily energy needs based on field metabolic rates fmr of three physiologically distinct modern groups mammalian endotherms varanid mesotherms and classically reptilian ectotherms fmr values measure the energy costs animals accrue during routine life activities and are more useful than basal metabolic rate bmr to approximate energy demands bennett and nagy 1977 gazzola et al 2007 hudson et al 2013 fmr equations have been substantiated empirically by numerous authors with confidence above 90 and follow the format of bmr equations peterson et al 1990 west et al 1997 dodds et al 2001 white and seymour 2003 white et al 2006 banavar et al 2010 that is they are based on the model x amb and expressed in kj day 1 where a is the intercept m is the animal s mass in grams and b is the allometric slope variable bennett and nagy 1977 nagy 1999 nagy 2005 because energetic costs in vertebrates are tightly linked to the organism s mass and metabolic engine this means that in our model 2 000 kg allosaurs with reptile metabolism needed 11 kg of meat per day to live mesotherms needed ca 17 kg while expensive endotherms required roughly 28 kg per day for more on how these values were derived see supplementary methods sm1 carnosaur agents were able to consume a maximum of 2 5 days worth of food at each step event a conservative figure given that modern animals can often consume several days worth of calories in a single sitting and can often survive weeks without food mccue et al 2010 adult tigers have been reported to consume 34 kg in a single day ca 4 times their daily requirement nowak and wilson 1999 while komodo dragons can consume 80 of their own body weight in one meal losos and greene 1988 each individual carnosaur agent was assigned a carcass detection radius between 1 and 10 km as an extension of its moore neighborhood if a carnosaur agent located a carcass or carcasses within this radius it moved toward the carcass prioritizing the closest target to itself once an agent reached a carcass object it consumed up to its maximum daily consumption rate at each step until the carcass was depleted or disappeared if no carcass objects were detected the agent moved to a random adjacent grid square see supplementary methods sm2 for additional details carnosaur scavengers were not able to detect or interact with living sauropod agents on the other hand carnosaur predators were given odds to kill living sauropod agents based on certain conditions if a carnosaur predator encountered a sauropod the former had a 35 chance to kill it a 10 chance of being killed by the sauropod and a 55 chance of neither result but see results we varied these values to compare relative value of each attribute these conditions are important to the realism of the model firstly because predation attempts usually fail in modern animals this is true of specialists and generalists alike whether they hunt in groups or solitarily and regardless of prey size preferences orsdol 1984 hayward and kerley 2005 finally we limited carnosaur predators to only attack sauropods below 3 000 kg large sauropods were probably immune to predation of any kind sander et al 2011 and modern predators rarely attack prey significantly larger than themselves de visser et al 2011 so we considered this limitation to be appropriate details presented in supplementary methods sm3 dominance hierarchies at carcass sites are ubiquitous phenomena in carrion ecology in light of this carnosaur alphas were introduced to test the value of dominance to survival in scavenging communities carnosaur scavengers were repelled by carnosaur alphas when both occupied the same carcass site and were unable to return to it as long as the space was occupied by more dominant agents 2 2 sauropod agents each sauropod agent moved randomly throughout the grid by one square per step they reproduced exponentially until population density was between 1 and 1 6 animals per km2 and the simulation enforced this continually throughout the model at any given time the model landscape contained between 4 800 and 7 200 sauropods they did not consume other material for energy and they did not react to other agents except in the case of carnosaur predators which were occasionally able to kill them or be killed by them they were converted to carcass objects at death whether death was caused passively or by carnosaur predators we set their maximum adult mass at 45 000 kg based on estimates of brachiosaurus seebacher 2001 benson et al 2018 but could have represented any collective population of the numerous large sauropods present in the morrison formation population structure reflected age and size class distribution estimated for sauropods by farlow et al 2010 this resulted in roughly 30 of the animals as adults at any given time although we varied this attribute in different tests see results which the authors note is representative of large vertebrates in many wild populations including unrelated taxa with different life history strategies such as ostriches struthio camelus and african elephants loxodonta africana thus we were confident with this assumption importantly sauropod agents experienced odds of mortality between 02 and 05 to account for deaths caused by disease starvation or senescence which were probably significant threats to these giant herbivores just as they are in herbivores of today young and very old sauropods likely were especially vulnerable to the long periods of resource deprivation that typify ecosystems such as those represented in the morrison formation engelmann et al 2004 turner and peterson 2004 parrish et al 2004 noto et al 2010 peterson et al 2017 we also ran the model to simulate seasonal changes in productive output during this cycle odds of sauropod agent mortality increased to 3x the background odds for a total of 60 consecutive steps and following this interval we set 60 steps with no mortality but most sauropods were probably immune to predation so we set our mortality rates to follow modern herbivore populations that experience no predation pressure for more on the rationale behind this see supplementary methods sm4 2 3 carcass objects carcass objects inherited mass and location properties from their parent sauropod agents if an 8 000 kg sauropod agent died whether from passive causes or from predation the resulting carcass object would originate at 8 000 kg as well and would retain its position in the grid for the remainder of its existence carcass objects lost mass either as a result of decay or as carnosaurs consumed them if an allosaur ate 40 kg in a consumption step the carcass lost 40 kg of mass in addition to its decay loss during that step carcasses disappeared if they reached below 15 of their initial mass whether by agent free decay or by consumption from allosaurs sauropod agent deaths caused between 69 and 85 carcasses to appear on the landscape each day remains of dead sauropods likely were present on the landscape for months but possibly more than 6 years bader et al 2009 drumheller et al 2020 mchugh et al 2020 and we viewed this fact as an important albeit self evident component of the model because we calculated mass changes on carcass objects over time as they decayed numerous environmental variables including temperature local insect species and cadaver mass influence decay rates and researchers disagree about the relative importance of each simmons et al 2010 sutherland et al 2013 farwig et al 2014 turner et al 2017 in fact cadaver decay research is not well represented in the literature except for a few species most commonly domestic pigs so we don t have an especially large comparison pool for sauropod carcasses a few principles are generally accepted however for example it is uncommon for invertebrate scavengers to consume appreciable amounts of carrion in wild conditions because mammalian and avian scavengers often rapidly deplete much of a carcass before insects arrive having said that controlled experiments demonstrate that african tropical fly larvae are able to consume 2 kg carcasses in roughly 3 days while carcasses of the same mass in neotropical forests routinely persist on the landscape for more than 10 days houston 1985 north american deer carcasses odocoileus spp take between 18 and 101 days to decompose depending on the season and ambient temperature jennelle et al 2009 african elephant loxodonta africana cadavers are targeted by carnivores for several weeks post mortem even after vultures abandon them douglas hamilton and hillman 1981 bradshaw 2008 white and diedrich 2012 they remain distinguishable on the landscape more than a year after mortality and take between 2 12 years to disappear hanks et al 1973 dudley et al 2001 modern cetaceans are the only animals approaching the mass of ancient sauropods but research on beached whales has heretofore focused on their impact to municipalities and appropriate disposal rather than their decomposition rates it is generally recognized that whale carcasses take months to decay in the absence of vertebrate scavengers tucker et al 2018 and sauropod cadavers likely also decayed over several months as well because pig carcasses are the most studied and because they demonstrate the consistent sigmoidal decomposition pattern recognized for all vertebrate corpses we used a 10 kg pig carcass decay pattern to govern decay of sauropod carcass objects the pig in question was observed in high elevation grassland páramo colombia 3 035 m and decayed to roughly 20 of its live weight in 83 days martinez et al 2007 while we recognize that 83 days is extremely conservative for sauropod sized carcasses it should be noted that a 600 kg european bison carcass bison bonasus approaches 20 of its original mass after ca 106 days in the temperate białowieża primeval forest poland selva et al 2003 the bison carcass only takes 28 more time to decompose than the pig despite more favorable environmental conditions and its 6 000 greater mass but its mass and presumably the mass of all cadavers follow the same sigmoidal decomposition curve there is no reason to believe that sauropod carcasses behaved differently than modern vertebrate corpses either fundamentally or because of environmental factors we plotted cadaver mass of the aforementioned pig as it decomposed then a line of best fit was applied in prism v 8 2 1 and produced the following vertebrate corpse decay equation r 87 1 e 0 208506n 6 12556 100 where r is the percentage of remaining mass n days after mortality and e is euler s number all carcass objects lost mass on a per step basis according to this equation figure 2 3 results 3 1 carnosaur agents carnosaur scavengers had a clear survival advantage when carcass detection range was high when metabolic costs were low or both for example a 2 000 kg carnosaur scavenger with reptilian ectotherm metabolism had a daily meat requirement of 11 kg these agents were cheap enough that even with a detection radius of 3 km carcass resources supported roughly 60 of them at any given time and they did not experience extinction detection range of 5 km carried at least 638 carnosaurs while 6 km detection range supported between 1 210 and 1 456 figure 3 the latter numbers are important because they compute a population density between 4 9 and 5 9 kg of biomass per hectare present day carnivorous reptiles typically occupy 5 5 kg of biomass per hectare lovich et al 2018 so it would be reasonable to accept this as a likely approximation of real conditions at baseline if carnosaurs like allosaurus were ectotherms interestingly this was true even when large adult sauropod agents comprised only 10 of the population so even when the share of large animals was low carnosaur agents were able to survive purely on carrion the 6 km detection radius appears to be a point of diminishing returns on population support for reptilian ectotherms in that there may not have been a significant survival advantage for allosaurs with 7 km detection range versus those with 6 km detection range while those with less than 6 km would have been significantly distressed in comparison table 1 carnosaur alphas with 6 km detection range outcompeted carnosaur scavengers with 7 km detection range albeit not fully the former ended the trial with 617 individuals and the latter 495 this is an overall population minimum of 1 112 carnosaurs on the landscape slightly lower than that supported in non competitive simulations interestingly this appears to mimic the dominance system between turkey vultures cathartes aura and black vultures coragyps attratus turkey vultures often arrive at carcasses first but are driven away by black vultures once the latter arrive buckley 1999 dominance systems were almost certainly important to carnosaur behavior at carcass sites and in the future more complex models could illuminate interrelationships between dominance carcass detection and survival success of allosaurus and kin carnosaur predators were able to exploit additional resources because they were able to profit from a small share of the living sauropods on the landscape and not just the carcasses generated by passive forces their presence in some trials caused a temporary peak in number of carcasses on a landscape as a result of successful kills however they were unable to compete against carnosaur scavengers even as cheap ectotherms and only avoided extinction at this metabolism when carcass detection ranges were 9 km or greater even at 9 km the minimum population of these agents only was 244 at end of runtime versus 1 690 carnosaur scavengers in that trial this also implies that even when carnosaur predators had opportunities to hunt their survival success was leveraged on their ability to detect carcass resources rather than their hunting abilities it is important to note that because carnosaur predators were only able to target sauropods below 3 000 kg in mass less than 10 of the sauropod population was vulnerable to predation at any given time the morrison formation was very diverse and included smaller non sauropod species which could have been more accessible prey targets but given that these included dangerous armored dinosaurs such as ankylosaurs and stegosaurs we suspect that allosaurs probably did not risk their safety attacking them except when forced to by long seasons of very low sauropod mortality overall population support in mesothermic carnosaur scavengers was markedly lower than in ectotherms they went extinct if carcass detection range was below 6 km table 1 exponential growth was not achieved until agents had detection ranges of 9 km or greater at 10 km detection range the carcass producing environment supported between 1 299 and 1 899 animals which also returns a favorable population density compared to that observed in modern carnivorous reptiles when we introduced dominance rules to mesotherm tests carnosaur alphas with 9 km detection radius were able to exercise a survival advantage over non dominant competitors with 10 km detection range alphas numbered 744 while non dominant agents numbered 522 in trials involving predatory mesotherms hunters were at a significant disadvantage against obligate scavenging rivals surviving a maximum of 57 steps figure 4 endothermic carnosaur scavengers were unable to survive unless their carcass detection range was 9 km or greater when detection was limited to 8 km the model generated a maximum of 39 carnosaurs of this type and they went extinct by step 90 with 9 km detection range the minimum population supported was 300 peaking at 465 while 10 km radius supported a minimum of 759 carnosaurs it is possible that if carnosaurs were endotherms they may have benefited from faster traveling speeds afforded by higher activity levels and it is likely that they would have been able to travel many kilometers in a single day anyway population density for large carnivorous mammals is ca 24 kg ha and the lower population of carnosaur scavengers as endotherms here returns 1 24 kg ha this does not rule out the possibility that allosaurus and related taxa were endotherms however because environments like the morrison formation were much more productive than any observed recently it is possible that carnosaurs were able to occupy greater population densities because of this carnosaur predators were not always unsuccessful as mentioned ectothermic predators were able to survive with detection range of 9 km while mesothermic predators went extinct in all carcass detection brackets mesothermic agents were able to avoid extinction only as the maximum size of sauropod agents went down for example when maximum sauropod agent size was limited to 10 000 kg ca 30 of the sauropod agents were targetable prey because the share was still too low predator agents struggled to survive past 100 steps figure 5 this was generally true even when predation success odds were 45 and chance of death on attack was 0 predators survived when sauropod agents were limited to maximum size of 4 000 kg mean carcass mass at death for these animals was 2 067 kg and the population of carnosaur predators reached 122 individuals versus 301 carnosaur scavengers table 2 the overall share of targetable prey was high enough to support predators but carcasses were still large enough and decayed slowly enough to be available for other agents to profit from it also means that if the amount of available carrion was reduced in other ways by superefficient insect species or specialized mesoscavengers carnosaurs would have survived without evolutionary pressure to hunt however endothermic predators were too expensive and were not able to meet their energy budgets in any trial when we trialed the simulation with changes in seasonality mesothermic carnosaur scavengers were exposed to high yield and low yield intervals wherein as previously described a surplus of sauropod carcasses became available followed by a period of scarcity we did this to simulate productivity cycles in modern semi arid biomes and as expected the population of mesothermic carnosaur scavengers grew rapidly from the onset we anticipated the carcass scarcity interval to limit population growth but because sauropod carcasses didn t usually disappear until between 29 and 83 steps after they were generated they served as long term reservoirs of energy because of this mesothermic carnosaur agents experienced no adverse survival events during the scarcity interval 3 2 carcasses carcasses appeared on the landscape at a rate of between 69 and 85 bodies per step and averaged between 21 000 and 25 000 kg except in trials where smaller sauropod agents were implemented they behaved as programmed 3 3 data availability all figures and data can be recreated using our code which has been made publicly available and can be found here https github com cmrn crmns phl abm data aggregation and graphs were created using matplotlib in python 4 discussion if living carnosaurs such as allosaurus behaved according to the variables and circumstances we modeled they were probably able to survive purely on carrion produced as a byproduct of contemporaneous sauropod populations contrary to intuitive expectations carnosaur agents with higher rates of predation success were at a selective disadvantage due to excess metabolic and survival costs they incurred agents with the fewest predation attempts and greatest carcass detection ranges had the highest odds of survival because of this it is possible that carnosaurs were terrestrial analogues of modern vultures this may explain why carnosaurs of the morrison formation and elsewhere developed weak senses zelenitsky et al 2011 including poor to non existent binocular vision stevens 2006 weak bite forces rayfield et al 2001 meers 2002 henderson 2003 bates and falkingham 2012 and no evident locomotor specialization snively 2003 hutchinson and allen 2009 snively et al 2019 because they were not forced to evolve predatory adaptations to survive 4 1 adaptations for scavenging the value of sauropod cadavers in late jurassic communities is perhaps to be expected given that comparably sized whale carcasses often support diverse trophic communities for decades postmortem smith et al 2015 individual beached whale carcasses in the arctic can sustain hundreds of polar bears ursus maritimus over several months laidre et al 2018 sauropod carcasses did not float great distances or descend into harsh abyssal environments so it is likely that they were more predictably available to local vertebrate consumers than whale carcasses are today species evolve toward equilibrium against their primary survival stressors and resource based stressors are among the strongest of these eldredge and gould 1972 it is logical that a group of vertebrate consumers would evolve to exploit a calorie source as abundant and rich as sauropod carcasses and carnosaur adaptations appear to reflect this if viewed as vulture analogues it is also difficult to explain what other environmental processes could have acted on sauropod remains if theropods were for some reason unable to consume them niches often arise because of the competitive exclusion principle which predicts that organisms in a single environment will exploit the most profitable available resources and will specialize to reduce competitive overlap within their communities carbone et al 2011 foster et al 2013 scavengers and predators both specialize according to this principle in modern biomes among scavengers this is most obvious in vultures but is typical in other terrestrial vertebrate groups as well weak jaws are common in these animals and their cervical anatomy is adapted to resist pulling and ripping forces for example vulture guilds are divided into three main groups based on these characteristics with rippers scrappers and gulpers present in old world and new world vultures alike houston 1988 hertel 1994 gomez et al 2008 hille et al 2016 blumstein et al 2017 rippers such as the king vulture sarcorhamphus papa use powerful necks and strain resistant strongly recurved beaks to capitalize on tough carcass units such as skin and hide they employ fast biting scissor motions while feeding fisher 1944 this allows gulpers like the black vulture coragyps atratus which evolved a narrow flexible skull and weak jaws to swallow large chunks of viscera once they become exposed houston 1988 scrappers are well represented in taxa like the turkey vulture cathartes aura which are adapted to consume discarded fleshy elements common to a carcass periphery and have the weakest least developed beak recurvature members of this guild often rely on other birds to expose and distribute viscera it also is likely that because carnosaurs were much larger than birds and had teeth instead of more lightly built beaks they probably did not struggle to open carcasses and were able to exploit cadavers more effectively than today s avian scavengers scavenging adaptations are not limited to avian taxa but are enforced in large mammalian vertebrates as well the saber toothed marsupial thylacosmilus has been traditionally regarded as a form convergent with large prey specialists such as those in smilodon but recent analysis of t atrox concluded that the animal was probably a carrion specialist because of craniodental features including extremely weak bite force and cervical anatomy optimized for ripping and pulling behaviors janis et al 2020 the authors noted that t atrox has probably been shoehorned into the apex predator role by previous investigators because of assumptions but that it was poorly adapted to overpower prey due to its weak jaws and low potential for agility allosaurus also exemplifies many of these key characteristics as seen in gulpers allosaurus demonstrated unusually wide gape and cranial kinesis that probably allowed it to swallow large volumes in a single gulp frazzetta and kardong 2002 henderson 2003 holliday and witmer 2008 lautenschlager 2015 furthermore its neck was designed to apply pulling and ripping forces snively and russell 2007a snively et al 2013 as are the necks of vultures and nearly all vertebrate scavenging specialists böhmer et al 2019 allosaurus bite force specifically was also weak perhaps only ca 5 494 n while more recent work reported a potential maximum of 8 724 n erickson 2001 rayfield 2001 bates and falkingham 2012 these numbers are respectively 23 and 38 of the value predicted for a mammalian predator of its size as determined based on relationships among bite force prey size and body mass in modern taxa meers 2002 wroe et al 2005 slater and van valkenburgh 2009 slater et al 2010 indeed the trend of weak jaws appears broadly applicable to all carnosaurs rayfield et al 2001 meers 2002 henderson 2003 snively et al 2006 mazzetta et al 2009 sakamoto 2010 rayfield 2011 lautenschlager 2015 high bite force is known to reduce prey handling time herrell et al 2007 and it is difficult to explain why feeding systems in carnivorous dinosaurs would favor weak skulls given the powerful attributes of their supposed quarry furthermore allosaurus bite force architecture is characterized by high efficiency fast biting as is common especially to rippers hertel 1994 sakamoto 2010 in felids cranial size is sacrificed to accommodate necessary bite force musculature to kill prey because food processing stresses drove their evolution kitchener et al 2010 hartstone rose et al 2012 evidence suggests that food processing stresses also drove carnosaur evolution but weak craniodental anatomy strongly suggests they were adapted to fundamentally different ecological roles dawkins and krebs 1979 sakamoto 2010 sakamoto et al 2010 morales and giannini 2013 in fact nearly all modern terrestrial large prey specialists employ powerful muscle driven bite forces to kill prey and there is no reason to expect otherwise of mesozoic animals meers 2002 henderson 2003 therrien 2005 wroe et al 2005 christiansen and adolfssen 2005 christiansen et al 2007 wroe et al 2007 wroe and milne 2007 anderson et al 2008 ellis 2009 meachen samuels van valkenburgh 2009 kitchener et al 2010 sakamoto et al 2010 erickson et al 2012 hartstone rose et al 2012 morales and giannini 2013 to expand on this predatory adaptations are well understood and contrast sharply with those of most carnosaurs meachen samuels and van valkenburgh 2009 van valkenburgh and molnar 2002 although authors often claim they employed the same hunting behaviors as modern apex predators hone and rauhut 2010 wallach et al 2015 predators must first recognize and locate a target in space then intercept it and subdue it sergio et al 2014 they overcome these hunting challenges with a predictable suite of features including wide bifocal fields of view bfov and other optical specializations to resolve prey detection problems along with strongly reinforced craniodental features pretterer et al 2004 heesy et al 2008 hornocker and negri 2010 veilleux and kirk 2014 lawson et al 2019 they also employ acute senses of hearing and smell and characteristically use adaptations for speed or agility to capture and dispatch prey iriarte díaz 2002 carbone et al 2007 for example felids have a binocular field of view bfov of ca 130 figure 6 large forward facing eyes curved corneas that maximize visual depth perception and greatly enhanced low light vision kitchener et al 2010 mines and ochieng 2017 selective pressure on felid visual tools is very strong and even influences retinal cone densities specific to each species hunting style ahnelt et al 2006 this is unsurprising given that visual field configuration follows foraging ecology and is not simply a reflection of ancestry or passive forces ahnelt et al 2006 martin 2009 2014 canids are also top predators and possess ca 60 of bfov miller and murphy 1995 byosiere et al 2018 comparable to that of tyrannosaurus rex stevens 2006 stereoscopic prey location systems are not limited to mammalia or to apex predators most snakes occupy low positions in the food web for most of their lives and require laterally facing eyes to detect threats even so diurnal visually hunting species exhibit roughly double the binocular field of view of non visually hunting species walls 1944 hughes 1977 safer and grace 2004 krysko 2005 crotaline boid and pythonid snakes use forward facing thermal pits in lieu of ocular instruments to target prey stereoscopically sichert et al 2006 these snakes retain laterally facing eyes to identify danger but their survival as predators requires accurate prey targeting systems thus several groups independently developed stereoscopic infrared sensing tools indeed much research has focused on the sensitivity of their thermal organs and the improved striking accuracy provided by their forward facing orientation jones et al 2001 krochmal et al 2004 goris 2011 chen et al 2012 chen et al 2017 schraft and clark 2019 even in vultures bfov increases as predatory behavior increases the white headed vulture trigonoceps occipitalis is taxonomically close to the obligate scavenging vultures in gyps the latter have only 20 of binocular overlap the unspecialized condition even though they locate carcasses visually and cannot do so via olfaction but because the white headed vulture regularly captures live prey its bfov is over 30 and averages 2 3x greater overall visual coverage area than its obligate scavenging relatives portugal et al 2017 this is to say nothing of the other raptors in accipitriformes predators thereof which developed bifoveate retinae greater bfov more densely packed retinal cells and larger eyes than their carrion specialist relatives potier et al 2016 2017 falconiformes evolved wide bfov and bifoveate retinae independently as a response to predation needs but their closest relatives the non predatory psittaciformes suh et al 2011 have laterally facing eyes and often lack foveae altogether mitkus et al 2014 comparatively allosaurus had very narrow binocular field of view between 10 and 20 stevens 2006 not only is this value like those reported in modern scavenging birds it is also the baseline condition for unspecialized oreinirostral animals busbey 1995 rayfield and milner 2008 and confirms that allosaurus were under no selective pressure to stereoscopically target objects whether prey or otherwise in three dimensional space there also is no evidence that allosaurs evolved innovative substitutes for stereoscopic vision as snakes did with infrared pits or bats with echolocation adult crocodylians may appear to be a minor exception at first in that they occupy top predator positions and employ ambush tactics to capture prey despite narrow bfov and limited overall agility but they conceal themselves under water to ambush their targets very few dinosaur lineages were semi aquatic so comparison with allosaurs is inappropriate furthermore given their weak jaws it is difficult to reasonably assume that allosaurus and modern crocodylians share niche specific selective pressures because the latter evolved powerful jaws as would be expected of large prey specialists carnosaurs such as allosaurus also had poorly developed auditory senses and were probably unable to detect subtle sounds rogers 1998 witmer and ridgely 2009 zelenitsky et al 2011 this would be a significant anomaly if allosaurus were a predator given that modern apex predators especially those of large terrestrial herbivores rely heavily on their senses of hearing both to locate prey and to recognize stealth challenges they encounter during ambush and stalking activities they have specific auditory adaptations including enlarged external ears greatly expanded auditory bullae and ear canal size when compared to linear scaling expectations and even specialized auditory cortical neurons this is true for pack hunting predators such as lions panthera leo solitary species such as tigers pantheria tigris and for cursorial species like cheetahs acinonyx jubatus and canids heffner 2004 kitchener et al 2010 carr and christiansen dalsgaard 2015 mason 2016 sakai et al 2016 along with specialized night vision and bite force tools these adaptations are enforced genetically because they evolved to overcome hunting challenges huang et al 2000 nummela et al 2013 kim et al 2017 even with these specializations most predation attempts fail this is true whether they hunt in groups or solitarily and irrespective of prey size preferences orsdol 1984 hayward and kerley 2005 if allosaurus and its relatives were under the same predation based evolutionary pressures as felids and canids of today one would predict the presence of excellent auditory and other senses in carnosaur lineages regardless of their hunting behaviors but this is not the case agrawal 2017 wu and wang 2019 it has been argued that olfaction is of principal importance to scavenging specialists in carcass detection it is true that cathartes vultures evolved to recognize odors uniquely present in decaying flesh and this fact has been established since at least the late 1800 s barrows 1887 mammalian facultative scavengers also use olfaction to find corpses across great distances particularly where geographic barriers obfuscate carcass localities kane et al 2016 allosaurus olfactory bulbs were not large for an animal its size zelenitsky et al 2011 but this probably implies very little about its foraging ecology for two reasons first olfactory bulb size is correlated with home range size among modern carnivores so it is a poor signal with respect to foraging ecology gittleman 1991 second most of today s successful vultures lack any olfactory sense vision is the primary carcass detection tool in unrelated species such as the california condor gymnogyps californianus the andean condor vultur gryphus and all members of gyps buechley and sekercioglu 2016 mateo tomas and olea 2018 so odor detection is not a prerequisite adaptation for carrion specialization it is more likely that olfaction evolved in cathartes vultures under selective pressure to find carrion hidden in dense neotropical forests houston 1985 1988 but this might not have been a predominant challenge in morrison formation savannahs further the strong and presumably dense odors produced by multi tonne sauropod carcasses probably required no exceptional odor differentiation abilities and their large size probably rendered them visually conspicuous from great distances as well many large theropods including allosaurus torvosaurus and ceratosaurus in the morrison formation but also monolophosaurus carcharodontosaurus concavenator cryolophosaurus dilophosaurus giganotosaurus and other carnosaurs elsewhere possessed decorative head ornamentation and other elaborate features that would have been obstacles to animals that relied on stealth during ambush stalking or pursuit behaviors gates et al 2016 the same is true of modern vultures which often exhibit bizarre display features that serve to help identify conspecifics and to intimidate competitors at carcass sites and interestingly this also may have been the case in thylacosmilus graves 2016 cuesta et al 2018 janis et al 2020 in some ways morphological features of allosaurus crania and jaws appear to parallel those of komodo dragons varanus komodoensis which also have weak jaws and a craniocervical anatomy designed to resist pull loading for these reasons researchers often consider the two species to be morphologically convergent farlow 1976 moreno et al 2008 d amore and blumensehine 2009 sakamoto 2010 snively et al 2013 mccurry et al 2015 however substantial evidence demonstrates that komodo dragons compensate for weak bite force either with venom septically infectious bites or both and thereby insulate themselves from evolutionary stresses that would otherwise favor strong jaws fry et al 2009 bull et al 2010 mccurry et al 2015 bishop et al 2017 there is no evidence that large theropods produced venom or were able to envenomate others so while possible it is unlikely that morrison carnivores were adapted for komodo dragon style predation nor is it reasonable to assume that they overcame their bite force deficiencies with snake style constriction machairodont dentition or even other unidentified means imaginative hypotheses about allosaurus cranial architecture adapted for hatchet attack behavior have been rightly challenged as unreasonable and scientifically unjustifiable rayfield et al 2001 frazzetta and kardong 2002 antón et al 2003 and considering data reported here will not further be entertained having said that although komodo dragons use chemical means to subdue prey they are not considered specialists of large prey they evolved as generalist carnivores and consume predominantly carrion hocknull et al 2009 shine and somaweera 2019 which could make morphological comparisons to allosaurus more appropriate this is not to argue that allosaurs were unable to hunt nor is it to speculate about hypothetical hunting methods dinosaurs could have used for one thing even obligate scavengers such as the andean condor vultur gryphus have been observed hunting and killing small prey gailey and bolwig 1973 so carnosaurs were also likely able to kill animals if conditions were right but condors possess few obvious adaptations to facilitate predation because they evolved to acquire most of their calories from carrion likewise critical tests of allosaur survival probably were not related to predation but to their ability to access sauropod carrion 4 2 sauropod carrion in other mesozoic systems sauropods and their carcasses were not unique to the morrison formation they dominated herbivore communities on most continents throughout the jurassic and cretaceous periods if they were truly immune to predation their existence may have precluded the evolution of terrestrial obligate predators it appears this may be the case because most well known large carnosaurs mimic the adaptations of allosaurus lacking predatory tools such as binocular vision cranially reinforced bite force architecture speed or agility south american forms in giganotosaurus and majungosaurus possessed weak skulls like in allosaurus coria and currie 2003 mazzetta et al 2004 slater et al 2010 but lived alongside multiple species of titanosaurs that potentially reached 90 000 124 000 kg in mass benson et al 2014 2018 vieira et al 2014 peczkis 1995 apesteguía 2007 novas et al 2013 given current knowledge it is difficult to imagine that the carcasses of these giants would have been ignored or unavailable to local carnivores locating and consuming this carrion would have tested carnosaur survival much more than predation success in part because of the abundance of carrion and in part because there were few opportunities to reliably kill sauropods during most of their lives questions about seemingly lopsided carnivore heavy environments like the kem kem and bahariya formations in north africa delcourt and grillo 2017 ibrahim et al 2020 may also be satisfied by a better understanding of sauropod carrion ecology true to form carcharodontosaurus saharicus also had braincase and skull morphology like that of allosaurus sereno et al 1996 rogers 1998 larsson et al 2000 larsson 2001 eddy and clarke 2011 proportionally weak jaws specialized for fast jaw closure coria and currie 2003 henderson and nicholls 2015 and almost no binocular field of vision stevens 2006 nityananda and read 2017 individuals of the species are estimated to have weighed between 4 000 and 6 000 kg seebacher 2001 therrien and henderson 2007 a 6 000 kg mesothermic theropod such as this would have required 46 6 kg of meat per day to survive if its titanosaur neighbors such as paralititan reached 79 000 kg in mass as has been proposed smith et al 2001 candeiro 2015 the abs predicted population support of between 26 and 52 mesothermic carcharodontosaurus individuals when carcass detection was 8 km this is approximately the same population of mesothermic allosaurus with 6 km carcass detection range 4 3 sauropod free systems if the presence of sauropods influenced the evolution of carnivore groups the lack of sauropod sized animals in other environments probably pressured carnivores to meet their energy budgets differently for example north american tyrannosaurs evolved in the absence of any significant sauropod presence due to the north american sauropod hiatus d emic et al 2010 d emic and foreman 2012 and are recognized as fundamentally unique among large theropods with respect to morphological adaptations because they appear to mirror adaptations present in living apex predators we trialed the abs conditions to compare systems of this type as well with a baseline passive carcass appearance rate of 84 per step dominant carnivores were modeled after tyrannosaurus rex which reached estimated adult mass between 5 000 8 870 kg persons et al 2019 resulting in energy needs of 38 8 65 5 kg of meat per day as a mesotherm and 53 6 79 3 kg as an endotherm the dominant herbivores were modeled after triceratops the most abundant hell creek dinosaur with a maximum mass of 14 000 kg benson et al 2014 and tyrannosaur predators could kill only those under 8 000 kg this means that between 50 and 60 of the triceratops agents were available as prey targets for predator agents at any given time survival as obligate scavengers was not profitable unless tyrannosaur energy needs were below 60 kg of meat per day and carcass detection was 10 km these conditions supported between 10 and 18 tyrannosaur scavengers on the landscape at any given time this computes a density of 29 kg of biomass per hectare which agrees favorably with population densities of today s large carnivorous mammals lovich et al 2018 it also fits into the energy budgets of midrange adult t rex individuals as calculated with respect to mass and metabolic engine estimates having said that t rex was a common dinosaur in its ecosystem comprising between 15 24 of the animals reflected in the hell creek fossil record whereas triceratops comprised at least 40 but up to 69 horner et al 2011 so a population support of 18 tyrannosaurs does not appear high enough to agree with fossil abundance observations tyrannosaur predators were able to avoid extinction even as expensive endotherms with only 6 km carcass detection range their population plateaued between 122 and 203 individuals or at least 2 kg of biomass per hectare carcasses provided to the landscape by predatory activities resulted in as many as 218 cadavers on the gridspace at any one time a surplus of more than 150 above the baseline successful predators were not able to deplete freshly killed carcasses fast enough to eliminate them from the landscape before other agents arrived so the carcass surplus benefited conspecifics by increasing the total available supply of cheap calories this is much different than in modern biomes where fresh carcasses are frequently depleted by avian scavengers in a matter of hours interestingly asian tyrannosaurs such as tarbosaurus have dorsolaterally compressed skulls and reduced binocular vision compared to north american sister taxa hurum and sabath 2003 this might be because they coexisted with titanosaurian sauropods like nemegtosaurus and opisthocoelicaudia which may have provided scavenging resources abundant enough to support them without predatory adaptations as mesotherms the total population of tyrannosaur agents that is both predators and scavengers exceeded 450 individuals by step 140 which computes a population density of 7 4 kg ha in simulations with greater detection ranges the population often rose above 1 000 within 150 steps reaching a plateau between 1 261 and 1 388 these results compute population densities greater than those observed in modern carnivorous reptiles and much greater than for carnivorous mammals according to lovich et al 2018 it is possible that north american tyrannosaurs evolved stereoscopic vision stevens 2006 acute senses witmer and ridgely 2009

et al 2019 and agility snively et al 2019 under selective pressure to at least partially meet their energy budgets by hunting while carnosaurs may not have experienced similar tests of their survival 5 conclusions allosaurus and relatives have been considered apex predators for more than 100 years but our model demonstrates that these dinosaurs may have evolved to fill a different niche altogether carrion generated by their whale sized sauropod neighbors may have been abundant enough to support them as obligate scavengers adaptive morphological similarities between carnosaurs and modern vultures appear to corroborate this finding this also could explain why the absence of sauropods in certain environments led to more obvious predatory adaptations in theropods such as tyrannosaurs which evolved without access to significant sauropod carrion this may have forced them to meet their energy budgets by hunting and pressured them to evolve differently many variables present among dinosauria remain lost so our model is necessarily incomplete it is possible that scavenging insects of the time were more aggressive or efficient than they are today which could have limited vertebrate access to carcasses it is also true that climate behavioral adaptations or other unknown factors may have changed spatiotemporal availability of sauropod carcasses which could have directed dinosaur foraging ecology differently than is described here future discoveries along with more diverse ecological modelling projects will undoubtedly help to progressively and more accurately

24559,fecal contamination of surface water resource is a major health concern primarily due to the potential for pathogenic organisms to be transmitted to human by contaminated water in lake wide modelling of large lakes with many sources of microbial contamination minor contributions from small tributaries are generally ignored in this study we applied a three dimensional high resolution hydrodynamic and water quality model to assess the impact of eight smaller tributaries located on the southern edge of lake st clair on microbial water quality during the summer of 2016 the impact at two beaches and two drinking water intakes located in the nearshore region of the southern edge of lake st clair was considered results reveal that the microbial water quality in the nearshore regions close to these eight small tributaries confluence are significantly affected by one or more of these tributaries although this effect is captured by our model with a time variable or constant decay rates the use of time variable decay may be preferable for dynamic simulations over time the total flow contribution from the smaller tributaries was estimated in the range of 18 35 while that for e coli concentration was 80 three small tributaries were also predicted to account for 70 of the e coli concentrations at drinking water intakes for tributaries that do not significantly affect the hydrodynamics in a lake a new framework is presented to identify approximate influence zones for microbial pollution that can help determine if a given location is likely to be impacted by the inflowing tributaries graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial modelling e coli aem3d lake st clair caedym 1 introduction fecal pollution of surface water resources is a global issue of concern human health risks from such pollution are associated with exposure to waterborne pathogens that may be present in human or animal feces through drinking or recreational use pandey et al 2014 who 2003 pathogens can be infectious at low dosages and monitoring low concentrations can be difficult time consuming and costly routine monitoring for multitude waterborne pathogens of fecal origin is also impractical the challenges associated with detecting pathogenic microorganisms in the water are currently too great to recommend this practice as part of a regular monitoring program hence various fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli are usually used to detect fecal pollution in natural waters health canada 2012 usepa 2012 who 2017 in canada raw drinking water sources and recreational waters are assessed through routine monitoring of e coli health canada 2020 2012 although monitoring for e coli can provide useful information to evaluate microbiological risks and treatment requirements for surface water sources its limitations need to be addressed for example in large water bodies with upstream watersheds impacted by human and animal fecal pollution significant fecal microbial pollution is mobilized into their tributaries during storm events this results in a significant and dynamic increase in microbial loadings to the receiving waters such changes in the loads produce dynamic and unexpected changes in the microbial water quality of the receiving waterbody which are difficult and costly to capture through monitoring studies due to the required sampling frequency and the large number of samples needed additional monitoring obstacles include requirements for equipment laboratory and field technicians and the fact that with monitoring alone it is difficult to identify potential sources of fecal pollution which could aid in better management planning alternatively process based numerical models can be used with the ability to link pollution sources and receptors madani et al 2020a once validated these models can become useful tools for managers to predict expected water quality changes at water intakes many process based models have been developed and applied to simulate the fate and transport of microbial pollution in water bodies in recent years bonamano et al 2015 bravo et al 2017 garcia armisen et al 2006 liu et al 2006 muirhead and monaghan 2012 safaie et al 2016 these models have demonstrated better spatial and temporal resolution of fib distributions at a lower cost when combined with judicious monitoring lake st clair is a precious natural resource that provides drinking water for millions of people in the united states and canada and numerous recreational opportunities the water quality concerns in lake st clair include pathogens toxic contaminants and eutrophication some previous studies have examined lake wide hydrodynamic and or nutrient transport modelling anderson et al 2010 bocaniov and scavia 2018 healy et al 2007 holtschlag and koschik 2002 for lake st clair the four major tributaries st clair sydenham thames and clinton rivers account for 99 5 of lake st clair inflow and are also the dominant contributors of microbial pollution to the lake more recently a high resolution 3d hydrodynamic model was developed using the aquatic ecosystem model aem3d modelling platform and applied to assess the impact of microbial pollution from the four major tributaries on microbial water quality in the lake as well as on a popular beach sandpoint beach windsor ontario canada located on the southern edge of the lake madani et al 2020a the results suggest that a large part of the lake starting from the middle of the lake to the southern shoreline was minimally affected by the four major tributaries combined input with maximum predicted e coli concentration of 10 cfu 100 ml there are two popular public beaches sandpoint and lakeview park west beach lp and two intakes for drinking water treatment plants lakeshore and stoney point close to the southern shores of lake st clair examining the data collected weekly by the local health unit as part of the beach monitoring program between 2010 2019 for both beaches the provincial beach water quality e coli standard of 100 cfu 100 ml was exceeded in more than 50 and 70 of the samples from sandpoint beach and lp beach respectively see supplementary information in 8 12 of the samples e coli level was 1000 cfu 100 ml and the beaches were closed for the following week e coli levels in the raw water at the two water treatment plants wtps seem to be generally very low with most values in 2016 recorded to be 10 cfu 100 ml see supplementary information occasionally higher values of up to 20 cfu 100 ml at lakeshore wtp and 10 cfu 100 ml at stoney point wtp were recorded the source of e coli for the higher values recorded at the beaches and wtps is currently undetermined in the case of the wtps although the water quality is good the identification of microbial pollution sources of greatest significance is still vital for better planning and future protection of source water quality eight small but seasonally significant tributaries of widely varying drainage areas and hydrologic features hereafter referred to as small tributaries discharge into lake st clair along the southern shores with 0 2 flow contribution to the lake the pollution load from these small tributaries is expected to be negligible in the context of the larger lake therefore they have either been ignored or shown to be as such in previous hydrodynamic and water quality modellings studies that reported results on the larger lake st clair anderson et al 2010 bocaniov and scavia 2018 healy et al 2007 holtschlag and koschik 2002 madani et al 2020a monitoring by essex region conservation authority erca and provincial stream water quality monitoring network pwqmn provides evidence of frequent occurrence and at times appreciable high levels of e coli in these tributaries erca 2015 it is thus likely that one or more of the small tributaries may have a significant impact on the microbial water quality at the two beaches or the drinking water intakes which are in the nearshore region of the southern shores of lake st clair where these tributaries discharge however the relative contribution and significance of that impact are currently unknown many laboratory and field investigations have been conducted to examine environmental and ecological variables affecting e coli decay and the derived relationships are being included in microbial water quality models in another recent study on lake st clair madani et al 2020b showed that a time dependent decay rate using such relationships might be expected to give more realistic predictions than using a conservative estimate based on literature values such relationships are being included in ecological modelling frameworks and then coupled with hydrodynamic models for microbial water quality modelling brookes et al 2004 chen and liu 2017 cho et al 2016 gao et al 2015 hipsey et al 2008 overall the fate and transport of microbial pollution in a lake environment are influenced by hydrodynamics microbial load from tributaries and die off rate decay of the microbes which depend on the environmental conditions and physicochemical characteristics of the water body the primary objective of the current study was to examine the added impact of the eight small tributaries along the southern shores of lake st clair on the microbial water quality in lake st clair during the summer of 2016 particularly in the area surrounding the southern shoreline the hydrodynamics was simulated using the high resolution aem3d hydrodynamic model developed in our previous study madani et al 2020a and adapted for 2016 the fate of e coli was modelled using caedym computational aquatic ecosystem dynamics model available within the aem3d modelling framework madani et al 2020b showed that a time dependent decay rate within caedym based on water temperature and solar radiation that accounts for dark mortality rate light inactivation growth and predation in the environment may be expected to give more realistic predictions than using a conservative estimate based on literature values used in their previous study madani et al 2020a thus the same decay formulation was implemented in the current study the spatiotemporal features of impacts on the flow and water quality at the shoreline adjacent to the tributary outlets were investigated 2

4 1 hydrodynamic driver and ecological model in the current study aem3d by hydronumerics pty ltd http hydronumerics com au was used for modelling pathogen transport in lake st clair the aem3d formulations are based on elcom estuary and lake computer model an advanced three dimensional hydrodynamic model hodges 2000 coupled with the water quality model caedym computational aquatic ecosystem dynamics model that can simulate three dimensional transport and interactions of flow physics thermodynamics and ecology the model has been successfully applied to many large lakes around the world caramatti et al 2020 romero et al 2004 silva et al 2014 and great lakes including lake st clair bocaniov and scavia 2018 madani et al 2020a lake erie leon et al 2005 leon et al 2011 oveisy et al 2014 valipour et al 2016 valipour et al 2021 and lake ontario leon et al 2012 paturi et al 2015 and a review of the coupled model system has been performed by trolle et al 2012 the simulation period is from may 1 2016 until october 7 2016 encompassing a range of meteorological and e coli occurrence events the first month is considered as the warm up period and results are not shown 2 4 2 decay formulation a detailed description of the configuration of aem3d used here and its validation against previous studies and observation data such as water temperature for 2010 is presented in detail madani et al 2020a the governing equation that explains the transport of the e coli has the following general form 1 d c d t x j c u j x j κ j c x j c i n c o u t k c where c denotes the e coli concentration o r g s m 3 t is time x j is the distance in the j t h dimension m u j is the velocity in the j t h dimension m s κ j is eddy diffusivity c i n and c o u t are the inflow and outflow fluxes o r g s m 3 s and k is the overall decay rate in the current study we assumed the survival of e coli is dependent on several factors including physio chemical abiotic e g temperature and sunlight and biological biotic factors e g growth and also predation in the presence of other competing predation and grazing by larger eukaryotic organisms such as protozoa byappanahalli et al 2012 hipsey et al 2008 ishii and sadowsky 2008 other relevant processes such as adsorption to suspended particulate matter settling and resuspension of sediment are not considered in this study e coli cells are assumed to be neutrally buoyant possessing negligible settling velocities as previously it was shown that settling contributions to overall decay was negligible compared to sunlight inactivation thupaki et al 2010 weiskerger and phanikumar 2020 hence the overall decay rate can be formulated using the simplest approach assuming additive effects 2 k k t k l k p k g where k t is the natural mortality or die off rate due to water temperature and can be expressed as the arrhenius expression 3 k t k d 20 θ t 20 where t is the temperature c k d 20 is the dark death rate at 20 c in freshwater and θ controls the sensitivity of k t to water temperature change k l is total die off due to exposure to sunlight with different bandwidth it takes the form 4 k l b 1 n b ϕ k b f b i 0 1 e η b δ z e η b δ z where n b is the number of discrete solar bandwidths to be modelled which here is 3 visible uv a and uv b b is the bandwidth class 1 2 nb k b is the freshwater inactivation rate coefficient for exposure to the b t h class m 2 m j 1 ϕ is a constant to convert units from seconds to days and j to m j 8 64 10 2 δ z is the depth of the computational cell and η b is the extinction coefficient for each bandwidth region which governs how incident light is attenuated within the water column according to the beer law k p is a simple temperature dependent inactivation of enteric organisms due to predation and grazing 5 k p k p 20 θ p t 20 where k p 20 is the minimum rate due to predation at 20 c and θ p accounts for the sensitivity of predation to water temperature finally k g is the growth rate 6 k g μ m a x c t 1 t t m i n 1 exp c t 2 t t m a x 2 where μ m a x is the maximum growth rate at 20 c and c t 1 c t 2 t m i n and t m a x are species specific constants controlling the exact shape of the growth function a detailed description of the formula we used for each of the parameters of decay and growth rate are presented by hipsey et al 2008 similar formulations have been used in other e coli modelling studies in the great lakes basin ge et al 2012 liu et al 2006 safaie et al 2020 safaie et al 2016 thupaki et al 2010 weiskerger and phanikumar 2020 2 4 3 relative contribution of tributaries to flow and e coli concentration the flow contribution of each tributary is defined as the relative quantity of water received from the inflow of that tributary to the location of concern to calculate this a conservative soluble tracer is used to simulate the distribution of the effluent plume zhao et al 2012 zhao et al 2021 different tracers are defined for each tributary and their concentration set to unity for all the tributaries so it represents the inflow the conservative tracer with zero decay rate is employed so that the impacts of receiving water hydrodynamics are isolated from those associated with decay processes to calculate the relative contribution of tributaries to the e coli concentration at different sites a similar process is repeated but the tracer concentration for each tributary are set to the estimated e coli concentration an overall decay rate of 0 9 d 1 which are obtained from the average condition during the simulation period according to the eq 2 was used flow and e coli contribution of each tributary at a point in the lake can be expressed mathematically as 7 relative flow or e c o l i contribution c t r i b i i 1 n c t r i b i 100 where c t r i b i is the tracer concentration receiving from tributary i at the location of interest and n is the number of tributaries 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli distribution in lake st clair and effect of small tributaries the model s ability to simulate circulation patterns and thermal structure in lake st clair were recently validated and examined using field observations madani et al 2020a to summarize the model can simulate both low and high values of velocity and its rapid changes in both west east and south north direction while the west east component performed better the model accuracy was assessed using normalized root mean square difference nrmse the west east and south north velocity components nrmse are 0 276 and 0 449 respectively in addition as water temperature is an important parameter in e coli fate proper calibration was done to simulate it in good agreement with the measured data and our model skill in reproducing water temperature is in good agreement with the observed data with nrmse and r2 of 0 37 and 0 88 respectively in this paper we focus on our new results of e coli distribution model simulations were carried out with and without all the small tributaries along the southern edge of lake st clair shown in fig 1 and the results for maximum 90th percentiles and mean predicted e coli concentration are presented in fig 2 the results show that while the predicted e coli concentrations for much of lake st clair are less influenced by the small tributaries their impact on mean e coli concentration at a narrow nearshore region along the southern edge is quite significant with the differences ranging between 30 350 cfu 100 ml the similarity in regions of influence seen for the 90th percentile and mean differences in e coli concentrations fig 2b c shows that in this region the influence of the small tributaries is significant most of the time occasionally the influence can extend beyond this narrow nearshore region as seen for the maximum in fig 2a but are relatively rare high water age madani et al 2020a and high decay rate in the middle south and southeastern part of the lake are believed to be responsible for lower e coli counts in those regions limited e coli monitoring data for 2016 in the nearshore region is available from the field measurements by eccc unpublished paper tom edge 2018 and the two town of lakeshore water treatment plants the locations of the sites are shown in fig 1 a comparison of the time series of the simulated results with and without the inclusion of the small tributaries and these limited observations is shown in fig 3 results of simulated e coli concentration with and without the inclusion of small tributaries at site p8 are very similar except for occasional differences and are in good agreement with observations this site is close to thames river is located at the northeast of its mouth and is farther away from the smaller tributaries thames river is one of the major tributaries and is included in both models the results suggest that the site is dominantly influenced by thames river with little to no influence of the smaller tributaries most of the time which explains the lack of difference observed in the model results for sites p1 which is the nearest site to the location of sandpoint beach p3 p5 and the two drinking water intakes which are closer to the small tributaries and farther away from thames river e coli concentration ranging between 0 20 cfu 100 ml have been observed which seem to be qualitatively in better agreement with model results where the additional contribution from the smaller tributaries was included fig 3 blue solid line the e coli concentrations simulated without the inclusion of the smaller tributaries were 1 cfu 100 ml most of the time fig 3 solid black line the spatial variation of e coli concentration at sites p3 and ls wtp and sites p5 and sp wtp cannot be captured by the 400 m grid resolution used in this study and therefore they are showed as together in fig 3 c d the impact of smaller tributaries on e coli concentrations at these sites is most evident during significant rainfall events see figure s2 in supplementary information for rainfall data particularly the largest one in late september 2016 during this event the predicted e coli concentrations at these sites including smaller tributaries range between 20 60 cfu 100 ml as compared to 5 cfu 100 ml without including smaller tributaries however monitoring data during such events is lacking in addition as can be seen in fig 3 c d model simulations with and without inclusion of the small tributaries underestimate the e coli concentration at sites p3 ls wtp p5 and sp wtp some of the many possible reasons for seeing this discrepancy in results could be because of the presence of additional e coli sources that were not accounted for in the model safaie et al 2020 or due to low resolution of the data that was used for load estimation or the potential of existence of local sources that are not included in the model for further verification of the modelling results and model improvements more intense and temporally resolved monitoring data during significant rainfall events is needed both for e coli concentrations at these sites and for better quantification of microbial loadings from the small tributaries such data can also help to further improve the e coli model by including the possible impact of particle settling and resuspension in the nearshore region and also account for potential sediment associated bacteria transport in streambed kim et al 2010 the estimation of the flow and e coli loading based on the limited available data and using it for ungagged tributaries is one on the main source of uncertainty in the model in the case of site p1 although it is the nearest site to sandpoint beach about 500 m the measured e coli concentration is much lower than the samples taken directly from the beach a few meters from the shoreline by wechu see supplementary information this site is about 200 m from the shore and due to the grid resolution cannot be the best representative of the beach the range and mean observed concentrations at the various sites are compared with various model simulations in fig 4 the simulations with small tributaries st include those with a time variable decay rate predicted using caedym fig 4 orange bars and constant decay rate average of decay rates calculated from caedym over the domain and simulation period fig 4 blue bars model simulations were also obtained with time variable decay but without including the small tributaries green bars for sites p1 p2 p7 and p8 which are farther away from the smaller tributaries the observed e coli concentrations are 5 cfu 100 ml and the model simulations are similar for sites p3 p5 town of lakeshore drinking water intakes ls wtp and sp wtp and the site near the confluence of ruscom river p4 the mean and range of e coli concentrations predicted using model simulations including small tributaries variable decay with st and constant decay with st fig 4 are higher than those without inclusion small tributaries and are also in better agreement with the observations these results confirm that the microbial water quality in the nearshore region close to the confluence of the eight smaller tributaries along the southern edge of lake st clair is significantly affected by one or more of these tributaries and the effect is captured by both models using a time variable or constant decay rates the range of predicted e coli concentrations using the time variable decay rate is in better agreement with the range of observed values than that using the constant decay rate suggesting that time variable decay may be preferable for dynamic simulations over time a similar conclusion has been drawn in previous studies madani et al 2020b 3 2 area of e coli influence and relative contribution of each tributary the combined flow from the eight small tributaries is very small and estimated to be 0 2 of the total inflows arriving at lake st clair in the nearshore region of a tributary the proximity of a study site to the tributary locations hydrodynamic conditions and inflows from the other major tributaries determine the contribution of the tributary to the water at that site the relative contribution of the eight small tributaries to the water at different sites near the southern shore of lake st clair as compared to the major tributaries is presented in table 1 given the proximity of the small tributaries to the sites their contribution to the water at these sites is much higher than their flow contribution to the whole lake the resulting contribution of the major tributaries is still high ranging between 64 7 in site p4 to 98 4 in site p6 for the same sites table 2 shows that the contribution to the e coli concentration was quite different from its flow contribution seen in table 1 for six of the 11 sites located in the nearshore region of the 40 km stretch between pike creek and little creek the impact on e coli concentrations from the eight small tributaries are far greater than their flow contribution that are predicted based on hydrodynamics alone while the relative flow contribution from all eight tributaries was 36 table 1 their relative contribution to e coli concentration exceeds 80 in most of the sites see fig 5 and table 2 for sites p3 and ls wtp for example while their source water is dominated by the major tributaries 77 6 and 80 9 respectively the contribution to e coli concentration is predicted to be dominated by the input from belle river 71 6 and 55 3 respectively see table 2 site p1 which is the nearest site to the location of sandpoint beach is highly influenced by e coli input from major tributaries pike creek and ruscom river with contributions of 56 6 15 9 and 8 3 respectively belle river is much closer to site p1 but its e coli contribution is less than the ruscom river because of the higher flow contribution of the ruscom river 2 1 compared to belle river 0 8 this can be attributed to the added impact of travel time on death or decay for microbial pollution while the results are subject to further validation the findings have significant implications for future monitoring and decision making for source protection given the dominance of the eight major tributaries influence on the microbial water quality in this nearshore region that includes two wtps and two public beaches they should be subject to more focused evaluation the low average and range of predicted e coli concentrations 30 cfu 100 ml at p1 suggest that watershed inputs to lake st clair including the smaller tributaries are still unlikely to be responsible for the exceedances of beach water quality standards 36 of samples observed at sandpoint beach wechu data si in our previous study the four major tributaries of lake st clair st clair sydenham thames and clinton rivers that account for 99 5 of lake st clair inflow and are also the dominant contributors of microbial pollution to the lake were predicted to have a minimal impact on the beach water quality madani et al 2020a however the larger range of predicted e coli up to 61 cfu 100 ml at p3 which is close to ls wtp and lp beach and the dominant 70 predicted contribution of belle river to e coli concentration suggests that belle river could have a significant impact on the microbial water quality at these two locations given the closer proximity of lp beach to belle river as compared to site p3 belle river could be a significant contributor to the 86 exceedances of beach water quality standards observed at the beach during the 2016 sampling season wechu data see supplementary information fig 5 shows the map and contour plot of the mean and 90th percentile of the relative e coli contribution from small tributaries combined the entire southern shoreline is affected by more than 80 contribution from small tributaries areas in the middle and eastern parts of the lake can occasionally have up to 50 relative contribution from small tributaries to e coli concentration fig 5b however it is important to note that the predicted total e coli concentration in these regions is very low see fig 2 in order to better understand and show the areal extent of influence for each tributary contour lines are plotted where the mean e coli concentrations are reduced by 90 1 log reduction and by 99 2 log reduction after their confluence with the lake as illustrated in fig 6 the results show that except for a narrow nearshore region along the southern edge close to their location of the confluence with lake st clair e coli concentrations resulting from the smaller tributaries were rapidly reduced by 99 the eight locations in table 2 where the combined contribution to e coli concentration from the eight smaller tributaries is 80 are within the 1 or 2 log reduction contours of one or more of these tributaries for example sites p3 and ls wtp are located in the area of 1 log reduction from belle river and 2 log reduction from duck creek moison creek ruscom river stony point and little creek that means the mean e coli concentration of belle river of 414 cfu 100 ml table s1 is reduced to 40 cfu 100 ml at those two sites when maximum e coli concentration enters from belle river 5600 cfu 100 ml and coincides with an east to west current in the southern shoreline the tributary concentrations are still reduced to less than 56 cfu 100 ml before reaching to sandpoint beach whether each site is affected by the other tributaries or not can be obtained from fig 6 as another example fig 6 shows in the case of site p1 it is only affected by inputs from pike creek and puce river any e coli entered from other tributaries will reduce by more than 2 log reduction more than 99 reduction before arriving at site p1 4 conclusion a 3d high resolution model aem3d was used to assess the impact on microbial water quality in lake st clair from eight smaller tributaries located on its southern edge although the combined flow contribution of these small tributaries to lake st clair compared to the major rivers is marginal less than 0 2 their impact on a narrow nearshore region along the southern edge is quite significant in the nearshore region of a 40 km stretch along the southern edge of the lake where the eight smaller tributaries discharge into the lake while the total flow contribution from the eight to the water was estimated in the range between 18 35 the contribution to the resulting e coli concentration was estimated to be 80 for sampling sites located within the study area model simulations that included the smaller tributaries inflows were in better agreement with observations than those without this suggests that the modelling framework used in the study can allow for the identification of areal zones where the contribution of a tributary may be significant the framework was then used to identify areal zones for each tributary within which 1 log 90 or 2 log 99 reduction in e coli concentration is expected due to decay and dilution if it was the sole contributor depending on the location of interest such zones can then be used to identify whether that location is likely to be impacted by the tributary for sandpoint beach the predicted e coli concentrations in its vicinity including the contributions from small tributaries suggest that watershed inputs are unlikely to be the source for exceedances of the provincial microbial beach water quality standards the nearshore region at the confluence of belle river includes and significantly impacts both a beach lp beach and a water treatment plant ls wtp intake a higher resolution model than the current 400 m grid size may be warranted to better elucidate this impact belle river could be a significant source for exceedances of the provincial microbial beach water quality standards observed at lp beach for both the water treatment plants both the monitored and predicted e coli concentrations are generally good 10 cfu 100 ml for lakeshore wtp greater than 80 of this is predicted to come from three smaller tributaries belle river ruscom river and duck creek for stoney point wtp greater than 70 of the contribution to e coli concentrations is also predicted to come from three but different smaller tributaries stoney point ruscom river little creek for tributaries that do not significantly affect the hydrodynamics in a lake the framework presented in the current study can be used to identify approximate areal zones of influence using contour plots of expected e coli log reductions depending on the location of interest such zones can then be used to identify whether the location is likely to be significantly impacted by the tributary to decide whether it s inclusion may deserve further consideration the hydrodynamics in the nearshore region is expected to be more complex than the larger lake water quality in these regions can be further influenced by the confluence of tributaries local surface runoffs or the presence of structures or changes in shoreline characteristics water quality changes in nearshore regions affected by such features are unlikely to be accurately predicted using the uniform grid size of 400 m used in the current modelling framework credit authorship contribution statement mohammad madani conceptualization methodology

24559,fecal contamination of surface water resource is a major health concern primarily due to the potential for pathogenic organisms to be transmitted to human by contaminated water in lake wide modelling of large lakes with many sources of microbial contamination minor contributions from small tributaries are generally ignored in this study we applied a three dimensional high resolution hydrodynamic and water quality model to assess the impact of eight smaller tributaries located on the southern edge of lake st clair on microbial water quality during the summer of 2016 the impact at two beaches and two drinking water intakes located in the nearshore region of the southern edge of lake st clair was considered results reveal that the microbial water quality in the nearshore regions close to these eight small tributaries confluence are significantly affected by one or more of these tributaries although this effect is captured by our model with a time variable or constant decay rates the use of time variable decay may be preferable for dynamic simulations over time the total flow contribution from the smaller tributaries was estimated in the range of 18 35 while that for e coli concentration was 80 three small tributaries were also predicted to account for 70 of the e coli concentrations at drinking water intakes for tributaries that do not significantly affect the hydrodynamics in a lake a new framework is presented to identify approximate influence zones for microbial pollution that can help determine if a given location is likely to be impacted by the inflowing tributaries graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial modelling e coli aem3d lake st clair caedym 1 introduction fecal pollution of surface water resources is a global issue of concern human health risks from such pollution are associated with exposure to waterborne pathogens that may be present in human or animal feces through drinking or recreational use pandey et al 2014 who 2003 pathogens can be infectious at low dosages and monitoring low concentrations can be difficult time consuming and costly routine monitoring for multitude waterborne pathogens of fecal origin is also impractical the challenges associated with detecting pathogenic microorganisms in the water are currently too great to recommend this practice as part of a regular monitoring program hence various fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli are usually used to detect fecal pollution in natural waters health canada 2012 usepa 2012 who 2017 in canada raw drinking water sources and recreational waters are assessed through routine monitoring of e coli health canada 2020 2012 although monitoring for e coli can provide useful information to evaluate microbiological risks and treatment requirements for surface water sources its limitations need to be addressed for example in large water bodies with upstream watersheds impacted by human and animal fecal pollution significant fecal microbial pollution is mobilized into their tributaries during storm events this results in a significant and dynamic increase in microbial loadings to the receiving waters such changes in the loads produce dynamic and unexpected changes in the microbial water quality of the receiving waterbody which are difficult and costly to capture through monitoring studies due to the required sampling frequency and the large number of samples needed additional monitoring obstacles include requirements for equipment laboratory and field technicians and the fact that with monitoring alone it is difficult to identify potential sources of fecal pollution which could aid in better management planning alternatively process based numerical models can be used with the ability to link pollution sources and receptors madani et al 2020a once validated these models can become useful tools for managers to predict expected water quality changes at water intakes many process based models have been developed and applied to simulate the fate and transport of microbial pollution in water bodies in recent years bonamano et al 2015 bravo et al 2017 garcia armisen et al 2006 liu et al 2006 muirhead and monaghan 2012 safaie et al 2016 these models have demonstrated better spatial and temporal resolution of fib distributions at a lower cost when combined with judicious monitoring lake st clair is a precious natural resource that provides drinking water for millions of people in the united states and canada and numerous recreational opportunities the water quality concerns in lake st clair include pathogens toxic contaminants and eutrophication some previous studies have examined lake wide hydrodynamic and or nutrient transport modelling anderson et al 2010 bocaniov and scavia 2018 healy et al 2007 holtschlag and koschik 2002 for lake st clair the four major tributaries st clair sydenham thames and clinton rivers account for 99 5 of lake st clair inflow and are also the dominant contributors of microbial pollution to the lake more recently a high resolution 3d hydrodynamic model was developed using the aquatic ecosystem model aem3d modelling platform and applied to assess the impact of microbial pollution from the four major tributaries on microbial water quality in the lake as well as on a popular beach sandpoint beach windsor ontario canada located on the southern edge of the lake madani et al 2020a the results suggest that a large part of the lake starting from the middle of the lake to the southern shoreline was minimally affected by the four major tributaries combined input with maximum predicted e coli concentration of 10 cfu 100 ml there are two popular public beaches sandpoint and lakeview park west beach lp and two intakes for drinking water treatment plants lakeshore and stoney point close to the southern shores of lake st clair examining the data collected weekly by the local health unit as part of the beach monitoring program between 2010 2019 for both beaches the provincial beach water quality e coli standard of 100 cfu 100 ml was exceeded in more than 50 and 70 of the samples from sandpoint beach and lp beach respectively see supplementary information in 8 12 of the samples e coli level was 1000 cfu 100 ml and the beaches were closed for the following week e coli levels in the raw water at the two water treatment plants wtps seem to be generally very low with most values in 2016 recorded to be 10 cfu 100 ml see supplementary information occasionally higher values of up to 20 cfu 100 ml at lakeshore wtp and 10 cfu 100 ml at stoney point wtp were recorded the source of e coli for the higher values recorded at the beaches and wtps is currently undetermined in the case of the wtps although the water quality is good the identification of microbial pollution sources of greatest significance is still vital for better planning and future protection of source water quality eight small but seasonally significant tributaries of widely varying drainage areas and hydrologic features hereafter referred to as small tributaries discharge into lake st clair along the southern shores with 0 2 flow contribution to the lake the pollution load from these small tributaries is expected to be negligible in the context of the larger lake therefore they have either been ignored or shown to be as such in previous hydrodynamic and water quality modellings studies that reported results on the larger lake st clair anderson et al 2010 bocaniov and scavia 2018 healy et al 2007 holtschlag and koschik 2002 madani et al 2020a monitoring by essex region conservation authority erca and provincial stream water quality monitoring network pwqmn provides evidence of frequent occurrence and at times appreciable high levels of e coli in these tributaries erca 2015 it is thus likely that one or more of the small tributaries may have a significant impact on the microbial water quality at the two beaches or the drinking water intakes which are in the nearshore region of the southern shores of lake st clair where these tributaries discharge however the relative contribution and significance of that impact are currently unknown many laboratory and field investigations have been conducted to examine environmental and ecological variables affecting e coli decay and the derived relationships are being included in microbial water quality models in another recent study on lake st clair madani et al 2020b showed that a time dependent decay rate using such relationships might be expected to give more realistic predictions than using a conservative estimate based on literature values such relationships are being included in ecological modelling frameworks and then coupled with hydrodynamic models for microbial water quality modelling brookes et al 2004 chen and liu 2017 cho et al 2016 gao et al 2015 hipsey et al 2008 overall the fate and transport of microbial pollution in a lake environment are influenced by hydrodynamics microbial load from tributaries and die off rate decay of the microbes which depend on the environmental conditions and physicochemical characteristics of the water body the primary objective of the current study was to examine the added impact of the eight small tributaries along the southern shores of lake st clair on the microbial water quality in lake st clair during the summer of 2016 particularly in the area surrounding the southern shoreline the hydrodynamics was simulated using the high resolution aem3d hydrodynamic model developed in our previous study madani et al 2020a and adapted for 2016 the fate of e coli was modelled using caedym computational aquatic ecosystem dynamics model available within the aem3d modelling framework madani et al 2020b showed that a time dependent decay rate within caedym based on water temperature and solar radiation that accounts for dark mortality rate light inactivation growth and predation in the environment may be expected to give more realistic predictions than using a conservative estimate based on literature values used in their previous study madani et al 2020a thus the same decay formulation was implemented in the current study the spatiotemporal features of impacts on the flow and water quality at the shoreline adjacent to the tributary outlets were investigated 2

according to routine monitoring data collected by the windsor essex county health unit wechu see supplementary information both beaches are frequently posted as unsafe for water recreation for the

thames sydenham st clair and clinton rivers and the outflow detroit river were obtained from the nearest gauged stations as described in the previous paper madani et al 2020a for the year 2016 the boundary condition for thames river is based on the data from site t0 at the river mouth in the case of small tributaries pike creek puce river belle river duck creek moison creek ruscom river stoney point drainage area and little creek the observed flow is only available for ruscom river at one station 02gh002 flow for other tributaries was obtained using their watershed area ratio to the ruscom river watershed e coli data for small tributaries are limited to few grab samples collected by erca and pwqmn a matlab script was used to correlate flow with e coli to obtain time series of e coli concentration for each tributary information of mean max and 90th percentile e coli concentrations from all tributaries are presented in table s2 in supplementary information 2 4 modelling framework 2 4 1 hydrodynamic driver and ecological model in the current study aem3d by hydronumerics pty ltd http hydronumerics com au was used for modelling pathogen transport in lake st clair the aem3d formulations are based on elcom estuary and lake computer model an advanced three dimensional hydrodynamic model hodges 2000 coupled with the water quality model caedym computational aquatic ecosystem dynamics model that can simulate three dimensional transport and interactions of flow physics thermodynamics and ecology the model has been successfully applied to many large lakes around the world caramatti et al 2020 romero et al 2004 silva et al 2014 and great lakes including lake st clair bocaniov and scavia 2018 madani et al 2020a lake erie leon et al 2005 leon et al 2011 oveisy et al 2014 valipour et al 2016 valipour et al 2021 and lake ontario leon et al 2012 paturi et al 2015 and a review of the coupled model system has been performed by trolle et al 2012 the simulation period is from may 1 2016 until october 7 2016 encompassing a range of meteorological and e coli occurrence events the first month is considered as the warm up period and results are not shown 2 4 2 decay formulation a detailed description of the configuration of aem3d used here and its validation against previous studies and observation data such as water temperature for 2010 is presented in detail madani et al 2020a the governing equation that explains the transport of the e coli has the following general form 1 d c d t x j c u j x j κ j c x j c i n c o u t k c where c denotes the e coli concentration o r g s m 3 t is time x j is the distance in the j t h dimension m u j is the velocity in the j t h dimension m s κ j is eddy diffusivity c i n and c o u t are the inflow and outflow fluxes o r g s m 3 s and k is the overall decay rate in the current study we assumed the survival of e coli is dependent on several factors including physio chemical abiotic e g temperature and sunlight and biological biotic factors e g growth and also predation in the presence of other competing predation and grazing by larger eukaryotic organisms such as protozoa byappanahalli et al 2012 hipsey et al 2008 ishii and sadowsky 2008 other relevant processes such as adsorption to suspended particulate matter settling and resuspension of sediment are not considered in this study e coli cells are assumed to be neutrally buoyant possessing negligible settling velocities as previously it was shown that settling contributions to overall decay was negligible compared to sunlight inactivation thupaki et al 2010 weiskerger and phanikumar 2020 hence the overall decay rate can be formulated using the simplest approach assuming additive effects 2 k k t k l k p k g where k t is the natural mortality or die off rate due to water temperature and can be expressed as the arrhenius expression 3 k t k d 20 θ t 20 where t is the temperature c k d 20 is the dark death rate at 20 c in freshwater and θ controls the sensitivity of k t to water temperature change k l is total die off due to exposure to sunlight with different bandwidth it takes the form 4 k l b 1 n b ϕ k b f b i 0 1 e η b δ z e η b δ z where n b is the number of discrete solar bandwidths to be modelled which here is 3 visible uv a and uv b b is the bandwidth class 1 2 nb k b is the freshwater inactivation rate coefficient for exposure to the b t h class m 2 m j 1 ϕ is a constant to convert units from seconds to days and j to m j 8 64 10 2 δ z is the depth of the computational cell and η b is the extinction coefficient for each bandwidth region which governs how incident light is attenuated within the water column according to the beer law k p is a simple temperature dependent inactivation of enteric organisms due to predation and grazing 5 k p k p 20 θ p t 20 where k p 20 is the minimum rate due to predation at 20 c and θ p accounts for the sensitivity of predation to water temperature finally k g is the growth rate 6 k g μ m a x c t 1 t t m i n 1 exp c t 2 t t m a x 2 where μ m a x is the maximum growth rate at 20 c and c t 1 c t 2 t m i n and t m a x are species specific constants controlling the exact shape of the growth function a detailed description of the formula we used for each of the parameters of decay and growth rate are presented by hipsey et al 2008 similar formulations have been used in other e coli modelling studies in the great lakes basin ge et al 2012 liu et al 2006 safaie et al 2020 safaie et al 2016 thupaki et al 2010 weiskerger and phanikumar 2020 2 4 3 relative contribution of tributaries to flow and e coli concentration the flow contribution of each tributary is defined as the relative quantity of water received from the inflow of that tributary to the location of concern to calculate this a conservative soluble tracer is used to simulate the distribution of the effluent plume zhao et al 2012 zhao et al 2021 different tracers are defined for each tributary and their concentration set to unity for all the tributaries so it represents the inflow the conservative tracer with zero decay rate is employed so that the impacts of receiving water hydrodynamics are isolated from those associated with decay processes to calculate the relative contribution of tributaries to the e coli concentration at different sites a similar process is repeated but the tracer concentration for each tributary are set to the estimated e coli concentration an overall decay rate of 0 9 d 1 which are obtained from the average condition during the simulation period according to the eq 2 was used flow and e coli contribution of each tributary at a point in the lake can be expressed mathematically as 7 relative flow or e c o l i contribution c t r i b i i 1 n c t r i b i 100 where c t r i b i is the tracer concentration receiving from tributary i at the location of interest and n is the number of tributaries 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli distribution in lake st clair and effect of small tributaries the model s ability to simulate circulation patterns and thermal structure in lake st clair were recently validated and examined using field observations madani et al 2020a to summarize the model can simulate both low and high values of velocity and its rapid changes in both west east and south north direction while the west east component performed better the model accuracy was assessed using normalized root mean square difference nrmse the west east and south north velocity components nrmse are 0 276 and 0 449 respectively in addition as water temperature is an important parameter in e coli fate proper calibration was done to simulate it in good agreement with the measured data and our model skill in reproducing water temperature is in good agreement with the observed data with nrmse and r2 of 0 37 and 0 88 respectively in this paper we focus on our new results of e coli distribution model simulations were carried out with and without all the small tributaries along the southern edge of lake st clair shown in fig 1 and the results for maximum 90th percentiles and mean predicted e coli concentration are presented in fig 2 the results show that while the predicted e coli concentrations for much of lake st clair are less influenced by the small tributaries their impact on mean e coli concentration at a narrow nearshore region along the southern edge is quite significant with the differences ranging between 30 350 cfu 100 ml the similarity in regions of influence seen for the 90th percentile and mean differences in e coli concentrations fig 2b c shows that in this region the influence of the small tributaries is significant most of the time occasionally the influence can extend beyond this narrow nearshore region as seen for the maximum in fig 2a but are relatively rare high water age madani et al 2020a and high decay rate in the middle south and southeastern part of the lake are believed to be responsible for lower e coli counts in those regions limited e coli monitoring data for 2016 in the nearshore region is available from the field measurements by eccc unpublished paper tom edge 2018 and the two town of lakeshore water treatment plants the locations of the sites are shown in fig 1 a comparison of the time series of the simulated results with and without the inclusion of the small tributaries and these limited observations is shown in fig 3 results of simulated e coli concentration with and without the inclusion of small tributaries at site p8 are very similar except for occasional differences and are in good agreement with observations this site is close to thames river is located at the northeast of its mouth and is farther away from the smaller tributaries thames river is one of the major tributaries and is included in both models the results suggest that the site is dominantly influenced by thames river with little to no influence of the smaller tributaries most of the time which explains the lack of difference observed in the model results for sites p1 which is the nearest site to the location of sandpoint beach p3 p5 and the two drinking water intakes which are closer to the small tributaries and farther away from thames river e coli concentration ranging between 0 20 cfu 100 ml have been observed which seem to be qualitatively in better agreement with model results where the additional contribution from the smaller tributaries was included fig 3 blue solid line the e coli concentrations simulated without the inclusion of the smaller tributaries were 1 cfu 100 ml most of the time fig 3 solid black line the spatial variation of e coli concentration at sites p3 and ls wtp and sites p5 and sp wtp cannot be captured by the 400 m grid resolution used in this study and therefore they are showed as together in fig 3 c d the impact of smaller tributaries on e coli concentrations at these sites is most evident during significant rainfall events see figure s2 in supplementary information for rainfall data particularly the largest one in late september 2016 during this event the predicted e coli concentrations at these sites including smaller tributaries range between 20 60 cfu 100 ml as compared to 5 cfu 100 ml without including smaller tributaries however monitoring data during such events is lacking in addition as can be seen in fig 3 c d model simulations with and without inclusion of the small tributaries underestimate the e coli concentration at sites p3 ls wtp p5 and sp wtp some of the many possible reasons for seeing this discrepancy in results could be because of the presence of additional e coli sources that were not accounted for in the model safaie et al 2020 or due to low resolution of the data that was used for load estimation or the potential of existence of local sources that are not included in the model for further verification of the modelling results and model improvements more intense and temporally resolved monitoring data during significant rainfall events is needed both for e coli concentrations at these sites and for better quantification of microbial loadings from the small tributaries such data can also help to further improve the e coli model by including the possible impact of particle settling and resuspension in the nearshore region and also account for potential sediment associated bacteria transport in streambed kim et al 2010 the estimation of the flow and e coli loading based on the limited available data and using it for ungagged tributaries is one on the main source of uncertainty in the model in the case of site p1 although it is the nearest site to sandpoint beach about 500 m the measured e coli concentration is much lower than the samples taken directly from the beach a few meters from the shoreline by wechu see supplementary information this site is about 200 m from the shore and due to the grid resolution cannot be the best representative of the beach the range and mean observed concentrations at the various sites are compared with various model simulations in fig 4 the simulations with small tributaries st include those with a time variable decay rate predicted using caedym fig 4 orange bars and constant decay rate average of decay rates calculated from caedym over the domain and simulation period fig 4 blue bars model simulations were also obtained with time variable decay but without including the small tributaries green bars for sites p1 p2 p7 and p8 which are farther away from the smaller tributaries the observed e coli concentrations are 5 cfu 100 ml and the model simulations are similar for sites p3 p5 town of lakeshore drinking water intakes ls wtp and sp wtp and the site near the confluence of ruscom river p4 the mean and range of e coli concentrations predicted using model simulations including small tributaries variable decay with st and constant decay with st fig 4 are higher than those without inclusion small tributaries and are also in better agreement with the observations these results confirm that the microbial water quality in the nearshore region close to the confluence of the eight smaller tributaries along the southern edge of lake st clair is significantly affected by one or more of these tributaries and the effect is captured by both models using a time variable or constant decay rates the range of predicted e coli concentrations using the time variable decay rate is in better agreement with the range of observed values than that using the constant decay rate suggesting that time variable decay may be preferable for dynamic simulations over time a similar conclusion has been drawn in previous studies madani et al 2020b 3 2 area of e coli influence and relative contribution of each tributary the combined flow from the eight small tributaries is very small and estimated to be 0 2 of the total inflows arriving at lake st clair in the nearshore region of a tributary the proximity of a study site to the tributary locations hydrodynamic conditions and inflows from the other major tributaries determine the contribution of the tributary to the water at that site the relative contribution of the eight small tributaries to the water at different sites near the southern shore of lake st clair as compared to the major tributaries is presented in table 1 given the proximity of the small tributaries to the sites their contribution to the water at these sites is much higher than their flow contribution to the whole lake the resulting contribution of the major tributaries is still high ranging between 64 7 in site p4 to 98 4 in site p6 for the same sites table 2 shows that the contribution to the e coli concentration was quite different from its flow contribution seen in table 1 for six of the 11 sites located in the nearshore region of the 40 km stretch between pike creek and little creek the impact on e coli concentrations from the eight small tributaries are far greater than their flow contribution that are predicted based on hydrodynamics alone while the relative flow contribution from all eight tributaries was 36 table 1 their relative contribution to e coli concentration exceeds 80 in most of the sites see fig 5 and table 2 for sites p3 and ls wtp for example while their source water is dominated by the major tributaries 77 6 and 80 9 respectively the contribution to e coli concentration is predicted to be dominated by the input from belle river 71 6 and 55 3 respectively see table 2 site p1 which is the nearest site to the location of sandpoint beach is highly influenced by e coli input from major tributaries pike creek and ruscom river with contributions of 56 6 15 9 and 8 3 respectively belle river is much closer to site p1 but its e coli contribution is less than the ruscom river because of the higher flow contribution of the ruscom river 2 1 compared to belle river 0 8 this can be attributed to the added impact of travel time on death or decay for microbial pollution while the results are subject to further validation the findings have significant implications for future monitoring and decision making for source protection given the dominance of the eight major tributaries influence on the microbial water quality in this nearshore region that includes two wtps and two public beaches they should be subject to more focused evaluation the low average and range of predicted e coli concentrations 30 cfu 100 ml at p1 suggest that watershed inputs to lake st clair including the smaller tributaries are still unlikely to be responsible for the exceedances of beach water quality standards 36 of samples observed at sandpoint beach wechu data si in our previous study the four major tributaries of lake st clair st clair sydenham thames and clinton rivers that account for 99 5 of lake st clair inflow and are also the dominant contributors of microbial pollution to the lake were predicted to have a minimal impact on the beach water quality madani et al 2020a however the larger range of predicted e coli up to 61 cfu 100 ml at p3 which is close to ls wtp and lp beach and the dominant 70 predicted contribution of belle river to e coli concentration suggests that belle river could have a significant impact on the microbial water quality at these two locations given the closer proximity of lp beach to belle river as compared to site p3 belle river could be a significant contributor to the 86 exceedances of beach water quality standards observed at the beach during the 2016 sampling season wechu data see supplementary information fig 5 shows the map and contour plot of the mean and 90th percentile of the relative e coli contribution from small tributaries combined the entire southern shoreline is affected by more than 80 contribution from small tributaries areas in the middle and eastern parts of the lake can occasionally have up to 50 relative contribution from small tributaries to e coli concentration fig 5b however it is important to note that the predicted total e coli concentration in these regions is very low see fig 2 in order to better understand and show the areal extent of influence for each tributary contour lines are plotted where the mean e coli concentrations are reduced by 90 1 log reduction and by 99 2 log reduction after their confluence with the lake as illustrated in fig 6 the results show that except for a narrow nearshore region along the southern edge close to their location of the confluence with lake st clair e coli concentrations resulting from the smaller tributaries were rapidly reduced by 99 the eight locations in table 2 where the combined contribution to e coli concentration from the eight smaller tributaries is 80 are within the 1 or 2 log reduction contours of one or more of these tributaries for example sites p3 and ls wtp are located in the area of 1 log reduction from belle river and 2 log reduction from duck creek moison creek ruscom river stony point and little creek that means the mean e coli concentration of belle river of 414 cfu 100 ml table s1 is reduced to 40 cfu 100 ml at those two sites when maximum e coli concentration enters from belle river 5600 cfu 100 ml and coincides with an east to west current in the southern shoreline the tributary concentrations are still reduced to less than 56 cfu 100 ml before reaching to sandpoint beach whether each site is affected by the other tributaries or not can be obtained from fig 6 as another example fig 6 shows in the case of site p1 it is only affected by inputs from pike creek and puce river any e coli entered from other tributaries will reduce by more than 2 log reduction more than 99 reduction before arriving at site p1 4 conclusion a 3d high resolution model aem3d was used to assess the impact on microbial water quality in lake st clair from eight smaller tributaries located on its southern edge although the combined flow contribution of these small tributaries to lake st clair compared to the major rivers is marginal less than 0 2 their impact on a narrow nearshore region along the southern edge is quite significant in the nearshore region of a 40 km stretch along the southern edge of the lake where the eight smaller tributaries discharge into the lake while the total flow contribution from the eight to the water was estimated in the range between 18 35 the contribution to the resulting e coli concentration was estimated to be 80 for sampling sites located within the study area model simulations that included the smaller tributaries inflows were in better agreement with observations than those without this suggests that the modelling framework used in the study can allow for the identification of areal zones where the contribution of a tributary may be significant the framework was then used to identify areal zones for each tributary within which 1 log 90 or 2 log 99 reduction in e coli concentration is expected due to decay and dilution if it was the sole contributor depending on the location of interest such zones can then be used to identify whether that location is likely to be impacted by the tributary for sandpoint beach the predicted e coli concentrations in its vicinity including the contributions from small tributaries suggest that watershed inputs are unlikely to be the source for exceedances of the provincial microbial beach water quality standards the nearshore region at the confluence of belle river includes and significantly impacts both a beach lp beach and a water treatment plant ls wtp intake a higher resolution model than the current 400 m grid size may be warranted to better elucidate this impact belle river could be a significant source for exceedances of the provincial microbial beach water quality standards observed at lp beach for both the water treatment plants both the monitored and predicted e coli concentrations are generally good 10 cfu 100 ml for lakeshore wtp greater than 80 of this is predicted to come from three smaller tributaries belle river ruscom river and duck creek for stoney point wtp greater than 70 of the contribution to e coli concentrations is also predicted to come from three but different smaller tributaries stoney point ruscom river little creek for tributaries that do not significantly affect the hydrodynamics in a lake the framework presented in the current study can be used to identify approximate areal zones of influence using contour plots of expected e coli log reductions depending on the location of interest such zones can then be used to identify whether the location is likely to be significantly impacted by the tributary to decide whether it s inclusion may deserve further consideration the hydrodynamics in the nearshore region is expected to be more complex than the larger lake water quality in these regions can be further influenced by the confluence of tributaries local surface runoffs or the presence of structures or changes in shoreline characteristics water quality changes in nearshore regions affected by such features are unlikely to be accurately predicted using the uniform grid size of 400 m used in the current modelling framework credit authorship contribution statement mohammad madani conceptualization methodology
