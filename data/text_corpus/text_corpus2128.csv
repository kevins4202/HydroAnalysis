10640,in stone fruits the pit hardening period is usually one of slow fruit growth that is considered relatively insensitive to an imposed moderate water stress for this reason this period is commonly employed for a first phase of reduced water input in regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies however in previous studies with the japanese plum cv angeleno the identification of a period of slow growth just before harvest suggested the need to reconsider the most suitable rdi strategy for this cultivar in this 3 year study 2014 2015 and 2016 three irrigation strategies were compared control con designed to meet tree water requirements throughout the season regulated deficit irrigation rdi with two separate periods of water deficit one preharvest with no irrigation inputs during an intermediate period of fruit growth pit hardening period and the other postharvest with a 30 reduction of the con inputs and preharvest regulated deficit irrigation rdp with a single period of deficit irrigation initiated before harvesting and extended until the end of the irrigation campaign both deficit irrigation treatments were found to be effective at controlling tree vigor with lower trunk cross sectional area growth and pruned wood weight than in the con treatment average water savings with the rdi and rdp strategies over the three years of the study were 24 and 18 respectively compared to con with no impact on yield and no carry over effect fruit size in the rdp treatment was similar to the con the differences in fruit firmness soluble solids concentration ssc acidity lightness l hue ho and chroma c of the skin were only slight or inconsistent over the three years our results confirm the suitability of moderate pre and postharvest water stress rdp strategy in this cultivar with greater water productivity than the traditional rdi strategy keywords water stress prunus salicina fruit development stem water potential soil water content 1 introduction in deciduous fruit trees the postharvest period until leaf fall despite a decline in water requirements continues to be a period in which physiological processes take place that will affect the following year s production glew et al 2003 holzapfel et al 2006 given the prospect of warmer years and a higher frequency intensity of periods of drought due to climate change the autumnal season will acquire greater importance in terms of tree water demand until leaf fall in both early and late maturing fruit trees the postharvest period has been identified as one that is less sensitive to water stress in stone fruit trees moderate induced stress can help to avoid undesired budding and favor the initiation of tree dormancy without negatively affecting the following year s yield crisosto et al 1994 johnson and handley 2000 larson and dejong 1988 even with long term application johnson et al 1992 however severe water stress in this period can result in yield losses due to a reduction in the number of flowers or an increase in fruit setting problems as has been observed in apricot brown 1953 ruíz sánchez et al 1999 torrecillas et al 2000 uriu et al 1964 peach girona et al 2003 naor 2005 and japanese plum crisosto et al 1994 deficit irrigation di techniques have been studied in depth in a wide range of crops with the objective of attaining pre established yield targets with a lower consumption of water fereres and soriano 2007 maatallah et al 2015 ripoll et al 2014 ruíz sánchez et al 2010 other additional benefits of di include the control of vigor in intensive or superintensive plantations and or the enhancement of fruit quality behboudian and mills 1997 crisosto et al 1994 mpelasoka et al 2000 which in turn imply greater economic profitability when designing di strategies it is extremely important to know the sensitivity of the crop to water stress in its different phenological stages using this information it is possible to differentiate between periods with greater and lesser sensitivity and to establish the acceptable levels of water stress in each case various proposals have been made as a result of such analyses including regulated deficit irrigation rdi chalmers 1981 mitchell and chalmers 1982 sustained deficit irrigation sdi jiménez 2001 sadras and connor 1991 and partial rootzone drying prd dodd 2005 dos santos et al 2003d girona et al 2006 mccarthy et al 2005 passioura and gardner 1990 according to the three stage fruit development model for stone fruit trees addoms et al 1930 a slowdown in growth takes place in the intermediate stage which coincides with pit hardening while moderate water stress in this period may not affect final fruit size it can affect vegetative growth gelly et al 2003 naor et al 2005 however it is not always easy to identify this stage samperio et al 2015a and there is some degree of year to year variability girona et al 2003 naor 2005 which can result in reduced fruit size in situations of excessive stress in time or intensity as has been observed in peach girona et al 2001 naor 2005 and nectarine naor et al 2005 this stage is practically non existent in early maturing cultivars and so di strategies tend to focus on the postharvest stage samperio et al 2015b since the publication of the first studies on rdi in fruit trees various authors have tried to define the most appropriate moment to induce water stress and the effect of the intensity of the stress on different species and cultivars with special attention paid to the impact on yield and its components number and size of fruits behboudian and mills 1997 fereres and soriano 2007 intrigliolo and castel 2010 naor 2005 ruíz et al 2016 samperio et al 2015a ruíz sánchez et al 2010 however far fewer studies have considered the effect on fruit characteristics dichio et al 2007 gelly et al 2003 intrigliolo and castel 2010 laribi et al 2013 lópez et al 2011 marsal et al 2010 pérez pastor et al 2007 even though in other crops like the grapevine the impact on quality has always been a key aspect in the analysis of any irrigation strategy the japanese plum cv angeleno is a late maturing cultivar with a very long period between flowering and harvest which exceeds six months in depth studies of fruit development in this cultivar have shown the difficulty of precisely establishing the start and end of a defined intermediate period of lower sensitivity to water stress with the fruit present on the tree samperio et al 2015a it has also been found that the rate at which the water stress is established and its intensity have a major impact on final fruit size blanco cipollone et al 2019 a slowdown has also been observed in the fruit growth rate as harvest time approaches with even a complete halt in growth observed in some years blanco cipollone et al 2019 in light of this information new water stress strategies which are better adapted to this cultivar may be feasible an evaluation of fruit production is closely associated to the external appearance of the fruit especially its size while other parameters such as the soluble solids content ssc or fruit firmness can be used to determine the harvest date the importance of fruit size has been used in some cases to justify the employment of costly practices such as thinning however the end consumer is today more demanding with respect to the quality of the fruit which entails a need to control the postharvest behavior of the tree and even modification of farming practices stone fruits develop their organoleptic characteristics in the final fruit growth stage as has been described in peach berman and dejong 1996 chalmers and wilson 1978 nectarine naor et al 2001 and japanese plum díaz mula et al 2008 previous studies in mid maturing japanese plum have shown that water stress in a period close to harvest reduces fruit size and vegetative vigor intrigliolo and castel 2005 2004 naor et al 2004 but has no impact on fruit quality intrigliolo et al 2013 although excessive irrigation can reduce ssc naor et al 2004 in general japanese plum fruits are highly perishable abdi et al 1997 and it is essential to know the agronomic behavior of the fruit during the preharvest period in order to ensure an optimal fruit quality mitchell and crisosto 1995 taylor et al 1993 however some cultivars including angeleno can be kept in storage for lengthy periods the aim of this study is to evaluate a new rdi strategy for the late maturing japanese plum cv angeleno in this strategy the deficit irrigation period is adapted in accordance with the specific growth pattern of this variety this new approach in which deficit irrigation with moderate water stress in initiated preharvest and continued until leaf fall is compared with the rdi treatment proposed for other stone fruit trees and cultivars of the same species and with a control treatment in which irrigation meets the full water needs of the crop the evaluation that is undertaken considers both ecophysiological aspects of the crop and the characteristics of the fruits at harvest 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions the study was carried out in 2014 2015 and 2016 at an experimental plot located in the cicytex la orden research center in badajoz spain the orchard was planted in 2005 with late maturing japanese plum trees cv angeleno grafted on marianna 2624 rootstock trained to an open vase system with 4 5 branches per tree and 6 4 m spacing in an east west orientation an appropriate number of cv fortune and larry ann trees were distributed throughout the plot as pollinators along with beehives at flowering to ensure proper pollination all crop practices were conducted following commercial criteria fruit thinning was only performed in 2016 a drip irrigation system was employed with one emitter line per tree row pressure compensating emitters with a 4 l h 1 discharge rate were used separated by 1 m along the emitter line daily meteorological information temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration was obtained from an automated weather station close to the experimental plot the number of cold hours was calculated as the number of hours below 7 c during the months of november december january and february the climate is mediterranean with atlantic influence characterized by hot dry summers and warm winters average precipitation and reference evapotranspiration eto for the years 2010 2016 were 487 and 1278 mm respectively according to the soil taxonomy classification soil survey staff 1998

loam with 40 4 sand 19 4 clay and 40 2 silt content soil water content at field capacity 33 kpa and permanent wilting point 1500 kpa were 0 261 cm3 cm 3 and 0 123 cm3 cm 3 respectively a complementary description of the physical properties of the soil and its water holding capacity can be found in samperio et al 2014 the irrigation water had an average electrical conductivity of 0 62 ds m 1 and average no3 and nh4 concentrations of 10 12 mg l 1 and 0 16 mg l 1 respectively 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design in the year prior to the trial all the trees were irrigated to meet evapotranspiration demand throughout the postharvest period of 2013 in order to eliminate any potential differences resulting from previous di treatments on the same trees fully irrigated trees

the rootzone area once a week throughout the irrigation period the neutron probe readings were calibrated prior to the trial in situ to obtain the volumetric water content and the locations of the access tubes which best represented soil water movement were selected samperio et al 2014 briefly soil water content samples were collected at 0 30 m depth intervals from 0 30 m to 2 70 m and oven dried at 105 c for 48 h the soil water content was then calculated as the difference between fresh and dry mass of the sample divided by its dry mass the neutron probe readings were calibrated

reading one tree was selected in two experimental plots of each treatment and four access tubes were installed for each tree in the following manner two tubes were placed at a distance of 1 5 m from the tree forming a line parallel to the emitter lines and two other tubes were situated 2 m from the tree following the emitter line and 0 5 m on either side of it each of the tubes was 2 1 m long and the measurements were made at 0 3 m intervals from 0 3 m to 1 8 m crop coefficient kc was determined for the period between two consecutive neutron probe measurements as 4 k c e t c w b i 0 i t et o i

maintained throughout the three years of the trial and the total amount of water applied was controlled by volumetric water meters irrigation was programmed each day on the basis of the previous day s eto and the calculated kc of the previous water balance period a random block design was employed with four replicates each block was comprised of four consecutive rows with four trees the elementary plot had a total of 16 trees with the four middle trees of the two central rows used for measurements and the remaining trees acting as guard trees 2 3 tree water status measurements the ψs was measured weekly at solar noon using a pressure chamber model 3005 soil moisture santa bárbara ca ee uu following the procedures described by turner turner 1981 the ψs was measured for a minimum of two north oriented matured leaves per tree situated near the base of the trunk and covered with aluminum foil at least two hours before the measurements determinations were carried out on 8 trees per

respectively but was always sufficient to cover the chill requirements of cv angeleno the evolution of daily minimum and maximum temperatures during this winter period varied considerably between years fig 2 a b prior to the trial the daily minimum temperature in november and december of 2013 was below 0 c on various occasions sometimes for more than 10 consecutive days and reaching a minimum of 4 8 c in january and february of 2014 the daily minimum temperatures remained above 0 c in the second winter period nov dec of 2014 the daily minimum temperature only dropped below 0 c very occasionally reaching approximately 1 0 c contrastingly the following two months jan feb of 2015 saw numerous episodes of temperatures below 0 c falling as low as 4 9 c the final year of the trial was the warmest with the daily minimum temperature for november and december of 2016 remaining above 0 c for almost the entire period as for the daily maximum temperatures fig 2b the november february period of 2015 2016 had the highest values and that of 2014 15 the lowest with respect to the other months of the year march october if considering only the period from march to the end of july the warmest year was 2015 and if considering august september and october the highest values were recorded in 2016 fig 2c the irrigation campaign was initiated on march 12 april 14 and may 3 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively with an average duration of 189 days cumulative precipitation from the end of the previous campaign s irrigation period to the start of p1 ranged from 401 mm in 2016 to 247 mm in 2015 table 2 the driest year of the trial was 2015 with cumulative precipitation from the end of the irrigation period of 2014 to the end of that of 2015 around 36 lower than in the other years coinciding additionally with a higher cumulative eto table 2 the amount of applied water in the con treatment of 2015 was 806 mm which was notably higher than the average amount applied in the area 650 700 mm the water savings obtained with the deficit irrigation treatments compared to the con treatment were 18 in rdi and 23 in rdp with the highest savings made in 2015 26 in rdi and 30 in rdp there were important differences between years in terms of the climate characteristics of the deficit irrigation periods p1 p2 and p3 fig 3 and although the duration of the rdp deficit period was 59 days on average compared to the 70 days of rdi the amount of irrigation water applied in rdp p2 p3 was lower than that applied in rdi p1 p3 3 2 soil water content in all three years of the trial θ was similar at the start of the irrigation campaign for the two deficit irrigation treatments but lower than in the con treatment fig 4 in 2015 fig 4b and 2016 fig 4c in 2014 which had the highest initial θ of the three years of the trial no differences between treatments were established until the end of p1 during p2 θ increased in rdi decreased in rdp and retained a more or less intermediate position in con in the following two years the two deficit treatments began their irrigation campaigns with a lower θ than con responding to the water stress periods with a decrease in θ reserves in p1 and p3 in rdi and in p2 and p3 in rdp in 2016 θ increased in all three treatments before p1 possibly as the result of the effect of intense rainfall fig 5 shows the θ profiles at the start and end of each of the periods p1 p2 and p3 for the two deficit treatments and three years of the trial root activity can be observed in all treatments down to the 180 cm measured depth in p1 the rdi treatment extracted water from the profile in each of the 3 years but much more so in 2016 which started with a higher soil water content the driest year 2015 had the lowest rdi extraction in this period figs 5a b c θ increased in rdi in p2 figs 5d e f and decreased in both rdi and rdp in p3 figs 5g h i the soil profile water extraction pattern was very different in the two deficit treatments 3 3 water status at the start of the irrigation campaign the ψs of the trees was around 0 55 mpa except in 2015 when it began with slightly lower values fig 6 in the three years of the trial the mean ψs of the con treatment was 0 90 mpa with values lower than 1 00 mpa for most of the crop cycle the rdi trees responded to the p1 suspension of irrigation with a decrease in ψs to a minimum value of 2 33 mpa in 2015 after irrigation was started again in the rdi treatment water status recovered rapidly in all years to the con and rdp values until the start of p2 during p2 the mean ψs in the rdp treatment was 1 22 mpa with a minimum value of 1 43 mpa attained in 2014 at harvest there was no difference between con and rdi but the mean ψs value in the rdp treatment was lower 0 32 mpa after the fruit had been picked the ψs response of the rdp and rdi trees during p3 differed in rdi the values remained the same or similar to those of the con treatment until approximately 20 days after reducing the water input in 2015 and 2016 and until the end of p3 in 2014 in rdp the ψs remained lower in 2014 and 2015 than in the other treatments until the latter part of p3 when as also occurred with con and rdi an improvement was observed in the water status the highest water stress integral values in the two deficit irrigation treatments were recorded in 2015 for both the period from the start of irrigation to harvest and the complete irrigation period table 3 in general the differences between con and rdi were greater than between con and rdp with the latter differences being only slight especially in the first and last years of the trial according to the annual water stress integral value the highest level of water stress was supported by rdi in all years 3 4 fruit growth as can be seen in table 4 fruit growth rates were highest from fruit set to the start of p1 when they began to slow down they continued falling in the following two stages between the end of p1 and the start of p2 and p2 the fastest fruit growth rate was in 2015 when the largest fruit sizes were obtained and the lowest in 2014 a comparison of the three treatments shows that the fruits all grew at the same rate after fruit set table 4 in p1 the con and rdp treatments had similar growth rates higher than the rdi treatment in the stage between the end of p1 and the start of p2 the rdi treatment recovered and had similar growth rates as the other treatments in p2 there were statistically significant differences between the two deficit irrigation treatments and con in the first two years of the trial 3 5 vegetative growth the most vigorous trees were found in the con treatment at the start of the trial the con trees had the highest tcsa data not shown and maintained a higher growth rate than the trees of the two deficit treatments the total tcsa increase over the three years of the trial was 207 cm2 in contrast to the 149 cm2 and 147 cm2 of the rdi and rdp treatments respectively table 5 the lowest increase in tcsa in all treatments was in 2014 while the highest was in 2015 despite this being the driest year and the trees having to endure the highest water stress levels fig 7 shows the evolution of relative tcsa growth over the three years of the trial while no differences between the con and rdi treatments can be seen in the first year there is a clear separation between the treatments in the following years with rdi vigor midway between that of the con and rdp treatments in fig 7 and in table 5 it can be seen how the water deficit provoked a greater reduction in vigor in rdp despite suffering the stress period a priori in a period of lower vegetative growth the relative trunk growth in rdp was lower than in the other treatments in the period from harvest to leaf fall in all years fig 7 although the highest tcsa growth took place in 2015 a higher amount of pruned wood was removed in 2016 in no case did the irrigation treatment affect the amount of pruned wood in the summer pruning although it did do so in the winter pruning and in terms of the total amount of pruned wood table 5 in the three years of the trial the con amount of summer pruned wood was significantly higher than in the other treatments with up to 7 kg more pruned wood removed per tree than in the rdi treatment compared to the con treatment the total amount of pruned wood summer winter pruning was 24 and 17 less in rdi and rdp respectively the daily fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation was slightly lower in the rdi treatment in the first two years of the trial while no clear differences were observed between con and rdp in any year fig 8 the biggest differences between treatments were in 2015 3 6 yield there were significant quantitative differences in plum production in the three years of the trial yield was highest in 2014 above 163 kg tree 1 on average very low in 2015 with 28 kg tree 1 and with an intermediate value in 2016 105 kg tree 1 table 6 despite these considerable differences in no case there were statistically significant differences between treatments in yield tree 1 as in 2014 the higher number of fruits tree 1 in the rdi treatment was compensated by a lower fruit size these differences in load in the first year of the trial cannot be attributed to the treatments but rather to the previous history of the trees as the treatments were initiated after the definitive establishment of the fruits in 2016 the number of fruits that set was higher in the deficit treatments with an estimated 2152 2689 and 2400 fruits tree 1 in con rdi and rdp respectively before thinning but was evened out by the thinning that was performed when expressing load in terms of the tcsa this tendency of increased load with water deficit was more evident in the rdi treatment the lower rdi fruit size compared to the other two treatments fig 9 could be attributable to the higher fruit load in 2014 and 2016 but not in 2015 as that year s load was so low that it could not be expected to have a detrimental effect on fruit size in general both deficit irrigation treatments displayed a tendency for a lower fruit size compared to con in 2015 and 2016 in all years fruit size distribution in con and rdp was similar and differed from rdi the most common fruit size in 2014 was below 53 mm in all three treatments and the rdi treatment had a lower number of fruits in the 56 59 mm range in 2015 con and rdp had the highest proportion of fruits in the 56 59 mm range while the most common fruit size in the rdi treatment continued to be below 53 mm in 2016 the majority of con and rdp fruits were in the three lowest fruit range sizes while the majority of rdi fruits again continued to be in the lowest range the wp values varied considerably between years with these differences dependent principally on yield table 6 given that there were no statistically significant differences in yield the highest wp was obtained in the deficit treatments statistically significant differences in 2014 and 2016 and without differences between the rdi and rdp treatments the rdi treatment provoked a slightly earlier ripening as can be seen in the preharvest sampling that was performed table 7 a tendency can be observed of higher ssc values though the differences between treatments became smaller as harvest approached and were only statistically significant in 2015 with the severest water stress the acidity and firmness values decreased at harvest with only the rdp fruits in 2015 having a higher firmness value than in the other treatments at harvest the ssc value varied from year to year in 2015 the range of values was 17 19 ºbrix with the rdi fruits having the highest value skin color was influenced by fruit ripening the ho values of fruit skin color were lower before harvest than at harvest with no significant differences between treatments in contrast the c values were lower at harvest with the rdp treatment having higher values than the other treatments in 2015 and 2016 color changes between treatments were better reflected by c than by ho as angeleno is a purple plum cultivar the l component lightness reaches low values and decreased at harvest 4 discussion 4 1 initial conditions in medium long cycle stone fruit trees the stone hardening phase and the postharvest period are proposed as the least sensitive periods to water deficit the success of an rdi strategy depends on correctly identifying when water stress begins and ends the level of stress supported by the trees and the subsequent recovery when the fruit is present previous studies with the japanese long cycle plum cultivar angeleno blanco cipollone et al 2019 gennai et al 2015 samperio et al 2015a have shown how difficult it is to precisely define this period around pit hardening and the risk that an incorrect identification entails in term of fruit size from this knowledge comes the proposal of an alternative deficit irrigation strategy which must be necessarily evaluated in field conditions before its adoption the aim of this work is to evaluate a di strategy adapted to the physiological characteristics and the productive cycle of the late maturing japanese plum cv angeleno comparing it with the di strategy generally proposed for mid season maturing stone fruit trees and also comparing both di strategies with an irrigation strategy which covers all the water needs of the crop this comparison is made from various perspectives the amount of irrigation water employed water use in the soil profile and vegetative and fruit and vegetative growth in field studies the meteorological conditions along with the year to year variation in woody crops tend to play an important role in the responses that are obtained in this respect the three years of the trial were markedly different strengthening the validity of the results because of both the meteorological conditions and the load level of the trees 4 2 influence of the treatments on applied water and crop water status when comparing the two deficit irrigation strategies the displacement of the period in which the water stress is induced in the rdp vs the rdi treatment not only modifies the phenological state of the moment but additionally acts under different meteorological conditions the clearest observed effect was due to the rdp deficit period p2 being at a moment of higher evaporative demand than the p1 period of the rdi treatment in consequence the rdp treatment had a higher reduction in the amount of applied water than the rdi treatment when compared with con despite the p1 p3 periods deficit irrigation periods of the rdi treatment being twelve days longer on average than the p2 p3 periods deficit irrigation periods of the rdp treatment the effects of the displacement of the deficit irrigation period on tree physiology are more difficult to assess it was observed however that in 2 of the 3 years of the trial there was an increase in the level of stress supported by the rdi trees in the postharvest period possibly triggering mechanisms favoring tree dormancy lower tree activity would in turn explain the higher accumulation of water in the soil from the autumn rains higher water stress levels would also lead to a reduction in leaf photosynthesis rates and therefore in canopy productivity during a stage in which the accumulation of reserves takes place in 2015 the lack of precipitation in the period prior to p1 resulted in the lowest θ level at the start of p1 period the lowest ψs values of the three years of the trial were also observed during this period in the rdi treatment below the 1 8 mpa threshold proposed by other authors intrigliolo and castel 2010 the lowest ψs values in con were also recorded in 2015 despite receiving twice the amount of water compared to the other years during the p1 period in fact these values were lower than the no stress reference values for this cultivar samperio et al 2015a in the rainiest years 2014 and 2016 the ψs value in rdi reached 1 4 mpa which is moderate according to the reference values for peach girona et al 2004 and plum intrigliolo and castel 2004 these results reveal the importance that water reserves accumulated in the soil before budding have on the subsequent development of the irrigation campaign 4 3 influence of the treatments on soil water uptake the soil water uptake pattern varied depending on the irrigation strategy employed with the full suspension of irrigation in rdi the tree extracted a larger amount of water stored throughout the soil profile in contrast when irrigation water was reduced in the rdp strategy a higher accumulation of water was observed in the soil profile close to leaf fall given that the irrigation inputs in this stage were lower and the crop requirements were not being covered worse water status the cause must lie in the inability of the tree to take advantage of the autumn rains as the canopy was in a more advanced stage of senescence confirmation of this hypothesis would require verification of leaf gas exchange levels and the percentage of senescent leaves θ was similar in the two deficit irrigation treatments at the end of the p1 period in 2014 and 2016 but significant differences were maintained between them in the ψs values similar situations and discrepancies between water availability and water status were detected in different moments of the crop cycle over the three years of the trial as although some relationship has been observed between ψs and θ values in grapevine williams and araujo 2002 or european plum mccutchan and shackel 1992 in this study the recovery of both did not always take place at the same rate the relationship between soil water content and plant water status is not a direct one but aspects such as the capacity of the plant to transport water to the leaves the evaporative demand the leaf gas exchange rate and the radiation intercepted by the plant canopy are all influential in 2015 annual precipitation was lower than the average for the area and in addition the crop cycle began with a low soil water profile content causing a marked decrease in ψs in the rdi treatment such a situation usually has an irreversible effect on fruit growth even in a year with a very low load level blanco cipollone et al 2019 in the other two years when load was higher and the soil profile had an initial higher water content a tendency for reduced fruit size was also observed but in this case coinciding with higher tree load in this treatment the interaction between water status and load level has previously been observed in this cultivar in relation to the effect on final fruit size samperio et al 2015a the water stress supported by the rdp trees in an advanced stage of fruit growth had lower repercussions on fruit size as although it affected the growth rate this was lower than in the previous growth stages it should also be noted that the p2 growth rates were the same in rdi and rdp and lower than in con 4 4 influence of the treatments on vegetative and productive response the results obtained in terms of the number of fruits that set in each treatment provide information about how the moment in which the tree suffers water stress affects the processes which determine the potential number of fruits in the following year the rdi treatment which endured a moderate to severe water stress in a stage around pit hardening saw a considerable increase in the number of fruits that set compared to the con treatment whereas when the stress was induced close to harvest rdp the effect was not so evident prolonged rdi strategies over several years can have a negative medium long term effect on peach tree productivity due to the reduction in canopy size marsal et al 2016 in our study the rdp strategy decreased tree vigor measured as the increase in tcsa compared to the con treatment however the impact of water stress on canopy intercepted radiation was lower than in the rdi treatment this was because the effect of water stress on the rdi trees was in a period of more active vegetative growth and hence they would be expected to be less prone to premature decline it should also be noted that the increase in crop load was less pronounced in the rdp than in the rdi treatment which means a lower consumption of assimilates in the initial stages until the establishment of the definitive load the rdp irrigation strategy focused on the periods immediately before harvest and postharvest with the latter taking on greater importance due to the effects of climate change establishing the water status of the tree ψs as an irrigation reference in a period of variable weather conditions should mean a more rational use of water resources it is important to avoid inducing severe stress in view of the accumulation of reserves and carry over effects the acidity and firmness values decreased in the days prior to harvest as was also reported for mid maturing japanese plum crisosto et al 2004 this preharvest phase when prunus salicina fruit acquire commercial maturity is of great importance el sharkawy et al 2007 trainotti et al 2003 however a reduction in ψs values in this phase in the rdp treatment only affected firmness in 2015 though this might have been more related to the low load level than the water stress cheng and crisosto 1997 crisosto et al 1994 intrigliolo and castel 2010 mpelasoka and behboudian 2002 naor et al 2004 in all cases firmness values were above 3 4 kg cm 2 the bruising threshold for impact related damage crisosto et al 2001 the rdi and con treatments had similar acidity and firmness values as has also been observed in apple mpelasoka and behboudian 2002 peach crisosto et al 1994 and japanese plum naor et al 2004 though this was not the case in other studies in which acidity decreased in water stress situations behboudian and mills 1997 gelly et al 2004 the ssc values at harvest were in the range considered good crisosto et al 2007 and with no significant differences between treatments except in 2015 the accumulation of sugars in the fruit growth and maturation stage is due principally to the assimilation of carbon produced by leaf photosynthesis in an intermediate stage of fruit development díaz mula 2008 a lower number of fruits per cm2 allowed a higher supply of assimilates to the fruits resulting in higher ssc values in 2015 crisosto et al 1994 intrigliolo and castel 2010 wünsche and ferguson 2005 when there were statistically significant differences between treatments 4 5 general remarks given the results obtained and based on the hypothesis that severe water stress in a period of high evaporative demand could put the harvest at risk the application of the rdp strategy seems in principle to offer advantages over the rdi strategy through the maintenance of a moderate tree water stress in the rdi strategy the total suspension of irrigation subjected the tree to a stress level that varied between years although the rdi strategy is easier to apply at commercial level it generates greater uncertainty in terms of the results with significant dependency on the amount of rainfall the level of soil reserves and tree load in addition a risk of a decrease in final fruit size must be accepted the application of a deficit irrigation period in a final stage of fruit growth p2 allows management decisions to be made with a greater awareness of the particular situation of each year that is the intensity of the stress that is induced can be varied in accordance with the water reserves available in the soil profile the meteorological conditions and forecasts and the load level the establishment of water status reference levels to manage deficit irrigation strategies is recommended to avoid stress levels so severe that they can have a negative impact even in less sensitive phenological stages however as happens in a species as alternate bearing as olive martín vertedor et al 2011 tree load level affects the water potential levels in 2015 a year with a heavily reduced load level the con treatment maintained ψs values above 1 0 mpa whereas in the other two years the values fell below this limit despite continuing with the same irrigation criteria and despite being wetter years at a practical level some flexibility is required with respect to the reference levels in terms of adapting to that year s conditions in the orchard with respect to another of the potential benefits of deficit irrigation the control of tree vigor the results of this study suggest that it may be recommendable in years of low load to allow more severe stress levels in order to restrict tree growth in this respect the rdi was more effective than the rdp strategy as it acts at a time of higher vegetation growth rates 5 conclusions in this study a new regulated deficit irrigation strategy is proposed for the late maturing japanese plum cv angeleno in this new strategy deficit irrigation with moderate water stress is initiated preharvest when the fruit growth rate slows down and sensitivity to water stress is low and is continued postharvest this strategy was compared in a 3 year long trial with a control treatment without induced water stress and a previously established deficit irrigation treatment for mid and late maturing stone fruit trees the two deficit irrigation treatments were equally effective in terms of controlling tree vigor but the results obtained show that this new strategy offers significant advantages obtaining the same productivity as the control and traditional deficit irrigation strategies but using considerably less water resources and maintaining only a moderate water stress during the postharvest period the proposed strategy resulted in an average water saving of 23 compared to the control without any observed carry over effects as a result water productivity was higher in the new strategy with no negative impact on fruit characteristics it should also be noted that the initiation of a preharvest irrigation water supply reduction at an advanced stage of the irrigation campaign allows better adaptation to the particular meteorological characteristics and tree load level of the year in question declaration of competing interest none

10640,in stone fruits the pit hardening period is usually one of slow fruit growth that is considered relatively insensitive to an imposed moderate water stress for this reason this period is commonly employed for a first phase of reduced water input in regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies however in previous studies with the japanese plum cv angeleno the identification of a period of slow growth just before harvest suggested the need to reconsider the most suitable rdi strategy for this cultivar in this 3 year study 2014 2015 and 2016 three irrigation strategies were compared control con designed to meet tree water requirements throughout the season regulated deficit irrigation rdi with two separate periods of water deficit one preharvest with no irrigation inputs during an intermediate period of fruit growth pit hardening period and the other postharvest with a 30 reduction of the con inputs and preharvest regulated deficit irrigation rdp with a single period of deficit irrigation initiated before harvesting and extended until the end of the irrigation campaign both deficit irrigation treatments were found to be effective at controlling tree vigor with lower trunk cross sectional area growth and pruned wood weight than in the con treatment average water savings with the rdi and rdp strategies over the three years of the study were 24 and 18 respectively compared to con with no impact on yield and no carry over effect fruit size in the rdp treatment was similar to the con the differences in fruit firmness soluble solids concentration ssc acidity lightness l hue ho and chroma c of the skin were only slight or inconsistent over the three years our results confirm the suitability of moderate pre and postharvest water stress rdp strategy in this cultivar with greater water productivity than the traditional rdi strategy keywords water stress prunus salicina fruit development stem water potential soil water content 1 introduction in deciduous fruit trees the postharvest period until leaf fall despite a decline in water requirements continues to be a period in which physiological processes take place that will affect the following year s production glew et al 2003 holzapfel et al 2006 given the prospect of warmer years and a higher frequency intensity of periods of drought due to climate change the autumnal season will acquire greater importance in terms of tree water demand until leaf fall in both early and late maturing fruit trees the postharvest period has been identified as one that is less sensitive to water stress in stone fruit trees moderate induced stress can help to avoid undesired budding and favor the initiation of tree dormancy without negatively affecting the following year s yield crisosto et al 1994 johnson and handley 2000 larson and dejong 1988 even with long term application johnson et al 1992 however severe water stress in this period can result in yield losses due to a reduction in the number of flowers or an increase in fruit setting problems as has been observed in apricot brown 1953 ruíz sánchez et al 1999 torrecillas et al 2000 uriu et al 1964 peach girona et al 2003 naor 2005 and japanese plum crisosto et al 1994 deficit irrigation di techniques have been studied in depth in a wide range of crops with the objective of attaining pre established yield targets with a lower consumption of water fereres and soriano 2007 maatallah et al 2015 ripoll et al 2014 ruíz sánchez et al 2010 other additional benefits of di include the control of vigor in intensive or superintensive plantations and or the enhancement of fruit quality behboudian and mills 1997 crisosto et al 1994 mpelasoka et al 2000 which in turn imply greater economic profitability when designing di strategies it is extremely important to know the sensitivity of the crop to water stress in its different phenological stages using this information it is possible to differentiate between periods with greater and lesser sensitivity and to establish the acceptable levels of water stress in each case various proposals have been made as a result of such analyses including regulated deficit irrigation rdi chalmers 1981 mitchell and chalmers 1982 sustained deficit irrigation sdi jiménez 2001 sadras and connor 1991 and partial rootzone drying prd dodd 2005 dos santos et al 2003d girona et al 2006 mccarthy et al 2005 passioura and gardner 1990 according to the three stage fruit development model for stone fruit trees addoms et al 1930 a slowdown in growth takes place in the intermediate stage which coincides with pit hardening while moderate water stress in this period may not affect final fruit size it can affect vegetative growth gelly et al 2003 naor et al 2005 however it is not always easy to identify this stage samperio et al 2015a and there is some degree of year to year variability girona et al 2003 naor 2005 which can result in reduced fruit size in situations of excessive stress in time or intensity as has been observed in peach girona et al 2001 naor 2005 and nectarine naor et al 2005 this stage is practically non existent in early maturing cultivars and so di strategies tend to focus on the postharvest stage samperio et al 2015b since the publication of the first studies on rdi in fruit trees various authors have tried to define the most appropriate moment to induce water stress and the effect of the intensity of the stress on different species and cultivars with special attention paid to the impact on yield and its components number and size of fruits behboudian and mills 1997 fereres and soriano 2007 intrigliolo and castel 2010 naor 2005 ruíz et al 2016 samperio et al 2015a ruíz sánchez et al 2010 however far fewer studies have considered the effect on fruit characteristics dichio et al 2007 gelly et al 2003 intrigliolo and castel 2010 laribi et al 2013 lópez et al 2011 marsal et al 2010 pérez pastor et al 2007 even though in other crops like the grapevine the impact on quality has always been a key aspect in the analysis of any irrigation strategy the japanese plum cv angeleno is a late maturing cultivar with a very long period between flowering and harvest which exceeds six months in depth studies of fruit development in this cultivar have shown the difficulty of precisely establishing the start and end of a defined intermediate period of lower sensitivity to water stress with the fruit present on the tree samperio et al 2015a it has also been found that the rate at which the water stress is established and its intensity have a major impact on final fruit size blanco cipollone et al 2019 a slowdown has also been observed in the fruit growth rate as harvest time approaches with even a complete halt in growth observed in some years blanco cipollone et al 2019 in light of this information new water stress strategies which are better adapted to this cultivar may be feasible an evaluation of fruit production is closely associated to the external appearance of the fruit especially its size while other parameters such as the soluble solids content ssc or fruit firmness can be used to determine the harvest date the importance of fruit size has been used in some cases to justify the employment of costly practices such as thinning however the end consumer is today more demanding with respect to the quality of the fruit which entails a need to control the postharvest behavior of the tree and even modification of farming practices stone fruits develop their organoleptic characteristics in the final fruit growth stage as has been described in peach berman and dejong 1996 chalmers and wilson 1978 nectarine naor et al 2001 and japanese plum díaz mula et al 2008 previous studies in mid maturing japanese plum have shown that water stress in a period close to harvest reduces fruit size and vegetative vigor intrigliolo and castel 2005 2004 naor et al 2004 but has no impact on fruit quality intrigliolo et al 2013 although excessive irrigation can reduce ssc naor et al 2004 in general japanese plum fruits are highly perishable abdi et al 1997 and it is essential to know the agronomic behavior of the fruit during the preharvest period in order to ensure an optimal fruit quality mitchell and crisosto 1995 taylor et al 1993 however some cultivars including angeleno can be kept in storage for lengthy periods the aim of this study is to evaluate a new rdi strategy for the late maturing japanese plum cv angeleno in this strategy the deficit irrigation period is adapted in accordance with the specific growth pattern of this variety this new approach in which deficit irrigation with moderate water stress in initiated preharvest and continued until leaf fall is compared with the rdi treatment proposed for other stone fruit trees and cultivars of the same species and with a control treatment in which irrigation meets the full water needs of the crop the evaluation that is undertaken considers both ecophysiological aspects of the crop and the characteristics of the fruits at harvest 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions the study was carried out in 2014 2015 and 2016 at an experimental plot located in the cicytex la orden research center in badajoz spain the orchard was planted in 2005 with late maturing japanese plum trees cv angeleno grafted on marianna 2624 rootstock trained to an open vase system with 4 5 branches per tree and 6 4 m spacing in an east west orientation an appropriate number of cv fortune and larry ann trees were distributed throughout the plot as pollinators along with beehives at flowering to ensure proper pollination all crop practices were conducted following commercial criteria fruit thinning was only performed in 2016 a drip irrigation system was employed with one emitter line per tree row pressure compensating emitters with a 4 l h 1 discharge rate were used separated by 1 m along the emitter line daily meteorological information temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration was obtained from an automated weather station close to the experimental plot the number of cold hours

description of the physical properties of the soil and its water holding capacity can be found in samperio et al 2014 the irrigation water had an average electrical conductivity of 0 62 ds m 1 and average no3 and nh4 concentrations of 10 12 mg l 1 and 0 16 mg l 1 respectively 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design in the year prior to the trial all the trees were irrigated to meet evapotranspiration demand throughout the postharvest period of 2013 in order to eliminate any potential differences resulting from previous di treatments on the same trees fully irrigated trees

the rootzone area once a week throughout the irrigation period the neutron probe readings were calibrated prior to the trial in situ to obtain the volumetric water content and the locations of the access tubes which best represented soil water movement were selected samperio et al 2014 briefly soil water content samples were collected at 0 30 m depth intervals from 0 30 m to 2 70 m and oven dried at 105 c for 48 h the soil water content was then calculated as the difference between fresh and dry mass of the sample divided by its dry mass the neutron probe readings were calibrated

in con in the following two years the two deficit treatments began their irrigation campaigns with a lower θ than con responding to the water stress periods with a decrease in θ reserves in p1 and p3 in rdi and in p2 and p3 in rdp in 2016 θ increased in all three treatments before p1 possibly as the result of the effect of intense rainfall fig 5 shows the θ profiles at the start and end of each of the periods p1 p2 and p3 for the two deficit treatments and three years of the trial root activity can be observed in all treatments down to the 180 cm measured depth in p1 the rdi treatment extracted water from the profile in each of the 3 years but much more so in 2016 which started with a higher soil water content the driest year 2015 had the lowest rdi extraction in this period figs 5a b c θ increased in rdi in p2 figs 5d e f and decreased in both rdi and rdp in p3 figs 5g h i the soil profile water extraction pattern was very different in the two deficit treatments 3 3 water status at the start of the irrigation campaign the ψs of the trees was around 0 55 mpa except in 2015 when it began with slightly lower values fig 6 in the three years of the trial the mean ψs of the con treatment was 0 90 mpa with values lower than 1 00 mpa for most of the crop cycle the rdi trees responded to the p1 suspension of irrigation with a decrease in ψs to a minimum value of 2 33 mpa in 2015 after irrigation was started again in the rdi treatment water status recovered rapidly in all years to the con and rdp values until the start of p2 during p2 the mean ψs in the rdp treatment was 1 22 mpa with a minimum value of 1 43 mpa attained in 2014 at harvest there was no difference between con and rdi but the mean ψs value in the rdp treatment was lower 0 32 mpa after the fruit had been picked the ψs response of the rdp and rdi trees during p3 differed in rdi the values remained the same or similar to those of the con treatment until approximately 20 days after reducing the water input in 2015 and 2016 and until the end of p3 in 2014 in rdp the ψs remained lower in 2014 and 2015 than in the other treatments until the latter part of p3 when as also occurred with con and rdi an improvement was observed in the water status the highest water stress integral values in the two deficit irrigation treatments were recorded in 2015 for both the period from the start of irrigation to harvest and the complete irrigation period table 3 in general the differences between con and rdi were greater than between con and rdp with the latter differences being only slight especially in the first and last years of the trial according to the annual water stress integral value the highest level of water stress was supported by rdi in all years 3 4 fruit growth as can be seen in table 4 fruit growth rates were highest from fruit set to the start of p1 when they began to slow down they continued falling in the following two stages between the end of p1 and the start of p2 and p2 the fastest fruit growth rate was in 2015 when the largest fruit sizes were obtained and the lowest in 2014 a comparison of the three treatments shows that the fruits all grew at the same rate after fruit set table 4 in p1 the con and rdp treatments had similar growth rates higher than the rdi treatment in the stage between the end of p1 and the start of p2 the rdi treatment recovered and had similar growth rates as the other treatments in p2 there were statistically significant differences between the two deficit irrigation treatments and con in the first two years of the trial 3 5 vegetative growth the most vigorous trees were found in the con treatment at the start of the trial the con trees had the highest tcsa data not shown and maintained a higher growth rate than the trees of the two deficit treatments the total tcsa increase over the three years of the trial was 207 cm2 in contrast to the 149 cm2 and 147 cm2 of the rdi and rdp treatments respectively table 5 the lowest increase in tcsa in all treatments was in 2014 while the highest was in 2015 despite this being the driest year and the trees having to endure the highest water stress levels fig 7 shows the evolution of relative tcsa growth over the three years of the trial while no differences between the con and rdi treatments can be seen in the first year there is a clear separation between the treatments in the following years with rdi vigor midway between that of the con and rdp treatments in fig 7 and in table 5 it can be seen how the water deficit provoked a greater reduction in vigor in rdp despite suffering the stress period a priori in a period of lower vegetative growth the relative trunk growth in rdp was lower than in the other treatments in the period from harvest to leaf fall in all years fig 7 although the highest tcsa growth took place in 2015 a higher amount of pruned wood was removed in 2016 in no case did the irrigation treatment affect the amount of pruned wood in the summer pruning although it did do so in the winter pruning and in terms of the total amount of pruned wood table 5 in the three years of the trial the con amount of summer pruned wood was significantly higher than in the other treatments with up to 7 kg more pruned wood removed per tree than in the rdi treatment compared to the con treatment the total amount of pruned wood summer winter pruning was 24 and 17 less in rdi and rdp respectively the daily fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation was slightly lower in the rdi treatment in the first two years of the trial while no clear differences were observed between con and rdp in any year fig 8 the biggest differences between treatments were in 2015 3 6 yield there were significant quantitative differences in plum production in the three years of the trial yield was highest in 2014 above 163 kg tree 1 on average very low in 2015 with 28 kg tree 1 and with an intermediate value in 2016 105 kg tree 1 table 6 despite these considerable differences in no case there were statistically significant differences between treatments in yield tree 1 as in 2014 the higher number of fruits tree 1 in the rdi treatment was compensated by a lower fruit size these differences in load in the first year of the trial cannot be attributed to the treatments but rather to the previous history of the trees as the treatments were initiated after the definitive establishment of the fruits in 2016 the number of fruits that set was higher in the deficit treatments with an estimated 2152 2689 and 2400 fruits tree 1 in con rdi and rdp respectively before thinning but was evened out by the thinning that was performed when expressing load in terms of the tcsa this tendency of increased load with water deficit was more evident in the rdi treatment the lower rdi fruit size compared to the other two treatments fig 9 could be attributable to the higher fruit load in 2014 and 2016 but not in 2015 as that year s load was so low that it could not be expected to have a detrimental effect on fruit size in general both deficit irrigation treatments displayed a tendency for a lower fruit size compared to con in 2015 and 2016 in all years fruit size distribution in con and rdp was similar and differed from rdi the most common fruit size in 2014 was below 53 mm in all three treatments and the rdi treatment had a lower number of fruits in the 56 59 mm range in 2015 con and rdp had the highest proportion of fruits in the 56 59 mm range while the most common fruit size in the rdi treatment continued to be below 53 mm in 2016 the majority of con and rdp fruits were in the three lowest fruit range sizes while the majority of rdi fruits again continued to be in the lowest range the wp values varied considerably between years with these differences dependent principally on yield table 6 given that there were no statistically significant differences in yield the highest wp was obtained in the deficit treatments statistically significant differences in 2014 and 2016 and without differences between the rdi and rdp treatments the rdi treatment provoked a slightly earlier ripening as can be seen in the preharvest sampling that was performed table 7 a tendency can be observed of higher ssc values though the differences between treatments became smaller as harvest approached and were only statistically significant in 2015 with the severest water stress the acidity and firmness values decreased at harvest with only the rdp fruits in 2015 having a higher firmness value than in the other treatments at harvest the ssc value varied from year to year in 2015 the range of values was 17 19 ºbrix with the rdi fruits having the highest value skin color was influenced by fruit ripening the ho values of fruit skin color were lower before harvest than at harvest with no significant differences between treatments in contrast the c values were lower at harvest with the rdp treatment having higher values than the other treatments in 2015 and 2016 color changes between treatments were better reflected by c than by ho as angeleno is a purple plum cultivar the l component lightness reaches low values and decreased at harvest 4 discussion 4 1 initial conditions in medium long cycle stone fruit trees the stone hardening phase and the postharvest period are proposed as the least sensitive periods to water deficit the success of an rdi strategy depends on correctly identifying when water stress begins and ends the level of stress supported by the trees and the subsequent recovery when the fruit is present previous studies with the japanese long cycle plum cultivar angeleno blanco cipollone et al 2019 gennai et al 2015 samperio et al 2015a have shown how difficult it is to precisely define this period around pit hardening and the risk that an incorrect identification entails in term of fruit size from this knowledge comes the proposal of an alternative deficit irrigation strategy which must be necessarily evaluated in field conditions before its adoption the aim of this work is to evaluate a di strategy adapted to the physiological characteristics and the productive cycle of the late maturing japanese plum cv angeleno comparing it with the di strategy generally proposed for mid season maturing stone fruit trees and also comparing both di strategies with an irrigation strategy which covers all the water needs of the crop this comparison is made from various perspectives the amount of irrigation water employed water use in the soil profile and vegetative and fruit and vegetative growth in field studies the meteorological conditions along with the year to year variation in woody crops tend to play an important role in the responses that are obtained in this respect the three years of the trial were markedly different strengthening the validity of the results because of both the meteorological conditions and the load level of the trees 4 2 influence of the treatments on applied water and crop water status when comparing the two deficit irrigation strategies the displacement of the period in which the water stress is induced in the rdp vs the rdi treatment not only modifies the phenological state of the moment but additionally acts under different meteorological conditions the clearest observed effect was due to the rdp deficit period p2 being at a moment of higher evaporative demand than the p1 period of the rdi treatment in consequence the rdp treatment had a higher reduction in the amount of applied water than the rdi treatment when compared with con despite the p1 p3 periods deficit irrigation periods of the rdi treatment being twelve days longer on average than the p2 p3 periods deficit irrigation periods of the rdp treatment the effects of the displacement of the deficit irrigation period on tree physiology are more difficult to assess it was observed however that in 2 of the 3 years of the trial there was an increase in the level of stress supported by the rdi trees in the postharvest period possibly triggering mechanisms favoring tree dormancy lower tree activity would in turn explain the higher accumulation of water in the soil from the autumn rains higher water stress levels would also lead to a reduction in leaf photosynthesis rates and therefore in canopy productivity during a stage in which the accumulation of reserves takes place in 2015 the lack of precipitation in the period prior to p1 resulted in the lowest θ level at the start of p1 period the lowest ψs values of the three years of the trial were also observed during this period in the rdi treatment below the 1 8 mpa threshold proposed by other authors intrigliolo and castel 2010 the lowest ψs values in con were also recorded in 2015 despite receiving twice the amount of water compared to the other years during the p1 period in fact these values were lower than the no stress reference values for this cultivar samperio et al 2015a in the rainiest years 2014 and 2016 the ψs value in rdi reached 1 4 mpa which is moderate according to the reference values for peach girona et al 2004 and plum intrigliolo and castel 2004 these results reveal the importance that water reserves accumulated in the soil before budding have on the subsequent development of the irrigation campaign 4 3 influence of the treatments on soil water uptake the soil water uptake pattern varied depending on the irrigation strategy employed with the full suspension of irrigation in rdi the tree extracted a larger amount of water stored throughout the soil profile in contrast when irrigation water was reduced in the rdp strategy a higher accumulation of water was observed in the soil profile close to leaf fall given that the irrigation inputs in this stage were lower and the crop requirements were not being covered worse water status the cause must lie in the inability of the tree to take advantage of the autumn rains as the canopy was in a more advanced stage of senescence confirmation of this hypothesis would require verification of leaf gas exchange levels and the percentage of senescent leaves θ was similar in the two deficit irrigation treatments at the end of the p1 period in 2014 and 2016 but significant differences were maintained between them in the ψs values similar situations and discrepancies between water availability and water status were detected in different moments of the crop cycle over the three years of the trial as although some relationship has been observed between ψs and θ values in grapevine williams and araujo 2002 or european plum mccutchan and shackel 1992 in this study the recovery of both did not always take place at the same rate the relationship between soil water content and plant water status is not a direct one but aspects such as the capacity of the plant to transport water to the leaves the evaporative demand the leaf gas exchange rate and the radiation intercepted by the plant canopy are all influential in 2015 annual precipitation was lower than the average for the area and in addition the crop cycle began with a low soil water profile content causing a marked decrease in ψs in the rdi treatment such a situation usually has an irreversible effect on fruit growth even in a year with a very low load level blanco cipollone et al 2019 in the other two years when load was higher and the soil profile had an initial higher water content a tendency for reduced fruit size was also observed but in this case coinciding with higher tree load in this treatment the interaction between water status and load level has previously been observed in this cultivar in relation to the effect on final fruit size samperio et al 2015a the water stress supported by the rdp trees in an advanced stage of fruit growth had lower repercussions on fruit size as although it affected the growth rate this was lower than in the previous growth stages it should also be noted that the p2 growth rates were the same in rdi and rdp and lower than in con 4 4 influence of the treatments on vegetative and productive response the results obtained in terms of the number of fruits that set in each treatment provide information about how the moment in which the tree suffers water stress affects the processes which determine the potential number of fruits in the following year the rdi treatment which endured a moderate to severe water stress in a stage around pit hardening saw a considerable increase in the number of fruits that set compared to the con treatment whereas when the stress was induced close to harvest rdp the effect was not so evident prolonged rdi strategies over several years can have a negative medium long term effect on peach tree productivity due to the reduction in canopy size marsal et al 2016 in our study the rdp strategy decreased tree vigor measured as the increase in tcsa compared to the con treatment however the impact of water stress on canopy intercepted radiation was lower than in the rdi treatment this was because the effect of water stress on the rdi trees was in a period of more active vegetative growth and hence they would be expected to be less prone to premature decline it should also be noted that the increase in crop load was less pronounced in the rdp than in the rdi treatment which means a lower consumption of assimilates in the initial stages until the establishment of the definitive load the rdp irrigation strategy focused on the periods immediately before harvest and postharvest with the latter taking on greater importance due to the effects of climate change establishing the water status of the tree ψs as an irrigation reference in a period of variable weather conditions should mean a more rational use of water resources it is important to avoid inducing severe stress in view of the accumulation of reserves and carry over effects the acidity and firmness values decreased in the days prior to harvest as was also reported for mid maturing japanese plum crisosto et al 2004 this preharvest phase when prunus salicina fruit acquire commercial maturity is of great importance el sharkawy et al 2007 trainotti et al 2003 however a reduction in ψs values in this phase in the rdp treatment only affected firmness in 2015 though this might have been more related to the low load level than the water stress cheng and crisosto 1997 crisosto et al 1994 intrigliolo and castel 2010 mpelasoka and behboudian 2002 naor et al 2004 in all cases firmness values were above 3 4 kg cm 2 the bruising threshold for impact related damage crisosto et al 2001 the rdi and con treatments had similar acidity and firmness values as has also been observed in apple mpelasoka and behboudian 2002 peach crisosto et al 1994 and japanese plum naor et al 2004 though this was not the case in other studies in which acidity decreased in water stress situations behboudian and mills 1997 gelly et al 2004 the ssc values at harvest were in the range considered good crisosto et al 2007 and with no significant differences between treatments except in 2015 the accumulation of sugars in the fruit growth and maturation stage is due principally to the assimilation of carbon produced by leaf photosynthesis in an intermediate stage of fruit development díaz mula 2008 a lower number of fruits per cm2 allowed a higher supply of assimilates to the fruits resulting in higher ssc values in 2015 crisosto et al 1994 intrigliolo and castel 2010 wünsche and ferguson 2005 when there were statistically significant differences between treatments 4 5 general remarks given the results obtained and based on the hypothesis that severe water stress in a period of high evaporative demand could put the harvest at risk the application of the rdp strategy seems in principle to offer advantages over the rdi strategy through the maintenance of a moderate tree water stress in the rdi strategy the total suspension of irrigation subjected the tree to a stress level that varied between years although the rdi strategy is easier to apply at commercial level it generates greater uncertainty in terms of the results with significant dependency on the amount of rainfall the level of soil reserves and tree load in addition a risk of a decrease in final fruit size must be accepted the application of a deficit irrigation period in a final stage of fruit growth p2 allows management decisions to be made with a greater awareness of the particular situation of each year that is the intensity of the stress that is induced can be varied in accordance with the water reserves available in the soil profile the meteorological conditions and forecasts and the load level the establishment of water status reference levels to manage deficit irrigation strategies is recommended to avoid stress levels so severe that they can have a negative impact even in less sensitive phenological stages however as happens in a species as alternate bearing as olive martín vertedor et al 2011 tree load level affects the water potential levels in 2015 a year with a heavily reduced load level the con treatment maintained ψs values above 1 0 mpa whereas in the other two years the values fell below this limit despite continuing with the same irrigation criteria and despite being wetter years at a practical level some flexibility is required with respect to the reference levels in terms of adapting to that year s conditions in the orchard with respect to another of the potential benefits of deficit irrigation the control of tree vigor the results of this study suggest that it may be recommendable in years of low load to allow more severe stress levels in order to restrict tree growth in this respect the rdi was more effective than the rdp strategy as it acts at a time of higher vegetation growth rates 5 conclusions in this study a new regulated deficit irrigation strategy is proposed for the late maturing japanese plum cv angeleno in this new strategy deficit irrigation with moderate water stress is initiated preharvest when the fruit growth rate slows down and sensitivity to water stress is low and is continued postharvest this strategy was compared in a 3 year long trial with a control treatment without induced water stress and a previously established deficit irrigation treatment for mid and late maturing stone fruit trees the two deficit irrigation treatments were equally effective in terms of controlling tree vigor but the results obtained show that this new strategy offers significant advantages obtaining the same productivity as the control and traditional deficit irrigation strategies but using considerably less water resources and maintaining only a moderate water stress during the postharvest period the proposed strategy resulted in an average water saving of 23 compared to the control without any observed carry over effects as a result water productivity was higher in the new strategy with no negative impact on fruit characteristics it should also be noted that the initiation of a preharvest irrigation water supply reduction at an advanced stage of the irrigation campaign allows better adaptation to the particular meteorological characteristics and tree load level of the year in question declaration of competing interest none

10641,water deficit is one of the most sever worldwide problems of agricultural systems which influences both yield and quality applying compositions like salicylic acid sa can improve plant resistance against environmental stresses the present study was conducted to evaluate the impact of irrigation intervals and sa application on plant growth osmotic parameters oil yield and oil composition of milk thistle a completely randomized design was applied with a factorial arrangement of two factors irrigation intervals as the first factor including 5 days control 10 days d1 15 days

yield and oil content results show that spraying 0 5 mm sa partially increased plant growth and seed yield parameters under control condition under drought stress conditions spraying 1 mm of sa had more significant effects on higher seed yield and oil content compared to 0 5 mm drought stress increased proline content total soluble carbohydrates tsc sucrose total phenolic compounds tpc and dpph free radical scavenging while applying 1 mm of sa increased these parameters in both well watered and water deficit conditions in addition the production of linolenic acid palmitic acid and stearic

other sa treatments according to our results we suggest that sa can play an essential role as a regulator for improving osmotic adjustment rwc and yield of milk thistle plants under drought stress

evapotranspiration cause agricultural drought mishra and cherkauer 2010 drought stress activates many physiological biochemical and molecular processes in a plant which leads to some changes in the plant metabolic pathways petropoulos et al 2008 water deficiency at critical stages of plant growth not only reduces plant growth but also reduces seed yield and quality drought stress may lead to physiological and biochemical disorders such as a reduction in photosynthesis and transpiration petropoulos et al 2008 regarding the effects of water irrigation regimes flagella et al 2002 reported a reduction of the total oil content of sunflower under drought stress they also recorded a significant increase in the oleic linoleic acid ratio under water stress flagella et al 2002 also reported a positive correlation between oleic acid and water deficit in the sunflower plant moreover drought stress induces the production of reactive oxygen species ros due to energy accumulation which leads to photooxidative effects and structural damages khoyerdi et al 2016 brito et al 2019 plants use different mechanisms to inhibit or reduce the adverse effects of drought stress which are known as avoidance escape and tolerance khoyerdi et al 2016 biosynthesis and accumulation of low molecular weight organic compounds like osmotic adjustments are essential to maintaining osmotic potential under drought conditions chaves et al 2003 it seems biosynthesis and accumulation of osmotic adjustments like proline soluble carbohydrates sucrose and phenolic compounds in vacuole and cytoplasm are in positive correlation with cell membrane stability molaei et al 2012 numerous reports confirm the enhancement of osmotic adjustments in stress conditions like drought conditions marcinska et al 2013 khoyerdi et al 2016 osama et al 2019 and salinity tension estaji et al 2018 2019 this increment enhances plant tolerance toward stress conditions on the other hand the accumulation of reactive oxygen species scavengers and antioxidants along with using signaling molecules such as salicylic acid sa and jasmonic acid have a vital role in improving plant tolerance to drought stress chavoushi et al 2019 the sa is classifying as a phenolic growth regulator which has an essential role in regulating plant growth and development szepesi et al 2008 sa is a potent signaling molecule that takes part in the process of plant defense by regulating physiological and biochemical functions gunes et al 2007 nazar et al 2011 previous studies also have shown that applying sa increased plant resistance toward salinity nazar et al 2015 khan et al 2014 and drought tensions yazdanpanah et al 2011 hussein et al 2007 according to the results of noreen and ashraf 2010 sa application decreased the adverse effects of stress and increased the amount of seed oil khalili et al 2009 reported that the antioxidant activity and accumulation of secondary metabolites might be induced by sa application in milk thistle in addition plants that treated with sa seemed to be more resistant against drought stress than control plants al hakimi and hamada 2001 nazar et al 2015 reported that sa application increased drought tolerance by raising the level of proline accumulation and inhibiting the synthesis of 1 aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid applying exogenous sa also increased the amount of silymarin in milk thistle seeds khalili et al 2009 brito et al 2019 suggested that the application of proper sa concentrations is an efficient tool to improve the cellular homeostasis and growth of plants subjected to recurrent drought periods milk thistle silybum marianum l is a medicinal plant from the asteraceae family which is positively effective in treating liver diseases and cancer by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation karkanis et al 2011 the pharmaceutical compound of milk thistle is producing from fruits dry pericarp and seed coat andrzejewska et al 2011 a group of flavonolignans commonly named silymarin is the main active compound in milk thistle khalili et al 2009 silymarin has both an anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties khalili et al 2009 the seed oil of milk thistle contains 20 25 high quality oil and a remarkable amount of vitamin e which makes it a potential natural source of vitamin e fathi and azadmard 2009 important fatty acids of milk thistle seed oil are linoleic acid 51 22 oleic acid 20 30 linolenic acid 3 78 palmitic acid 8 77 arachidonic acid 1 02 and stearic acid 5 05 which show high amount of unsaturated fatty acids content ramasamy and agarwal 2008 estaji et

according to the results of ali et al 2013 these compounds play a vital role in the oil oxidative stability of oils european countries especially poland are the important producer of milk thistle seeds and medicines derived from its seeds now the cultivated area covers about 2000 ha and the cultivation area is increasing every year around the world karkanis et al 2011 recently the cultivation of milk thistle has increased in iran due to the high level of unsaturated fatty acids and silymarin these compounds are essential for the food and pharmaceutical industry although milk thistle is relativity resistant to drought stress severe drought tension and rainfall reduction during the critical period of plant growth can negatively affect yield and seed quality hatzig et al 2018 reported that drought stress decreased seed yield and oil content but increased unsaturated fatty acids of winter oilseed rape therefore the deficit in rainfall or watering can be considered as a climate factor that is improving the seed oil quality although it reduces seed yield and oil content however as drought stress is an expanding problem in iran using some filed management techniques like the application of phytohormones can reduce the harmful effects of drought stress on plant growth and seed yield since sa has an active role in increasing drought tolerance this experiment aims to evaluate the impact of sa application on improving osmotic adjustments relative water content rwc plant growth seed yield and seed oil characteristics of milk thistle under drought stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site in late february 2016 a field experiment was conducted at the experimental field located in the west of tehran iran latitude 35 43 n longitude 51 8 e and altitude 1215 m the average annual precipitation was 242 7 mm and this experimental field climate represents a semi arid character the average maximum and minimum temperatures were 41 4 c and 6 7 c respectively and average relative humidity was 36 during the crop season basic meteorological data during the experimental period are presented in fig 1 to determine the soil chemical and physical characteristics soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm depth the mixture of these samples then analyzed by routine soil analyzing methods alban and kellogg 1959 table 1 2 2 plant materials and experimental treatments to evaluate the effects of sa on drought resistance of milk thistle this experiment was conducted as a factorial based on completely randomized design with three replications seeds of cv budakalazi were purchased from the department of medicinal plants kvryns university the size of each experimental plot was kept 3 m 3 m and there was 1 m space between the plots seeds of milk thistle were planted on 30th february at 3 cm depth row spacing was 50 cm and intra row spacing was 30 cm up to 7 plants per square meter all the seeds germinated within 10 13 days 10 13 march after sowing seedlings were grown under ambient condition and irrigated at 100 field capacity until they reached the main stem formation stage 4 may all crop cultural practices and plant protection measures were carried out uniformly in all plots during the period of experimentation the irrigation treatments were applied at four different irrigation intervals including c normally irrigated every 5 days d1 10 days d2 15 days and d3 20 days in the day of irrigation the amount of irrigation water was calculated based on the soil water content and its difference to the 100 field capacity therefore in the day of irrigation experimental units were irrigated up to the 100 field capacity the soil water content was measured by the gravimetric method evett et al 1993 soil samples were collected with a drill from 30 and 60 cm depth before and after the irrigation irrigation treatments were started 45 days after emergence 4 may the time of main stem formation and was continued until the maturity of the flower heads to prepare a solution of sa the required amount of sa was solved in a little amount of ethanol 0 5 ml then distilled water was added to achieve the concentrations of 0 5 and 1 mm drought stress and well watered plots were sprayed with the sa treatments which includes 0 0 5 and 1 mm sa application started at 31 days after emergence 24 april and it repeated seven times in four weeks control plants remained unsprayed until the end of sampling 2 3 growth parameters and yield growth parameters include main stem height cm the number of capitula per plant number of lateral branches per plant was measured in the flowering stage for sampling and measurements we disregarded 50 cm of both ends of each plot to avoid the marginal effect thus we used twenty plants from inner rows for sampling and analyzing yield parameters like the number of seeds per capitula and seed yield t ha 1 were measured at the seed maturity stage seed yield was calculated by harvesting 20 plants from the center of each plot and the average of seed weight per plant was calculated according to plant density per unit area seed yield was estimated per hectare and was expressed as t ha 1 2

intervals the main stem height the number of lateral branches the number of capitula and the number of seeds per capitula decreased in untreated and treated plants with sa plants under d3 irrigation without sa application exhibited the maximum reduction of main stem height 49 8 number of lateral branches 78 4 number of capitula 78 4 and the number of seeds per capitula 31 9 comparing to untreated sa plants under c irrigation the application of different sa concentrations had dissimilar effects on vegetative indices of milk thistle under different irrigation conditions although the application of 0 5 mm sa increased the main stem height and the number of lateral branches compared to untreated plants under control irrigation the application of 1 mm sa had no significant effects on these traits under control irrigation conversely exogenous sa in interaction with d1 d2 and d3 increased main stem height number of lateral branches and the number of seeds per capitula comparing to the same level of irrigation interval and control sa treatment the number of capitula was increased by application of both sa concentrations in c d1 and d2 irrigation but in d3 irrigation exogenous sa had not significant effects table 2 generally with increasing irrigation intervals reduction of vegetative parameters of treated plants with sa were lower than untreated plants irrigation intervals sa application and their interaction effects p 0 01 significantly changed the seed yield increasing irrigation interval decreased the seed yield of untreated sa plants table 2 plants treated with 0 5 and 1 mm sa under10 days irrigation interval d1 did not show any significant difference in seed yield compared to treated plants exposed to 5 days irrigation interval c table 2 moreover exogenous sa improved the seed yield in plants exposed to d1 d2 and d3 conditions while it did not affect seed yield in c irrigation table 2 3 2 relative water content rwc interaction effects of irrigation interval and sa influenced rwc in milk thistle plants leaves table 3 a liner reduction was found between leaf rwc of milk thistle plant and drought severity plants treated with 1 mm sa had the least decrease of rwc 14 compared to plants under control irrigation the maximum decrease in rwc was recorded in untreated sa plants 18 and treated plants with 0 5 mm sa 17 at d3 irrigation conditions fig 2 3 3 proline analysis of variance table 3 revealed that drought stress sa and their interaction had significant effects on proline content p 0 01 the proline content increased in plants under water stress especially in plants under d2 and d3 irrigation intervals comparing to control irrigation proline content is likely to grow 1 5 and 2 5 fold respectively under d2 and d3 irrigation fig 3 a exogenous sa 1 mm increased proline content by the rate of 34 22 49 and 34 in c d1 d2 and d3 respectively compared to the same level of irrigation without sa application fig 3a 3 4 total soluble protein tsp interaction of irrigation intervals and sa treatment affected the tsp content of milk thistle leaves significantly table 3 p 0 01 results indicate that the amount of tsp decreased substantially because of increasing irrigation intervals in leaves of untreated and treated plants with sa tsp content increased in plants treated with 1 mm sa compared to untreated sa plants at the same irrigation level this increase was about 16 2 and 27 9 in d2 and d3 irrigation intervals respectively results also show that the application of 0 5 mm sa in all irrigation intervals did not produce any significant effect on tsp content except for plants exposed to d3 irrigation conditions fig 3b 3 5 total soluble carbohydrates tsc interaction effects of irrigation intervals and sa significantly influenced tsc table 3 as shown in fig 4 a tsc content enhanced by increasing irrigation interval in sa treated and untreated plants however no significant difference was observed in the tsc content of plants exposed to d1 and d2 conditions exogenous sa increased leaf tsc in all irrigation levels but the differences between plants treated with 0 5 and 1 mm at each irrigation level were not considerable fig 4a 3 6 sucrose irrigation interval sa and their interactions had significant effects on leaf sucrose content p 0 01 the leaf sucrose content of sa treated and untreated plants enhanced by increasing irrigation interval exogenous sa remarkably increased sucrose content in all irrigation condition in this study the highest sucrose content 51 33 μg g 1 fw was recorded in sa treated plants under the d3 condition this sucrose content is 2 fold higher than control plants under d3 irrigation intervals fig 4b 3 7 total phenolic compounds tpc the interaction effects of irrigation intervals and sa application significantly influenced the tpc content of milk thistle leaves fig 5 a the tpc content of all plants raised appreciably by increasing irrigation intervals besides 1 mm sa treatment increased the tpc content compared to untreated sa plants at the same irrigation level this rise was about 15 6 22 3 24 7 and 24 7 in control d1 d2 and d3 respectively results also indicate that 0 5 mm sa application under control and d1 irrigation interval did not affect tpc content significantly compared to untreated sa plants however by increasing the irrigation intervals to 15 and 20 days d2 and d3 tpc content increased considerably fig 5a 3 8 dpph free radical scavenging activity dpph free radical scavenging activity significantly affected by irrigation intervals sa and their interactions table 3 p 0 01 drought stress and sa treatment increased free radical scavenging activity the highest free radical scavenging activity 71 recorded in plant grown under d3 condition and treated with 1 mm sa while the lowest free radical scavenging activity 45 recorded in well watered plants without sa treatment fig 5b 3 9 oil content and composition according to the results the oil content of milk thistle seeds decreased by increasing water stress intensity in both untreated and treated sa plants table 4 application of 0 5 and 1 mm sa on plants subjected to d1 d2 and d3 irrigation intervals increased the oil content compared to untreated sa plants in same levels of irrigation however there was no significant effect between plants treated with 0 5 and 1 mm sa results also indicate that exogenous 0 5 and 1 mm sa increased seed oil content by 55 and 30 respectively compared with untreated sa plants under c irrigation condition table 4 based on gc6 analysis fatty acid composition of milk thistle oil is linoleic acid 35 7 43 1 oleic acid 29 2 35 1 linolenic acid 2 4 4 3 stearic acid 5 8 8 5 palmitic acid 9 6 17 7 and arachidonic acid 1 8 1 9 generally linoleic acid linolenic acid and arachidonic acid are polyunsaturated fatty acid and oleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids table 4 interaction effects of drought stress and sa significantly affected linoleic acid linolenic acid stearic acid and total unsaturated fatty acids p 0 01 however the amount of palmitic acid oleic acid arachidonic acid monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids were not significantly affected table 4 p 0 05 stearic acid content significantly enhanced by increasing irrigation intervals regardless of sa treatments the maximum stearic acid content was found in seed of plants under d3 irrigation and the minimum stearic acid content was recorded in well irrigated c plants table 4 plants exposed to 1 mm sa showed a higher amount of stearic acid than untreated sa plants in d2 and d3 irrigation intervals the difference between plants treated with 0 5 and 1 mm sa was not significant in d2 and d3 irrigation as shown in table 4 exogenous sa did not considerably affect stearic acid content under c and d1 treatments linolenic acid content increased under water deficit condition that induced by increasing irrigation intervals as shown in table 4 there was no significant difference between plants irrigated under d2 and d3 conditions application of 0 5 and 1 mm sa significantly increased the content of linoleic acid content compared to untreated sa plants in all irrigation intervals table 4 4 discussion over the last years some farm management plans have been made to develop strategies for decreasing the harmful effects of drought on plant growth physiology and yield for that purpose the exogenous application of phytohormones like jasmonic acid bandurska et al 2003 and sa shaki et al 2018 osama et al 2019 brito et al 2019 have been tested on some species nonetheless no information has been described how exogenous sa mitigates the effects of drought stress on growth yield and oil characteristics of milk thistle plants our results show a significant negative relationship between growth parameters and drought stress table 2 therefore our results supporting previous studies reporting that water stress reduces the plant elongation and expansion water deficit caused a significant reduction of these two vital parameters in milk thistle belitz and sams 2007 farhadi et al 2016 coneflower gray et al 2003 jatropha hedayati et al 2013 sunflower safflower and sesame ebrahimian et al 2019 and decreased their growth and yield on the other hand exogenous sa application increased growth parameters like plant height number of seed per capitula number of capitula per plant and the number of lateral branch it can be said that the sa application gradually declined the harmful effects of deficit irrigation improving plant growth due to the application of sa has also been reported in safflower shaki et al 2018 ammi visnaga l osama et al 2019 and egletes viscosa l batista et al 2019 hussain et al 2008 also reported higher growth and yield of sunflower plants by sa application in water definition condition water shortage by impairing nutrient absorption selvakumar et al 2012 reduces turgor pressure and rwc khoyerdi et al 2016 which changes morphological and physiological parameters and decreases plant growth the beneficial effects of sa in promoting growth could affect both physiological and biochemical processes brito et al 2019 reported that the proper concentration of sa 100 μm could increase the root growth of young olive trees under drought stress according to the study of shakirova et al 2003 sa is capable of preventing cytokinin and auxin from reduction which motivates cell division of apical root meristem plant growth and productivity sa also affects the cell elongation and cell differentiation miura et al 2009 ion uptake batista et al 2019 brito et al 2019 antioxidant capacity osama et al 2019 sa improves enzymatic and photosynthetic activities batista et al 2019 and the balance between ros production and scavenging brito et al 2019 based on our results the growth promoting effects of sa can be related to improving water relations and osmolytes accumulation such as proline tsc sucrose and tpc that prevent negative effects of water decline as shown in table 5 a positive and significant correlation was observed between plant growth and yield with rwc and osmotic adjustments hoekstra and buitink 2001 reported that the accumulation of osmotic adjustments has a strong correlation with tolerance to drought stress loutfy et al 2012 reported that sa application enhanced the resistance of wheat plants toward stress conditions by increasing the plant biomass rwc and the content of inorganic and organic solutes however the high concentration of sa may cause auxin depletion that leads to disturbance of meristem activity and root architecture pasternak et al 2019 this finding could explain our result that plants treated with 1 mm sa showed significant growth reduction under normal irrigation conditions thus the application of a high concentration of sa may cause high levels of oxidative stress in the control condition kang et al 2012 under stress conditions rwc is one of the most reliable tools for predicting physiological traits of plants chaturvedi et al 2019 rwc indicates plant water status which is considered as one of the most meaningful indices of dehydration tolerance antonić et al 2016 our results shows that deficit irrigation reduces rwc but exogenous sa application improved it under stress conditions similar responses have reported on impatiens walleriana l under drought stress and sa application antonić et al 2016 the role of sa on maintaining the rwc rate under stress conditions also has been reported on other plants such as mustard alam et al 2013 and tomato hayat et al 2008 hayat et al 2008 reported that reduction of rwc under drought stress conditions is mainly due to the following reasons i limiting water availability for plant roots ii reduction of root activity and water uptake and iii decreasing membrane stability and increasing electrolyte leakage and water loss the application of sa helps plants to overcome these changes by increasing the accumulation of osmotic adjustments like proline and tsc hayat et al 2008 in our study rwc was significantly correlated with tsp r 0 96 tsc r 0 75 and proline r 0 75 table 5 these findings indicate that water stress severely affected plant resistance parameters to drought stress the amount of sucrose and tsc increased significantly when the severity of drought stress increased fig 1 plants can accumulate a series of compounds like tsc and sucrose to avoid adverse effects of drought stress resistance to stresses is positively correlated with the concentration of these compatible compounds khoyerdi et al 2016 increasing activity of the sucrose phosphatase enzyme which has a crucial role in the metabolism of starch and sucrose would result in a higher amount of sucrose cheikh and brenner 1992 accumulation of tsc under stress condition can be due to i decomposition of insoluble carbohydrate to soluble carbohydrates ii tsc synthesis from non photosynthetic pathways iii reduction of photosynthesis rate and lower carbohydrate consumption which cause less plant growth estaji et al 2018 parade et al 2000 suggested that increasing tsc and sucrose lead to higher osmotic potential and growth in terms of stress in this experiment applying sa enhanced the amount of tsc and sucrose in both drought stress and control treatments effects of sa on some enzymes which are involved in starch degradation and producing 6 carbon sugars could be the main reason for this enhancement in stress conditions poor et al 2011 increasing sa levels could improve plant health by raising the content of polysaccharides and soluble sugars luo et al 2014 similar reports on tomato poor et al 2011 wheat marcinska et al 2013 and safflower chavoushi et al 2019 are available which support our results as shown in table 5 rwc had a negative correlation with tsc r 0 75 it means that plants store some compounds like tsc to reduce the harmful effects of rwc reduction these compounds significantly decrease plant water potential and increase the gradient of water potential between plant tissue and soil because of this difference in water potential water will move from the soil into the plant root cells via the process of osmosis vieira et al 2017 reported that decreasing rwc increased starch degradation and tsc accumulation however our results show that sa application by growing accumulation for tsc improved rwc and milk thistle resistance to drought stress in stress conditions the accumulation of some molecules supports plant growth proline is one of those osmotic adjustments that help plants to maintain osmotic potential under stress conditions li et al 2014 khan et al 2015a b pointed on the positive role of proline in maintaining turgor pressure without interfering in other metabolic processes during drought stress increasing the activity of enzymes which involved in the biosynthesis of the stress protective proteins may cause accumulation of proline in this circumstance khedr et al 2003 on the other hand proline acts as a source of energy for regulating redox potential hong boa et al 2006 according to the study of khedr et al 2003 proline also reduces the effects of free radicals our results indicates that proline content enhanced under drought stress while sa increased the amount of proline in control and well watered plants fig 3a these results confirm finding of li et al 2014 which reported sa application reduces the harmful effects of stress by increasing proline content applying sa also may cause proline production by stimulating the synthesis of aba and stress proteins pál et al 2018 application of sa 0 5 and 1 mm can induce the activity of proline biosynthesis enzymes e g pyrroline 5 carboxylate reductase and γ glutamyl kinase khan et al 2015a b ghafiyehsanj et al 2013 and el tayeb and ahmed 2010 reported increasing proline as a result of sa application which are in agreement with our results kordi et al 2013 have shown that the highest proline content in basil leaves was recorded in plants treated with 1 5 mm sa under drought stress according to the current study there is a negative and significant correlation between rwc and proline accumulation r 0 79 decreasing rwc under stress conditions leads to the accumulation of aba and reactive oxygen species ros that can act as signaling molecules in root tissue accumulation of aba under stress conditions stimulate the production of proline synthesizing enzymes pál et al 2018 therefore the rwc reduction can be considered as the first factor stimulating proline synthesis drought stress causes some quantitative and qualitative changes in plant proteins generally during water definition condition changes in gene expression disrupts normal protein synthesis pathway which causes producing new series of proteins anjum et al 2011 our results show a considerable reduction of soluble proteins with increasing severity of drought stress reduction of total proteins content in maize mohammadkhani and heidari 2008 tomato ghorbanli et al 2013 and pistachio khoyerdi et al 2016 under drought stress are in agreement with our results previous studies also indicate that the activity of protease and cysteine proteinase which play an essential role in protein degradation increased considerably under drought stress however some reports indicate tsp enhancement under drought stress shan et al 2018 hasan et al 2018 the reduction of tsp might be due to the severe decrease of photosynthesis under drought stress lack of required materials for protein synthesis as a result of decreased photosynthesis rate should be regarded as an essential reason for tsp reduction khoyerdi et al 2016 suggested that protein synthesis is reducing by the raised amount of free radicals that influence methionine oxidation our results also show that sa 1 mm application leads to an increase of protein content in water definition condition fig 3b sa treatment could raise protein synthesis in drought stress by controlling the activity of enzymes involved in protein production like glutamine synthesis and nitrate reductase hao et al 2012 kang et al 2012 reported that sa treatment enhanced the activity of glutamine enzymes under drought stress in wheat plants another study shows significantly more amino acids and proteins because of sa and water definition treatments könig et al 2003 which supports our results this increment might be related to the decisive role of sa in developing mechanisms that avoid proteins degradation or by inducing specific proteins related to drought stress brito et al 2019 previous studies reported positive role of sa on the activity of the enzymes involved in the protein biosynthetic pathway our results also show that the application of 1 mm sa was more effective on protein biosynthesis compared to 0 5 mm sa the findings of the present study show a positive and significant correlation between tsp and rwc r 0 96 while a negative and significant correlation between tsp and tsc r 0 83 and proline r 0 81 were found table 5 therefore rwc with the highest correlation coefficient had the most significant role in tsp content table 5 changes in tsp content under drought stress seems to be an essential and useful indicator of many physiological processes related to stress therefore further studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the relationship between rwc and tsp under stress conditions producing phenolic compounds is considered as a non enzymatic defense mechanism and a biochemical marker against environmental stresses boudet 2007 phenolic compounds also make plants more resistant to drought stress by decreasing ros production mayer and harel 1991 results also show that increasing tpc could be the main result of increasing levels of enzymes involve in shikimate pathway in water shortage condition and sa application fig 5a sánchez rodríguez et al 2011 on the other hand sa increases phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity which is an important enzyme involved in the early stages of phenolic compounds biosynthesis chaman et al 2003 khan et al 2015a b also reported increasing level of phenolic compounds because of drought stress and sa application osama et al 2019 stated that drought stress on ammi visnaga l increased the level of tpc in all plant organs besides they reported a considerable increase of tpc as a result of spraying sa these results are in agreement with the outcome of the present study which indicates by increasing the sa concentration tpc content becomes higher in irrigation intervals in addition a positive and significant correlation between tsc and sucrose with tpc r 0 86 r 0 95 respectively were recorded table 5 as results show a high level of tsc and sucrose can stimulate the accumulation of secondary metabolites like phenolic compounds signaling role of soluble carbohydrates on the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites previously reported by bolouri moghaddam et al 2010 it seems that change in carbohydrates level is more effective than change in rwc for stimulating the metabolism of phenolic compounds under drought stress conditions rosa et al 2009 reported that soluble sugars which act as a signaling factor in many plant metabolic pathways are highly sensitive to environmental stresses the shikimic acid pathway participates in the biosynthesis of most phenolic compounds in plant tissue soluble carbohydrates are basic compounds for the synthesis of phenolic components in the shikimic acid pathway the shikimic acid pathway can convert simple carbohydrates from pentose phosphate and the glycolysis pathway to the aromatic amino acids ghasemzadeh et al 2010 therefore high drought intensity by disturbing the balance of carbohydrates between the sink and the source stimulate enzymes of the shikimic acid pathway guo et al 2018 antioxidant activity of the methanolic extract of seed was increased as a consequence of drought stress and sa application finding of previous studies that indicated the positive role of sa application on raising dpph radical scavenging activity are supporting our results osama et al 2019 this enhancement can be justified with the increment of phenolic compounds zainol et al 2003 stated that phenolic compounds have considerable antioxidant activity they also reported that with increasing leaves phenolic compounds antioxidant properties increased significantly rosicka kaczmarek 2004 the correlation results table 5 show that tpc with the highest correlation coefficient r 0 95 compared to the other traits acts as an active factor in the dpph radical scavenging activity these results suggest that the tpc level might be is responsible for a large proportion of antioxidant activity this finding is in agreement with results reported by zhao et al 2014 who reported a positive and significant correlation between phenolic compounds and the activity of antioxidant enzymes composition of milk thistle oil reported as linoleic acid 44 oleic acid 32 linolenic acid 3 stearic acid 6 palmitic acid 11 and arachidonic acid 2 by estaji et al 2011 malekzadeh et al 2011 reported a similar oil composition in milk thistle under environmental stresses our results show that the main constituents of milk thistle oil are unsaturated fatty acids like linoleic acid linolenic acid and oleic acid which shows the high quality of milk thistle oil for cooking drought stress significantly altered oil content and fatty acid composition these oil qualitative and quantitative changes against environmental stresses strongly depend on plant genotype and the severity of drought stress our results indicate that with increasing levels of drought stress oil content stearic acid and linolenic acid increased significantly while linoleic acid decreased this result is in agreement with malekzadeh et al 2011 which reported the enhancement of stearic acid and arachidonic acid in terms of salinity stress ozkan and kulak 2013 results on sesame show a significant increase of oleic acid under drought stress while linoleic acid decreased many studies reported that water stress changed oil composition on soybean dornbos and mullen 1992 rapeseed zarei et al 2010 and sunflower mobasser and tavassoli 2013 which are in agreement with our results dornbos and mullen 1992 results show that water definition condition during the seed filling period increased the level of stearic acid while the decreased level of oleic acid in soybean carrera et al 2009 suggested that in sever stresses plants produce more protein instead of fatty acids while in moderate tensions increasing oil content was observed it seems there is a strong correlation between protein and oil production 5 conclusion increasing irrigation interval decreased plant growth seed yield oil content and linoleic acid content to deal with drought stress plants use different mechanisms like enhancing osmoregulators and secondary metabolites our study shows that tpc tsc sucrose and proline increase under water deficit irrigation while rwc and tsp decreased under similar irrigation foliar sa application reduced destructive effects of drought stress on growth yield oil and oil compounds by maintaining rwc and tsp rate and increasing tpc tsc sucrose and proline content furthermore exogenous sa application increased the dpph radical scavenging activity in the plant methanolic extract according to the correlation results we could suggest that rwc acts as a critical factor for growth yield oil proline and tsc content under drought stress in this regard tsc and proline help to maintain rwc and avoid plant dehydration by decreasing the cell water potential while phenolic compounds help by increasing antioxidant activity and membrane stability however in water deficit irrigation it is advisable to use sa as a foliar spray to increase seed yield and the quantity and quality of oil and antioxidant activity these findings could be considered as a practical and straightforward strategy for arid and semi arid areas to increase the quality and quantity of milk thistle products for pharmaceutical and food purposes declaration of competing interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary

10641,water deficit is one of the most sever worldwide problems of agricultural systems which influences both yield and quality applying compositions like salicylic acid sa can improve plant resistance against environmental stresses the present study was conducted to evaluate the impact of irrigation intervals and sa application on plant growth osmotic parameters oil yield and oil composition of milk thistle a completely randomized design was applied with a factorial arrangement of two factors irrigation intervals as the first factor including 5 days control 10 days d1 15 days d2 20 days d3 and sa application as the second factor including 0 0 5 and 1 mm from the obtained results it was clear that water deficit damaged plant growth including relative water content rwc seed yield and oil content results show that spraying 0 5 mm sa partially increased plant growth and seed yield parameters under control condition under drought stress conditions spraying 1 mm of sa had more significant effects on higher seed yield and oil content compared to 0 5 mm drought stress increased proline content total soluble carbohydrates tsc sucrose total phenolic compounds tpc and dpph free radical scavenging while applying 1 mm of sa increased these parameters in both well watered and water deficit conditions in addition the production of linolenic acid palmitic acid and stearic acid enhanced under drought stress while linoleic acid and total soluble proteins tsp dropped by increasing drought intensity applying 1 mm of sa increased all these parameters more effectively than other sa treatments according to our results we suggest that sa can play an essential role as a regulator for improving osmotic adjustment rwc and yield of milk thistle plants under drought stress conditions therefore the application of a proper amount of sa can be considered as a practical and straightforward strategy for increasing seed oil quality and seed yield for both industrial and

is one of the most effective environmental tensions that influence plant growth and yield ebrahimian et al 2019 continuous rain shortage and irregular rainfall regimes with a high level of evapotranspiration cause agricultural drought mishra and cherkauer 2010 drought stress activates many physiological biochemical and molecular processes in a plant which leads to some changes in the plant metabolic pathways petropoulos et al 2008 water deficiency at critical stages of plant growth not only reduces plant growth but also reduces seed yield and quality drought stress may lead to physiological and biochemical disorders such as a reduction in photosynthesis and transpiration petropoulos et al 2008 regarding the effects of water irrigation regimes flagella et al 2002 reported a reduction of the total oil content of sunflower under drought stress they also recorded a significant increase in the oleic linoleic acid ratio under water stress flagella et al 2002 also reported a positive correlation between oleic acid and water deficit in the sunflower plant moreover drought stress induces the production of reactive oxygen species ros due to energy accumulation which leads to photooxidative effects and structural damages khoyerdi et al 2016 brito et al 2019 plants use different mechanisms to inhibit or reduce the adverse effects of drought stress which are known as avoidance escape and tolerance khoyerdi et al 2016 biosynthesis and accumulation of low molecular weight organic compounds like osmotic adjustments are essential to maintaining osmotic potential under drought conditions chaves et al 2003 it seems biosynthesis and accumulation of osmotic adjustments like proline soluble carbohydrates sucrose and phenolic compounds in vacuole and cytoplasm are in positive correlation with cell membrane stability molaei et al 2012 numerous reports confirm the enhancement of osmotic adjustments in stress conditions like drought conditions marcinska et al 2013 khoyerdi et al 2016 osama et al 2019 and salinity tension estaji et al 2018 2019 this increment enhances plant tolerance toward stress conditions on the other hand the accumulation of reactive oxygen species scavengers and antioxidants along with using signaling molecules such as salicylic acid sa and jasmonic acid have a vital role in improving plant tolerance to drought stress chavoushi et al 2019 the sa is classifying as a phenolic growth regulator which has an essential role in regulating plant growth and development szepesi et al 2008 sa is a potent signaling molecule that takes part in the process of plant defense by regulating physiological and biochemical functions gunes et al 2007 nazar et al 2011 previous studies also have shown that applying sa increased plant resistance toward salinity nazar et al 2015 khan et al 2014 and drought tensions yazdanpanah et al 2011 hussein et al 2007 according to the results of noreen and ashraf 2010 sa application decreased the adverse effects of stress and increased the amount of seed oil khalili et al 2009 reported that the antioxidant activity and accumulation of secondary metabolites might be induced by sa application in milk thistle in addition plants that treated with sa seemed to be more resistant against drought stress than control plants al hakimi and hamada 2001 nazar et al 2015 reported that sa application increased drought tolerance by raising the level of proline accumulation and inhibiting the synthesis of 1 aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid applying exogenous sa also increased the amount of silymarin in milk thistle seeds khalili et al 2009 brito et al 2019 suggested that the application of proper sa concentrations is an efficient tool to improve the cellular homeostasis and growth of plants subjected to recurrent drought periods milk thistle silybum marianum l is a medicinal plant from the asteraceae family which is positively effective in treating liver diseases and cancer by inhibiting cancer cell proliferation karkanis et al 2011 the pharmaceutical compound of milk thistle is producing from fruits dry pericarp and seed coat andrzejewska et al 2011 a group of flavonolignans commonly named silymarin is the main active compound in milk thistle khalili et al 2009 silymarin has both an anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties khalili et al 2009 the seed oil of milk thistle contains 20 25 high quality oil and a remarkable amount of vitamin e which makes it a potential natural source of vitamin e fathi and azadmard 2009 important fatty acids of milk thistle seed oil are linoleic acid 51 22 oleic acid 20 30 linolenic acid 3 78 palmitic acid 8 77 arachidonic acid 1 02 and stearic acid 5 05 which show high amount of unsaturated fatty acids content ramasamy and agarwal 2008 estaji et al 2011 this oil also is a rich source of secondary antioxidant metabolites such as polyphenolics compounds fathi and azadmard 2009 flavonoids estaji et al 2011 and tocopherols fathi and azadmard 2009 according to the results of ali et al 2013 these compounds play a vital role in the oil oxidative stability of oils european countries especially poland are the important producer of milk thistle seeds and medicines derived from its seeds now the cultivated area covers about 2000 ha and the cultivation area is increasing every year around the world karkanis et al 2011 recently the cultivation of milk thistle has increased in iran due to the high level of unsaturated fatty acids and silymarin these compounds are essential for the food and pharmaceutical industry although milk thistle is relativity resistant to drought stress severe drought tension and rainfall reduction during the critical period of plant growth can negatively affect yield and seed quality hatzig et al 2018 reported that drought stress decreased seed yield and oil content but increased unsaturated fatty acids of winter oilseed rape therefore the deficit in rainfall or watering can be considered as a climate factor that is improving the seed oil quality although it reduces seed yield and oil content however as drought stress is an expanding problem in iran using some filed management techniques like the application of phytohormones can reduce the harmful effects of drought stress on plant growth and seed yield since sa has an active role in increasing drought tolerance this experiment aims to evaluate the impact of sa application on improving osmotic adjustments relative water content rwc plant growth seed yield and seed oil characteristics of milk thistle under drought stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site in late february 2016 a field experiment was conducted at the experimental field located in the west of tehran iran latitude 35 43 n longitude 51 8 e and altitude

intervals the main stem height the number of lateral branches the number of capitula and the number of seeds per capitula decreased in untreated and treated plants with sa plants under d3 irrigation without sa application exhibited the maximum reduction of main stem height 49 8 number of lateral branches 78 4 number of capitula 78 4 and the number of seeds per capitula 31 9 comparing to untreated sa plants under c irrigation the application of different sa concentrations had dissimilar effects on vegetative indices of milk thistle under different irrigation conditions although the application of 0 5 mm sa increased the main stem height and the number of lateral branches compared to untreated plants under control irrigation the application of 1 mm sa had no significant effects on these traits under control irrigation conversely exogenous sa in interaction with d1 d2 and d3 increased main stem height number of lateral branches and the number of seeds per capitula comparing to the same level of irrigation interval and control sa treatment the number of capitula was increased by application of both sa concentrations in c d1 and d2 irrigation but in d3 irrigation exogenous sa had not significant effects table 2 generally with increasing irrigation intervals reduction of vegetative parameters of treated plants with sa were lower than untreated plants irrigation intervals sa application and their interaction effects p 0 01 significantly changed the seed yield increasing irrigation interval decreased the seed yield of untreated sa plants table 2 plants treated with 0 5 and 1 mm sa under10 days irrigation interval d1 did not show any significant difference in seed yield compared to treated plants exposed to 5 days irrigation interval c table 2 moreover exogenous sa improved the seed yield in plants exposed to d1 d2 and d3 conditions while it did not affect seed yield in c irrigation table 2 3 2 relative water content rwc interaction effects of irrigation interval and sa influenced rwc in milk thistle plants leaves table 3 a liner reduction was found between leaf rwc of milk thistle plant and drought severity plants treated with 1 mm sa had the least decrease of rwc 14 compared to plants under control irrigation the maximum decrease in rwc was recorded in untreated sa plants 18 and treated plants with 0 5 mm sa 17 at d3 irrigation conditions fig 2 3 3 proline analysis of variance table 3 revealed that drought stress sa and their interaction had significant effects on proline content p 0 01 the proline content increased in plants under water stress especially in plants under d2 and d3 irrigation intervals comparing to control irrigation proline content is likely to grow 1 5 and 2 5 fold respectively under d2 and d3 irrigation fig 3 a exogenous sa 1 mm increased proline content by the rate of 34 22 49 and 34 in c d1 d2 and d3 respectively compared to the same level of irrigation without sa application fig 3a 3 4 total soluble protein tsp interaction of irrigation intervals and sa treatment affected the tsp content of milk thistle leaves significantly table 3 p 0 01 results indicate that the amount of tsp decreased substantially because of increasing irrigation intervals in leaves of untreated and treated plants with sa tsp content increased in plants treated with 1 mm sa compared to untreated sa plants at the same irrigation level this increase was about 16 2 and 27 9 in d2 and d3 irrigation intervals respectively results also show that the application of 0 5 mm sa in all irrigation intervals did not produce any significant effect on tsp content except for plants exposed to d3 irrigation conditions fig 3b 3 5 total soluble carbohydrates tsc interaction effects of irrigation intervals and sa significantly influenced tsc table 3 as shown in fig 4 a tsc content enhanced by increasing irrigation interval in sa treated and untreated plants however no significant difference was observed in the tsc content of plants exposed to d1 and d2 conditions exogenous sa increased leaf tsc in all irrigation levels but the differences between plants treated with 0 5 and 1 mm at each irrigation level were not considerable fig 4a 3 6 sucrose irrigation interval sa and their interactions had significant effects on leaf sucrose content p 0 01 the leaf sucrose content of sa treated and untreated plants enhanced by increasing irrigation interval exogenous sa remarkably increased sucrose content in all irrigation condition in this study the highest sucrose content 51 33 μg g 1 fw was recorded in sa treated plants under the d3 condition this sucrose content is 2 fold higher than control plants under d3 irrigation intervals fig 4b 3 7 total phenolic compounds tpc the interaction effects of irrigation intervals and sa application significantly influenced the tpc content of milk thistle leaves fig 5 a the tpc content of all plants raised appreciably by increasing irrigation intervals besides 1 mm sa treatment increased the tpc content compared to untreated sa plants at the same irrigation level this rise was about 15 6 22 3 24 7 and 24 7 in control d1 d2 and d3 respectively results also indicate that 0 5 mm sa application under control and d1 irrigation interval did not affect tpc content significantly compared to untreated sa plants however by increasing the irrigation intervals to 15 and 20 days d2 and d3 tpc content increased considerably fig 5a 3 8 dpph free radical scavenging activity dpph free radical scavenging activity significantly affected by irrigation intervals sa and their interactions table 3 p 0 01 drought stress and sa treatment increased free radical scavenging activity the highest free radical scavenging activity 71 recorded in plant grown under d3 condition and treated with 1 mm sa while the lowest free radical scavenging activity 45 recorded in well watered plants without sa treatment fig 5b 3 9 oil content and composition according to the results the oil content of milk thistle seeds decreased by increasing water stress intensity in both untreated and treated sa plants table 4 application of 0 5 and 1 mm sa on plants subjected to d1 d2 and d3 irrigation intervals increased the oil content compared to untreated sa plants in same levels of irrigation however there was no significant effect between plants treated with 0 5 and 1 mm sa results also indicate that exogenous 0 5 and 1 mm sa increased seed oil content by 55 and 30 respectively compared with untreated sa plants under c irrigation condition table 4 based on gc6 analysis fatty acid composition of milk thistle oil is linoleic acid 35 7 43 1 oleic acid 29 2 35 1 linolenic acid 2 4 4 3 stearic acid 5 8 8 5 palmitic acid 9 6 17 7 and arachidonic acid 1 8 1 9 generally linoleic acid linolenic acid and arachidonic acid are polyunsaturated fatty acid and oleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids table 4 interaction effects of drought stress and sa significantly affected linoleic acid linolenic acid stearic acid and total unsaturated fatty acids p 0 01 however the amount of palmitic acid oleic acid arachidonic acid monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids were not significantly affected table 4 p 0 05 stearic acid content significantly enhanced by increasing irrigation intervals regardless of sa treatments the maximum stearic acid content was found in seed of plants under d3 irrigation and the minimum stearic acid content was recorded in well irrigated c plants table 4 plants exposed to 1 mm sa showed a higher amount of stearic acid than untreated sa plants in d2 and d3 irrigation intervals the difference between plants treated with 0 5 and 1 mm sa was not significant in d2 and d3 irrigation as shown in table 4 exogenous sa did not considerably affect stearic acid content under c and d1 treatments linolenic acid content increased under water deficit condition that induced by increasing irrigation intervals as shown in table 4 there was no significant difference between plants irrigated under d2 and d3 conditions application of 0 5 and 1 mm sa significantly increased the content of linoleic acid content compared to untreated sa plants in all irrigation intervals table 4 4 discussion over the last years some farm management plans have been made to develop strategies for decreasing the harmful effects of drought on plant growth physiology and yield for that purpose the exogenous application of phytohormones like jasmonic acid bandurska et al 2003 and sa shaki et al 2018 osama et al 2019 brito et al 2019 have been tested on some species nonetheless no information has been described how exogenous sa mitigates the effects of drought stress on growth yield and oil characteristics of milk thistle plants our results show a significant negative relationship between growth parameters and drought stress table 2 therefore our results supporting previous studies reporting that water stress reduces the plant elongation and expansion water deficit caused a significant reduction of these two vital parameters in milk thistle belitz and sams 2007 farhadi et al 2016 coneflower gray et al 2003 jatropha hedayati et al 2013 sunflower safflower and sesame ebrahimian et al 2019 and decreased their growth and yield on the other hand exogenous sa application increased growth parameters like plant height number of seed per capitula number of capitula per plant and the number of lateral branch it can be said that the sa application gradually declined the harmful effects of deficit irrigation improving plant growth due to the application of sa has also been reported in safflower shaki et al 2018 ammi visnaga l osama et al 2019 and egletes viscosa l batista et al 2019 hussain et al 2008 also reported higher growth and yield of sunflower plants by sa application in water definition condition water shortage by impairing nutrient absorption selvakumar et al 2012 reduces turgor pressure and rwc khoyerdi et al 2016 which changes morphological and physiological parameters and decreases plant growth the beneficial effects of sa in promoting growth could affect both physiological and biochemical processes brito et al 2019 reported that the proper concentration of sa 100 μm could increase the root growth of young olive trees under drought stress according to the study of shakirova et al 2003 sa is capable of preventing cytokinin and auxin from reduction which motivates cell division of apical root meristem plant growth and productivity sa also affects the cell elongation and cell differentiation miura et al 2009 ion uptake batista et al 2019 brito et al 2019 antioxidant capacity osama et al 2019 sa improves enzymatic and photosynthetic activities batista et al 2019 and the balance between ros production and scavenging brito et al 2019 based on our results the growth promoting effects of sa can be related to improving water relations and osmolytes accumulation such as proline tsc sucrose and tpc that prevent negative effects of water decline as shown in table 5 a positive and significant correlation was observed between plant growth and yield with rwc and osmotic adjustments hoekstra and buitink 2001 reported that the accumulation of osmotic adjustments has a strong correlation with tolerance to drought stress loutfy et al 2012 reported that sa application enhanced the resistance of wheat plants toward stress conditions by increasing the plant biomass rwc and the content of inorganic and organic solutes however the high concentration of sa may cause auxin depletion that leads to disturbance of meristem activity and root architecture pasternak et al 2019 this finding could explain our result that plants treated with 1 mm sa showed significant growth reduction under normal irrigation conditions thus the application of a high concentration of sa may cause high levels of oxidative stress in the control condition kang et al 2012 under stress conditions rwc is one of the most reliable tools for predicting physiological traits of plants chaturvedi et al 2019 rwc indicates plant water status which is considered as one of the most meaningful indices of dehydration tolerance antonić et al 2016 our results shows that deficit irrigation reduces rwc but exogenous sa application improved it under stress conditions similar responses have reported on impatiens walleriana l under drought stress and sa application antonić et al 2016 the role of sa on maintaining the rwc rate under stress conditions also has been reported on other plants such as mustard alam et al 2013 and tomato hayat et al 2008 hayat et al 2008 reported that reduction of rwc under drought stress conditions is mainly due to the following reasons i limiting water availability for plant roots ii reduction of root activity and water uptake and iii decreasing membrane stability and increasing electrolyte leakage and water loss the application of sa helps plants to overcome these changes by increasing the accumulation of osmotic adjustments like proline and tsc hayat et al 2008 in our study rwc was significantly correlated with tsp r 0 96 tsc r 0 75 and proline r 0 75 table 5 these findings indicate that water stress severely affected plant resistance parameters to drought stress the amount of sucrose and tsc increased significantly when the severity of drought stress increased fig 1 plants can accumulate a series of compounds like tsc and sucrose to avoid adverse effects of drought stress resistance to stresses is positively correlated with the concentration of these compatible compounds khoyerdi et al 2016 increasing activity of the sucrose phosphatase enzyme which has a crucial role in the metabolism of starch and sucrose would result in a higher amount of sucrose cheikh and brenner 1992 accumulation of tsc under stress condition can be due to i decomposition of insoluble carbohydrate to soluble carbohydrates ii tsc synthesis from non photosynthetic pathways iii reduction of photosynthesis rate and lower carbohydrate consumption which cause less plant growth estaji et al 2018 parade et al 2000 suggested that increasing tsc and sucrose lead to higher osmotic potential and growth in terms of stress in this experiment applying sa enhanced the amount of tsc and sucrose in both drought stress and control treatments effects of sa on some enzymes which are involved in starch degradation and producing 6 carbon sugars could be the main reason for this enhancement in stress conditions poor et al 2011 increasing sa levels could improve plant health by raising the content of polysaccharides and soluble sugars luo et al 2014 similar reports on tomato poor et al 2011 wheat marcinska et al 2013 and safflower chavoushi et al 2019 are available which support our results as shown in table 5 rwc had a negative correlation with tsc r 0 75 it means that plants store some compounds like tsc to reduce the harmful effects of rwc reduction these compounds significantly decrease plant water potential and increase the gradient of water potential between plant tissue and soil because of this difference in water potential water will move from the soil into the plant root cells via the process of osmosis vieira et al 2017 reported that decreasing rwc increased starch degradation and tsc accumulation however our results show that sa application by growing accumulation for tsc improved rwc and milk thistle resistance to drought stress in stress conditions the accumulation of some molecules supports plant growth proline is one of those osmotic adjustments that help plants to maintain osmotic potential under stress conditions li et al 2014 khan et al 2015a b pointed on the positive role of proline in maintaining turgor pressure without interfering in other metabolic processes during drought stress increasing the activity of enzymes which involved in the biosynthesis of the stress protective proteins may cause accumulation of proline in this circumstance khedr et al 2003 on the other hand proline acts as a source of energy for regulating redox potential hong boa et al 2006 according to the study of khedr et al 2003 proline also reduces the effects of free radicals our results indicates that proline content enhanced under drought stress while sa increased the amount of proline in control and well watered plants fig 3a these results confirm finding of li et al 2014 which reported sa application reduces the harmful effects of stress by increasing proline content applying sa also may cause proline production by stimulating the synthesis of aba and stress proteins pál et al 2018 application of sa 0 5 and 1 mm can induce the activity of proline biosynthesis enzymes e g pyrroline 5 carboxylate reductase and γ glutamyl kinase khan et al 2015a b ghafiyehsanj et al 2013 and el tayeb and ahmed 2010 reported increasing proline as a result of sa application which are in agreement with our results kordi et al 2013 have shown that the highest proline content in basil leaves was recorded in plants treated with 1 5 mm sa under drought stress according to the current study there is a negative and significant correlation between rwc and proline accumulation r 0 79 decreasing rwc under stress conditions leads to the accumulation of aba and reactive oxygen species ros that can act as signaling molecules in root tissue accumulation of aba under stress conditions stimulate the production of proline synthesizing enzymes pál et al 2018 therefore the rwc reduction can be considered as the first factor stimulating proline synthesis drought stress causes some quantitative and qualitative changes in plant proteins generally during water definition condition changes in gene expression disrupts normal protein synthesis pathway which causes producing new series of proteins anjum et al 2011 our results show a considerable reduction of soluble proteins with increasing severity of drought stress reduction of total proteins content in maize mohammadkhani and heidari 2008 tomato ghorbanli et al 2013 and pistachio khoyerdi et al 2016 under drought stress are in agreement with our results previous studies also indicate that the activity of protease and cysteine proteinase which play an essential role in protein degradation increased considerably under drought stress however some reports indicate tsp enhancement under drought stress shan et al 2018 hasan et al 2018 the reduction of tsp might be due to the severe decrease of photosynthesis under drought stress lack of required materials for protein synthesis as a result of decreased photosynthesis rate should be regarded as an essential reason for tsp reduction khoyerdi et al 2016 suggested that protein synthesis is reducing by the raised amount of free radicals that influence methionine oxidation our results also show that sa 1 mm application leads to an increase of protein content in water definition condition fig 3b sa treatment could raise protein synthesis in drought stress by controlling the activity of enzymes involved in protein production like glutamine synthesis and nitrate reductase hao et al 2012 kang et al 2012 reported that sa treatment enhanced the activity of glutamine enzymes under drought stress in wheat plants another study shows significantly more amino acids and proteins because of sa and water definition treatments könig et al 2003 which supports our results this increment might be related to the decisive role of sa in developing mechanisms that avoid proteins degradation or by inducing specific proteins related to drought stress brito et al 2019 previous studies reported positive role of sa on the activity of the enzymes involved in the protein biosynthetic pathway our results also show that the application of 1 mm sa was more effective on protein biosynthesis compared to 0 5 mm sa the findings of the present study show a positive and significant correlation between tsp and rwc r 0 96 while a negative and significant correlation between tsp and tsc r 0 83 and proline r 0 81 were found table 5 therefore rwc with the highest correlation coefficient had the most significant role in tsp content table 5 changes in tsp content under drought stress seems to be an essential and useful indicator of many physiological processes related to stress therefore further studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the relationship between rwc and tsp under stress conditions producing phenolic compounds is considered as a non enzymatic defense mechanism and a biochemical marker against environmental stresses boudet 2007 phenolic compounds also make plants more resistant to drought stress by decreasing ros production mayer and harel 1991 results also show that increasing tpc could be the main result of increasing levels of enzymes involve in shikimate pathway in water shortage condition and sa application fig 5a sánchez rodríguez et al 2011 on the other hand sa increases phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity which is an important enzyme involved in the early stages of phenolic compounds biosynthesis chaman et al 2003 khan et al 2015a b also reported increasing level of phenolic compounds because of drought stress and sa application osama et al 2019 stated that drought stress on ammi visnaga l increased the level of tpc in all plant organs besides they reported a considerable increase of tpc as a result of spraying sa these results are in agreement with the outcome of the present study which indicates by increasing the sa concentration tpc content becomes higher in irrigation intervals in addition a positive and significant correlation between tsc and sucrose with tpc r 0 86 r 0 95 respectively were recorded table 5 as results show a high level of tsc and sucrose can stimulate the accumulation of secondary metabolites like phenolic compounds signaling role of soluble carbohydrates on the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites previously reported by bolouri moghaddam et al 2010 it seems that change in carbohydrates level is more effective than change in rwc for stimulating the metabolism of phenolic compounds under drought stress conditions rosa et al 2009 reported that soluble sugars which act as a signaling factor in many plant metabolic pathways are highly sensitive to environmental stresses the shikimic acid pathway participates in the biosynthesis of most phenolic compounds in plant tissue soluble carbohydrates are basic compounds for the synthesis of phenolic components in the shikimic acid pathway the shikimic acid pathway can convert simple carbohydrates from pentose phosphate and the glycolysis pathway to the aromatic amino acids ghasemzadeh et al 2010 therefore high drought intensity by disturbing the balance of carbohydrates between the sink and the source stimulate enzymes of the shikimic acid pathway guo et al 2018 antioxidant activity of the methanolic extract of seed was increased as a consequence of drought stress and sa application finding of previous studies that indicated the positive role of sa application on raising dpph radical scavenging activity are supporting our results osama et al 2019 this enhancement can be justified with the increment of phenolic compounds zainol et al 2003 stated that phenolic compounds have considerable antioxidant activity they also reported that with increasing leaves phenolic compounds antioxidant properties increased significantly rosicka kaczmarek 2004 the correlation results table 5 show that tpc with the highest correlation coefficient r 0 95 compared to the other traits acts as an active factor in the dpph radical scavenging activity these results suggest that the tpc level might be is responsible for a large proportion of antioxidant activity this finding is in agreement with results reported by zhao et al 2014 who reported a positive and significant correlation between phenolic compounds and the activity of antioxidant enzymes composition of milk thistle oil reported as linoleic acid 44 oleic acid 32 linolenic acid 3 stearic acid 6 palmitic acid 11 and arachidonic acid 2 by estaji et al 2011 malekzadeh et al 2011 reported a similar oil composition in milk thistle under environmental stresses our results show that the main constituents of milk thistle oil are unsaturated fatty acids like linoleic acid linolenic acid and oleic acid which shows the high quality of milk thistle oil for cooking drought stress significantly altered oil content and fatty acid composition these oil qualitative and quantitative changes against environmental stresses strongly depend on plant genotype and the severity of drought stress our results indicate that with increasing levels of drought stress oil content stearic acid and linolenic acid increased significantly while linoleic acid decreased this result is in agreement with malekzadeh et al 2011 which reported the enhancement of stearic acid and arachidonic acid in terms of salinity stress ozkan and kulak 2013 results on sesame show a significant increase of oleic acid under drought stress while linoleic acid decreased many studies reported that water stress changed oil composition on soybean dornbos and mullen 1992 rapeseed zarei et al 2010 and sunflower mobasser and tavassoli 2013 which are in agreement with our results dornbos and mullen 1992 results show that water definition condition during the seed filling period increased the level of stearic acid while the decreased level of oleic acid in soybean carrera et al 2009 suggested that in sever stresses plants produce more protein instead of fatty acids while in moderate tensions increasing oil content was observed it seems there is a strong correlation between protein and oil production 5 conclusion increasing irrigation interval decreased plant growth seed yield oil content and linoleic acid content to deal with drought stress plants use different mechanisms like enhancing osmoregulators and secondary metabolites our study shows that tpc tsc sucrose and proline increase under water deficit irrigation while rwc and tsp decreased under similar irrigation foliar sa application reduced destructive effects of drought stress on growth yield oil and oil compounds by maintaining rwc and tsp rate and increasing tpc tsc sucrose and proline content furthermore exogenous sa application increased the dpph radical scavenging activity in the plant methanolic extract according to the correlation results we could suggest that rwc acts as a critical factor for growth yield oil proline and tsc content under drought stress in this regard tsc and proline help to maintain rwc and avoid plant dehydration by decreasing the cell water potential while phenolic compounds help by increasing antioxidant activity and membrane stability however in water deficit irrigation it is advisable to use sa as a foliar spray to increase seed yield and the quantity and quality of oil and antioxidant activity these findings could be considered as a practical and straightforward strategy for arid and semi arid areas to increase the quality and quantity of milk thistle products for pharmaceutical and food purposes declaration of competing interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary

10642,this study evaluated the performance of deep learning dl artificial neural network ann and k nearest neighbour knn models to estimate field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp using four combinations of soil data the dl ann and knn models are compared with the previous published pedotransfer functions ptf the data consist of 256 calcareous soil samples collected from konya çumra plain turkey the results demonstrated that the dl a with inputs of soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability showed the best performances with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 829 correlation coefficient r of 0 911 mean absolute error mae of 0 027 and relative root mean square error rrmse 9 397 in fc estimation for calcareous soil samples for the pwp estimation of calcareous soil samples the knn b with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime content and particle density indicated the best performance with the value of r2 to 0 800 of r to 0 894 of mae to 0 021 and rrmse to 12 043 lastly the results showed that the dl ann and the knn models perform better than the previously applied ptf for calcareous soils therefore the dl model could be recommended for the estimation of fc when full soil data are available and the knn model could be recommended for estimation of pwp with all combinations of soil data keywords field capacity permanent wilting point deep learning artificial neural network k nearest neighbour 1 introduction over recent decades the decline in water available for agriculture around the globe has become a major problem especially in arid and semi arid regions topak et al 2011 as such there is growing demand for the effective management of existing scarce water resources to sustain agricultural production de fraiture and wichelns 2010 a useful approach in the protection of natural resources and sustainable agricultural production involves determining the soil moisture content at water potentials of 33 kpa field capacity fc and 1500 kpa permanent wilting point pwp haghighi et al 2010 active plants naturally require soil water held at water potentials between fc defined as the upper limit for plant available water and pwp defined as the lower limit for plant available water serrano 1997 horne and scotter 2016 the determination of fc and pwp often requires expensive detailed laboratory analyses of soil samples that are often difficult to use to describe the spatial and temporal variation of soil properties botula et al 2012 mohanty et al 2015 various formulations of pedotransfer functions ptf have been developed to estimate fc and pwp values gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 saxton and rawls 2006 the ptf requires easily measurable soil variables such as soil texture sand silt and clay bulk density organic matter content geometric mean particle size diameter and geometric standard deviation of soil particles bouma 1989 many studies have utilized empirical methods of ptf for predicting fc and pwp acutis and donatelli 2003 botula et al 2012 givi et al 2004 mcneill et al 2018 rab et al 2011 however these methods are not able to estimate fc and pwp values using specific soil properties such as aggregate stability and lime content thus developing a simple and accurate mathematical method using all these data is challenging to estimate fc and pwp also due to the nonlinear nature of fc and pwp they are difficult to model with standard empirical methods and the accuracy of fc and pwp estimates is low they depend on the number of available soil data and the quality of this data therefore modelling with more innovative approaches such as machine learning methods help to obtain more reliable results shiri et al 2017 examined the gene expression programming neuro fuzzy support vector machine svm multivariate adaptive regression spline random forest rf and model tree and they compared them with six different ptf ghorbani et al 2017 evaluated the estimation of fc and pwp using the artificial neural network ann svm and svm with firefly algorithm svm ffa and they found that the svm ffa model performed better than svm and ann models mohanty et al 2015 evaluated the ann method under different number of neurons in a hidden layer and they found that six neurons in hidden layer had the best performance for predicting fc and pwp lamorski et al 2008 compared ann and svm model to estimate soil hydraulic parameters they found the svm model behaved better the ann model gunarathna et al 2019 evaluated ann k nearest neighbour knn and rf models for estimation of fc and pwp values and the study found that three applied machine learning models had better performances than earlier developed ptf the performance of the machine learning needs to be continuously improved as more and more data is provided to the model however after a while the capacity of the model is not sufficient to support the complex and large data set wang et al 2018 found that deep learning dl has advantages than earlier machine learning methods due to its high learning and training features therefore the use of dl is recently increased in soil science which has availability of complex and complicated dataset kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 song et al 2016 studied the estimation of soil moisture using the dl method for irrigated corn padarian et al 2018 estimated soil properties by the dl method from spectral data padarian et al 2019 studied the dl method for digital soil mapping in this study the aim was to use dl ann and knn models to estimate fc and pwp within calcareous soils with low organic matter content in arid and semi arid climate conditions the main objectives were 1 to evaluate the dl ann and knn models using soil properties to estimate fc and pwp and 2 to compare the fc and pwp estimated by the dl ann and knn models with fc and pwp estimated by empirical models developed by gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 and saxton and rawls 2006 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and dataset description the study area was located in the konya çumra plain in the central anatolia region of turkey fig 1 the relief of the study area soils is smooth and nearly flat and altitude is between 1006 1023 m formed on lacustrine and alluvium parent material the soils of the sampling area in konya çumra plain are classified as typic xerofluvents de meester 1970 soil survey staff 2014 in the region wheat sugar beet corn barley sunflower and other crops are grown in rotation under irrigation with intensive soil tillage used şeker et al 2016 according to the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 the climate of the area is semi arid with cold snowy winters and extremely hot dry summers and an average annual precipitation of 323 mm topak et al 2011 in the study 256 calcareous soil samples 0 20 cm soil depth were taken from three soil series and analyzed for soil particle size distribution sand silt and clay bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density aggregate stability fc 33 kpa and pwp 1500 kpa sand 50 2000 μm silt 20 50 μm clay 2 μm fractions of the calcareous soil samples were determined according to the procedure of bouyoucos hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 bulk density was measured by the undisturbed soil sample core 50 51 mm method blake and hartge 1986a and organic matter was determined by the dumas dry combustion method using a leco cn 2000 device wright and bailey 2001 lime content as caco3 equivalent was determined through scheibler calcimeter method nelson 1982 particle density was measured through the pycnometer method blake and hartge 1986b the determination of soil aggregate stability was achieved through artificial rainfall simulator device and employed procedures are described in the protocol formulated by gugino et al 2009 fc and the pwp were determined using a pressure plate apparatus cassel and nielsen 1986 published ptf for estimating fc and pwp are presented in table 1 according to these ptf soil texture components organic matter and bulk density are used as an input data to estimate fc and pwp 2 2 deep learning in recent years dl has been implemented successfully in agriculture research mohanty et al 2016 sa et al 2016 steen et al 2016 dl was first proposed by dechter 1986 and is the branch of the machine learning which uses more layers in the model kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 the dl model transforms the data by using many functions that allow data representation in a hierarchical way through multiple levels of abstraction lecun et al 2015 dl is composed of several hidden layers that allow higher performance and learning capabilities the structure of the dl is shown in fig 2 dl has three types of layers the first layer is called the input layer and the last layer the output layer and other layers the hidden layers which can consist of many layers dl has the ability to solve highly complex problems accurately and quickly therefore the dl can improve classification accuracy or decrease errors in regression problems however dl has some limitations the training time takes longer than other established machine learning methods another limitation is that when data sets are small and significantly different optimization problems can occur due to the complexity of the model kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 detailed information about calculation procedure of the dl model is provided by dechter 1986 2 3 artificial neural networks the ann machine learning method has been widely used to estimate fc and pwp merdun et al 2006 mohanty et al 2015 lamorski et al 2008 ghorbani et al 2017 ayoubi and sahrawat 2011 zolfaghari and mosaddeghi 2015 norouzi et al 2010 this method is a mathematical model developed by the inspiration of the structure of the biological brain landeras et al 2008 the method is a supervised model that has skills to learn from a training dataset and store the pattern of the data as a weighted connection of nodes after the learning process when the new data is applied to the ann model it recognizes the pattern from the data and classifies it in this way the method gives results quickly and accurately yamaç and todorovic 2020 the structure of a multilayer ann is shown in fig 3 the ann model is formed by three layers called the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer each layer consists of one or more nodes these nodes are linked to the next and previous layers the group of nodes is arranged in many layers including the following 1 input layers where the input variables fed into the system 2 hidden layers where the system learns the process and 3 output layers where the system gives the output variables liakos et al 2018 besalatpour et al 2012 tajik et al 2012 2 4 k nearest neighbour the k nearest neighbour knn method is one of the most widely used methods in data mining algorithms in the research community wu et al 2008 the method is a long established non parametric classifier introduced by cover and hart 1967 this method is easy to implement and it is also simple efficient intuitive and competitive therefore it can be used for both classification and regression problems yu et al 2002 at the stage of classification for a given test sample the knn algorithm directly searches all training examples by computing the distances between the testing sample and all training data to determine the nearest neighbours and produce the classification output fig 4 illustrates the knn decision rule for two classes k 1 and k 3 the former class an unknown sample x is classified by using one known sample square which is closest to the x in the latter class three closest samples to x are used for classification yamaç 2021 the euclidean distance function eq 1 one of the most widely used distance metric function in knn hu et al 2016 was used in this study the euclidian distance equation can be represented as 1 d p q i 1 n q i p i 2 in this formula d is the euclidian distance p and q are the data points consisting of n dimensions i is an index number in addition to the advantages described above the knn method has some disadvantages the knn method can take a long time to execute when the training dataset is large the reason is that each query sample is calculated singularly within each training dataset moreover the knn algorithm is highly sensitive to redundant and irrelevant features and therefore the quality of the features selection must be done carefully otherwise incorrect classification occurs imandoust and bolandraftar 2013 2 5 model evaluation the dl ann and knn methods were used to estimate fc and pwp input data for the models consisted of soil textures sand silt and clay bulk density organic matter lime particle density and aggregate stability the correlation matrix was developed in order to understand the relations between soil input data and output variables fc and pwp table 2 accordingly four combinations of soil input data were created and analyzed by dl ann and knn models these combinations of soil inputs were classified due to using less impact input variables which are particle density and aggregate stability and they include combination a soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability combination b soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime content and particle density combination c soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents and aggregate stability and combination d soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents all the input and output variables were normalized by scaling 0 1 to minimize the redundancy and inconsistency of the data the normalization equation is defined as follow lapedes and farber 1988 2 x n o r m x i x m i n x m a x x m i n where xnorm is the normalized value of xi xi is the observed value xmin and xmax are the minimum and maximum values the measured dataset for calcareous soil samples was divided into two subsets 70 of the data used for training and 30 of the data used for testing the training and testing data were divided randomly the performance of dl ann and knn models were evaluated using mean absolute error mae relative root means square

rrmse 30 and poor if rrmse 30 li et al 2013 3 results the soil data statistics are listed in table 3 the skewness was 0 09 for silt and skewness was 0 48 for pd can be observed from the table differences between the maximum and minimum values of the fc and pwp were 0 35 and 0 29 cm3 cm 3 the average values of the fc and pwp were 0 36 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 and the standard deviations were 0 07 and 0 06 respectively the highest value of the variation coefficient of the measured soil properties was determined for the sand content 42 48 the highest values of skewness and kurtosis present were for pwp 0 84 and pd 1 63 among the soil texture components sand content has the maximum skewness and kurtosis correlation matrix coefficients relating the input and output of the models are listed in table 2 the results demonstrated that the correlation between sand and other variables excluding bulk density had negative relationships the correlations between clay and output variables fc and pwp had the highest impact with values of 0 797 and 0 810 respectively in general particle density and aggregate stability had a small impact on fc and pwp 3 1 performances of selected ptf the statistical results of gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 and saxton and rawls 2006 equations performance for fc and pwp with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability soil input variables are presented in table 4 soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability was used as input for all the published ptf according to statistical indicators rawls et al 1982 equation represented the highest values with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 035 11 950 0 635 and 0 797 however gupta and larson 1979 equation showed the lowest values with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 058 19 510 0 446 and 0 668 for fc values estimation in pwp estimation gupta and larson 1979 equation performed slightly better than saxton and rawls 2006 and rawls et al 1982 equation while saxton and rawls 2006 equation gave the lowest statistical performance 3 2 models performances for estimation of fc the performance of the dl ann and knn models for estimating fc training and testing periods were assessed using four combinations of soil input variables table 5 for the dl model the most appropriate results were reached when the rectifier activation code and three hidden layers 25 40 and 25 were used in the present study according to result table 5 it can be noticed that the dl method produced the best performance for combination a with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 027 9 397 0 829 and 0 911 while the poorest performance was observed for combination b with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 029 9 898 0 803 and 0 896 respectively the statistical parameters indicated similar performances of the dl method for the c dl c and d dl d combinations of input soil data in general it was observed that among the dl ann and knn models for estimating fc the dl a method showed the best performance based on the statistical parameters in the testing subset comparison of observed and simulated fc values for the dl method is shown in fig 5 the best performance of the ann for estimating fc was observed for the ann 6 7 7 8 9 1 which means that the model consists of six neurons for combination a seven neurons for combination b seven neurons for combination c and eight neurons for combination d in input layers nine neurons in the hidden layer and one output layer the rectifier linear unit function was used as the activation function for the ann model the ann a had the highest performance with considering mae 0 027 rrmse 9 397 r2 0 829 and r 0 910 in the testing subset the statistical parameters indicated a similar performance of the ann method for combination b and c of soil input data the lowest performance was observed for the ann d with inputs of soil textures bulk density organic matter and lime contents in that case mae was 0 027 rrmse was 9 362 r2 was 0 777 and r 0 881 respectively comparison of observed and simulated fc values for the ann method is shown in fig 6 for the knn model the highest performance was observed when the k was selected to 7 the statistical results of fc estimate using knn model with four combinations of soil input variables knn a knn b knn c and knn d indicated the lowest performance of the model when fc were estimated with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability knn a with mae of 0 895 rrmse of 9 163 r2 of 0 801 and r of 0 895 in the testing subset a similar statistical performance obtained for the knn b knn c and knn d combinations during the testing period the knn model showed the best performance for fc estimate when combination c was used with mae of 0 026 rrmse of 9 283 r2 of 0 820 and r of 0 906 comparison of observed and simulated fc for the knn method is shown in fig 7 according to rrmse 10 rrmse all the dl and knn ann a and ann d had an excellent agreement between observed and simulated values for estimating fc in the testing subset 3 3 models performances for estimation of pwp table 6 demonstrates the statistical performances of dl ann and knn models for estimating pwp under four combinations of soil input variables for the estimation of pwp with the dl method three hidden layers 25 40 and 25 and the rectifier activation code were used in this study as shown in table 6 the dl method gave no significantly different results between the combinations however the dl method showed the best performance with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability dl a with the value of mae to 0 024 rrmse to 13 680 r2 to 0 729 r to 0 854 comparison of observed and simulated pwp for the dl method is shown in fig 8 the performance criteria demonstrated that ann 6 7 7 8 6 1 models perform better for the pwp estimation here the model gave six neurons for combination a seven neurons for combination b seven neurons for combination c and eight neurons for combination d in input layers six neurons in the hidden layer and one in the output layer the rectifier linear unit function was used as the activation function for the testing subset the ann a fed with inputs of soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability had the highest performance with considering mae 0 025 rrmse 13 776 r2 0 730 r 0 854 however the ann d fed with inputs of soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents was observed the lowest performance with mae of 0 025 rrmse of 14 234 r2 of 0 702 r of 0 838 comparison of observed and simulated pwp for ann method is shown in fig 9 the best result for estimating pwp was obtained when k was set to seven for the knn model as shown in table 6 it is concluded that the knn method produces the poorest result for combination c with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 023 13 717 0 745 and 0 863 respectively the combination of knn c and knn d was shown to have similar statistical indicators the performance of knn was improved in combination b with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents and particle density also knn b showed the best performance among the ann and knn models with mae of 0 021 rrmse of 14 234 r2 of 0 800 and r of 0 894 in the testing period comparison of observed and simulated pwp for knn method is shown in fig 10 4 discussion in this study dl ann and knn models with different combinations of soil parameters were tested to estimate fc and pwp of the calcareous soils the present results showed that the dl ann and knn methods were able to describe nonlinear relationships between soil inputs and to simulate fc and pwp values these nonparametric methods have an advantage since they do not need prior information about the relations between the input and output variables gocić et al 2015 yamaç and todorovic 2020 the statistical parameters of the dl method with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability dl a observed the best performance for fc estimation of the calcareous soil this result confirmed the correlation between the soil input variables that were reported in table 2 for pwp value the statistical parameters of the knn method with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents and particle density knn b were observed the highest performance for calcareous soil however the statistical parameters were indicated that the lowest performance of the fc is the ann with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents ann d and the lowest performance of the pwp is the ann with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents ann d the statistical indicators in tables 4 5 and 6 the dl ann and knn show better performances than the pedotransfer functions of gupta and larson 1979 saxton and rawls 2006 and rawls et al 1982 the observation is in agreement with the findings of shiri et al 2017 who indicated that the machine learning techniques perform better than the applied pedotransfer functions in the estimation of fc and pwp the presented statistical indicators demonstrate good performances of dl ann and knn methods for instance ghorbani et al 2017 applied three different methods svm ann and svm ffa with soil input data for estimating fc and pwp for the ann and svm methods they reported higher rrmse and smaller r in the training and testing phase in respect to the results of the present study mohanty et al 2015 examined the ann model with different hidden layers in fc and pwp estimation however the present study indicates that knn with a and b combinations show higher r2 values for pwp estimation merdun et al 2006 evaluated the ann model for estimating fc and pwp the ann has shown a similar performance in estimation fc in the study gunarathna et al 2019 estimated the fc and pwp with ann knn and rf models and different soil inputs variables soil texture components bulk density and organic carbon they reported smaller r2 and higher mae in respect to the results of the present study according to statistical indicators it was observed that r2 and r for pwp values estimation are higher than fc estimation as it is known soil properties such as organic matter and lime contents in high calcareous soils bulk density soil texture components and soil structure are effective on the amount of high energy moisture content such as fc moreover these parameters are more effective on the amount of low energy moisture content such as pwp wu et al 1990 kay and angers 2002 lebron et al 2002 zhang et al 2017 these observations can be explained by the high lime content the presence of non clay minerals as lime in clay fractions şeker and karakaplan 1999 and the different types of clay minerals of the study area munsuz et al 1996 5 conclusions due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of soil structures the practices of machine learning methods in the field of soil science studies have been increasing in the last years machine learning techniques are a cost effective and comprehensive tool using sophisticated algorithms that allow better soil condition estimation and decision making moreover these techniques are an important tool for processing real time datasets from the latest generation of sensors through data cloud technologies in this study the dl method was used for the first time to estimate fc and pwp for calcareous soil in order to investigate modelling performance with different combinations of soil input data and in respect to the well known ann and knn methods the ann and knn have been used in many studies as a comparison tool in order to analyze the performance of the dl method in addition dl ann and knn models provided much greater accuracy in modelling fc and pwp in comparison to the applied pedotransfer functions the benchmarking analysis of dl ann and knn methods were undertaken for four combinations of soil input data the overall results indicated that the dl method with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability dl a also the dl a and the ann c gave similar results for pwp values estimation of calcareous soils the knn method with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents and particle density knn b has the most appropriate result therefore the knn method might be an adequate alternative solution to the use of other more complex techniques like the dl and ann and full soil input datasets this finding is particularly important for the contexts where the range of soil analysis is limited due to economical and temporal reasons consequently more data is required to boost the performance of the dl method for estimating fc and pwp likewise further studies should be applied to confirm and evaluate the applicability of other machine learning techniques for fc and pwp estimating under different geographical conditions and soil input data availability these estimations are especially important for irrigated agriculture which faces many challenges in developing improved irrigation scheduling and field management acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge to tübi̇takfor this research prepared from data of the tübi̇tak via project no 112o314

combinations of soil data the dl ann and knn models are compared with the previous published pedotransfer functions ptf the data consist of 256 calcareous soil samples collected from konya çumra plain turkey the results demonstrated that the dl a with inputs of soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability showed the best performances with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 829 correlation coefficient r of 0 911 mean absolute error mae of 0 027 and relative root mean square error rrmse 9 397 in fc estimation for calcareous soil samples for the pwp estimation of calcareous soil samples the knn b with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime content and particle density indicated the best performance with the value of r2 to 0 800 of r to 0 894 of mae to 0 021 and rrmse to 12 043 lastly the results showed that the dl ann and the knn models perform better than the previously applied ptf for calcareous soils therefore the dl model could be recommended for the estimation of fc when full soil data are available and the knn model could be recommended for estimation of pwp with all combinations of soil data keywords field capacity permanent wilting point deep learning artificial neural network k nearest neighbour 1 introduction over recent decades the decline in water available for agriculture around the globe has become a major problem especially in arid and semi arid regions topak et al 2011 as such there is growing demand for the effective management of existing scarce water resources to sustain agricultural production de fraiture and wichelns 2010 a useful approach in the protection of natural resources and sustainable agricultural production involves determining the soil moisture content at water potentials of 33 kpa field capacity fc and 1500 kpa permanent wilting point pwp haghighi et al 2010 active plants naturally require soil water held at water potentials between fc defined as the upper limit for plant available water and pwp defined as the lower limit for plant available water serrano 1997 horne and scotter 2016 the determination of fc and pwp often requires expensive detailed laboratory analyses of soil samples that are often difficult to use to describe the spatial and temporal variation of soil properties botula et al 2012 mohanty et al 2015 various formulations of pedotransfer functions ptf have been developed to estimate fc and pwp values gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 saxton and rawls 2006 the ptf requires easily measurable soil variables such as soil texture sand silt and clay bulk density organic matter content geometric mean particle size diameter and geometric standard deviation of soil particles bouma 1989 many studies have utilized empirical methods of ptf for predicting fc and pwp acutis and donatelli 2003 botula et al 2012 givi et al 2004 mcneill et al 2018 rab et al 2011 however these methods are not able to estimate fc and pwp values using specific soil properties such as aggregate stability and lime content thus developing a simple and accurate mathematical method using all these data is challenging to estimate fc and pwp also due to the nonlinear nature of fc and pwp they are difficult to model with standard empirical methods and the accuracy of fc and pwp estimates is low they depend on the number of available soil data and the quality of this data therefore modelling with more innovative approaches such as machine learning methods help to obtain more reliable results shiri et al 2017 examined the gene expression programming neuro fuzzy support vector machine svm multivariate adaptive regression spline random forest rf and model tree and they compared them with six different ptf ghorbani et al 2017 evaluated the estimation of fc and pwp using the artificial neural network ann svm and svm with firefly algorithm svm ffa and they found that the svm ffa model performed better than svm and ann models mohanty et al 2015 evaluated the ann method under different number of neurons in a hidden layer and they found that six neurons in hidden layer had the best performance for predicting fc and pwp lamorski et al 2008 compared ann and svm model to estimate soil hydraulic parameters they found the svm model behaved better the ann model gunarathna et al 2019 evaluated ann k nearest neighbour knn and rf models for estimation of fc and pwp values and the study found that three applied machine learning models had better performances than earlier developed ptf the performance of the machine learning needs to be continuously improved as more and more data is provided to the model however after a while the capacity of the model is not sufficient to support the complex and large data set wang et al 2018 found that deep learning dl has advantages than earlier machine learning methods due to its high learning and training features therefore the use of dl is recently increased in soil science which has availability of complex and complicated dataset kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 song et al 2016 studied the estimation of soil moisture using the dl method for irrigated corn padarian et al 2018 estimated soil properties by the dl method from spectral data padarian et al 2019 studied the dl method for digital soil mapping in this study the aim was to use dl ann and knn models to estimate fc and pwp within calcareous soils with low organic matter content in arid and semi arid climate conditions the main objectives were 1 to evaluate the dl ann and knn models using soil properties to estimate fc and pwp and 2 to compare the fc and pwp estimated by the dl ann and knn models with fc and pwp estimated by empirical models developed by gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 and saxton and rawls 2006 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and dataset description the study area was located in the konya çumra plain in the central anatolia region of turkey fig 1 the relief of the study area soils is smooth and nearly flat and altitude is between 1006 1023 m formed on lacustrine and alluvium parent material the soils of the sampling area in konya çumra plain are classified as typic xerofluvents de meester 1970 soil survey staff 2014 in the region wheat sugar beet corn barley sunflower and other crops are grown in rotation under irrigation with intensive soil tillage used şeker et al 2016 according to the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 the climate of the area is semi arid with cold snowy winters and extremely hot dry summers and an average annual precipitation of 323 mm topak et al 2011 in the study 256 calcareous soil samples 0 20 cm soil depth were taken from three soil series and analyzed for soil particle size distribution sand silt and clay bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density aggregate stability fc 33 kpa and pwp 1500 kpa sand 50 2000 μm silt 20 50 μm clay 2 μm fractions of the calcareous soil samples were determined according to the procedure of bouyoucos hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 bulk density was measured by the undisturbed soil sample core 50 51 mm method blake and hartge 1986a and organic matter was determined by the dumas dry combustion method using a leco cn 2000 device wright and bailey 2001 lime content as caco3 equivalent was determined through scheibler calcimeter method nelson 1982 particle density was measured through the pycnometer method blake and hartge 1986b the determination of soil aggregate stability was achieved through artificial rainfall simulator device and employed procedures are described in the protocol formulated by gugino et al 2009 fc and the pwp were determined using a pressure plate apparatus cassel and nielsen 1986 published ptf for estimating fc and pwp are presented in table 1 according to these ptf soil texture components organic matter and bulk density are used as an input data to estimate fc and pwp 2 2 deep learning in recent years dl has been implemented successfully in agriculture research mohanty et al 2016 sa et al 2016 steen et al 2016 dl was first proposed by dechter 1986 and is the branch of the machine learning which uses more layers in the model kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 the dl model transforms the data by using many functions that allow data representation in a hierarchical way through multiple levels of abstraction lecun et al 2015 dl is composed of several hidden layers that allow higher performance and learning capabilities the structure of the dl is shown in fig 2 dl has three types of layers the first layer is called the input layer and the last layer the output layer and other layers the hidden layers which can consist of many layers dl has the ability to solve highly complex problems accurately and quickly therefore the dl can improve classification accuracy or decrease errors in regression problems however dl has some limitations the training time takes longer than other established machine learning methods another limitation is that when data sets are small and significantly different optimization problems can occur due to the complexity of the model kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 detailed information about calculation procedure of the dl model is provided by dechter 1986 2 3 artificial neural networks the ann machine learning method has been widely used to estimate fc and pwp merdun et al 2006 mohanty et al 2015 lamorski et al 2008 ghorbani et al 2017 ayoubi and sahrawat 2011 zolfaghari and mosaddeghi 2015 norouzi et al 2010 this method is a mathematical model developed by the inspiration of the structure of the biological brain landeras et al 2008 the method is a supervised model that has skills to learn from a training dataset and store the pattern of the data as a weighted connection of nodes after the learning process when the new data is applied to the ann model it recognizes the pattern from the data and classifies it in this way the method gives results quickly and accurately yamaç and todorovic 2020 the structure of a multilayer ann is shown in fig 3 the ann model is formed by three layers called the input layer the hidden layer and the output layer each layer consists of one or more nodes these nodes are linked to the next and previous layers the group of nodes is arranged in many layers including the following 1 input layers where the input variables fed into the system 2 hidden layers where the system learns the process and 3 output layers where the system gives the output variables liakos et al 2018 besalatpour et al 2012 tajik et al 2012 2 4 k nearest neighbour the k nearest neighbour knn method is one of the most widely used methods in data mining algorithms in the research community wu et al 2008 the method is a long established non parametric classifier introduced by cover and hart 1967 this method is easy to implement and it is also simple efficient intuitive and competitive therefore it can be used for both classification and regression problems yu et al 2002 at the stage of classification for a given test sample the knn algorithm directly searches all training examples by computing the distances between the testing sample and all training data to determine the nearest neighbours and produce the classification output fig 4 illustrates the knn decision rule for two classes k 1 and k 3 the former class an unknown sample x is classified by using one known sample square which is closest to the x in the latter class three closest samples to x are used for classification yamaç 2021 the euclidean distance function eq 1 one of the most widely used distance metric function in knn hu et al 2016 was used in this study the euclidian distance equation can be represented as 1 d p q i 1 n q i p i 2 in this formula d is the euclidian distance p and q are the data points consisting of n dimensions i is an index number in addition to the advantages described above the knn method has some disadvantages the knn method can take a long time to execute when the training dataset is large the reason is that each query sample is calculated singularly within each training dataset moreover the knn algorithm is highly sensitive to redundant and irrelevant features and therefore the quality of the features selection must be done carefully otherwise incorrect classification occurs imandoust and bolandraftar 2013 2 5 model evaluation the dl ann and knn methods were used to estimate fc and pwp input data for the models consisted of soil textures sand silt and clay bulk density organic matter lime particle density and aggregate stability the correlation matrix was developed in order to understand the relations between soil input data and output variables fc and pwp table 2 accordingly four combinations of soil input data were created and analyzed by dl ann and knn models these combinations of soil inputs were classified due to using less impact input variables which are particle density and aggregate stability and they include combination a soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability combination b soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime content and particle density combination c soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents and aggregate stability and combination d soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents all the input and output variables were normalized by scaling 0 1 to minimize the redundancy and inconsistency of the data the normalization equation is defined as follow lapedes and farber 1988 2 x n o r m x i x m i n x m a x x m i n where xnorm is the normalized value of xi xi is the observed value xmin and xmax are the minimum and maximum values the measured dataset for calcareous soil samples was divided into two subsets 70 of the data used for training and 30 of the data used for testing the training and testing data were divided randomly the performance of dl ann and knn models were evaluated using mean absolute error mae relative root means square

differences between the maximum and minimum values of the fc and pwp were 0 35 and 0 29 cm3 cm 3 the average values of the fc and pwp were 0 36 and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 and the standard deviations were 0 07 and 0 06 respectively the highest value of the variation coefficient of the measured soil properties was determined for the sand content 42 48 the highest values of skewness and kurtosis present were for pwp 0 84 and pd 1 63 among the soil texture components sand content has the maximum skewness and kurtosis correlation matrix coefficients relating the input and output of the models are listed in table 2 the results demonstrated that the correlation between sand and other variables excluding bulk density had negative relationships the correlations between clay and output variables fc and pwp had the highest impact with values of 0 797 and 0 810 respectively in general particle density and aggregate stability had a small impact on fc and pwp 3 1 performances of selected ptf the statistical results of gupta and larson 1979 rawls et al 1982 and saxton and rawls 2006 equations performance for fc and pwp with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability soil input variables are presented in table 4 soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability was used as input for all the published ptf according to statistical indicators rawls et al 1982 equation represented the highest values with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 035 11 950 0 635 and 0 797 however gupta and larson 1979 equation showed the lowest values with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 058 19 510 0 446 and 0 668 for fc values estimation in pwp estimation gupta and larson 1979 equation performed slightly better than saxton and rawls 2006 and rawls et al 1982 equation while saxton and rawls 2006 equation gave the lowest statistical performance 3 2 models performances for estimation of fc the performance of the dl ann and knn models for estimating fc training and testing periods were assessed using four combinations of soil input variables table 5 for the dl model the most appropriate results were reached when the rectifier activation code and three hidden layers 25 40 and 25 were used in the present study according to result table 5 it can be noticed that the dl method produced the best performance for combination a with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 027 9 397 0 829 and 0 911 while the poorest performance was observed for combination b with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 029 9 898 0 803 and 0 896 respectively the statistical parameters indicated similar performances of the dl method for the c dl c and d dl d combinations of input soil data in general it was observed that among the dl ann and knn models for estimating fc the dl a method showed the best performance based on the statistical parameters in the testing subset comparison of observed and simulated fc values for the dl method is shown in fig 5 the best performance of the ann for estimating fc was observed for the ann 6 7 7 8 9 1 which means that the model consists of six neurons for combination a seven neurons for combination b seven neurons for combination c and eight neurons for combination d in input layers nine neurons in the hidden layer and one output layer the rectifier linear unit function was used as the activation function for the ann model the ann a had the highest performance with considering mae 0 027 rrmse 9 397 r2 0 829 and r 0 910 in the testing subset the statistical parameters indicated a similar performance of the ann method for combination b and c of soil input data the lowest performance was observed for the ann d with inputs of soil textures bulk density organic matter and lime contents in that case mae was 0 027 rrmse was 9 362 r2 was 0 777 and r 0 881 respectively comparison of observed and simulated fc values for the ann method is shown in fig 6 for the knn model the highest performance was observed when the k was selected to 7 the statistical results of fc estimate using knn model with four combinations of soil input variables knn a knn b knn c and knn d indicated the lowest performance of the model when fc were estimated with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability knn a with mae of 0 895 rrmse of 9 163 r2 of 0 801 and r of 0 895 in the testing subset a similar statistical performance obtained for the knn b knn c and knn d combinations during the testing period the knn model showed the best performance for fc estimate when combination c was used with mae of 0 026 rrmse of 9 283 r2 of 0 820 and r of 0 906 comparison of observed and simulated fc for the knn method is shown in fig 7 according to rrmse 10 rrmse all the dl and knn ann a and ann d had an excellent agreement between observed and simulated values for estimating fc in the testing subset 3 3 models performances for estimation of pwp table 6 demonstrates the statistical performances of dl ann and knn models for estimating pwp under four combinations of soil input variables for the estimation of pwp with the dl method three hidden layers 25 40 and 25 and the rectifier activation code were used in this study as shown in table 6 the dl method gave no significantly different results between the combinations however the dl method showed the best performance with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability dl a with the value of mae to 0 024 rrmse to 13 680 r2 to 0 729 r to 0 854 comparison of observed and simulated pwp for the dl method is shown in fig 8 the performance criteria demonstrated that ann 6 7 7 8 6 1 models perform better for the pwp estimation here the model gave six neurons for combination a seven neurons for combination b seven neurons for combination c and eight neurons for combination d in input layers six neurons in the hidden layer and one in the output layer the rectifier linear unit function was used as the activation function for the testing subset the ann a fed with inputs of soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability had the highest performance with considering mae 0 025 rrmse 13 776 r2 0 730 r 0 854 however the ann d fed with inputs of soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents was observed the lowest performance with mae of 0 025 rrmse of 14 234 r2 of 0 702 r of 0 838 comparison of observed and simulated pwp for ann method is shown in fig 9 the best result for estimating pwp was obtained when k was set to seven for the knn model as shown in table 6 it is concluded that the knn method produces the poorest result for combination c with mae rrmse r2 and r equal to 0 023 13 717 0 745 and 0 863 respectively the combination of knn c and knn d was shown to have similar statistical indicators the performance of knn was improved in combination b with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents and particle density also knn b showed the best performance among the ann and knn models with mae of 0 021 rrmse of 14 234 r2 of 0 800 and r of 0 894 in the testing period comparison of observed and simulated pwp for knn method is shown in fig 10 4 discussion in this study dl ann and knn models with different combinations of soil parameters were tested to estimate fc and pwp of the calcareous soils the present results showed that the dl ann and knn methods were able to describe nonlinear relationships between soil inputs and to simulate fc and pwp values these nonparametric methods have an advantage since they do not need prior information about the relations between the input and output variables gocić et al 2015 yamaç and todorovic 2020 the statistical parameters of the dl method with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability dl a observed the best performance for fc estimation of the calcareous soil this result confirmed the correlation between the soil input variables that were reported in table 2 for pwp value the statistical parameters of the knn method with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents and particle density knn b were observed the highest performance for calcareous soil however the statistical parameters were indicated that the lowest performance of the fc is the ann with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents ann d and the lowest performance of the pwp is the ann with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents ann d the statistical indicators in tables 4 5 and 6 the dl ann and knn show better performances than the pedotransfer functions of gupta and larson 1979 saxton and rawls 2006 and rawls et al 1982 the observation is in agreement with the findings of shiri et al 2017 who indicated that the machine learning techniques perform better than the applied pedotransfer functions in the estimation of fc and pwp the presented statistical indicators demonstrate good performances of dl ann and knn methods for instance ghorbani et al 2017 applied three different methods svm ann and svm ffa with soil input data for estimating fc and pwp for the ann and svm methods they reported higher rrmse and smaller r in the training and testing phase in respect to the results of the present study mohanty et al 2015 examined the ann model with different hidden layers in fc and pwp estimation however the present study indicates that knn with a and b combinations show higher r2 values for pwp estimation merdun et al 2006 evaluated the ann model for estimating fc and pwp the ann has shown a similar performance in estimation fc in the study gunarathna et al 2019 estimated the fc and pwp with ann knn and rf models and different soil inputs variables soil texture components bulk density and organic carbon they reported smaller r2 and higher mae in respect to the results of the present study according to statistical indicators it was observed that r2 and r for pwp values estimation are higher than fc estimation as it is known soil properties such as organic matter and lime contents in high calcareous soils bulk density soil texture components and soil structure are effective on the amount of high energy moisture content such as fc moreover these parameters are more effective on the amount of low energy moisture content such as pwp wu et al 1990 kay and angers 2002 lebron et al 2002 zhang et al 2017 these observations can be explained by the high lime content the presence of non clay minerals as lime in clay fractions şeker and karakaplan 1999 and the different types of clay minerals of the study area munsuz et al 1996 5 conclusions due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of soil structures the practices of machine learning methods in the field of soil science studies have been increasing in the last years machine learning techniques are a cost effective and comprehensive tool using sophisticated algorithms that allow better soil condition estimation and decision making moreover these techniques are an important tool for processing real time datasets from the latest generation of sensors through data cloud technologies in this study the dl method was used for the first time to estimate fc and pwp for calcareous soil in order to investigate modelling performance with different combinations of soil input data and in respect to the well known ann and knn methods the ann and knn have been used in many studies as a comparison tool in order to analyze the performance of the dl method in addition dl ann and knn models provided much greater accuracy in modelling fc and pwp in comparison to the applied pedotransfer functions the benchmarking analysis of dl ann and knn methods were undertaken for four combinations of soil input data the overall results indicated that the dl method with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents particle density and aggregate stability dl a also the dl a and the ann c gave similar results for pwp values estimation of calcareous soils the knn method with soil texture components bulk density organic matter and lime contents and particle density knn b has the most appropriate result therefore the knn method might be an adequate alternative solution to the use of other more complex techniques like the dl and ann and full soil input datasets this finding is particularly important for the contexts where the range of soil analysis is limited due to economical and temporal reasons consequently more data is required to boost the performance of the dl method for estimating fc and pwp likewise further studies should be applied to confirm and evaluate the applicability of other machine learning techniques for fc and pwp estimating under different geographical conditions and soil input data availability these estimations are especially important for irrigated agriculture which faces many challenges in developing improved irrigation scheduling and field management acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge to tübi̇takfor this research prepared from data of the tübi̇tak via project no 112o314 
10643,mulched drip irrigation is a common water saving irrigation technology that can improve water resource utilization efficiency in arid areas the change of irrigation method affects the growth of crop root system and then regulates the growth of aboveground organs however there have been limited comparative studies on how mulched drip irrigation affects the cotton root growth and regulates the relationship between cotton root and shoot the objective of this study was to determine whether mulched drip irrigation could achieve water saving and high yield cotton cultivation by regulating the growth redundancy of root and shoot under field conditions mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation conventional flood irrigation and reduced flood irrigation were used in this experiment traditional flood irrigation was used as the control group the results showed that compared with the traditional flood irrigation the higher soil water content under mulched drip irrigation increased the specific root length srl which promoted the growth of fine root length and biomass at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage the growth of fine roots increased the root shoot ratio r s of mulched drip irrigation and then inhibited the excessive vegetative growth of the aboveground parts when entering the late full boll stage and boll opening stage the fine root biomass and fine root mass fraction decreased rapidly under the mulched drip irrigation resulting in a lower r s the smaller r s of mulched drip irrigation facilitated the distribution of photosynthetic products to reproductive organs which increased the boll number per plant by 7 30 25 10 thus increasing the boll loading of fine root system and seed cotton yield however compared with conventional drip irrigation over irrigation led to excessive vegetative growth of cotton under excessive drip irrigation which resulted in the decrease of boll opening rate and seed cotton yield by 8 71 17 19 and 14 14 24 27 respectively moreover the smaller r s at the late growth stage enabled conventional drip irrigation to achieve the maximum water use efficiency wue therefore mulched drip irrigation promoted the root growth of cotton and inhibited the vigorous vegetative growth of shoot before the prophase full boll stage and then reduced the growth redundancy of root and increased the productive capacity of the fine root system after the prophase full boll stage which increased boll number per plant and yield however only under the appropriate irrigation amount 390 mm mulched drip irrigation can increase both yield and wue thus achieving the goal of water saving and high yield cultivation keywords mulched drip irrigation cotton root growth root shoot ratio growth redundancy 1 introduction xinjiang is the largest arid region in china and its agricultural production is totally dependent on irrigation wang et al 2011a the shortage of water resources has restricted the development of agriculture in this area cotton gossypium hirsutum l is the most important cash crop in xinjiang since the mid 1980s with the application of plastic film mulching cultivation technology cotton yield has increased rapidly lou 1989 liu et al 2014 however traditional flood irrigation method is still used in cotton irrigation the characteristics of traditional flood irrigation with large amount of water poor uniformity of irrigation water and difficult to control water volume and large evaporation capacity in the field easily lead to soil hardening and secondary salinization resulting in lower yield and water use efficiency mitchell and van genuchten 1993 shan et al 2004 hu et al 2016 drip irrigation is considered to be the most effective water saving method which can effectively maintain the soil aggregate structure prevent deep water leakage and surface loss and reduce the risk of soil degradation and salinization batchelor et al 1996 ayars et al 1999 karlberg and frits 2004 wang et al 2011a compared with flood irrigation drip irrigation increased cotton yields by about 25 percent and saved water by 40 50 percent ward and pulido velazquez 2008 since the late 1990s a precision irrigation technology called mulched drip irrigation has been developed by combining drip irrigation and mulching with plastic film in xinjiang this technology can not only increase soil temperature preserve soil moisture and reduce surface evaporation but also can regularly and quantitatively infiltrate the growth area of crop root system and improve yield and water use efficiency zhang et al 2003 2011 dai and dong 2014 therefore mulched drip irrigation has been widely applied in xinjiang root system is an important organ for crops to absorb water and nutrients and plays a vital role in soil plant interactions gregory 2006 zhang et al 2009 chen et al 2018 the distribution and content of water in the soil affect the morphological structure physiological function and water absorption characteristics of crop roots thus affecting the formation of yield hu et al 2009 chen et al 2018 a well developed root morphology and distribution are critical to increasing irrigation water productivity and crop yields min et al 2014 feng et al 2017 previous studies have shown that within the range of 75 field water capacity the root growth rate of mulched drip irrigation cotton is fast during the whole growth period and the root dry weight and yield are finally larger hu et al 2009 yield formation of cotton was significantly influenced by vegetative and reproductive growth as well as the relationship between roots and aboveground organs dong et al 2014 only a reasonable structure of root and shoot can support a high yield plaut et al 1987 dong et al 2014 mulched drip irrigation can effectively control the water supply change the distribution of water in the soil layer goldberg et al 1976 sampathkumar et al 2012 regulate the growth of cotton root system and thus affect the yield formation gao et al 2014 chen et al 2018 under the natural conditions of the field the root system and the vegetative organ of the plant have a lot of growth redundancy donald and hamblin 1983 sheng 1990 this growth redundancy consumes material and energy leading to a decline in economic output mccree 1986 sheng 1990 ma et al 2018 especially cotton is a crop with unlimited growth habit the vegetative growth grows with the reproductive growth for a long time wang and yin 2015 excessive water and fertilizer will lead to the vigorous growth of stems leaves and other vegetative organs of cotton resulting in unneeded growth of plant height and leaf area sheng 1990 growth redundancy of vegetative organs inhibits the reproductive growth and prolongs the growth period which is not conducive to the formation of economic yield cai et al 2002 he et al 2010 yi et al 2011 however crop yield can be enhanced by reasonably reducing the growth redundancy of root system and aboveground vegetative organ through agricultural cultivation techniques han et al 2005 ma et al 2018 for example alternate partial root zone drip irrigation can increase the transport of photosynthetic products to boll and reduce the growth redundancy of stem and leaf thus increasing the cotton yield du et al 2008 it is clear that reducing the useless assimilate and water consumption of the plant will be good for the increase in yield and water use efficiency by minimizing growth redundancy of root and shoot therefore we speculated that compared with traditional flood irrigation the water saving and high yield of mulched drip irrigation might be closely related to the reduction of the growth redundancy of cotton root and shoot however further study is required to determine how mulched drip irrigation affects soil water distribution regulates root growth and coordinates the relationship between cotton root and shoot to test our hypotheses a comparative study was conducted between mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation the primary objective of this study was to determine whether mulched drip irrigation could achieve high efficiency water saving and yield of cotton by influencing root characteristics and adjusting root and shoot growth the research results are of great significance to the development of water saving and high yield cultivation measures for irrigated cotton in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted

experiment each irrigation method had two irrigation amounts 390 mm 600 mm there were four treatments in total namely conventional drip irrigation di 3 irrigation amount 390 mm the amount of water from mulched drip irrigation in field production at present excessive drip irrigation di 6 irrigation amount 600 mm the amount of water from traditional flood irrigation in field production conventional flood irrigation fi 6 irrigation amount 600 mm the amount of water from traditional flood irrigation in field production reduced flood irrigation fi 3 irrigation amount 390 mm the amount of water from mulched drip irrigation in field production at present four treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with three replicates and the irrigation time was the same as the local production deng et al 2013 mai et al 2014 in order to keep the same seedling emergence rate between mulched drip irrigation zhang et al 2003 and traditional flood irrigation zhang et al 2014 the water used for seedling emergence in all test plots was provided by drip irrigation zhang et al 2014 subsequently drip irrigation continued to be used in mulched drip irrigation treatment while the drip lines in traditional flood irrigation treatment were removed during the whole growth period mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation were the same as the irrigation methods in field production and the irrigation times were 7 and 4 times respectively excluding the water used for seedling emergence table 1 before irrigation ridges 30 cm high were built around the plots of traditional flood irrigation to prevent water from flowing out at the beginning of irrigation the water was piped into a canal next to the plots of traditional flood irrigation and then flowed into the plots in the process of flowing over the plastic mulch water used its own gravity to slowly flow from the membrane holes and no mulch zone into the soil around the roots of the crops for irrigation fig 3 to prevent the movement of water and fertilizer between the mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation plots plastic film 70 cm width and 1 6 mm thickness was completely buried between the plots before planting gossypium hirsutum l xinluzao 45 was sown on 21 april 2017 and 2018 harvested on 3 october 2017 and 10 october 2018 for mulched drip irrigation drip lines were set following one mulch two drip lines and four rows of cotton plants which indicated that there were two drip lines beneath each mulch and each mulch contained four rows of cotton plants fig 2 the planting mode of traditional flood irrigation was the same as mulched drip irrigation but there were no drip lines fig 3 the total amount of fertilizer applied during the growing season in each

applied before planting the base fertilizers were urea 46 n triple superphosphate 46 p2o5 the remainder of the fertilizer i e 80 of the n 54 of the p2o5 and 100 of the k2o was applied as topdressing the topdressing fertilizer was added to the irrigation water in the mulched drip irrigation treatment in contrast topdressing fertilizer was placed in shallow furrows and then covered with soil before the irrigation water was applied in the traditional flood irrigation treatment the topdressing fertilizers were urea 46 n monopotassium phosphate 52 p2o5 and 34 6 k2o specific information about the irrigation date irrigation amount and topdressing fertilizer amount are presented in table 1 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 root length and biomass root samples were collected five times at full

above ground growth conditions at the selected plot figs 2 and 3 in total 20 monoliths were collected for the four cotton plants of each plot the root system was separated into coarse roots diameter 2 mm and fine roots diameter 2 mm jones et al 2009 roumet et al 2016 roots were washed placed onto a mesh tray filled with distilled water and spread out to avoid any overlap between roots and then scanned using a flatbed scanner 300 dpi root images were analyzed using winrhizo image analysis software winrhizo version 2009 regent instrument quebec canada to obtain the root length the roots of each soil layer were oven dried at 70 c for 48 h and then weighed 2 3 2 aboveground biomass and yield traits samples were collected five times at full bud stage full flowering stage prophase full boll

into stems leaves buds and bolls and the boll number per plant were counted the cotton stem leaf bud and boll were respectively put in paper bags and dried at 105 c for 30 min then oven dried at 80 c for 48 h and weighed for estimating biomass three representative sample points were randomly selected for each treatment during the harvest period the total number of plants bolls and opened bolls per unit area of each sampling point were investigated in each plot 30 cotton bolls were selected from the 2nd lower branch the 4th 5th middle branch and the 6th 8th upper branch in the 1 st fruit node to estimate average boll weight seed cotton yield was harvested from each plot to calculate crop yield 2 3 3 specific root length and fine root mass fraction specific root length srl m g 1 refers to root length per unit root biomass a trait which characterizes the economical aspects of a root system ryser 2006 ostonen et al 2007 in this experiment the srl at the level of fine roots was analyzed the ratio of fine root mass to total plant mass is fine root mass fraction frmf g g 1 it reflects whether a plant will invest more biomass in the organ responsible for obtaining a certain resource when it is limited by that resource poorter and ryser 2015 freschet et al 2015 2 3 4 root shoot ratio and boll loading of fine root system root shoot ratio r s was calculated using the following equation 1 r s rb ab where rb is the root biomass and ab is aboveground biomass in this experiment the r s was obtained at the full bud stage full flowering stage prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage in 2017 and 2018 respectively the productive capacity of the fine root biomass was measured according to wu et al 1992 as follows 2 blfr bn frb where blfr is the boll loading of fine root system bn is the boll number per plant and frb is the fine root biomass per plant in this experiment the blfr was obtained at the prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage in 2017 and 2018 respectively 2 3 5 water use efficiency cotton total evapotranspiration et mm was calculated during the cotton growing season using the water balance equation as follows zhang et al 2019 3 et p i cr rf dp δs where et is the total evapotranspiration mm during the growing season p is the total precipitation mm i is the irrigation water amount mm cr is capillary rise mm rf is the runoff mm dp is the percolation mm and δs is the change in soil water storage at planting and harvesting mm in eq 3 cr is considered to be zero because the groundwater table depth is consistently below 20 m runoff is also considered to be insignificant because all the experimental plots were flat and dp is assumed negligible because the soil water content below 80 cm did not reach field capacity fc on any sampling date water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as the ratio of seed cotton yield to the total evapotranspiration for the whole season du et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 4 wue y et where y is the seed cotton yield kg ha 1 et is the total evapotranspiration for the whole season mm 2 3 6 statistical analysis all data were analyzed with spss 17 0 statistical software spss inc chicago il usa the least significant difference lsd at the probability level of p 0 05 was used for the mean comparisons fitting equation and drawing figures were conducted with sigmaplot 12 5 systat software san jose ca 3 results 3 1 effect on yield components and water use efficiency wue of cotton in the harvest period the boll number per plant total bolls boll weight seed

boll weight seed cotton yield and wue of di 3 increased by 11 21 25 10 0 92 35 10 16 52 33 72 and 45 58 76 59 respectively the difference in boll opening rate was not significant in addition compared with traditional flood irrigation the boll number per plant of excessive drip irrigation di 6 increased by 7 30 20 41 but there was no significant difference in seed cotton yield the wue of di 6 was significantly smaller than that of reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 but the difference between di 6 and conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 was not significant under the same irrigation method compared with di 6 the boll number per plant boll opening rate boll weight seed cotton yield and wue of di 3 increased by 3 65 3 89 9 54 20 76 1 54 6 38 16 47 32 05 and 63 0 88 00 respectively the differences between di 3 and di 6 in boll weight boll opening rate yield and wue were significant but the difference in boll number per plant was not significant this result indicated that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase the boll number per plant and seed cotton yield mulched drip irrigation achieved the maximum yield and wue when the irrigation volume was 390 mm 3 2 effect on fine root length frl and fine root biomass frb under different irrigation methods mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 showed higher frl and frb than traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage figs 4 and 5 the frl and frb of conventional drip irrigation di 3 were larger than reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 at the late full boll stage and showed a decreasing trend in 2018 additionally the frl and frb of excessive drip irrigation di 6 were larger than conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 in 2017 and smaller than fi 6 in 2018 and showed a downward trend in two years when entering the boll opening stage mulched drip irrigation showed a rapid decrease in frl and frb under the same irrigation method with the increase of irrigation amount the frl and frb of di 6 were smaller than that of di 3 at the late full boll stage however there was an inter annual difference at the prophase full boll stage that is the frl and frb of di 6 were greater than di 3 in 2017 and less than di 3 in 2018 this result showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase the frl and frb at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage in addition with the increase of irrigation amount the frl and frb of excessive drip irrigation were lower than that of conventional drip irrigation at the late full boll stage 3 3 effect on specific root length srl under different irrigation methods the specific root length srl of mulched drip irrigation cotton di 3 and di 6 was higher than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage table 3 however the srl of conventional drip irrigation di 3 was smaller than that of reduced flood irrigation fi 3 and the srl of excessive drip irrigation di 6 was larger than that of conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage under the same irrigation method with the increase of irrigation water the srl of di 3 was greater than di 6 at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage and less than di 6 at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage the higher srl of plant root system the more efficient utilization of photosynthetic carbon sources freschet et al 2015 and higher foraging ability of the root system roumet et al 2016 became in the short term this result indicated that the fine roots of conventional drip irrigation cotton had a strong ability to utilize the photosynthetic carbon source at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage but the ability to utilize the photosynthetic carbon source decreased at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage 3 4 effect on fine root mass fraction frmf under different irrigation methods the fine root mass fraction frmf of mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was higher than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the prophase full boll stage fig 6 and lower than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage under the same irrigation methods the frmf of excessive drip irrigation di 6 was greater than conventional drip irrigation di 3 at the prophase full boll stage and there was no difference at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage in addition there was no significant difference in frmf between conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 and reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 at the full flowering stage prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage this result showed that the frmf of mulched drip irrigation was greater than that of traditional flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage and less than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage with the increase of irrigation amount the frmf of excessive drip irrigation was higher than that of conventional drip irrigation at the prophase full boll stage but there was no significant difference at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage 3 5 effect on root shoot ratio r s under different irrigation methods the root shoot ratio r s of mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was larger than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage while the r s was smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage table 4 under the same irrigation method with the increase of irrigation amount the r s of excessive drip irrigation di 6 was less than conventional drip irrigation di 3 at the full flowering stage but greater than di 3 at the prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage the r s of conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 was larger than that of reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 at the prophase full boll stage and smaller than that of fi 3 at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage statistical analysis showed that the r s was negatively correlated with reproductive organ biomass boll number per plant and yield figs 7 and 8 that is the biomass of reproductive organs boll number per plant and yield increased with the decrease of r s in addition r s was negatively correlated with wue fig 8 when r s was less than 0 097 wue decreased with the increase of r s however when the r s was greater than 0 097 wue increased with the increase of r s this result indicated that mulched drip irrigation had a large r s at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage which promoted the transfer of photosynthetic products to underground roots and was beneficial to root growth and development however the r s of mulched drip irrigation decreased at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage which reduced the distribution of assimilates to the root system and thus decreased the growth redundancy of root 3 6 effect on boll loading of fine root system blfr under different irrigation methods the boll loading of fine root system blfr of mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the prophase full boll stage and larger than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage table 5 compared with other treatments the blfr of conventional drip irrigation di 3 was the largest at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage specifically compared with reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 and excessive drip irrigation di 6 the blfr of di 3 increased by 23 56 30 12 8 43 12 39 and 7 06 8 54 at the late full boll stage and increased by 40 55 60 02 34 84 71 49 and 19 19 at the boll opening stage respectively this result showed that the blfr of mulched drip irrigation was lower than that of traditional flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage but higher than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage furthermore conventional drip irrigation had the highest blfr at the late stage of cotton growth 4 discussion 4 1 the dynamics of root growth under different irrigation methods the growth and function of the root system are considered to be an important part of crop growth and yield palta and yang 2014 wang et al 2018 hirte et al 2018 fine roots diameter 2 mm are the most physiologically active part of the underground plant system jackson et al 1990 eissenstat 1992 and their functional characteristics are closely related to the acquisition of water and nutrients resources mccormack et al 2015 roumet et al 2016 the larger root biomass and length can increase the water and nutrient supply of plants so that crops can better adapt to semi arid environment fageria 2004 palta and watt 2009 our results showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation conventional flood irrigation and reduced flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation could regulate the distribution of water in the soil fig s1 and table s1 increase the fine root length frl and fine root biomass frb at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage figs 4 and 5 this was beneficial to the absorption of water and nutrients in the reproductive growth stage of cotton the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage of cotton are two flourishing periods for the vegetative and reproductive growth and also the periods when cotton needs the most water and fertilizer wang and yin 2015 mulched drip irrigation had higher soil water content table s1 compared with traditional flood irrigation the soil moisture content of 0 60 cm in mulched drip irrigation increased by 4 80 12 87 from the full flowering stage to prophase full boll stage which provided favorable environmental conditions for root growth and improved the specific root length srl at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage table 3 ostonen et al 2007 larson and funk 2016 ahmadi et al 2018 higher srl enhanced the ability of roots to utilize photosynthetic carbon sources ryser 2006 freschet et al 2015 which contributed to the formation of frl and frb at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage and increased the absorption of water and nutrients however the vegetative growth of cotton gradually weakens and the demand for water is relatively reduced when entering into the late full boll stage and boll opening stage which are two important periods to increase the boll weight and improve the quality of cotton wang and yin 2015 for most annual plants when plants enter the reproductive growth stage the amount of assimilates transported from the ground to the root system will be significantly reduced resulting in a downward trend in root length wiesler and horst 1993 eissenstat et al 2000 wang et al 2009 in our field experiment compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation rapidly decreased the frb and fine root mass fraction frmf at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage figs 5 and 6 and the absorption capacity of roots was weakened which led to the premature senility of roots this was because the boll number per plant under mulched drip irrigation increased significantly at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage table s2 resulting in a large amount of nutrients and photosynthetic products being transported to the reproductive organs subsequently the amount of carbohydrate transported to the root from the aboveground was decreased mai et al 2012 2014 which reduced the ability of the root system to utilize photosynthetic carbon sources thus inhibiting the growth of fine roots and causing premature senility of roots in addition compared with conventional drip irrigation the excessive soil water content of excessive drip irrigation table s1 compared with conventional drip irrigation the soil moisture content of 0 60 cm in excessive drip irrigation increased by 6 61 8 21 after the prophase full boll stage limited the growth of primary roots and accelerated the attenuation of roots rich and watt 2013 resulting in a significantly larger decline in frb in the late growth stage furthermore premature senility of roots reduced the ability of cotton roots to absorb water and nutrients however the demand for water and fertilizer at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage was decreased wang and yin 2015 so the maintenance of excessive root system might result in energy waste mccree 1986 previous studies have shown that up to 70 of photosynthetic productivity can be allocated to plant roots litton et al 2007 poorter et al 2012 in which 40 of the fixed net c was allocated to fine roots jones et al 2009 therefore premature senility of roots caused by mulched drip irrigation in the late growth period might be beneficial to the cotton region in xinjiang where the temperature in the late growth period was low fig 1 and the growth period of cotton was limited this was because the cotton plant transferred the photosynthetic products that were originally allocated to the root system to the aboveground portion in time reducing the energy consumption required to maintain growth redundancy of root 4 2 effect of the characteristics of root and shoot on seed cotton yield the root system and the aboveground portion of cotton plants are a unified whole gregory and eastham 1996 and the root shoot ratio r s reflects the coordination of root and shoot growth lloret et al 1999 this study showed that the r s was closely related to the biomass of reproductive organs boll number per plant and yield the three indexes mentioned above increased with the decrease of r s figs 7 and 8 the dynamic change of boll loading of fine root system blfr can reveal the inevitable relationship between cotton root growth and boll number growth and the coordination degree between root growth and reproductive organ growth can be understood through this index wu et al 1992 the results of this study showed that the blfr of mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation was smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation conventional flood irrigation and reduced flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage table 5 this was because the higher soil water content under the mulched drip irrigation table s1 compared with traditional flood irrigation the soil moisture content of 0 60 cm in mulched drip irrigation increased by 4 80 12 87 from the full flowering stage to prophase full boll stage promoted the growth and development of fine roots at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage figs 4 and 5 lu et al 2014 and improved the r s table 4 apparently the increase of r s inhibited the reproductive organs growth and boll formation in the aboveground part fig 7 and decreased the blfr of mulched drip irrigation at the prophase full boll stage table 5 however the blfr of mulched drip irrigation was larger than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage the main reason was that the growth of fine roots under mulched drip irrigation slowed down or reduced at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage resulting in a lower r s table 4 the smaller r s reduced the distribution of assimilates to the root system thus reducing the growth redundancy of root and promoting the distribution of photosynthetic products to the reproductive organs at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage fig 7 and table s2 therefore mulched drip irrigation coordinated the vegetative growth and reproductive growth of cotton plants at the later stage of growth and increased the boll number per plant and productive capacity of the fine root system thus increasing the yield in addition there was no significant difference in boll number per plant between conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation but the seed cotton yield of conventional drip irrigation was significantly higher than that of excessive drip irrigation table 2 when the irrigation water of 600 mm from conventional flood irrigation was put into the soil through mulched drip irrigation the way of water entering the soil changed from uneven infiltration into the soil to point source emitter subsequently water diffused in all directions forming a narrow and deep humid zone wang et al 2011b chen et al 2018 resulting in the soil water content of 0 60 cm in the root area of excessive drip irrigation being greater than that of conventional drip irrigation table s1 compared with conventional drip irrigation the soil moisture content of 0 60 cm in excessive drip irrigation increased by 6 57 9 17 after the late full boll stage as a result excessive water resulted in extended growth and delayed maturity of cotton plants under excessive drip irrigation cai et al 2002 which led to maladjustment of vegetative growth and reproductive growth and significantly reduced the boll opening rate and seed cotton yield table 2 the results showed that excessive irrigation amount was not conducive to the increase of cotton economic yield under mulched drip irrigation cai et al 2002 therefore it was concluded that mulched drip irrigation could increase yield by increasing boll number per plant and boll weight under suitable irrigation amount 390 mm water use efficiency wue is an indicator to characterize the relationship between crop production and water consumption and also one of the comprehensive indicators to evaluate the suitability of plant growth under water deficit du et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 the relationship between above and below ground not only determines the formation of crop yield but also greatly affects the wue of crops this study showed that the r s was closely related to the wue in a certain range wue decreased with the increase of r s however when the r s exceeded a certain critical value 0 097 wue increased with the increase of r s fig 8 when the irrigation amount was 390 mm the r s of mulched drip irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage was the minimum table 4 thus obtaining the maximum wue table 2 5 conclusions compared with traditional flood irrigation conventional flood irrigation and reduced flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation had a larger specific root length srl at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage and the root system had a stronger ability to utilize carbon source of photosynthetic products this characteristic promoted root growth and development of cotton under mulched drip irrigation increased the root shoot ratio r s and was useful to control the vigorous vegetative growth of the aboveground parts however mulched drip irrigation reduced the fine root biomass and fine root mass fraction at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage then inhibited the growth of fine roots and reduced the r s the smaller r s was beneficial to reduce the growth redundancy of root under mulched drip irrigation and promote the distribution of photosynthetic products to reproductive organs which significantly increased the boll number per plant and boll loading of fine root system additionally excessive drip irrigation resulted in excess vegetative growth at the later stage of growth which decreased the boll opening rate and the seed cotton yield was significantly lower than that of conventional drip irrigation furthermore compared with traditional flood irrigation and excessive drip irrigation the smaller r s at the late growth stage of conventional drip irrigation achieved the maximum water use efficiency wue therefore mulched drip irrigation coordinated the growth of root and shoot by regulating the growth of cotton roots thus reducing the growth redundancy of root and shoot and increasing the productive capacity of the fine root system furthermore mulched drip irrigation coordinated vegetative and reproductive growth and had the potential to increase cotton yield by increasing the boll number per plant however for mulched drip irrigation maximum yield and wue can only be obtained at the appropriate irrigation

10643,mulched drip irrigation is a common water saving irrigation technology that can improve water resource utilization efficiency in arid areas the change of irrigation method affects the growth of crop root system and then regulates the growth of aboveground organs however there have been limited comparative studies on how mulched drip irrigation affects the cotton root growth and regulates the relationship between cotton root and shoot the objective of this study was to determine whether mulched drip irrigation could achieve water saving and high yield cotton cultivation by regulating the growth redundancy of root and shoot under field conditions mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation conventional flood irrigation and reduced flood irrigation were used in this experiment traditional flood irrigation was used as the control group the results showed that compared with the traditional flood irrigation the higher soil water content under mulched drip irrigation increased the specific root length srl which promoted the growth of fine root length and biomass at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage the growth of fine roots increased the root shoot ratio r s of mulched drip irrigation and then inhibited the excessive vegetative growth of the aboveground parts when entering the late full boll stage and boll opening stage the fine root biomass and fine root mass fraction decreased rapidly under the mulched drip irrigation resulting in a lower r s the smaller r s of mulched drip irrigation facilitated the distribution of photosynthetic products to reproductive organs which increased the boll number per plant by 7 30 25 10 thus increasing the boll loading of fine root system and seed cotton yield however compared with conventional drip irrigation over irrigation led to excessive vegetative growth of cotton under excessive drip irrigation which resulted in the decrease of boll opening rate and seed cotton yield by 8 71 17 19 and 14 14 24 27 respectively moreover the smaller r s at the late growth stage enabled conventional drip irrigation to achieve the maximum water use efficiency wue therefore mulched drip irrigation promoted the root growth of cotton and inhibited the vigorous vegetative growth of shoot before the prophase full boll stage and then reduced the growth redundancy of root and increased the productive capacity of the fine root system after the prophase full boll stage which increased boll number per plant and yield however only under the appropriate irrigation amount 390 mm mulched drip irrigation can increase both yield and wue thus achieving the goal of water saving and high yield cultivation keywords mulched drip irrigation cotton root growth root shoot ratio growth redundancy 1 introduction xinjiang is the largest arid region in china and its agricultural production is totally dependent on irrigation wang et al 2011a the shortage of water resources has restricted the development of agriculture in this area cotton gossypium hirsutum l is the most important cash crop in xinjiang since the mid 1980s with the application of plastic film mulching cultivation technology cotton yield has increased rapidly lou 1989 liu et al 2014 however traditional flood irrigation method is still used in cotton irrigation the characteristics of traditional flood irrigation with large amount of water poor uniformity of irrigation water and difficult to control water volume and large evaporation capacity in the field easily lead to soil hardening and secondary salinization resulting in lower yield and water use efficiency mitchell and van genuchten 1993 shan et al 2004 hu et al 2016 drip irrigation is considered to be the most effective water saving method which can effectively maintain the soil aggregate structure prevent deep water leakage and surface loss and reduce the risk of soil degradation and salinization batchelor et al 1996 ayars et al 1999 karlberg and frits 2004 wang et al 2011a compared with flood irrigation drip irrigation increased cotton yields by about 25 percent and saved water by 40 50 percent ward and pulido velazquez 2008 since the late 1990s a precision irrigation technology called mulched drip irrigation has been developed by combining drip irrigation and mulching with plastic film in xinjiang this technology can not only increase soil temperature preserve soil moisture and reduce surface evaporation but also can regularly and quantitatively infiltrate the growth area of crop root system and improve yield and water use efficiency zhang et al 2003 2011 dai and dong 2014 therefore mulched drip irrigation has been widely applied in xinjiang root system is an important organ for crops to absorb water and nutrients and plays a vital role in soil plant interactions gregory 2006 zhang et al 2009 chen et al 2018 the distribution and content of water in the soil affect the morphological structure physiological function and water absorption characteristics of crop roots thus affecting the formation of yield hu et al 2009 chen et al 2018 a well developed root morphology and distribution are critical to increasing irrigation water productivity and crop yields min et al 2014 feng et al 2017 previous studies have shown that within the range of 75 field water capacity the root growth rate of mulched drip irrigation cotton is fast during the whole growth period and the root dry weight and yield are finally larger hu et al 2009 yield formation of cotton was significantly influenced by vegetative and reproductive growth as well as the relationship between roots and aboveground organs dong et al 2014 only a reasonable structure of root and shoot can support a high yield plaut et al 1987 dong et al 2014 mulched drip irrigation can effectively control the water supply change the distribution of water in the soil layer goldberg et al 1976 sampathkumar et al 2012 regulate the growth of cotton root system and thus affect the yield formation gao et al 2014 chen et al 2018 under the natural conditions of the field the root system and the vegetative organ of the plant have a lot of growth redundancy donald and hamblin 1983 sheng 1990 this growth redundancy consumes material and energy leading to a decline in economic output mccree 1986 sheng 1990 ma et al 2018 especially cotton is a crop with unlimited growth habit the vegetative growth grows with the reproductive growth for a long time wang and yin 2015 excessive water and fertilizer will lead to the vigorous growth of stems leaves and other vegetative organs of cotton resulting in unneeded growth of plant height and leaf area sheng 1990 growth redundancy of vegetative organs inhibits the reproductive growth and prolongs the growth period which is not conducive to the formation of economic yield cai et al 2002 he et al 2010 yi et al 2011 however crop yield can be enhanced by reasonably reducing the growth redundancy of root system and aboveground vegetative organ through agricultural cultivation techniques han et al 2005 ma et al 2018 for example alternate partial root zone drip irrigation can increase the transport of photosynthetic products to boll and reduce the growth redundancy of stem and leaf thus increasing the cotton yield du et al 2008 it is clear that reducing the useless assimilate and water consumption of the plant will be good for the increase in yield and water use efficiency by minimizing growth redundancy of root and shoot therefore we speculated that compared with traditional flood irrigation the water saving and high yield of mulched drip irrigation might be closely related to the reduction of the growth redundancy of cotton root and shoot however further study is required to determine how mulched drip irrigation affects soil water distribution regulates root growth and coordinates the relationship between cotton root and shoot to test our hypotheses a comparative study was conducted between mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation the primary objective of this study was to determine whether mulched drip irrigation could achieve high efficiency water saving and yield of cotton by influencing root characteristics and adjusting root and shoot growth the research results are of great significance to the development of water saving and high yield cultivation measures for irrigated cotton in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted

experiment each irrigation method had two irrigation amounts 390 mm 600 mm there were four treatments in total namely conventional drip irrigation di 3 irrigation amount 390 mm the amount of water from mulched drip irrigation in field production at present excessive drip irrigation di 6 irrigation amount 600 mm the amount of water from traditional flood irrigation in field production conventional flood irrigation fi 6 irrigation amount 600 mm the amount of water from traditional flood irrigation in field production reduced flood irrigation fi 3 irrigation amount 390 mm the amount of water from mulched drip irrigation in field production at present four treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with three replicates and the irrigation time was the same as the local production deng et al 2013 mai et al 2014 in order to keep the same seedling emergence rate between mulched drip irrigation zhang et al 2003 and traditional flood irrigation zhang et al 2014 the water used for seedling emergence in all test plots was provided by drip irrigation zhang et al 2014 subsequently drip irrigation continued to be used in mulched drip irrigation treatment while the drip lines in traditional flood irrigation treatment were removed during the whole growth period mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation were the same as the irrigation methods in field production and the irrigation times were 7 and 4 times respectively excluding the water used for seedling emergence table 1 before irrigation ridges 30 cm high were built around the plots of traditional flood irrigation to prevent water from flowing out at the beginning of irrigation the water was piped into a canal next to the plots of traditional flood irrigation and then flowed into the plots in the process of flowing over the plastic mulch water used its own gravity to slowly flow from the membrane holes and no mulch zone into the soil around the roots of the crops for irrigation fig 3 to prevent the movement of water and fertilizer between the mulched drip irrigation and traditional flood irrigation plots plastic film 70 cm width and 1 6 mm thickness was completely buried between the plots before planting gossypium hirsutum l xinluzao 45 was sown on 21 april 2017 and 2018 harvested on 3 october 2017 and 10 october 2018 for mulched drip irrigation drip lines were set following one mulch two drip lines and four rows of cotton plants which indicated that there were two drip lines beneath each mulch and each mulch contained four rows of cotton plants fig 2 the planting mode of traditional flood irrigation was the same as mulched drip irrigation but there were no drip lines fig 3 the total amount of fertilizer applied during the growing season in each irrigation treatment was n 400 kg ha 1 p2o5 218 kg ha 1 k2o 78 kg ha 1 and cottonseed cake 4500 kg ha 1 of these fertilizer amounts 20 of the n 46 of the p2o5 and 100 of the cottonseed cake were applied before planting the base fertilizers were urea 46 n triple superphosphate 46 p2o5 the remainder of the fertilizer i e 80 of the n 54 of the p2o5 and 100 of the k2o was applied as topdressing the topdressing fertilizer was added to the irrigation water in the mulched drip irrigation treatment in contrast topdressing fertilizer was placed in shallow furrows and then covered with soil before the irrigation water was applied in the traditional flood irrigation treatment the topdressing fertilizers were urea 46 n monopotassium phosphate 52 p2o5 and 34 6 k2o specific information about the irrigation date irrigation amount and topdressing fertilizer amount are presented in table 1 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 root length and biomass root samples were collected five times at full

and 141 in 2017 and 2018 respectively root samples were collected by the monolith method chen et al 2018 the spatial layout of root sampling was designed according to the cotton plant and drip line arrangements in the cotton field soil cubes with dimensions of 24 20 20 cm were dug individually in a soil volume of 24 80 cm and a depth of 100 cm surrounding four cotton plants which had similar above ground growth conditions at the selected plot figs 2 and 3 in total 20 monoliths were collected for the four cotton plants of each plot the root system was separated into coarse roots diameter 2 mm and fine roots diameter 2 mm jones et al 2009 roumet et al 2016 roots were washed placed onto a mesh tray filled with distilled water and spread out to avoid any overlap between roots and then scanned using a flatbed scanner 300 dpi root images were analyzed using winrhizo image analysis software winrhizo version 2009 regent instrument quebec canada to obtain the root length the roots of each soil layer were oven dried at 70 c for 48 h and then weighed 2 3 2 aboveground biomass and yield traits samples were collected five times at full bud stage full flowering stage prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage in 2017 and 2018 four cotton plants with similar growth rate were selected from each plot figs 2 and 3 the aboveground parts of the plant were divided into stems leaves buds and bolls and the boll number per plant were counted the cotton stem leaf bud and boll were respectively put in paper bags and dried at 105 c for 30 min then oven dried at 80 c for 48 h and weighed for estimating biomass three representative sample points were randomly selected for each treatment during the harvest period the total number of plants bolls and opened bolls per unit area of each sampling point were investigated in each plot 30 cotton bolls were selected from the 2nd lower branch the 4th 5th middle branch and the 6th 8th upper branch in the 1 st fruit node to estimate average boll weight seed cotton yield was harvested from each plot to calculate crop yield 2 3 3 specific root length and fine root mass fraction specific root length srl m g 1 refers to root length per unit root biomass a trait which characterizes the economical aspects of a root system ryser 2006 ostonen et al 2007 in this experiment the srl at the level of fine roots was analyzed the ratio of fine root mass to total plant mass is fine root mass fraction frmf g g 1 it reflects whether a plant will invest more biomass in the organ responsible for obtaining a certain resource when it is limited by that resource poorter and ryser 2015 freschet et al 2015 2 3 4 root shoot ratio and boll loading of fine root system root shoot ratio r s was calculated using the following equation 1 r s rb ab where rb is the root biomass and ab is aboveground biomass in this experiment the r s was obtained at the full bud stage full flowering stage prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage in 2017 and 2018 respectively the productive capacity of the fine root biomass was measured according to wu et al 1992 as follows 2 blfr bn frb where blfr is the boll loading of fine root system bn is the boll number per plant and frb is the fine root biomass per plant in this experiment the blfr was obtained at the prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage in 2017 and 2018 respectively 2 3 5 water use efficiency cotton total evapotranspiration et mm was calculated during the cotton growing season using the water balance equation as follows zhang et al 2019 3 et p i cr rf dp δs where et is the total evapotranspiration mm during the growing season p is the total precipitation mm i is the irrigation water amount mm cr is capillary rise mm rf is the runoff mm dp is the percolation mm and δs is the change in soil water storage at planting and harvesting mm in eq 3 cr is considered to be zero because the groundwater table depth is consistently below 20 m runoff is also considered to be insignificant because all the experimental plots were flat and dp is assumed negligible because the soil water content below 80 cm did not reach field capacity fc on any sampling date water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as the ratio of seed cotton yield to the total evapotranspiration for the whole season du et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 4 wue y et where y is the seed cotton yield kg ha 1 et is the total evapotranspiration for the whole season mm 2 3 6 statistical analysis all data were analyzed with spss 17 0 statistical software spss inc chicago il usa the least significant difference lsd at the probability level of p 0 05 was used for the mean comparisons fitting equation and drawing figures were conducted with sigmaplot 12 5 systat software san jose ca 3 results 3 1 effect on yield components and water use efficiency wue of cotton in the harvest period the boll number per plant total bolls boll weight seed

boll weight seed cotton yield and wue of di 3 increased by 11 21 25 10 0 92 35 10 16 52 33 72 and 45 58 76 59 respectively the difference in boll opening rate was not significant in addition compared with traditional flood irrigation the boll number per plant of excessive drip irrigation di 6 increased by 7 30 20 41 but there was no significant difference in seed cotton yield the wue of di 6 was significantly smaller than that of reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 but the difference between di 6 and conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 was not significant under the same irrigation method compared with di 6 the boll number per plant boll opening rate boll weight seed cotton yield and wue of di 3 increased by 3 65 3 89 9 54 20 76 1 54 6 38 16 47 32 05 and 63 0 88 00 respectively the differences between di 3 and di 6 in boll weight boll opening rate yield and wue were significant but the difference in boll number per plant was not significant this result indicated that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase the boll number per plant and seed cotton yield mulched drip irrigation achieved the maximum yield and wue when the irrigation volume was 390 mm 3 2 effect on fine root length frl and fine root biomass frb under different irrigation methods mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 showed higher frl and frb than traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage figs 4 and 5 the frl and frb of conventional drip irrigation di 3 were larger than reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 at the late full boll stage and showed a decreasing trend in 2018 additionally the frl and frb of excessive drip irrigation di 6 were larger than conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 in 2017 and smaller than fi 6 in 2018 and showed a downward trend in two years when entering the boll opening stage mulched drip irrigation showed a rapid decrease in frl and frb under the same irrigation method with the increase of irrigation amount the frl and frb of di 6 were smaller than that of di 3 at the late full boll stage however there was an inter annual difference at the prophase full boll stage that is the frl and frb of di 6 were greater than di 3 in 2017 and less than di 3 in 2018 this result showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation was beneficial to increase the frl and frb at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage in addition with the increase of irrigation amount the frl and frb of excessive drip irrigation were lower than that of conventional drip irrigation at the late full boll stage 3 3 effect on specific root length srl under different irrigation methods the specific root length srl of mulched drip irrigation cotton di 3 and di 6 was higher than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage table 3 however the srl of conventional drip irrigation di 3 was smaller than that of reduced flood irrigation fi 3 and the srl of excessive drip irrigation di 6 was larger than that of conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage under the same irrigation method with the increase of irrigation water the srl of di 3 was greater than di 6 at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage and less than di 6 at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage the higher srl of plant root system the more efficient utilization of photosynthetic carbon sources freschet et al 2015 and higher foraging ability of the root system roumet et al 2016 became in the short term this result indicated that the fine roots of conventional drip irrigation cotton had a strong ability to utilize the photosynthetic carbon source at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage but the ability to utilize the photosynthetic carbon source decreased at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage 3 4 effect on fine root mass fraction frmf under different irrigation methods the fine root mass fraction frmf of mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was higher than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the prophase full boll stage fig 6 and lower than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage under the same irrigation methods the frmf of excessive drip irrigation di 6 was greater than conventional drip irrigation di 3 at the prophase full boll stage and there was no difference at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage in addition there was no significant difference in frmf between conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 and reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 at the full flowering stage prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage this result showed that the frmf of mulched drip irrigation was greater than that of traditional flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage and less than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage with the increase of irrigation amount the frmf of excessive drip irrigation was higher than that of conventional drip irrigation at the prophase full boll stage but there was no significant difference at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage 3 5 effect on root shoot ratio r s under different irrigation methods the root shoot ratio r s of mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was larger than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage while the r s was smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage table 4 under the same irrigation method with the increase of irrigation amount the r s of excessive drip irrigation di 6 was less than conventional drip irrigation di 3 at the full flowering stage but greater than di 3 at the prophase full boll stage late full boll stage and boll opening stage the r s of conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 was larger than that of reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 at the prophase full boll stage and smaller than that of fi 3 at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage statistical analysis showed that the r s was negatively correlated with reproductive organ biomass boll number per plant and yield figs 7 and 8 that is the biomass of reproductive organs boll number per plant and yield increased with the decrease of r s in addition r s was negatively correlated with wue fig 8 when r s was less than 0 097 wue decreased with the increase of r s however when the r s was greater than 0 097 wue increased with the increase of r s this result indicated that mulched drip irrigation had a large r s at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage which promoted the transfer of photosynthetic products to underground roots and was beneficial to root growth and development however the r s of mulched drip irrigation decreased at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage which reduced the distribution of assimilates to the root system and thus decreased the growth redundancy of root 3 6 effect on boll loading of fine root system blfr under different irrigation methods the boll loading of fine root system blfr of mulched drip irrigation di 3 and di 6 was smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation fi 3 and fi 6 at the prophase full boll stage and larger than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage table 5 compared with other treatments the blfr of conventional drip irrigation di 3 was the largest at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage specifically compared with reduced flooding irrigation fi 3 conventional flooding irrigation fi 6 and excessive drip irrigation di 6 the blfr of di 3 increased by 23 56 30 12 8 43 12 39 and 7 06 8 54 at the late full boll stage and increased by 40 55 60 02 34 84 71 49 and 19 19 at the boll opening stage respectively this result showed that the blfr of mulched drip irrigation was lower than that of traditional flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage but higher than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage furthermore conventional drip irrigation had the highest blfr at the late stage of cotton growth 4 discussion 4 1 the dynamics of root growth under different irrigation methods the growth and function of the root system are considered to be an important part of crop growth and yield palta and yang 2014 wang et al 2018 hirte et al 2018 fine roots diameter 2 mm are the most physiologically active part of the underground plant system jackson et al 1990 eissenstat 1992 and their functional characteristics are closely related to the acquisition of water and nutrients resources mccormack et al 2015 roumet et al 2016 the larger root biomass and length can increase the water and nutrient supply of plants so that crops can better adapt to semi arid environment fageria 2004 palta and watt 2009 our results showed that compared with traditional flood irrigation conventional flood irrigation and reduced flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation could regulate the distribution of water in the soil fig s1 and table s1 increase the fine root length frl and fine root biomass frb at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage figs 4 and 5 this was beneficial to the absorption of water and nutrients in the reproductive growth stage of cotton the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage of cotton are two flourishing periods for the vegetative and reproductive growth and also the periods when cotton needs the most water and fertilizer wang and yin 2015 mulched drip irrigation had higher soil water content table s1 compared with traditional flood irrigation the soil moisture content of 0 60 cm in mulched drip irrigation increased by 4 80 12 87 from the full flowering stage to prophase full boll stage which provided favorable environmental conditions for root growth and improved the specific root length srl at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage table 3 ostonen et al 2007 larson and funk 2016 ahmadi et al 2018 higher srl enhanced the ability of roots to utilize photosynthetic carbon sources ryser 2006 freschet et al 2015 which contributed to the formation of frl and frb at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage and increased the absorption of water and nutrients however the vegetative growth of cotton gradually weakens and the demand for water is relatively reduced when entering into the late full boll stage and boll opening stage which are two important periods to increase the boll weight and improve the quality of cotton wang and yin 2015 for most annual plants when plants enter the reproductive growth stage the amount of assimilates transported from the ground to the root system will be significantly reduced resulting in a downward trend in root length wiesler and horst 1993 eissenstat et al 2000 wang et al 2009 in our field experiment compared with traditional flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation rapidly decreased the frb and fine root mass fraction frmf at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage figs 5 and 6 and the absorption capacity of roots was weakened which led to the premature senility of roots this was because the boll number per plant under mulched drip irrigation increased significantly at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage table s2 resulting in a large amount of nutrients and photosynthetic products being transported to the reproductive organs subsequently the amount of carbohydrate transported to the root from the aboveground was decreased mai et al 2012 2014 which reduced the ability of the root system to utilize photosynthetic carbon sources thus inhibiting the growth of fine roots and causing premature senility of roots in addition compared with conventional drip irrigation the excessive soil water content of excessive drip irrigation table s1 compared with conventional drip irrigation the soil moisture content of 0 60 cm in excessive drip irrigation increased by 6 61 8 21 after the prophase full boll stage limited the growth of primary roots and accelerated the attenuation of roots rich and watt 2013 resulting in a significantly larger decline in frb in the late growth stage furthermore premature senility of roots reduced the ability of cotton roots to absorb water and nutrients however the demand for water and fertilizer at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage was decreased wang and yin 2015 so the maintenance of excessive root system might result in energy waste mccree 1986 previous studies have shown that up to 70 of photosynthetic productivity can be allocated to plant roots litton et al 2007 poorter et al 2012 in which 40 of the fixed net c was allocated to fine roots jones et al 2009 therefore premature senility of roots caused by mulched drip irrigation in the late growth period might be beneficial to the cotton region in xinjiang where the temperature in the late growth period was low fig 1 and the growth period of cotton was limited this was because the cotton plant transferred the photosynthetic products that were originally allocated to the root system to the aboveground portion in time reducing the energy consumption required to maintain growth redundancy of root 4 2 effect of the characteristics of root and shoot on seed cotton yield the root system and the aboveground portion of cotton plants are a unified whole gregory and eastham 1996 and the root shoot ratio r s reflects the coordination of root and shoot growth lloret et al 1999 this study showed that the r s was closely related to the biomass of reproductive organs boll number per plant and yield the three indexes mentioned above increased with the decrease of r s figs 7 and 8 the dynamic change of boll loading of fine root system blfr can reveal the inevitable relationship between cotton root growth and boll number growth and the coordination degree between root growth and reproductive organ growth can be understood through this index wu et al 1992 the results of this study showed that the blfr of mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation was smaller than that of traditional flood irrigation conventional flood irrigation and reduced flood irrigation at the prophase full boll stage table 5 this was because the higher soil water content under the mulched drip irrigation table s1 compared with traditional flood irrigation the soil moisture content of 0 60 cm in mulched drip irrigation increased by 4 80 12 87 from the full flowering stage to prophase full boll stage promoted the growth and development of fine roots at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage figs 4 and 5 lu et al 2014 and improved the r s table 4 apparently the increase of r s inhibited the reproductive organs growth and boll formation in the aboveground part fig 7 and decreased the blfr of mulched drip irrigation at the prophase full boll stage table 5 however the blfr of mulched drip irrigation was larger than that of traditional flood irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage the main reason was that the growth of fine roots under mulched drip irrigation slowed down or reduced at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage resulting in a lower r s table 4 the smaller r s reduced the distribution of assimilates to the root system thus reducing the growth redundancy of root and promoting the distribution of photosynthetic products to the reproductive organs at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage fig 7 and table s2 therefore mulched drip irrigation coordinated the vegetative growth and reproductive growth of cotton plants at the later stage of growth and increased the boll number per plant and productive capacity of the fine root system thus increasing the yield in addition there was no significant difference in boll number per plant between conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation but the seed cotton yield of conventional drip irrigation was significantly higher than that of excessive drip irrigation table 2 when the irrigation water of 600 mm from conventional flood irrigation was put into the soil through mulched drip irrigation the way of water entering the soil changed from uneven infiltration into the soil to point source emitter subsequently water diffused in all directions forming a narrow and deep humid zone wang et al 2011b chen et al 2018 resulting in the soil water content of 0 60 cm in the root area of excessive drip irrigation being greater than that of conventional drip irrigation table s1 compared with conventional drip irrigation the soil moisture content of 0 60 cm in excessive drip irrigation increased by 6 57 9 17 after the late full boll stage as a result excessive water resulted in extended growth and delayed maturity of cotton plants under excessive drip irrigation cai et al 2002 which led to maladjustment of vegetative growth and reproductive growth and significantly reduced the boll opening rate and seed cotton yield table 2 the results showed that excessive irrigation amount was not conducive to the increase of cotton economic yield under mulched drip irrigation cai et al 2002 therefore it was concluded that mulched drip irrigation could increase yield by increasing boll number per plant and boll weight under suitable irrigation amount 390 mm water use efficiency wue is an indicator to characterize the relationship between crop production and water consumption and also one of the comprehensive indicators to evaluate the suitability of plant growth under water deficit du et al 2008 zhang et al 2019 the relationship between above and below ground not only determines the formation of crop yield but also greatly affects the wue of crops this study showed that the r s was closely related to the wue in a certain range wue decreased with the increase of r s however when the r s exceeded a certain critical value 0 097 wue increased with the increase of r s fig 8 when the irrigation amount was 390 mm the r s of mulched drip irrigation at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage was the minimum table 4 thus obtaining the maximum wue table 2 5 conclusions compared with traditional flood irrigation conventional flood irrigation and reduced flood irrigation mulched drip irrigation conventional drip irrigation and excessive drip irrigation had a larger specific root length srl at the full flowering stage and prophase full boll stage and the root system had a stronger ability to utilize carbon source of photosynthetic products this characteristic promoted root growth and development of cotton under mulched drip irrigation increased the root shoot ratio r s and was useful to control the vigorous vegetative growth of the aboveground parts however mulched drip irrigation reduced the fine root biomass and fine root mass fraction at the late full boll stage and boll opening stage then inhibited the growth of fine roots and reduced the r s the smaller r s was beneficial to reduce the growth redundancy of root under mulched drip irrigation and promote the distribution of photosynthetic products to reproductive organs which significantly increased the boll number per plant and boll loading of fine root system additionally excessive drip irrigation resulted in excess vegetative growth at the later stage of growth which decreased the boll opening rate and the seed cotton yield was significantly lower than that of conventional drip irrigation furthermore compared with traditional flood irrigation and excessive drip irrigation the smaller r s at the late growth stage of conventional drip irrigation achieved the maximum water use efficiency wue therefore mulched drip irrigation coordinated the growth of root and shoot by regulating the growth of cotton roots thus reducing the growth redundancy of root and shoot and increasing the productive capacity of the fine root system furthermore mulched drip irrigation coordinated vegetative and reproductive growth and had the potential to increase cotton yield by increasing the boll number per plant however for mulched drip irrigation maximum yield and wue can only be obtained at the appropriate irrigation

globally more people live in urban areas than in rural areas with 54 of the world s population residing in urban areas in 2014 united nations 2016 the united nations 2016 report further states that the most urbanized regions include northern america with 82 of the population living in urban areas latin america and the caribbean 80 and europe 73 in contrast africa and asia remain mostly rural with 40 and 48 of their respective populations living in urban areas it is widely recognized that urbanization will continue and projections suggest that africa and asia are expected to become 56 and 64 urban respectively by 2050 in africa rapid and unplanned urbanization is likely to cause considerable challenges these include increased demand for fresh water the provision of adequate sanitation and the disposal of large amounts of waste generated in these urban settlements recently there has been a concerted effort to develop innovative and sustainable sanitation technologies to reduce open defecation and dumping of human excreta into water bodies and the soil these include sanitation technologies linked to agriculture that could provide an integrated closed loop system in which elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus essential for plant growth and water can be recovered from excreta and used for crop production in urban agriculture human urine is considered as the main contributor of nutrients to human wastes with 85 of nitrogen 50 of phosphorus and 55 of potassium heinonen tanski and van wijk sijbesma 2005 ganrot et al 2007 lamicchane and babcock 2013 the use of human excreta derived materials hedm such as waste water and human urine based fertilizer has become crucial and is currently identified as a useful fertilizer source bonvin 2013 haddad and mizyed 2011 the primary goal of using hedm is to provide or supplement the nutrients requirement of crops while converting waste into agriculturally valuable inputs kirchmann et al 2017 this will also help in addressing sanitation challenges while increasing food and income security for poor urban migrants commonly used nutrient recovery methods have been applied using a wide range of innovative technologies to recover nutrients from human waste through struvite precipitation crystallization from source separated urine etter et al 2011 forward osmosis zhang et al 2014 ammonia stripping farahbakhshazad and morrison 1997 and nanofiltration for the separation of heavy metals from nutrients in source separated urine lahav et al 2013 while these strategies may have been applied to recover nutrients from human excreta they are impractical for onsite application because they bring additional energy cost and results in co2 emissions instead the use of decentralised waste water treatment system nitrification and distillation process and hydroponic system for the cultivation of agricultural crops using nutrients recovered from human waste is applicable for on site use and offer a high potential as environmentally friendly bioremediation processes endut et al 2010 udert and wächter 2012 yang et al 2015 plants have been studied extensively in recent years as effective biofilters and degraders of different kinds of organic and inorganic pollutants lone et al 2008 chinnasamy et al 2010 wang et al 2010 paz alberto and sigua 2013 linking crop growth and wastewater treatment has been proposed since the 1960 s hoffman 1998 rawat et al 2011 olguin et al 2017 and plant species with high biomass production have been suggested for successful removal of nutrients to improve crop productivity turcois and papenbrock 2014 although human excreta for agricultural crop production indicated to be a good source of fertilizer its use has its own share of challenges such as possible toxicity to plants presence of pathogens and volatility of nitrogen who 2006 toxicity on plants come in a form of heavy metal and pharmaceutical accumulation winker 2010 bischel et al 2015 musazura et al 2015 however human urine demonstrated to have low heavy metal and pharmaceuticals composition vinnerås and jönsson 2002 this is attributable to the fact that the concentration of these substances in the food we consume is low therefore human bodies excrete lower concentrations jönsson et al 1997 in fact effluent flows such as dyes and chemicals from grey water are major contributor of heavy metals vinnerås and jönsson 2002 furthermore the use of treated wastewater as nutrient sources is also associated with the possibility of human health risks through the transmission of pathogens such as coliform bacteria and faecal coliforms al nakshabandi et al 1997 however the contamination of food crops such as vegetables can be minimized by the selection of proper treatment methods and good cultivation systems that will further improve the management of wastes this include pre treatment of wastewater in conjunction with controlled irrigation armon et al 1994 hydroponic crop production system has been also used as the final treatment stage of source separated human urine to meet the sewer discharge standards hydroponic systems are particularly appropriate for informal urban and peri urban settlements because land is limiting hence need for innovative approaches where the recovered nutrients can be used in hydroponic systems in schools community centres and unused open spaces in urban settlements in an integrated wastewater treatment incorporating the hydroponic production concept nutrient rich effluents from the treatment of urine or waste water can be used to grow plants the combined effect of these systems can effectively address the challenges of waste disposal in urban settlements while at the same time providing much needed resources for increased food production in urban agriculture studies on hydroponic wastewater treatment demonstrated a removal efficiency of 58 66 chemical oxygen demand cod 41 49 total nitrogen and up to 47 total soluble solids indicating sufficient capacity for nutrient removal in urine keeratiurai 2013 yang et al 2015 investigated the final treatment of source separated urine using a hydroponic system after urea hydrolysis struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping in singapore and the hydroponic system demonstrated the feasibility for both urine treatment and water spinach cultivation however these studies were only focused on the treatment efficiency of hydroponic system for nutrients heavy metal and pathogen removal from human wastewater particularly wastewater the build up of elevated heavy metals and nutrients as well as the bio accumulation of these pollutants in edible parts of the plants remain a serious concern mapanda et al 2005 research on the use of hedm for crop production is very limited more especially in hydroponic crop production systems in hydroponic crop production systems water and nutrients cannot be considered as limiting factors but interactions between water and different nutrient sources and in particular hedm could have an effect on photosynthetic capacity and efficiency and impact biomass production photosynthetic efficiency of plants is one of the common physiological indicators of crop responses to growth conditions e g temperature nutrient deficiency and water stress and variables such as leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence play a huge role in plant metabolism and consequently affect biomass production yield output chlorophyll fluorescence provides information about photosynthetic reactions in plants antd their tolerence to abiotic stresses hence it is used to effectively analyze the effect of environmental stress on photosyntesis maxwell and johnson 2000 variables such as photochemical quenching non photochemical quenching maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii psii and electron transfer rate are mostly used to determine plant responses under a wide range of environmental stresses for instance deprivation of nitrogen results in a decline on the function of both photosystem i and ii which influence the conversion of photochemical energy this is explained by the role played by nitrogen on the transfer and dissipitation of excess light energy which increases the efficiency of maximum quantum yield of psii understanding physiological responses of plants to hedm may result in the use of hedm as potentially new and alternative nutrient sources for crop production tomato is one of the largest and widely grown vegetables in the world after potato and it is one of the most important economic vegetable crops in south africa grown by both commercial and small scale farmers the crop is easily grown in greenhouses using hydroponics and respond better to fertilizer application particularly n p and k hebbar et al 2004 and therefore serves as an ideal indicator crop to study the nutrient regimes the current study investigated the effect of decentralized waste water treatment system dewats effluents and nitrified urine concentrate nuc on leaf gas exchange photosynthetic efficiency and mineral content of hydroponically grown tomato 2 materials and methods 2 1 nutrient sources and irrigation regime the nutrient solutions used in the experiment were a commercial hydroponic mixture chfm nitrified urine concentrate nuc and effluents from decentralized wastewater treatment system dewats nuc urine based fertilizer was collected from a pilot plant at ethekwini municipality research station 29 46 25 648 e 30 58 28 329 s the production of nitrified urine concentrate was done according to udert and wachter 2012 the urine was collected from the male urinals of the ethekwini water and sanitation customer care centre where it was treated in a nitrification reactor and concentrated 20 fold in an industrial scale high efficiency evaporator at the newlands mashu research site the distillation of nuc was carried out in order to recover maximum nutrients and a volume 200 ml nitrified urine concentrate was distilled once at low pressure using a buchi rotavap udert and wächter 2012 dewats effluents were collected from a sewage plant treating the waste from 86 households adjacent to the newlands mashu research station in durban south africa the experimental control solution comprised of commercially available inorganic hydroponic fertilizer hygroponic and solu cal sourced from hygrotech pty ltd pietermaritzburg south africa nutrient information of the study materials used in the current study is presented in table 1 the nutrient solution from all the treatments was replaced every seven to fourteen days depending on the plant s consumption of the solution the intention was to expose the plants to the nutrient solutions for as long as possible to maximise nutrient absorption from the hydroponic solution 2 2 experimental design details and crop establishment tomato solunum lycopersicum plants were hydroponically grown using pine shavings as a source of growth medium in a polyethylene tunnel at newlands mashu research station in durban south africa 29 46 25 648 e 30 58 28 329 s from july to october 2017 fourteen days old seedlings of tomato plants cv monica purchased from a local nursery sunshine seedlings pietermaritzburg south africa were transplanted into 30 cm polyethylene pots the pots were filled with pine shavings as a growth medium and a pressure pump fed the nutrient solution up through a 20 m irrigation line along the length of the benches were the pots were placed a 20 cm drip irrigation emitters 2 l hour were placed and irrigation was performed at six intervals 5 min per interval daily using a timer the nutrient solution in the hydroponic containers was allowed to recirculate to provide adequate aeration tomato plants were allowed to grow freely on a wire trellis 2 3 experimental design and treatments the study was arranged using a complete randomised design with 15 replications giving a total number n of forty five experimental units the hydroponic system consisted of three identical recirculating hydroponic growing system designed to run three different nutrient streams namely chfm nuc and dewats the application rate for the chemical commercial fertilizer was prepared based on the recommended ratio of hygroponic solucal to 1 l of water for vegetables fruits and flowers 600 g 490 g 1000 l from transplanting to first truss and 800 g 620 g 1000 l from first truss to the end for the nuc fertilizer the commercial fertilizer application rate was used as a benchmark as recommended by jönsson et al 2004 who emphasised that urine based fertilizers contain equal amounts of nutrients compared to traditional fertilizers the application rate was based on the urine nitrogen content because nitrogen is often the limiting factor in crop production systems no application rate was used for the dewats treatment only effluents from the anaerobic baffle reactor component was used both as nutrient and irrigation source the nutrient solution for each system was contained in a 100 l container stacked on the ground at the foot of each system 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 leaf area index leaf area index lai was measured non destructively using the lai 2200 plant canopy analyser li cor lincoln ne usa the instrument consists of a measurement wand attached to a control unit and a fish eye optical sensor measurement of leaf area index using lai 2200 constitutes of above canopy readings to measure the total incoming light and below canopy readings to capture the rest of the incoming light which was not absorbed by the canopy li cor additionally a 270º view cap was used according to danner et al 2015 to avoid any interruptions from the operator that might results to inaccurate measurements lai readings were measured on 45 tomato plants 15 plants for each treatment for all the treatments during vegetative and reproductive stage all measurements were taken under overcasting conditions before 9 00 am or after 4 pm to avoid direct sunlight which is a prerequisite for lai measurement using lai 2200 li cor device one above and four below canopy readings were acquired at each plant to assess the transmittance and leaf area index 2 4 2 chlorophyll content leaf chlorophyll content of the uppermost fully expanded leaves was recorded non destructively using a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta corp ramsey nj usa the chlorophyll content was taken twice at six weeks after planting before flowering and two weeks after flowering measurements were taken in all the replicates each represented by 15 plants for all the experimental treatments on each of the two sampling times one reading per leaf was taken and the values were averaged 2 4 3 leaf mineral content analysis nitrogen phosphorus potassium and calcium are elements essential for the growth of tomato plant after eight weeks the tomato plant shoots were harvested by cutting at 1 cm above soil level and dried at 70 c to constant weight the samples were ground before being sent for micro and macronutrients analysis at the soil fertility and analytical services laboratory cedara kzn department of agriculture and environmental affairs prior to analysis leaf tissues were sieved through a 0 84 sieve and leaf mineral content were analysed using icp aes for micro and macronutrients rodda et al 2011 2 4 4 leaf gas

chamber by scrubbing a fraction of the inlet air through a desiccating column massonet et al 2007 leaf gas exchange parameters such as stomatal conductance gs mol m 2 photosynthetic rate a μmol co2 m

exchange measurements were conducted between 12 00 and 14 00 on the third half fully expanded leaf from the tip of the plant by clamping the leaf inside the sensor head measurements were taken from five independent plants for each replicate leading to 15 plants per treatment and values were averaged 2 5 statistical analysis data collected from measured variables for both phenological stages were

software as oslo science park norway 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nutrient solution on chlorophyll content leaf area leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters the analysis of variance showing mean squares and significant test for chlorophyll content leaf area index leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of hydroponically grown tomato plants tested under different nutrient sources is presented in table 2 3 2 changes in chlorophyll content and leaf area index in response to nutrient sources in the current study comparisons between nutrient sources derived from human waste nuc and dewats effluents and commercial fertilizer chfm revealed that these nutrient sources significantly p 0 001 influenced the chlorophyll content in tomato plants as assessed by the spad values table 2 fig 1 a however no significant differences were reported for the growth stage before flowering tomato plants receiving nuc recorded a high spad value 42 58 followed by chfm 30 51 and dewats effluents 23 58 for the growth stage after flowering the high chlorophyll content in nuc fed plants may be attributed to the high concentration of nutrients contained in this urine based fertilizer particularly nitrogen table 1 a positive correlation between leaf chlorophyll content and leaf nitrogen have been reported bojović and marković 2009 this relationship exists primarily because nitrogen is responsible for the structural formation of chlorophyll components and the synthesis of proteins in plants bojović and marković 2009 a similar effect of an increase in chlorophyll content by addition of fermented urine in onion allium cepa was also reported bohdziewicz et al 2015 leaf chlorophyll content is one of the most important attributes indicating the photosynthetic capacity as it contains reaction centers that facilitate the process of photosynthesis in plants mao et al 2007 the evaluation of chlorophyll content is important to understand the efficiency of plant stimuli e g nutrient and water stress and changes in chlorophyll content may be good indicators of growth and physiological status of plants demotes mainard et al 2008 further assessment of chlorophyll content provides direct information about the bio assimilation of nutrients as well as the biological efficiency of plant resources like nutrients carbon dioxide and water houles et al 2007 leaf area index of tomato plants differed significantly p 0 001 among the nutrient sources in the current study fig 1b plants fertilized with the commercial hydroponic mix chfm showed increased leaf area index 3 00 compared with the plants fertilized with dewats effluents 1 48 and nuc 1 85 plants fertilized with dewats and nuc reduced leaf area index by 50 7 and 38 4 respectively leaf area index lai is another important parameter used in plant growth models and is used as an indicator of photosynthetic and transpiration capacities of plant canopies bremer and ham 2010 lai is an indicator of plant growth and health especially when plants are exposed to environmental stress e g water stress and nutrient deficiency reduced leaf area index in the present study may be attributed to the low potassium content in both nuc and dewats effluents fig 1e because k deficiency results in the reduction of growth and shortening of internodes in plants perassakli et al 2015 3 3 effect of nutrients sources on leaf mineral content for tomato plants nitrogen phosphorus potassium and calcium are the major plant nutrients required for the plant to maximize fruit quality yield nutrients such as n p k and phosphorus are essential for the growth and development of the crop seed formation within the crop maximizing flower numbers as well as transportation of sugars and maintenance of stomatal conductance respectively cole et al 2016 in the current study significant differences p 0 05 were observed among nutrient sources on leaf nitrogen phosphorus potassium and calcium fig 1c d tomato plants treated with human excreta derived source of nutrients nuc demonstrated a high percentage of leaf n 6 68 and leaf p 1 42 followed by plants treated with the commercial fertilizer chfm with n and p percentage of 4 63 and 0 82 respectively the lowest percentage was observed at dewats effluent fed plants with n and p of 2 84 and 0 47 respectively however plants treated with nuc and dewats effluents demonstrated equal amounts of leaf k 1 68 compared to the commercial hydroponic fertilizer which had significantly higher k content 6 62 with regards to calcium content a comparable amount of 2 28 and 2 83 were observed for dewats effluent and chfm respectively the reduced amount of ca content for the nuc treated plants is attributable to the naturally lower content of calcium in the human urine table 1 calcium is re absorbed into the body and not passed through urine because its role and function during metabolic reactions in the human body nocolaysen et al 1953 in addition a large fraction of the calcium excreted out of the human body is found on faeces compared to urine so the observation made in the current study explains why nuc treated plant had a lower content of leaf ca since nuc is urine based fertilizer the high n and p percentage on tomato leaves in the nuc have shown that the high n and p contained in urine based fertilizers table 1 were readily available for plant uptake similar results were found by bonvin et al 2015 reported increased n and p uptake in ryegrass in response to the application of synthetic urine fertiliser this is associated with the higher amount of both n and p available in human urine mihelcic et al 2011 3 4 effect of dewats nuc and commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix on leaf gas exchange parameters the effect of different nutrient sources on the photosynthetic rate a of tomato plants is presented in fig 2 a tomato plants treated with dewats effluents had increased a 22 75 μmol co2 m 2 s 2 followed chfm treatments 22 40 μmol co2 m 2 s 2 and the lowest recorded for nuc treatments 14 56 μmol co2 m 2 s 2 the variation in the rate of photosynthesis could be attributed to the variation in nutrient composition of the nutrient sources used in the current study table 1 plant nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus potassium manganese molybdenum magnesium and calcium play a major role in the process of photosynthesis for example nitrogen deficiency causes a wide range of physiological and morphological changes in plants leaf area index chlorophyll content photosynthetic rate and biomass production were significantly decreased in sorghum planted under low nitrogen conditions zhao et al 2005 similarly magnesium deprivation reduced sugar accumulation in leaves due to a reduction in photosynthesis and chlorophyll biosynthesis hermans and verbruggen 2005 increasing trend on the photosynthetic rate with increasing nitrogen level in plants has been reported hazandy and mencuccini 2009 nitrogen is a key element in plant physiological metabolism and influences quantity structure and composition of the photosynthetic apparatus of plants allison et al 1997 nitrogen form both the component of chlorophyll and rubisco the enzyme responsible for the process of photosynthesis a high nitrogen content in the leaf tissue allows the plant to have more chlorophyll and the carboxylation enzyme 1 5 ribulose bi phosphate carboxylase rubisco hence activating a higher rate of photosynthesis hadiyati et al 2016 a positive relationship between photosynthetic rate and nitrogen was established by nakano et al 1997 whereby rubisco content increased with increase in n uptake and leaf n content güsewell 2004 suggested the effect of n concentration on photosynthetic rate is through its influence on light use efficiency in the current study we found that photosynthetic rate was higher in dewats treatments compared to nuc treatment but not significantly different from chfm treated plants the reduction in a for nuc treated plants can be attributed to the decline in intercellular carbon dioxide concentration partly due to reduced stomatal conductance fig 2c e souza et al 2004 the reduction in stomatal conductance could be associated with the osmotic effect which involves limited absorption of water due to salinity in the root zone and the toxic effect or ion imbalances due to excess ions such as na and cl james et al 2002 the high concentration of sodium in nuc solutions could be one among the reasons for reduced stomatal conductance furthermore the declining rate of photosynthesis in nuc might be associated with the imbalances of nutrients such as k ca and mg which are also essential for the role of photosynthesis results of the current study showed that different nutrients sources had a significant effect p 0 001 on stomatal conductance of tomato plants the highest stomatal conductance was recorded for dewats treatment 0 4437 mol m 2 followed by chfm 0 2117 mol m 2 whereas tomato plants treated with nuc had the lowest stomatal conductance 0 1102 mol m 2 fig 2e stomatal conductance plays an important role in photosynthesis and is positively correlated to photosynthetic rate because stomatal conductance regulates co2 fixation in the leaf mesophyll tissue khandaker et al 2013 carbon dioxide is important in plants as it is required for the production of carbohydrates during photosynthesis the internal co2 concentration of tomato plant under different nutrient sources is presented in fig 2c significantly highest internal co2 concentration was obtained from dewats treatment 297 2 μmol mol m 1 closely followed by chfm 184 9 μmol mol m 1 nuc showed the lowest internal co2 concentration 158 4 μmol mol m 1 fig 2c transpiration rate of tomato plants under different nutrient sources is presented in fig 2b highly significant p 0 001 differences were observed among nutrient sources with respect to tr plants treated with dewats effluents recorded the higher transpiration rate 3 136 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 followed by chfm 1 877 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 nuc treated plants recorded the lowest transpiration rate 1 043 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 plants require optimum nutrients particularly phosphorus levels for the conversion of light energy into chemical energy through the process of transpiration for optimum growth and reproduction warren 2011 the effect of nutrients sources both from human excreta and commercial hydroponic fertilizer may have enhanced transpiration rates due to the high p accumulation in the leaves fig 1d for the human excreta derived treatments p and other essential elements such as n k and ca required for plant growth and development were higher in both dewats and nuc table 1 fig 1c f however nuc treatment which was significantly high in n and p compared to dewats and chfm showed decreased transpiration rate in tomato plants fig 2b our results correspond with the findings by zhu et al 2012 who reported that high levels of n p and k reduced transpiration rate of tomato plants similar results were reported in okra albemoschus esculentus where high n p and k levels reduced transpiration rates khandaker et al 2017 the reduction in transpiration rate might be attributable to the osmotic influence caused by high levels of nutrients 3 5 changes in chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in response to dewats effluents nuc and commercial hydroponic mix chlorophyll fluorescence is one of the common techniques in plant physiology and it plays a major role in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of photosynthesis and response of plants to abiotic stresses roháček et al 2008 the effect of nutrient source on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of tomato is summarised in table 3 significant differences p 0 05 in response to nutrient sources were observed on measurements taken before flowering for all the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters suggesting varying responses among tomato plants under different nutrient sources however after flowering there were no significant differences in chlorophyll fluorescence variables before flowering high values of f0 fm and fv fm were observed in plants fertilized with nuc the φpsii and qp were significantly p 0 001 higher in nuc and chfm fertilized plants dewats and nuc showed significantly higher p 0 001 qp values compared to chfm fertilized plants results of the current study showed that different nutrient sources affected the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of tomato leaves suggesting that fertilizers derived from human excreta can effectively influence the photosynthetic efficiency of tomato plants this effect can be associated with the variation in nutrient composition of the fertilizer treatment used for the study especially nitrogen jin et al 2015 previous studies also reported that nitrogen fertilization increases the quantum yield of psii electron transport co2 assimilation and the maximal quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry nunes et al 1993 verhoeven et al 1997 findings by zhang et al 2010 indicated that the application of n fertilizer significantly increased fv fḿ and this is due to the high efficiency of the excitation energy captured by open psii caused by high levels of n fertilization in addition high levels of nitrogen enhance the chlorophyll and carotenoids content of the leaves hence increased photosynthetic efficiency of plants chlorophyll and carotenoids are two essential pigments which facilitate the absorption of light energy and dissipates it into heat energy thus preventing the leaves from photo damage simkin et al 2008 taiz and zeiger 2009 reduction in φpsii and fv fm in apple leaves were reported by cheng et al 2000 under low nitrogen levels similar trends were observed in the current study where the lowest φpsii and fv fm was recorded on plants treated with dewats effluents this could be attributed to the decrease in leaf nitrogen content in this treatment table 1 positive correlations between the effective quantum of efficiencies of psii photochemistry and photosynthetic rate in leaves have also been reported in the literature maxwell and johnson 2000 this relationship exists because atp and nadph which are products of linear electron transport are used directly for the assimilation of carbon dioxide hence chlorophyll fluorescence is used to detect differential responses of plants to environmental stressors the results from the present study are also indicative that chlorophyll fluorescence of tomato plants can be significantly influenced by different sources of nutrients this may be due to the variation in nutrient content for both human excreta derived materials and commercial hydroponic mix table 2 photochemical qp and non photochemical quenching qn are important physiological processes involved in the removal of excessive light energy in plants under stressful conditions demmig adams et al 2014 qp is used to measure the proportion of psii open reaction centers that are responsible for the reduction of electron acceptor maxwell and johnson 2000 mashilo et al 2017 a decrease in qp values may be indicative of an increase in the fraction of the reduction state of quinine electron acceptor qa of psii suggesting an increased susceptibility to photoinhibition guan et al 2014 in the current study before flowering higher qp values were observed for tomato plants treated with commercial fertilizer mix and nuc table 3 suggesting that these nutrient sources may have contributed in keeping more psii reaction centers in an open state so that excess excitation energy can be used for electron transport non photochemical quenching qn of chlorophyll fluorescence on the other hand is known to be an indicator of an essential regulation and photoprotection mechanisms against heat stress in a photosynthetic organism krause and jahns 2004 in the current study before flowering the nuc treatment showed significantly p 0 05 higher values of qn table 3 indicating a positive contribution of this human excreta derived fertilizer in the removal of excess excitation energy generated through heat dissipation and thereby preventing the leaves from photo damage simkin et al 2008 nutrient deprivation has been reported to reduce photosynthetic efficiency caused by excess light stress due to excess excitation energy li et al 2000 thus an increase in non photochemical quenching is needed under this condition previous studies reported that an increased in qn enhanced lhcx member of light harvesting protein family contributing to dissipate excess light energy under limited iron and nitrate conditions for ocean species taddei et al 2016 before flowering significant differences p 0 05 were observed among nutrient sources with regards to electron transport rate in tomato leaves table 3 plants treated with chfm and nuc showed higher etr suggesting that nutrient sources affect photosynthetic electron transfer studies have demonstrated that the light reactions of photosynthetic electron transport may be altered during nutrient limitation wykoff et al 1998 for example the generation of excess reducing power and oxidative damage have been reported to increase under sulphur deprivation pollock et al 2005 this is because sulphur deprivation enhances the degradation of proteins starch or lipids resulting in the release of electrons which are directed to the plastoquinone pool which is involved in the electron transport chain in the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis iron depletion has also been reported to have negative effects on the photosynthetic electron transport chain jean david 2011 this is attributed to the ability of iron to donate and accept an electron and act as a co factor hence affecting electron transfer reaction the increase in etr is indicative of an important role played by nutrients to protect leaf cell against photo inhibition figueroa et al 2009 3 6 principal component and correlation analysis the principal component analysis was used to visualize the relationship between chlorophyll content leaf area index leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and mineral content under different nutrient sources fig 3 principal components and corresponding correlation coefficient eigenvectors for the physiological parameters were grouped in tables 4 and 5 these parameters were grouped in to four pcs which contributed to the variation of 87 chlorophyll content index electron transfer nitrogen and phosphorus were positively correlated with pc 1 which accounted for 39 48 of total variation whereas the gaseous exchange parameters tr gs ci and ci ca and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters fv fm фpsii qn and qp were negatively correlated with pc 1 fm fo leaf area index transpiration and stomatal conductance were highly correlated with pc 2 which accounted for 21 08 of the total variation photosynthetic rate maximum quantum efficiency of photochemistry the effective quantum efficiencies of psii photochemistry photochemical quenching and non photochemical quenching were highly correlated with pc 3 which accounted for 16 96 of the total variation intercellular carbon dioxide and the ratio of intercellular carbon dioxide and atmospheric carbon dioxide were positively correlated with pc 4 which accounted for 9 22 of the total variation among the nutrient sources dewats effluents were differentiated by high stomatal conductance transpiration rate intercellular co2 concentration the ratio of intercellular and atmospheric co2 concentration and leaf ca fig 3 the positive and strong relationship among these gaseous exchange parameters indicates that dewats effluents improved stomatal opening of the leaves which increased transpiration rate intercellular co2 hence higher photosynthetic rate the higher stomatal conductance of the dewats effluent treated plants supports the hypothesis that plants under limited nutrient availability increase the rate of transpiration cramer et al 2008 nuc treatment was differentiated by high chlorophyll content index f0 fm fv fm qn etr leaf n and p whereas tomato plants fertilized with commercial fertilizer were differentiated by higher lai etr qp фpsii k and ca leaf n and chlorophyll content revealed a positive correlation in the current study and this relationship exists simply because nitrogen forms a structural unit for chlorophyll molecules as well as proteins bojović and marković 2009 overall both the pca and correlation analysis indicated that different nutrient sources had an effect on leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence 4 conclusion the current study showed that human excreta derived materials such as dewats effluents and nuc have a positive effect on mineral nutrition and physiological functioning e g lai and cci gaseous exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of hydroponically grown tomato plants this suggests that both dewats effluents and nuc can be potentially used as good sources of nutrients for the production of hydroponically grown tomatoes the efficiency of these nutrient sources on photosynthetic capacity over commercial hydroponic mix lies on the fact that these nutrients contain a high amount of essential nutrients such as n p k and ca which are efficient for the process of photosynthesis nutrients in human excreta particularly urine are present in ionic form and their plant availability compares well with chemical fertilizers between 75 and 90 of the n in human urine is excreted as urea and ammonium which is directly available to plants and an excellent source of n fertilizer this is evident through the higher use of urea and ammonium as two main n fertilizers in the world unlike most chemical fertilizers human excreta based nutrient sources contains all the micro nutrients necessary for plant growth which limits the risks associated with the deficiency of these nutrients however further investigation on the effect of dewats effluents and nuc on nutrient toxicity and yield performance of tomato is needed in addition toxicity effects on humans and food safety hazard chemical

treatments namely dewats effluent nuc and commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix chfm sampling conducted both before and after flowering showed significant differences p 0 05 among different nutrient sources for all physiological parameters leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence and mineral content leaf n and p were significantly p 0 05 higher in nuc treatment whereas ca and k were high in the chfm treatment the current study demonstrated that hedm such as nuc and dewats effluent could be an effective source of nutrients of agricultural crops in hydroponic systems with results comparable to commercial fertilizer mix keywords gas exchange chlorophyll fluorescence photosystem ii hydroponics mineral nutrients plant physiology 1 introduction demographic trends indicate that globally more people live in urban areas than in rural areas with 54 of the world s population residing in urban areas in 2014 united nations 2016 the united nations 2016 report further states that the most urbanized regions include northern america with 82 of the population living in urban areas latin america and the caribbean 80 and europe 73 in contrast africa and asia remain mostly rural with 40 and 48 of their respective populations living in urban areas it is widely recognized that urbanization will continue and projections suggest that africa and asia are expected to become 56 and 64 urban respectively by 2050 in africa rapid and unplanned urbanization is likely to cause considerable challenges these include increased demand for fresh water the provision of adequate sanitation and the disposal of large amounts of waste generated in these urban settlements recently there has been a concerted effort to develop innovative and sustainable sanitation technologies to reduce open defecation and dumping of human excreta into water bodies and the soil these include sanitation technologies linked to agriculture that could provide an integrated closed loop system in which elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus essential for plant growth and water can be recovered from excreta and used for crop production in urban agriculture human urine is considered as the main contributor of nutrients to human wastes with 85 of nitrogen 50 of phosphorus and 55 of potassium heinonen tanski and van wijk sijbesma 2005 ganrot et al 2007 lamicchane and babcock 2013 the use of human excreta derived materials hedm such as waste water and human urine based fertilizer has become crucial and is currently identified as a useful fertilizer source bonvin 2013 haddad and mizyed 2011 the primary goal of using hedm is to provide or supplement the nutrients requirement of crops while converting waste into agriculturally valuable inputs kirchmann et al 2017 this will also help in addressing sanitation challenges while increasing food and income security for poor urban migrants commonly used nutrient recovery methods have been applied using a wide range of innovative technologies to recover nutrients from human waste through struvite precipitation crystallization from source separated urine etter et al 2011 forward osmosis zhang et al 2014 ammonia stripping farahbakhshazad and morrison 1997 and nanofiltration for the separation of heavy metals from nutrients in source separated urine lahav et al 2013 while these strategies may have been applied to recover nutrients from human excreta they are impractical for onsite application because they bring additional energy cost and results in co2 emissions instead the use of decentralised waste water treatment system nitrification and distillation process and hydroponic system for the cultivation of agricultural crops using nutrients recovered from human waste is applicable for on site use and offer a high potential as environmentally friendly bioremediation processes endut et al 2010 udert and wächter 2012 yang et al 2015 plants have been studied extensively in recent years as effective biofilters and degraders of different kinds of organic and inorganic pollutants lone et al 2008 chinnasamy et al 2010 wang et al 2010 paz alberto and sigua 2013 linking crop growth and wastewater treatment has been proposed since the 1960 s hoffman 1998 rawat et al 2011 olguin et al 2017 and plant species with high biomass production have been suggested for successful removal of nutrients to improve crop productivity turcois and papenbrock 2014 although human excreta for agricultural crop production indicated to be a good source of fertilizer its use has its own share of challenges such as possible toxicity to plants presence of pathogens and volatility of nitrogen who 2006 toxicity on plants come in a form of heavy metal and pharmaceutical accumulation winker 2010 bischel et al 2015 musazura et al 2015 however human urine demonstrated to have low heavy metal and pharmaceuticals composition vinnerås and jönsson 2002 this is attributable to the fact that the concentration of these substances in the food we consume is low therefore human bodies excrete lower concentrations jönsson et al 1997 in fact effluent flows such as dyes and chemicals from grey water are major contributor of heavy metals vinnerås and jönsson 2002 furthermore the use of treated wastewater as nutrient sources is also associated with the possibility of human health risks through the transmission of pathogens such as coliform bacteria and faecal coliforms al nakshabandi et al 1997 however the contamination of food crops such as vegetables can be minimized by the selection of proper treatment methods and good cultivation systems that will further improve the management of wastes this include pre treatment of wastewater in conjunction with controlled irrigation armon et al 1994 hydroponic crop production system has been also used as the final treatment stage of source separated human urine to meet the sewer discharge standards hydroponic systems are particularly appropriate for informal urban and peri urban settlements because land is limiting hence need for innovative approaches where the recovered nutrients can be used in hydroponic systems in schools community centres and unused open spaces in urban settlements in an integrated wastewater treatment incorporating the hydroponic production concept nutrient rich effluents from the treatment of urine or waste water can be used to grow plants the combined effect of these systems can effectively address the challenges of waste disposal in urban settlements while at the same time providing much needed resources for increased food production in urban agriculture studies on hydroponic wastewater treatment demonstrated a removal efficiency of 58 66 chemical oxygen demand cod 41 49 total nitrogen and up to 47 total soluble solids indicating sufficient capacity for nutrient removal in urine keeratiurai 2013 yang et al 2015 investigated the final treatment of source separated urine using a hydroponic system after urea hydrolysis struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping in singapore and the hydroponic system demonstrated the feasibility for both urine treatment and water spinach cultivation however these studies were only focused on the treatment efficiency of hydroponic system for nutrients heavy metal and pathogen removal from human wastewater particularly wastewater the build up of elevated heavy metals and nutrients as well as the bio accumulation of these pollutants in edible parts of the plants remain a serious concern mapanda et al 2005 research on the use of hedm for crop production is very limited more especially in hydroponic crop production systems in hydroponic crop production systems water and nutrients cannot be considered as limiting factors but interactions between water and different nutrient sources and in particular hedm could have an effect on photosynthetic capacity and efficiency and impact biomass production photosynthetic efficiency of plants is one of the common physiological indicators of crop responses to growth conditions e g temperature nutrient deficiency and water stress and variables such as leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence play a huge role in plant metabolism and consequently affect biomass production yield output chlorophyll fluorescence provides information about photosynthetic reactions in plants antd their tolerence to abiotic stresses hence it is used to effectively analyze the effect of environmental stress on photosyntesis maxwell and johnson 2000 variables such as photochemical quenching non photochemical quenching maximum quantum yield of photosystem ii psii and electron transfer rate are mostly used to determine plant responses under a wide range of environmental stresses for instance deprivation of nitrogen results in a decline on the function of both photosystem i and ii which influence the conversion of photochemical energy this is explained by the role played by nitrogen on the transfer and dissipitation of excess light energy which increases the efficiency of maximum quantum yield of psii understanding physiological responses of plants to hedm may result in the use of hedm as potentially new and alternative nutrient sources for crop production tomato is one of the largest and widely grown vegetables in the world after potato and it is one of the most important economic vegetable crops in south africa grown by both commercial and small scale farmers the crop is easily grown in greenhouses using hydroponics and respond better to fertilizer application particularly n p and k hebbar et al 2004 and therefore serves as an ideal indicator crop to study the nutrient regimes the current study investigated the effect of decentralized waste water treatment system dewats effluents and nitrified urine concentrate nuc on leaf gas exchange photosynthetic efficiency and mineral content of hydroponically grown tomato 2 materials and methods 2 1 nutrient sources and irrigation regime the nutrient solutions used in the experiment were a commercial hydroponic mixture chfm nitrified urine concentrate nuc and effluents from decentralized wastewater treatment system dewats nuc urine based fertilizer was collected from a pilot plant at ethekwini municipality research station 29 46 25 648 e 30 58 28 329 s the production of nitrified urine concentrate was done according to udert and wachter 2012 the urine was collected from the male urinals of the ethekwini water and sanitation customer care centre where it was treated in a nitrification reactor and concentrated 20 fold in an industrial scale high efficiency evaporator at the newlands mashu research site the distillation of nuc was carried out in order to recover maximum nutrients and a volume 200 ml nitrified urine concentrate was distilled once at low pressure using a buchi rotavap udert and wächter 2012 dewats effluents were collected from a sewage plant treating the waste from 86 households adjacent to the newlands mashu research station in durban south africa the experimental control solution comprised of commercially available inorganic hydroponic fertilizer hygroponic and solu cal sourced from hygrotech pty ltd pietermaritzburg south africa nutrient information of the study materials used in the current study is presented in table 1 the nutrient solution from all the treatments was replaced every seven to fourteen days depending on the plant s consumption of the solution the intention was to expose the plants to the nutrient solutions for as long as possible to maximise nutrient absorption from the hydroponic solution 2 2 experimental design details and crop establishment tomato solunum lycopersicum plants were hydroponically grown using pine shavings as a source of growth medium in a polyethylene tunnel at newlands mashu research station in durban south africa 29 46 25 648 e 30 58 28 329 s from july to october 2017 fourteen days old seedlings of tomato plants cv monica purchased from a local nursery sunshine seedlings pietermaritzburg south africa were transplanted into 30 cm polyethylene pots the pots were filled with pine shavings as a growth medium and a pressure pump fed the nutrient solution up through a 20 m irrigation line along the length of the benches were the pots were placed a 20 cm drip irrigation emitters 2 l hour were placed and irrigation was performed at six intervals 5 min per interval daily using a timer the nutrient solution in the hydroponic containers was allowed to recirculate to provide adequate aeration tomato plants were allowed to grow freely on a wire trellis 2 3 experimental design and treatments the study was arranged using a complete randomised design with 15 replications giving a total number n of forty five experimental units the hydroponic system consisted of three identical recirculating hydroponic growing system designed to run three different nutrient streams namely chfm nuc and dewats the application rate for the chemical commercial fertilizer was prepared based on the recommended ratio of hygroponic solucal to 1 l of water for vegetables fruits and flowers 600 g 490 g 1000 l from transplanting to first truss and 800 g 620 g 1000 l from first truss to the end for the nuc fertilizer the commercial fertilizer application rate was used as a benchmark as recommended by jönsson et al 2004 who emphasised that urine based fertilizers contain equal amounts of nutrients compared to traditional fertilizers the application rate was based on the urine nitrogen content because nitrogen is often the limiting factor in crop production systems no application rate was used for the dewats treatment only effluents from the anaerobic baffle reactor component was used both as nutrient and irrigation source the nutrient solution for each system was contained in a 100 l container stacked on the ground at the foot of each system 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 leaf area index leaf area index lai was measured non destructively using the lai 2200 plant canopy analyser li cor lincoln ne usa the instrument consists of a measurement wand attached to a control unit and a fish eye optical sensor measurement of leaf area index using lai 2200 constitutes of above canopy readings to measure the total incoming light and below canopy readings to capture the rest of the incoming light which was not absorbed by the canopy li cor additionally a 270º view cap was used according to danner et al 2015 to avoid any interruptions from the operator that might results to inaccurate measurements lai readings were measured on 45 tomato plants 15 plants for each treatment for all the treatments during vegetative and reproductive stage all measurements were taken under overcasting conditions before 9 00 am or after 4 pm to avoid direct sunlight which is a prerequisite for lai measurement using lai 2200 li cor device one above and four below canopy readings were acquired at each plant to assess the transmittance and leaf area index 2 4 2 chlorophyll content leaf chlorophyll content of the uppermost fully expanded leaves was recorded non destructively using a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta corp ramsey nj usa the chlorophyll content was taken twice at six weeks after planting before flowering and two weeks after flowering measurements were taken in all the replicates each represented by 15 plants for all the experimental treatments on each of the two sampling times one reading per leaf was taken and the values were averaged 2 4 3 leaf mineral content analysis nitrogen phosphorus potassium and calcium are elements essential for the growth of tomato plant after eight weeks the tomato plant shoots were harvested by cutting at 1 cm above soil level and dried at 70 c to constant weight the samples were ground before being sent for micro and macronutrients analysis at the soil fertility and analytical services laboratory cedara kzn department of agriculture and environmental affairs prior to analysis leaf tissues were sieved through a 0 84 sieve and leaf mineral content were analysed using icp aes for micro and macronutrients rodda et al 2011 2 4 4 leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were measured concurrently using the li 6400 xt portable photosynthesis system li cor

chamber by scrubbing a fraction of the inlet air through a desiccating column massonet et al 2007 leaf gas exchange parameters such as stomatal conductance gs mol m 2 photosynthetic rate a μmol co2 m

transport rate etr were measured automatically measurements were made at four weeks after transplanting i e before flowering and two weeks after flowering similar to chlorophyll content data leaf gas exchange measurements were conducted between 12 00 and 14 00 on the third half fully expanded leaf from the tip of the plant by clamping the leaf inside the sensor head measurements were taken from five independent plants for each replicate leading to 15 plants per treatment and values were averaged 2 5 statistical analysis data collected from measured variables for both phenological stages were subjected to one way analysis of variance anova using genstat version 18 vsn international hemel hempstead uk treatment means were separated using fischer s least significant difference lsd test at 5

software as oslo science park norway 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nutrient solution on chlorophyll content leaf area leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters the analysis of variance showing mean squares and significant test for chlorophyll content leaf area index leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of hydroponically grown tomato plants tested under different nutrient sources is presented in table 2 3 2 changes in chlorophyll content and leaf area index in response to nutrient sources in the current study comparisons between nutrient sources derived from human waste nuc and dewats effluents and commercial fertilizer chfm revealed that these nutrient sources significantly p 0 001 influenced the chlorophyll content in tomato plants as assessed by the spad values table 2 fig 1 a however no significant differences were reported for the growth stage before flowering tomato plants receiving nuc recorded a high spad value 42 58 followed by chfm 30 51 and dewats effluents 23 58 for the growth stage after flowering the high chlorophyll content in nuc fed plants may be attributed to the high concentration of nutrients contained in this urine based fertilizer particularly nitrogen table 1 a positive correlation between leaf chlorophyll content and leaf nitrogen have been reported bojović and marković 2009 this relationship exists primarily because nitrogen is responsible for the structural formation of chlorophyll components and the synthesis of proteins in plants bojović and marković 2009 a similar effect of an increase in chlorophyll content by addition of fermented urine in onion allium cepa was also reported bohdziewicz et al 2015 leaf chlorophyll content is one of the most important attributes indicating the photosynthetic capacity as it contains reaction centers that facilitate the process of photosynthesis in plants mao et al 2007 the evaluation of chlorophyll content is important to understand the efficiency of plant stimuli e g nutrient and water stress and changes in chlorophyll content may be good indicators of growth and physiological status of plants demotes mainard et al 2008 further assessment of chlorophyll content provides direct information about the bio assimilation of nutrients as well as the biological efficiency of plant resources like nutrients carbon dioxide and water houles et al 2007 leaf area index of tomato plants differed significantly p 0 001 among the nutrient sources in the current study fig 1b plants fertilized with the commercial hydroponic mix chfm showed increased leaf area index 3 00 compared with the plants fertilized with dewats effluents 1 48 and nuc 1 85 plants fertilized with dewats and nuc reduced leaf area index by 50 7 and 38 4 respectively leaf area index lai is another important parameter used in plant growth models and is used as an indicator of photosynthetic and transpiration capacities of plant canopies bremer and ham 2010 lai is an indicator of plant growth and health especially when plants are exposed to environmental stress e g water stress and nutrient deficiency reduced leaf area index in the present study may be attributed to the low potassium content in both nuc and dewats effluents fig 1e because k deficiency results in the reduction of growth and shortening of internodes in plants perassakli et al 2015 3 3 effect of nutrients sources on leaf mineral content for tomato plants nitrogen phosphorus potassium and calcium are the major plant nutrients required for the plant to maximize fruit quality yield nutrients such as n p k and phosphorus are essential for the growth and development of the crop seed formation within the crop maximizing flower numbers as well as transportation of sugars and maintenance of stomatal conductance respectively cole et al 2016 in the current study significant differences p 0 05 were observed among nutrient sources on leaf nitrogen phosphorus potassium and calcium fig 1c d tomato plants treated with human excreta derived source of nutrients nuc demonstrated a high percentage of leaf n 6 68 and leaf p 1 42 followed by plants treated with the commercial fertilizer chfm with n and p percentage of 4 63 and 0 82 respectively the lowest percentage was observed at dewats effluent fed plants with n and p of 2 84 and 0 47 respectively however plants treated with nuc and dewats effluents demonstrated equal amounts of leaf k 1 68 compared to the commercial hydroponic fertilizer which had significantly higher k content 6 62 with regards to calcium content a comparable amount of 2 28 and 2 83 were observed for dewats effluent and chfm respectively the reduced amount of ca content for the nuc treated plants is attributable to the naturally lower content of calcium in the human urine table 1 calcium is re absorbed into the body and not passed through urine because its role and function during metabolic reactions in the human body nocolaysen et al 1953 in addition a large fraction of the calcium excreted out of the human body is found on faeces compared to urine so the observation made in the current study explains why nuc treated plant had a lower content of leaf ca since nuc is urine based fertilizer the high n and p percentage on tomato leaves in the nuc have shown that the high n and p contained in urine based fertilizers table 1 were readily available for plant uptake similar results were found by bonvin et al 2015 reported increased n and p uptake in ryegrass in response to the application of synthetic urine fertiliser this is associated with the higher amount of both n and p available in human urine mihelcic et al 2011 3 4 effect of dewats nuc and commercial hydroponic fertilizer mix on leaf gas exchange parameters the effect of different nutrient sources on the photosynthetic rate a of tomato plants is presented in fig 2 a tomato plants treated with dewats effluents had increased a 22 75 μmol co2 m 2 s 2 followed chfm treatments 22 40 μmol co2 m 2 s 2 and the lowest recorded for nuc treatments 14 56 μmol co2 m 2 s 2 the variation in the rate of photosynthesis could be attributed to the variation in nutrient composition of the nutrient sources used in the current study table 1 plant nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus potassium manganese molybdenum magnesium and calcium play a major role in the process of photosynthesis for example nitrogen deficiency causes a wide range of physiological and morphological changes in plants leaf area index chlorophyll content photosynthetic rate and biomass production were significantly decreased in sorghum planted under low nitrogen conditions zhao et al 2005 similarly magnesium deprivation reduced sugar accumulation in leaves due to a reduction in photosynthesis and chlorophyll biosynthesis hermans and verbruggen 2005 increasing trend on the photosynthetic rate with increasing nitrogen level in plants has been reported hazandy and mencuccini 2009 nitrogen is a key element in plant physiological metabolism and influences quantity structure and composition of the photosynthetic apparatus of plants allison et al 1997 nitrogen form both the component of chlorophyll and rubisco the enzyme responsible for the process of photosynthesis a high nitrogen content in the leaf tissue allows the plant to have more chlorophyll and the carboxylation enzyme 1 5 ribulose bi phosphate carboxylase rubisco hence activating a higher rate of photosynthesis hadiyati et al 2016 a positive relationship between photosynthetic rate and nitrogen was established by nakano et al 1997 whereby rubisco content increased with increase in n uptake and leaf n content güsewell 2004 suggested the effect of n concentration on photosynthetic rate is through its influence on light use efficiency in the current study we found that photosynthetic rate was higher in dewats treatments compared to nuc treatment but not significantly different from chfm treated plants the reduction in a for nuc treated plants can be attributed to the decline in intercellular carbon dioxide concentration partly due to reduced stomatal conductance fig 2c e souza et al 2004 the reduction in stomatal conductance could be associated with the osmotic effect which involves limited absorption of water due to salinity in the root zone and the toxic effect or ion imbalances due to excess ions such as na and cl james et al 2002 the high concentration of sodium in nuc solutions could be one among the reasons for reduced stomatal conductance furthermore the declining rate of photosynthesis in nuc might be associated with the imbalances of nutrients such as k ca and mg which are also essential for the role of photosynthesis results of the current study showed that different nutrients sources had a significant effect p 0 001 on stomatal conductance of tomato plants the highest stomatal conductance was recorded for dewats treatment 0 4437 mol m 2 followed by chfm 0 2117 mol m 2 whereas tomato plants treated with nuc had the lowest stomatal conductance 0 1102 mol m 2 fig 2e stomatal conductance plays an important role in photosynthesis and is positively correlated to photosynthetic rate because stomatal conductance regulates co2 fixation in the leaf mesophyll tissue khandaker et al 2013 carbon dioxide is important in plants as it is required for the production of carbohydrates during photosynthesis the internal co2 concentration of tomato plant under different nutrient sources is presented in fig 2c significantly highest internal co2 concentration was obtained from dewats treatment 297 2 μmol mol m 1 closely followed by chfm 184 9 μmol mol m 1 nuc showed the lowest internal co2 concentration 158 4 μmol mol m 1 fig 2c transpiration rate of tomato plants under different nutrient sources is presented in fig 2b highly significant p 0 001 differences were observed among nutrient sources with respect to tr plants treated with dewats effluents recorded the higher transpiration rate 3 136 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 followed by chfm 1 877 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 nuc treated plants recorded the lowest transpiration rate 1 043 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 plants require optimum nutrients particularly phosphorus levels for the conversion of light energy into chemical energy through the process of transpiration for optimum growth and reproduction warren 2011 the effect of nutrients sources both from human excreta and commercial hydroponic fertilizer may have enhanced transpiration rates due to the high p accumulation in the leaves fig 1d for the human excreta derived treatments p and other essential elements such as n k and ca required for plant growth and development were higher in both dewats and nuc table 1 fig 1c f however nuc treatment which was significantly high in n and p compared to dewats and chfm showed decreased transpiration rate in tomato plants fig 2b our results correspond with the findings by zhu et al 2012 who reported that high levels of n p and k reduced transpiration rate of tomato plants similar results were reported in okra albemoschus esculentus where high n p and k levels reduced transpiration rates khandaker et al 2017 the reduction in transpiration rate might be attributable to the osmotic influence caused by high levels of nutrients 3 5 changes in chlorophyll fluorescence parameters in response to dewats effluents nuc and commercial hydroponic mix chlorophyll fluorescence is one of the common techniques in plant physiology and it plays a major role in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of photosynthesis and response of plants to abiotic stresses roháček et al 2008 the effect of nutrient source on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of tomato is summarised in table 3 significant differences p 0 05 in response to nutrient sources were observed on measurements taken before flowering for all the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters suggesting varying responses among tomato plants under different nutrient sources however after flowering there were no significant differences in chlorophyll fluorescence variables before flowering high values of f0 fm and fv fm were observed in plants fertilized with nuc the φpsii and qp were significantly p 0 001 higher in nuc and chfm fertilized plants dewats and nuc showed significantly higher p 0 001 qp values compared to chfm fertilized plants results of the current study showed that different nutrient sources affected the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of tomato leaves suggesting that fertilizers derived from human excreta can effectively influence the photosynthetic efficiency of tomato plants this effect can be associated with the variation in nutrient composition of the fertilizer treatment used for the study especially nitrogen jin et al 2015 previous studies also reported that nitrogen fertilization increases the quantum yield of psii electron transport co2 assimilation and the maximal quantum efficiency of psii photochemistry nunes et al 1993 verhoeven et al 1997 findings by zhang et al 2010 indicated that the application of n fertilizer significantly increased fv fḿ and this is due to the high efficiency of the excitation energy captured by open psii caused by high levels of n fertilization in addition high levels of nitrogen enhance the chlorophyll and carotenoids content of the leaves hence increased photosynthetic efficiency of plants chlorophyll and carotenoids are two essential pigments which facilitate the absorption of light energy and dissipates it into heat energy thus preventing the leaves from photo damage simkin et al 2008 taiz and zeiger 2009 reduction in φpsii and fv fm in apple leaves were reported by cheng et al 2000 under low nitrogen levels similar trends were observed in the current study where the lowest φpsii and fv fm was recorded on plants treated with dewats effluents this could be attributed to the decrease in leaf nitrogen content in this treatment table 1 positive correlations between the effective quantum of efficiencies of psii photochemistry and photosynthetic rate in leaves have also been reported in the literature maxwell and johnson 2000 this relationship exists because atp and nadph which are products of linear electron transport are used directly for the assimilation of carbon dioxide hence chlorophyll fluorescence is used to detect differential responses of plants to environmental stressors the results from the present study are also indicative that chlorophyll fluorescence of tomato plants can be significantly influenced by different sources of nutrients this may be due to the variation in nutrient content for both human excreta derived materials and commercial hydroponic mix table 2 photochemical qp and non photochemical quenching qn are important physiological processes involved in the removal of excessive light energy in plants under stressful conditions demmig adams et al 2014 qp is used to measure the proportion of psii open reaction centers that are responsible for the reduction of electron acceptor maxwell and johnson 2000 mashilo et al 2017 a decrease in qp values may be indicative of an increase in the fraction of the reduction state of quinine electron acceptor qa of psii suggesting an increased susceptibility to photoinhibition guan et al 2014 in the current study before flowering higher qp values were observed for tomato plants treated with commercial fertilizer mix and nuc table 3 suggesting that these nutrient sources may have contributed in keeping more psii reaction centers in an open state so that excess excitation energy can be used for electron transport non photochemical quenching qn of chlorophyll fluorescence on the other hand is known to be an indicator of an essential regulation and photoprotection mechanisms against heat stress in a photosynthetic organism krause and jahns 2004 in the current study before flowering the nuc treatment showed significantly p 0 05 higher values of qn table 3 indicating a positive contribution of this human excreta derived fertilizer in the removal of excess excitation energy generated through heat dissipation and thereby preventing the leaves from photo damage simkin et al 2008 nutrient deprivation has been reported to reduce photosynthetic efficiency caused by excess light stress due to excess excitation energy li et al 2000 thus an increase in non photochemical quenching is needed under this condition previous studies reported that an increased in qn enhanced lhcx member of light harvesting protein family contributing to dissipate excess light energy under limited iron and nitrate conditions for ocean species taddei et al 2016 before flowering significant differences p 0 05 were observed among nutrient sources with regards to electron transport rate in tomato leaves table 3 plants treated with chfm and nuc showed higher etr suggesting that nutrient sources affect photosynthetic electron transfer studies have demonstrated that the light reactions of photosynthetic electron transport may be altered during nutrient limitation wykoff et al 1998 for example the generation of excess reducing power and oxidative damage have been reported to increase under sulphur deprivation pollock et al 2005 this is because sulphur deprivation enhances the degradation of proteins starch or lipids resulting in the release of electrons which are directed to the plastoquinone pool which is involved in the electron transport chain in the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis iron depletion has also been reported to have negative effects on the photosynthetic electron transport chain jean david 2011 this is attributed to the ability of iron to donate and accept an electron and act as a co factor hence affecting electron transfer reaction the increase in etr is indicative of an important role played by nutrients to protect leaf cell against photo inhibition figueroa et al 2009 3 6 principal component and correlation analysis the principal component analysis was used to visualize the relationship between chlorophyll content leaf area index leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and mineral content under different nutrient sources fig 3 principal components and corresponding correlation coefficient eigenvectors for the physiological parameters were grouped in tables 4 and 5 these parameters were grouped in to four pcs which contributed to the variation of 87 chlorophyll content index electron transfer nitrogen and phosphorus were positively correlated with pc 1 which accounted for 39 48 of total variation whereas the gaseous exchange parameters tr gs ci and ci ca and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters fv fm фpsii qn and qp were negatively correlated with pc 1 fm fo leaf area index transpiration and stomatal conductance were highly correlated with pc 2 which accounted for 21 08 of the total variation photosynthetic rate maximum quantum efficiency of photochemistry the effective quantum efficiencies of psii photochemistry photochemical quenching and non photochemical quenching were highly correlated with pc 3 which accounted for 16 96 of the total variation intercellular carbon dioxide and the ratio of intercellular carbon dioxide and atmospheric carbon dioxide were positively correlated with pc 4 which accounted for 9 22 of the total variation among the nutrient sources dewats effluents were differentiated by high stomatal conductance transpiration rate intercellular co2 concentration the ratio of intercellular and atmospheric co2 concentration and leaf ca fig 3 the positive and strong relationship among these gaseous exchange parameters indicates that dewats effluents improved stomatal opening of the leaves which increased transpiration rate intercellular co2 hence higher photosynthetic rate the higher stomatal conductance of the dewats effluent treated plants supports the hypothesis that plants under limited nutrient availability increase the rate of transpiration cramer et al 2008 nuc treatment was differentiated by high chlorophyll content index f0 fm fv fm qn etr leaf n and p whereas tomato plants fertilized with commercial fertilizer were differentiated by higher lai etr qp фpsii k and ca leaf n and chlorophyll content revealed a positive correlation in the current study and this relationship exists simply because nitrogen forms a structural unit for chlorophyll molecules as well as proteins bojović and marković 2009 overall both the pca and correlation analysis indicated that different nutrient sources had an effect on leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence 4 conclusion the current study showed that human excreta derived materials such as dewats effluents and nuc have a positive effect on mineral nutrition and physiological functioning e g lai and cci gaseous exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of hydroponically grown tomato plants this suggests that both dewats effluents and nuc can be potentially used as good sources of nutrients for the production of hydroponically grown tomatoes the efficiency of these nutrient sources on photosynthetic capacity over commercial hydroponic mix lies on the fact that these nutrients contain a high amount of essential nutrients such as n p k and ca which are efficient for the process of photosynthesis nutrients in human excreta particularly urine are present in ionic form and their plant availability compares well with chemical fertilizers between 75 and 90 of the n in human urine is excreted as urea and ammonium which is directly available to plants and an excellent source of n fertilizer this is evident through the higher use of urea and ammonium as two main n fertilizers in the world unlike most chemical fertilizers human excreta based nutrient sources contains all the micro nutrients necessary for plant growth which limits the risks associated with the deficiency of these nutrients however
