6845,the potential of aggregation decomposition agdp for flood control of mixed reservoir system remains unclear due to the flood variability and complex hydraulic connections in this study we develop flood classification aggregation decomposition fad operating rules to adapt for flood variability and to account for the trade offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream three steps are involved in the proposed fad operating rules 1 flood classification by projection pursuit pp coupled with genetic algorithm ga 2 definition of fad operating rules using the agdp model

common natural hazards that could cause severe losses of human life and property wang et al 2016 2015 reservoir construction and operation is a practical approach to mitigate flood disasters hui et al 2010 labadie 2004 plate 2002 however reservoir flood control operation is a very complex issue since it should cater to multiple conflicting objectives and flood variability cheng and chau 2002 liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 the main purpose of reservoir flood control operation is to decide how much water should be released now and how much water should be retained for future use a wide variety of methods such as implicit stochastic optimization iso young 1967 explicit stochastic optimization eso and parameterization simulation optimization pso celeste and billib 2009 have been applied for reservoir flood control operation each of which however has its potential advantages and drawbacks for example the application of iso can be limited because perfect forecast is required for deterministic reservoir operation karamouz and houck 1982 eso incorporates the inflow probability into the optimization process such as stochastic dynamic programming sdp huang et al 1991 nevertheless sdp is less applicable to large scale multi reservoir systems due to its curse of dimensionality and computational complexity yeh 1985 in order to resolve these problems the shape of reservoir operating rules is predefined in pso then heuristic algorithms are used for the optimization of reservoir operating rules and the complex simulation model could be replaced by the surrogate model for simplification zhang et al 2016 chu et al 2015 oliveira and loucks 1997 the aggregation decomposition agdp method was proposed by turgeon 1980 to solve the curse of dimensionality in a large scale hydropower reservoir system and since then it has been used for multi reservoir operation optimization duran et al 1985 li et al 2014 liu et al 2011b a salient feature of agdp is to aggregate multiple reservoirs into a virtual reservoir making it possible to simplify the multi reservoir operation into single reservoir operation the reservoirs in a hydropower system are aggregated in energy units li et al 2014 liu et al 2011b valdes et al 1992 and the optimal total output can be allocated to individual reservoirs using neural networks saad et al 1996 saad et al 1994 empirical equation li et al 2014 inflow or installed capacity rate zhang et al 2016 in practice fixed reservoir operating rules are often applied to cope with all kinds of floods with different magnitudes and spatial distributions resulting in less favorable outcomes for a large scale river basin the location of the rainstorm center has an impact on the reservoir flood control operation and thus specific reservoir operating rules should be designed to adapt for the flood variability more water should be released in the reservoir where the rainstorm center is located to reserve more capacity for the coming floods whereas less water should be released in other reservoirs to store more water for future hydropower generation and water supply in dry seasons floods can be classified into different types based on some meteorological e g temperature and hydrological e g flood peak discharge factors merz and bl√∂schl 2003 used atmospheric inputs rainfall and basin states soil moisture to classify floods across austria the floods generated by the weather generator coupled with the rainfall runoff model in two alpine catchments in austria and france were classified based on temperature and precipitation indicators by cluster analysis turkington et al 2016 hundecha et al 2017 used the spatial extent and process for flood classification in europe however these studies mainly focused on formative factors such as temperature and precipitation in flood forecasting to our knowledge little research has focused on the important effect of flood classification on reservoir operation due to the unpredictable and variable nature of floods in addition considerable attention has been given to the optimization of reservoir operation for the specific short term forecasted floods huang et al 2014 celeste and billib 2012 applied iso to derive reservoir operating rules for a single reservoir with different predicted mean monthly inflows for the next few months however there are little research about the reservoir operating rules for different magnitudes and spatial distributions of floods for multi reservoir system the flood is extremely variable in the respect of flood magnitude and spatial distribution for floods with different magnitude or different spatial distribution the reservoirs should have different behaviors to handle it thus we should find different behaviors of reservoirs for different flood in this study the flood classification model is used to divide historical floods by the magnitude and spatial distribution so that specific reservoir operating rules could be derived to adapt for flood variability projection pursuit pp and fuzzy clustering analysis were used in the flood classification model shu and burn 2004 both of which could project high dimensional data into lower dimensional data many multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been developed for multi objective optimization problems deb et al 2002 giuliani et al 2015 hadka and reed 2012 lei et al 2018 vrugt et al 2003 for example the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 is widely used to solve constrained multi objective problems with the non dominated sorting and the crowding distance multi objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis moscem vrugt et al 2003 uses pareto dominance to produce solutions in stable distribution pareto set giuliani et al 2015 proposed evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps that combined direct policy search nonlinear approximating networks and multi objective evolutionary algorithms to design pareto approximate closed loop operating policies this paper first contributes to deriving fad operating rules of large scale mixed reservoir system by combining flood classification model agdp model and parameterization simulation optimization pso framework secondly this paper provides a new insight into specific reservoir operating rules for flood variability the pp model coupled with ga performed very well in flood classification model thirdly the curse of dimensionality and excessive demands for large scale reservoir system are solved by the agdp model coupled with piecewise linear function finally the trade offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream is considered in the derivation of fad operating rules a case study was performed with a large scale mixed reservoir system in the xijiang river basin china the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the flood classification model agdp model and pso framework section 3 addresses a case study of ten flood control reservoirs in the xijiang river basin china then the results of flood classification fad operating rules and reservoir operation in three scenarios conventional operation for the status quo year co sqy conventional operation for the perspective year 2030 co 2030 and fad operation for the perspective year 2030 fad 2030 are shown and discussed in section 4 finally conclusions are given in section 5 2 methodology the fad method considering flood variability and the trade offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream is illustrated in fig 1 the procedures are elaborated as follows 1 flood classification model floods are classified into several types by pp model coupled with ga according to the magnitude and spatial distribution of floods 2 aggregation decomposition agdp model all reservoirs in the same tributary are aggregated into a virtual reservoir the total release of the virtual aggregated reservoir could be determined by piecewise linear operating rules and then it could be decomposed for individual reservoirs 3 parameterization simulation optimization framework pso fad operating rules can be determined by nsga ii considering the trade offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream 2 1 flood classification model currently there is no universally accepted standard for flood classification liao et al 2012 for a single reservoir the magnitude of inflow is usually used as the only index for flood classification celeste and billib 2012 for a multi reservoir system there are a variety of indexes for flood classification including the flood peak occurrence time flood peak discharge storm duration runoff response dynamics and spatial coherence merz and bl√∂schl 2003 merz and bl√∂schl 2008 however the flood peak occurrence time and flood peak discharge are the two most important indexes for flood classification pp is a multivariate data analysis method that can transform high dimensional data into one dimensional data by optimal projection direction and it is often used for flood classification friedman and tukey 1974 huang and zhang 2011 jin et al 2003 a critical challenge in pp is the construction of the projection index function to search for the optimal projection direction friedman and tukey 1974 for floods in a large river basin the flood peak occurrence time and flood peak discharge at several flood control sections constitute the vector of flood indexes x i x i 1 x i j x i p j 1 p corresponding to ith flood hydrograph for k hydrographs the vectors of flood indexes x i i 1 2 k constitute the following high dimensional matrix 1 x x 1 1 x 1 j x 1 p x i 1 x i j x i p x k 1 x k j x k p i 1 2 k j 1 2 p where the element x i j is the jth flood index in ith flood hydrograph and k and p are the number of flood hydrographs and flood indexes respectively pp coupled with ga can search the best projection direction to obtain one dimensional projection values which could be used for flood classification the detailed procedure of pp coupled ga for flood classification is described in appendix a and the experimental setup of ga is shown in appendix b 2 2 aggregation decomposition model the agdp model is widely used for multi reservoir hydropower operation liu et al 2011b valdes et al 1992 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 but seldom for multi reservoir flood control operation the basic idea of the agdp model is to aggregate all the reservoirs in the same tributary into a virtual reservoir to determine the optimal total output which is then allocated to individual reservoirs saad et al 1994 2 2 1 aggregated reservoir conceptually the reservoirs in a large scale mixed reservoir system can be aggregated into several virtual ones that can preserve and describe some features of these reservoir without considering the interactions the reservoirs are aggregated in water units rather than in energy units the flood forecasting of several periods for the aggregated reservoir should be considered in aggregation 2 v i t n 1 n v n t j 0 j i n t j Œ¥ t where v i t is the storage of the aggregated virtual reservoir i at the beginning of time period t with j periods of forecasted inflows at the beginning of time period t v n t is the storage of the reservoir n at the beginning of time period t i n t is the inflow of the reservoir n during time period t Œ¥ t is the time interval n j are the number of reservoirs and flood forecasting periods during aggregation respectively 2 2 2 decomposition strategy many decomposition strategies have been used in the agdp model to allocate the optimal total output of the virtual reservoir for individual reservoirs zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2011b used the fitting function as the decomposition pattern based on the deterministic optimal operation li et al 2014 used genetic programming gp to determine decomposition strategy the percentage of total installed capacity was used as the decomposition method in multi reservoir hydropower operation zhang et al 2016 similarly the percentage of forecasted inflow is selected as the decomposition method for reservoir flood control operation which is shown as follows 3 r n t r i t t t j i n t i 1 n t t j i n t where r i t is the total output of an aggregated virtual reservoir i during time period t and r n t is the output of individual reservoir n during time period t 2 3 parameterization simulation optimization framework the pso framework is used to derive optimal reservoir operating rules for the large scale mixed reservoir system without deterministic reservoir operation as the piecewise linear function liu et al 2011a zhang et al 2015 is often used as the reservoir operating rules for flood control the piecewise linear function is selected as the form of aggregated virtual reservoir which is defined as follows 4 r i t a i 1 v i t b i 1 v i min v i t v i t a i 2 v i t b i 2 v i t v i t v i max where a i 1 b i 1 a i 2 b i 2 are the parameters of slope and intercept of the piecewise linear regression to be optimized the value of the turning point v i t is determined by the intersection and v i min v i max are the allowable minimum and maximum reservoir storage of the aggregated virtual reservoir i inputs of piecewise linear operating rules includes the storage of the aggregated virtual reservoir i at the beginning of time period t with j periods of forecasted inflows during time period t output is the total release of the virtual aggregated reservoir during time period t the reservoirs which are aggregated as the virtual aggregated reservoir share the same function with same parameter values however different virtual aggregated reservoirs have the same function but different parameter values 2 3 1 objective functions the large scale mixed reservoir operation optimization model aims to minimize the flood loss at flood control sections on tributaries and the mainstream as expressed in eqs 5 and 6 respectively as the importance of tributaries is the same but not as important as the mainstream the flood loss of each tributary could be lumped as the total flood loss of tributaries the first objective is to minimize the accumulated squared deviations of overflow at all flood control sections on the tributaries 5 min q 1 min m 1 m t 1 t q m t q m s 2 n m t where q 1 is the accumulated squared deviations of overflow at all flood control sections on the tributaries m t is the number of flood control sections on the tributaries and the number of time periods respectively q m t is the streamflow at flood control section m during time period t n m t is the binary variables which is taken to be 1 when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharge and to be 0 when the streamflow is within the safe discharge at flood control section m q m s is the safe discharge at flood control station m the second objective is to minimize the accumulated squared deviations of overflow at flood control section on the mainstream 6 min q 2 min t 1 t q f t q f s 2 n f t where q 2 is the accumulated squared deviations of overflow at the flood control section on the mainstream q f t is the streamflow at the flood control section on the mainstream during time period t n f t is the binary variables which is taken to be 1 when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharge and to be 0 when the streamflow is within the safe discharge at flood control section on the mainstream and q f s is the safe discharge at the flood control section on the mainstream 2 3 2 constraints the water balance equation reservoir water level limits release capacity safe discharges at the flood control stations boundary conditions and channel routing constraints are as follows 7 i n t i n t 1 2 Œ¥ t r n t r n t 1 2 Œ¥ t v n t 1 v n t 8 z n min z n t z n max 9 r n t r n max t 10 z n i n i t z n f l w l 11 q z t c 0 r t c 1 r t 1 c 2 q z t 1 where z n min z n max are the minimum and maximum allowable water level of reservoir n at the beginning of time period t respectively r n max t is the maximum release of reservoir n during time period t which is often associated with spillways z n i n i t is the initial water level of reservoir n at the beginning of reservoir flood control operation z n f l w l is the flood limited water level flwl of reservoir n for flood control and c 0 c 1 c 2 are the channel routing coefficients in the muskingum method it is assumed that there is no water loss from evaporation the well known nsga ii is used in this paper for the derivation of fad operating rules of large scale mixed reservoir system however it is important to note that many other multi objective optimization algorithms such as emodps giuliani et al 2015 can also be used for the same purpose the experimental setup of nsga ii is described in appendix b 3 case study the xijiang river is the third longest river in china after the yangtze river and the yellow river and its main tributaries include yujiang hongshuihe liujiang qianjiang xunjiang and guijiang fig 2 the xijiang river basin often suffers from flood disasters due to the unevenly temporal and spatial distribution of floods and mountainous topography the reservoir flood control operation in the xijiang river basin aims to reduce flood loss at six flood control sections nanning qianjiang liuzhou wuxuan guilin and wuzhou the safe discharges of these flood control sections are shown in table 1 the wuzhou section on the mainstream is considered separately due to its important role for guangdong province and the other five flood control sections on the tributaries are considered together for simplification the large scale mixed reservoir system in the xijiang river basin is schematically shown in fig 3 there are four reservoirs baise laokou longtan and qingshitan in the xijiang river basin for flood control for the status quo year and six reservoirs yangxi luojiu datengxia fuzikou chuanjiang and xiaorongjiang are added for flood control for the perspective year 2030 the primary goal of these ten reservoirs during flood season is flood control for non flood season baise laokou longtan datengxia and yangxi reservoirs aim for hydropower generation and navigation and the other five reservoirs luojiu qingshitan chuanjiang xiaorongjiang and fuzikou aim for water supply and irrigation the basic parameters of these ten reservoirs for flood control are shown in table 2 conventional operating rules cor of these reservoirs are designed individually which are provided by guangxi water and power design institute the cor of the longtan reservoir is selected as an example in table 3 the release of the longtan reservoir was determined by the forecasted streamflow at the wuzhou section when the forecasted streamflow at the wuzhou section was increased to be higher than 25 000 m3 s the reservoir release was limited within 4 000 m3 s if the forecasted streamflow was declined to be lower than 42 000 m3 s the reservoir release equaled to the inflow three scenarios co sqy co 2030 and fad 2030 are set for the comparison of reservoir flood control operation corresponding to the conventional operation of four reservoirs for the status quo year the conventional operation of ten reservoirs for the perspective year 2030 and the flood classification aggregation decomposition operation for the perspective year 2030 respectively as there are thousands of hydrological stations in the xijiang river basin with a drainage area of 352 400 km2 it is difficult to obtain the flood data of all hydrological stations we selected 15 typical flood hydrographs 1962 1966 1968 1970 1974 1976 1978 1983 1988 1994 1996 1998 2001 2002 and 2005 with a time step of 1 h which could well reflect the various magnitude and spatial distribution of floods as the dahuangjiangkou section is important in the xunjiang the streamflow variation at seven sections nanning qianjiang liuzhou wuxuan guilin wuzhou and dahuangjiangkou of 15 typical flood hydrographs are shown by graphs in supplementary data it should be noted that the typical flood hydrographs are observed with the same time step 1 h for different lengths of time 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of three flood types the flood peak occurrence time and flood peak discharge of seven sections are selected as the indexes for flood classification yielding a total of 14 indexes for the single flood hydrograph table 4 as the length of typical flood hydrographs differs from each other the flood peak occurrence time should be converted to radians as follows 12 x ij d ij 2 œÄ l i where d ij is the flood peak occurrence time of section j in flood hydrograph ith and l i is the length of flood hydrograph ith the optimal projection direction obtained by ga is 0 504 0 321 0 135 0 764 0 189 0 526 0 243 0 333 0 591 0 157 0 154 0 965 0 585 1 000 shown in table 4 the projection values of the 15 typical flood hydrographs can be simulated by optimal projection direction ranging from 0 3 to 2 6 as shown in fig 4 the larger projection values distributed widely while smaller projection values distributed rather closely to distribute the projection values uniformly two empirical values 0 8 and 1 5 were selected as the thresholds based on experience and former researches cheng et al 2009 dong et al 2007 huang and zhang 2011 as shown in table 5 the 15 typical flood hydrographs can be classified into 3 flood types based on two empirical thresholds including the middle and upstream flood type mu the whole basin flood type wb and the middle and downstream flood type md the normalized flood peak discharges of seven sections are plotted separately the upward convex curve for the mu type floods is shown in fig 5 a the cubic function curve for the wb type floods is shown in fig 5b and the concave downward curve for the md type floods is shown in fig 5c respectively thus we can also classify floods based on the matching degree of the three trend lines in fig 5 with the normalized maximum streamflow of the seven sections three typical flood hydrographs in 1966 1968 and 1998 are selected as examples the proportion of the flood peak discharge at wuzhou section attributed to the flood peak discharges at six sections on the tributaries in 1966 1968 and 1998 are shown in table 6 in 1966 mu type floods the maximum proportion of the flood peak discharge at wuzhou section is 95 58 at dahuangjiangkou section while the minimum one is 3 97 at guilin section in 1998 md type floods the maximum proportion of the flood peak discharge at wuzhou section is 78 08 at dahuangjiangkou section while the minimum one is 10 98 at guilin section in 1968 wb type floods the proportion of the flood peak discharge at dahuangjiangkou and guilin sections in that at wuzhou section is between that in 1966 mu type floods and 1998 md type floods as dahuangjiangkou and guilin sections are located in the central and lower basin respectively the results indicate that when the flood peak discharge at the central basin section is close to that at the outlet the floods can be classified as mu type floods the md type floods indicate that the local streamflow between the central basin section and the outlet constitutes a large proportion of flood peak discharge at the outlet the wb type floods occur in the whole river basin i e flood on tributaries resulting in flood at the outlet on the mainstream 4 2 fad operating rules in scenario fad 2030 the reservoirs in the same tributary such as two cascade baise laokou reservoirs in yujiang two parallel yangxi luojiu reservoirs in liujiang and four parallel qingshitan fuzikou chuanjiang and xiaorongjiang reservoirs in guijiang can be aggregated into three virtual reservoirs as piecewise linear operating rules are set for the virtual actual reservoir the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the turning point and endpoint are four parameters to be optimized as there are three aggregated virtual reservoirs and two actual reservoirs longtan reservoir in hongshuihe and datengxia reservoir in qianjiang there are 20 parameters for each flood type and a total of 60 parameters for the three flood types to be optimized the initial storage of each reservoir is corresponding to the initial reservoir water level i e flwl the detailed experimental setup of optimization algorithms ga and nsga ii for fad operating rules has been shown in appendix b the optimization time of fad operating rules for three types of flood is approximately equal to one hour it should also be noted that the maximum streamflow of five flood control sections nanning qianjiang liuzhou wuxuan and guilin on the tributaries in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 are below their safe discharges for mu type and wb type floods in addition the wuzhou section could be damaged for all three flood types therefore there is only a single objective for reducing flood loss at wuzhou section for mu type and wb type floods and two objectives for reducing flood loss on the tributaries and the mainstream for md type floods in scenario fad 2030 the single objective value of flood loss at wuzhou section for mu type floods is 3 87 10 8 which is smaller than that for wb type floods 2 28 10 9 the corresponding parameters are selected as the fad operating rules for mu type and wb type floods the pareto front of multi objective optimization for md type floods is shown in fig 6 the point a denotes a solution whereby five flood control sections on the tributaries are safe and the corresponding parameters are selected as the fad operating rules for md type floods besides the objective values for md type floods in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 are not shown in fig 6 due to large difference in the order of magnitude but all of them are in the dominated region of the pareto front in scenario fad 2030 the fad operating rules of three flood types in scenario fad 2030 are shown in fig 7 the total release from fad operating rules can be allocated for individual reservoirs based on decomposition strategy 4 3 reservoir operation results as cor remains unchanged from the status quo year to the perspective year 2030 the simulation results of four reservoirs baise laokou longtan and qingshitan are the same in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 the operation of longtan reservoir in 1998 md type floods is divided into four periods a b c and d in fig 8 the reservoir water level increased in scenario fad 2030 during period a and c due to the reduction in the flood peak discharge with fad operating rules while that remains largely unchanged with the equilibrium between inflow and release during period b and d in general the release in scenario fad 2030 is smoother and lower than that in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 resulting in a higher water level in scenario fad 2030 however the maximum water level at longtan reservoir in scenario fad 2030 is within the flood control water level fcwl in general fad operating rules could make full use of the flood control capacity of longtan reservoir the maximum release and water level of baise reservoir example of four reservoirs for the status quo year in three scenarios for three flood types are presented as box plots fig 9 the box plots in scenario co sqy are the same as those in scenario co 2030 due to same cor fig 9a shows that the median maximum release of baise reservoir in scenario fad 2030 is lower than that in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 indicating less flood loss at the downstream section nanning fig 9b shows that the median maximum water level of baise reservoir in scenario fad 2030 is higher than that in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 but lower than the fcwl it means that baise reservoir could store more water in flood season to protect the downstream section nanning and the maximum water level is lower than fcwl this further demonstrates the advantages of fad operating rules the maximum water levels of datengxia fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs examples of six reservoirs for the perspective year 2030 in scenarios co 2030 and fad 2030 for three flood types are shown in fig 10 the maximum water level of datengxia reservoir in scenario co 2030 exceeds fcwl for two years 1998 and 2005 in md type floods damage that is more serious for fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs because all their medians in scenario co 2030 for three flood types are higher than fcwls the flood control capacities of fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs are occupied up to 8 million m3 268 97 m in 1978 mu type floods and 2 million m3 268 24 m in 1996 wb type floods respectively these results indicate that the designed cor of the datengxia fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs in scenario co 2030 have insufficient flood control capacity for floods as flwl and fcwl of reservoir cannot be changed the flood control capacity also cannot be increased thus the conventional operation of these reservoirs need to be modified with more cooperation 4 4 comparison of flood control sections fig 11 shows the box plots of the maximum streamflow at six flood control sections in three scenarios and the lowest median maximum streamflow is usually observed in scenario fad 2030 followed by scenarios co 2030 and co sqy the box plot of the maximum streamflow at nanning and qianjiang sections in scenario co sqy is the same as that in scenario co 2030 as no new reservoirs are built in yujiang and hongshuihe a lower median maximum streamflow is preferred due to less flood loss at downstream sections the maximum streamflow at nanning qianjiang wuxuan and liuzhou sections for three flood types are within the safe discharges in the three scenarios the median maximum streamflow at nanning section in scenario fad 2030 for mu type floods is higher than that in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 but also below the safe discharge the median maximum streamflow at liuzhou section is high in scenario co sqy due to no reservoir for flood control for the status quo year but that in scenario co 2030 for three flood types are much lower due to reservoir flood control operation of yangxi and luojiu reservoirs furthermore the median maximum streamflow at wuzhou section the outlet of the xijiang river basin in scenario fad 2030 are the lowest among three scenarios fig 12 shows the variation of streamflow at wuzhou section in 1998 md type floods in three scenarios the natural flood peak discharge at wuzhou section is 52 900 m3 s which far exceeds the safe discharge 41 200 m3 s it could be reduced to 43 290 m3 s in scenario co sqy which however still exceeds the safe discharge it could be further decreased to 40 030 m3 s and 38 720 m3 s in scenarios co 2030 and fad 2030 respectively which are below the safe discharge evidently the minimum flood peak discharge at wuzhou section can be observed by fad operating rules in scenario fad 2030 5 conclusions a novel method based on flood classification aggregation decomposition known as fad is proposed to derive reservoir operating rules for the large scale mixed reservoir system in the xijiang river basin and its performance in the safety of reservoir operation and the peak flow reduction at flood control sections is compared with cor this method involves three steps of flood classification model agdp model and pso framework some important conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the pp model coupled with ga is suitable for flood classification flood classification is found to be useful in the derivation of reservoir operating rules since it can better adapt for flood variability 2 the agdp method can avoid the curse of dimensionality and excessive demands on computing time the aggregation step serves to aggregate several reservoirs in the same tributary into a virtual reservoir and the subsequent decomposition step can divide the total release of the virtual reservoir to individual reservoirs 3 fad operating rules in scenario fad 2030 outperform cor in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 for three flood types as it considers flood variability and the trade offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream whereas fixed cor only considers the flood loss of its downstream section in this paper flood classification plays an important role in deriving fad operating rules however it remains unclear what kind of reservoir operating rules should be used for future floods thus more effort should be devoted to the integration of flood forecasting and selection of fad operating rules in the

high dimensional data into low dimensional data for classification and it is used for flood classification in this paper the main procedures are shown as follows 1 normalization of flood indexes normalization of flood index can be realized by the following formula to eliminate dimension of each index value and unify range of each index value a1 x ij x ij x j min x j max x j min where x ij corresponds to the flood index x ij after normalization and x j min x j max denote the minimum and maximum of jth flood index 2 simulation of projection value the main idea of the pp method is to transform p dimensional data x ij j 1 2 p to one dimensional projection value z i by projection direction a2 z i j 1 p x ij a j a j 1 1 where a j j 1 2 p are the parameters of the projection direction 3 construction of projection index function a3 q a s a d a where s a is the distance function between clusters which denotes the standard derivation of projection values z i corresponding to flood sample sets and d a denotes the density function of clusters a4 s a i 1 k z i z 2 n 1 1 2 a5 d a i 1 k t 1 k r r i t f r r i t where z i 1 k z i n r i t z i z t i t 1 2 k r denotes the window radius

6845,the potential of aggregation decomposition agdp for flood control of mixed reservoir system remains unclear due to the flood variability and complex hydraulic connections in this study we develop

common natural hazards that could cause severe losses of human life and property wang et al 2016 2015 reservoir construction and operation is a practical approach to mitigate flood disasters hui et al 2010 labadie 2004 plate 2002 however reservoir flood control operation is a very complex issue since it should cater to multiple conflicting objectives and flood variability cheng and chau 2002 liu et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 the main purpose of reservoir flood control operation is to decide how much water should be released now and how much water should be retained for future use a wide variety of methods such as implicit stochastic optimization iso young 1967 explicit stochastic optimization eso and parameterization simulation optimization pso celeste and billib 2009 have been applied for reservoir flood control operation each of which however has its potential advantages and drawbacks for example the application of iso can be limited because perfect forecast is required for deterministic reservoir operation karamouz and houck 1982 eso incorporates the inflow probability into the optimization process such as stochastic dynamic programming sdp huang et al 1991 nevertheless sdp is less applicable to large scale multi reservoir systems due to its curse of dimensionality and computational complexity yeh 1985 in order to resolve these problems the shape of reservoir operating rules is predefined in pso then heuristic algorithms are used for the optimization of reservoir operating rules and the complex simulation model could be replaced by the surrogate model for simplification zhang et al 2016 chu et al 2015 oliveira and loucks 1997 the aggregation decomposition agdp method was proposed by turgeon 1980 to solve the curse of dimensionality in a large scale hydropower reservoir system and since then it has been used for multi reservoir operation optimization duran et al 1985 li et al 2014 liu et al 2011b a salient feature of agdp is to aggregate multiple reservoirs into a virtual reservoir making it possible to simplify the multi reservoir operation into single reservoir operation the reservoirs in a hydropower system are aggregated in energy units li et al 2014 liu et al 2011b valdes et al 1992 and the optimal total output can be allocated to individual reservoirs using neural networks saad et al 1996 saad et al 1994 empirical equation li et al 2014 inflow or installed capacity rate zhang et al 2016 in practice fixed reservoir operating rules are often applied to cope with all kinds of floods with different magnitudes and spatial distributions resulting in less favorable outcomes for a large scale river basin the location of the rainstorm center has an impact on the reservoir flood control operation and thus specific reservoir operating rules should be designed to adapt for the flood variability more water should be released in the reservoir where the rainstorm center is located to reserve more capacity for the coming floods whereas less water should be released in other reservoirs to store more water for future hydropower generation and water supply in dry seasons floods can be classified into different types based on some meteorological e g temperature and hydrological e g flood peak discharge factors merz and bl√∂schl 2003 used atmospheric inputs rainfall and basin states soil moisture to classify floods across austria the floods generated by the weather generator coupled with the rainfall runoff model in two alpine catchments in austria and france were classified based on temperature and precipitation indicators by cluster analysis turkington et al 2016 hundecha et al 2017 used the spatial extent and process for flood classification in europe however these studies mainly focused on formative factors such as temperature and precipitation in flood forecasting to our knowledge little research has focused on the important effect of flood classification on reservoir operation due to the unpredictable and variable nature of floods in addition considerable attention has been given to the optimization of reservoir operation for the specific short term forecasted floods huang et al 2014 celeste and billib 2012 applied iso to derive reservoir operating rules for a single reservoir with different predicted mean monthly inflows for the next few months however there are little research about the reservoir operating rules for different magnitudes and spatial distributions of floods for multi reservoir system the flood is extremely variable in the respect of flood magnitude and spatial distribution for floods with different magnitude or different spatial distribution the reservoirs should have different behaviors to handle it thus we should find different behaviors of reservoirs for different flood in this study the flood classification model is used to divide historical floods by the magnitude and spatial distribution so that specific reservoir operating rules could be derived to adapt for flood variability projection pursuit pp and fuzzy clustering analysis were used in the flood classification model shu and burn 2004 both of which could project high dimensional data into lower dimensional data many multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas have been developed for multi objective optimization problems deb et al 2002 giuliani et al 2015 hadka and reed 2012 lei et al 2018 vrugt et al 2003 for example the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 is widely used to solve constrained multi objective problems with the non dominated sorting and the crowding distance multi objective shuffled complex evolution metropolis moscem vrugt et al 2003 uses pareto dominance to produce solutions in stable distribution pareto set giuliani et al 2015 proposed evolutionary multi objective direct policy search emodps that combined direct policy search nonlinear approximating networks and multi objective evolutionary algorithms to design pareto approximate closed loop operating policies this paper first contributes to deriving fad operating rules of large scale mixed reservoir system by combining flood classification model agdp model and parameterization simulation optimization pso framework secondly this paper provides a new insight into specific reservoir operating rules for flood variability the pp model coupled with ga performed very well in flood classification model thirdly the curse of dimensionality and excessive demands for large scale reservoir system are solved by the agdp model coupled with piecewise linear function finally the trade offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream is considered in the derivation of fad operating rules a case study was performed with a large scale mixed reservoir system in the xijiang river basin china the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the flood classification model agdp model and pso framework section 3 addresses a case study of ten flood control reservoirs in the xijiang river basin china then the results of flood classification fad operating rules and reservoir operation in three scenarios conventional operation for the status quo year co sqy conventional operation for the perspective year 2030 co 2030 and fad operation for the perspective year 2030 fad 2030 are shown and discussed in section 4 finally conclusions are given in section 5 2 methodology the fad method considering flood variability and the trade offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream is illustrated in fig 1 the procedures are elaborated as follows 1 flood classification model floods are classified into several types by pp model coupled with ga according to the magnitude and spatial distribution of floods 2 aggregation decomposition agdp model all reservoirs in the same tributary are aggregated into a virtual reservoir the total release of the virtual aggregated reservoir could be determined by piecewise linear operating rules and then it could be decomposed for individual reservoirs 3 parameterization simulation optimization framework pso fad operating rules can be determined by nsga ii considering the trade offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream 2 1 flood classification model currently there is no universally accepted standard for flood classification liao et al 2012 for a single reservoir the magnitude of inflow is usually used as the only index for flood classification celeste and billib 2012 for a multi reservoir system there are a variety of indexes for flood classification including the flood peak occurrence time flood peak discharge storm duration runoff response dynamics and spatial coherence merz and bl√∂schl 2003 merz and bl√∂schl 2008 however the flood peak occurrence time and flood peak discharge are the two most important indexes for flood classification pp is a multivariate data analysis method that can transform high dimensional data into one dimensional data by optimal projection direction and it is often used for flood classification friedman and tukey 1974 huang and zhang 2011 jin et al 2003 a critical challenge in pp is the construction of the projection index function to search for the optimal projection direction friedman and tukey 1974 for floods in a large river basin the flood peak occurrence time and flood peak discharge at several flood control sections constitute the vector of flood indexes x i x i 1 x i j x i p j 1 p corresponding to ith flood hydrograph for k hydrographs the vectors of flood indexes x i i 1 2 k constitute the following high dimensional matrix 1 x x 1 1 x 1 j x 1 p x i 1 x i j x i p x k 1 x k j x k p i 1 2 k j 1 2 p where the element x i j is the jth flood index in ith flood hydrograph and k and p are the number of flood hydrographs and flood indexes respectively pp coupled with ga can search the best projection direction to obtain one dimensional projection values which could be used for flood classification the detailed procedure of pp coupled ga for flood classification is described in appendix a and the experimental setup of ga is shown in appendix b 2 2 aggregation decomposition model the agdp model is widely used for multi reservoir hydropower operation liu et al 2011b valdes et al 1992 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 but seldom for multi reservoir flood control operation the basic idea of the agdp model is to aggregate all the reservoirs in the same tributary into a virtual reservoir to determine the optimal total output which is then allocated to individual reservoirs saad et al 1994 2 2 1 aggregated reservoir conceptually the reservoirs in a large scale mixed reservoir system can be aggregated into several virtual ones that can preserve and describe some features of these reservoir without considering the interactions the reservoirs are aggregated in water units rather than in energy units the flood forecasting of several periods for the aggregated reservoir should be considered in aggregation 2 v i t n 1 n v n t j 0 j i n t j Œ¥ t where v i t is the storage of the aggregated virtual reservoir i at the beginning of time period t with j periods of forecasted inflows at the beginning of time period t v n t is the storage of the reservoir n at the beginning of time period t i n t is the inflow of the reservoir n during time period t Œ¥ t is the time interval n j are the number of reservoirs and flood forecasting periods during aggregation respectively 2 2 2 decomposition strategy many decomposition strategies have been used in the agdp model to allocate the optimal total output of the virtual reservoir for individual reservoirs zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2011b used the fitting function as the decomposition pattern based on the deterministic optimal operation li et al 2014 used genetic programming gp to determine decomposition strategy the percentage of total installed capacity was used as the decomposition method in multi reservoir hydropower operation zhang et al 2016 similarly the percentage of forecasted inflow is selected as the decomposition method for reservoir flood control operation which is shown as follows 3 r n t r i t t t j i n t i 1 n t t j i n t where r i t is the total output of an aggregated virtual reservoir i during time period t and r n t is the output of individual reservoir n during time period t 2 3 parameterization simulation optimization framework the pso framework is used to derive optimal reservoir operating rules for the large scale mixed reservoir system without deterministic reservoir operation as the piecewise linear function liu et al 2011a zhang et al 2015 is often used as the reservoir operating rules for flood control the piecewise linear function is selected as the form of aggregated virtual reservoir which is defined as follows 4 r i t a i 1 v i t b i 1 v i min v i t v i t a i 2 v i t b i 2 v i t v i t v i max where a i 1 b i 1 a i 2 b i 2 are the parameters of slope and intercept of the piecewise linear regression to be optimized the value of the turning point v i t is determined by the intersection and v i min v i max are the allowable minimum and maximum reservoir storage of the aggregated virtual reservoir i inputs of piecewise linear operating rules includes the storage of the aggregated virtual reservoir i at the beginning of time period t with j periods of forecasted inflows during time period t output is the total release of the virtual aggregated reservoir during time period t the reservoirs which are aggregated as the virtual aggregated reservoir share the same function with same parameter values however different virtual aggregated reservoirs have the same function but different parameter values 2 3 1 objective functions the large scale mixed reservoir operation optimization model aims to minimize the flood loss at flood control sections on tributaries and the mainstream as expressed in eqs 5 and 6 respectively as the importance of tributaries is the same but not as important as the mainstream the flood loss of each tributary could be lumped as the total flood loss of tributaries the first objective is to minimize the accumulated squared deviations of overflow at all flood control sections on the tributaries 5 min q 1 min m 1 m t 1 t q m t q m s 2 n m t where q 1 is the accumulated squared deviations of overflow at all flood control sections on the tributaries m t is the number of flood control sections on the tributaries and the number of time periods respectively q m t is the streamflow at flood control section m during time period t n m t is the binary variables which is taken to be 1 when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharge and to be 0 when the streamflow is within the safe discharge at flood control section m q m s is the safe discharge at flood control station m the second objective is to minimize the accumulated squared deviations of overflow at flood control section on the mainstream 6 min q 2 min t 1 t q f t q f s 2 n f t where q 2 is the accumulated squared deviations of overflow at the flood control section on the mainstream q f t is the streamflow at the flood control section on the mainstream during time period t n f t is the binary variables which is taken to be 1 when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharge and to be 0 when the streamflow is within the safe discharge at flood control section on the mainstream and q f s is the safe discharge at the flood control section on the mainstream 2 3 2 constraints the water balance equation reservoir water level limits release capacity safe discharges at the flood control stations boundary conditions and channel routing constraints are as follows 7 i n t i n t 1 2 Œ¥ t r n t r n t 1 2 Œ¥ t v n t 1 v n t 8 z n min z n t z n max 9 r n t r n max t 10 z n i n i t z n f l w l 11 q z t c 0 r t c 1 r t 1 c 2 q z t 1 where z n min z n max are the minimum and maximum allowable water level of reservoir n at the beginning of time period t respectively r n max t is the maximum release of reservoir n during time period t which is often associated with spillways z n i n i t is the initial water level of reservoir n at the beginning of reservoir flood control operation z n f l w l is the flood limited water level flwl of reservoir n for flood control and c 0 c 1 c 2 are the channel routing coefficients in the muskingum method it is assumed that there is no water loss from evaporation the well known nsga ii is used in this paper for the derivation of fad operating rules of large scale mixed reservoir system however it is important to note that many other multi objective optimization algorithms such as emodps giuliani et al 2015 can also be used for the same purpose the experimental setup of nsga ii is described in appendix b 3 case study the xijiang river is the third longest river in china after the yangtze river and the yellow river and its main tributaries include yujiang hongshuihe liujiang qianjiang xunjiang and guijiang fig 2 the xijiang river basin often suffers from flood disasters due to the unevenly temporal and spatial distribution of floods and mountainous topography the reservoir flood control operation in the xijiang river basin aims to reduce flood loss at six flood control sections nanning qianjiang liuzhou wuxuan guilin and wuzhou the safe discharges of these flood control sections are shown in table 1 the wuzhou section on the mainstream is considered separately due to its important role for guangdong province and the other five flood control sections on the tributaries are considered together for simplification the large scale mixed reservoir system in the xijiang river basin is schematically shown in fig 3 there are four reservoirs baise laokou longtan and qingshitan in the xijiang river basin for flood control for the status quo year and six reservoirs yangxi luojiu datengxia fuzikou chuanjiang and xiaorongjiang are added for flood control for the perspective year 2030 the primary goal of these ten reservoirs during flood season is flood control for non flood season baise laokou longtan datengxia and yangxi reservoirs aim for hydropower generation and navigation and the other five reservoirs luojiu qingshitan chuanjiang xiaorongjiang and fuzikou aim for water supply and irrigation the basic parameters of these ten reservoirs for flood control are shown in table 2 conventional operating rules cor of these reservoirs are designed individually which are provided by guangxi water and power design institute the cor of the longtan reservoir is selected as an example in table 3 the release of the longtan reservoir was determined by the forecasted streamflow at the wuzhou section when the forecasted streamflow at the wuzhou section was increased to be higher than 25 000 m3 s the reservoir release was limited within 4 000 m3 s if the forecasted streamflow was declined to be lower than 42 000 m3 s the reservoir release equaled to the inflow three scenarios co sqy co 2030 and fad 2030 are set for the comparison of reservoir flood control operation corresponding to the conventional operation of four reservoirs for the status quo year the conventional operation of ten reservoirs for the perspective year 2030 and the flood classification aggregation decomposition operation for the perspective year 2030 respectively as there are thousands of hydrological stations in the xijiang river basin with a drainage area of 352 400 km2 it is difficult to obtain the flood data of all hydrological stations we selected 15 typical flood hydrographs 1962 1966 1968 1970 1974 1976 1978 1983 1988 1994 1996 1998 2001 2002 and 2005 with a time step of 1 h which could well reflect the various magnitude and spatial distribution of floods as the dahuangjiangkou section is important in the xunjiang the streamflow variation at seven sections nanning qianjiang liuzhou wuxuan guilin wuzhou and dahuangjiangkou of 15 typical flood hydrographs are shown by graphs in supplementary data it should be noted that the typical flood hydrographs are observed with the same time step 1 h for different lengths of time 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of three flood types the flood peak occurrence time and flood peak discharge of seven sections are selected as the indexes for flood classification yielding a total of 14 indexes for the single flood hydrograph table 4 as the length of typical flood hydrographs differs from each other the flood peak occurrence time should be converted to radians as follows 12 x ij d ij 2 œÄ l i where d ij is the flood peak occurrence time of section j in flood hydrograph ith and l i is the length of flood hydrograph ith the optimal projection direction obtained by ga is 0 504 0 321 0 135 0 764 0 189 0 526 0 243 0 333 0 591 0 157 0 154 0 965 0 585 1 000 shown in table 4 the projection values of the 15 typical flood hydrographs can be simulated by optimal projection direction ranging from 0 3 to 2 6 as shown in fig 4 the larger projection values distributed widely while smaller projection values distributed rather closely to distribute the projection values uniformly two empirical values 0 8 and 1 5 were selected as the thresholds based on experience and former researches cheng et al 2009 dong et al 2007 huang and zhang 2011 as shown in table 5 the 15 typical flood hydrographs can be classified into 3 flood types based on two empirical thresholds including the middle and upstream flood type mu the whole basin flood type wb and the middle and downstream flood type md the normalized flood peak discharges of seven sections are plotted separately the upward convex curve for the mu type floods is shown in fig 5 a the cubic function curve for the wb type floods is shown in fig 5b and the concave downward curve for the md type floods is shown in fig 5c respectively thus we can also classify floods based on the matching degree of the three trend lines in fig 5 with the normalized maximum streamflow of the seven sections three typical flood hydrographs in 1966 1968 and 1998 are selected as examples the proportion of the flood peak discharge at wuzhou section attributed to the flood peak discharges at six sections on the tributaries in 1966 1968 and 1998 are shown in table 6 in 1966 mu type floods the maximum proportion of the flood peak discharge at wuzhou section is 95 58 at dahuangjiangkou section while the minimum one is 3 97 at guilin section in 1998 md type floods the maximum proportion of the flood peak discharge at wuzhou section is 78 08 at dahuangjiangkou section while the minimum one is 10 98 at guilin section in 1968 wb type floods the proportion of the flood peak discharge at dahuangjiangkou and guilin sections in that at wuzhou section is between that in 1966 mu type floods and 1998 md type floods as dahuangjiangkou and guilin sections are located in the central and lower basin respectively the results indicate that when the flood peak discharge at the central basin section is close to that at the outlet the floods can be classified as mu type floods the md type floods indicate that the local streamflow between the central basin section and the outlet constitutes a large proportion of flood peak discharge at the outlet the wb type floods occur in the whole river basin i e flood on tributaries resulting in flood at the outlet on the mainstream 4 2 fad operating rules in scenario fad 2030 the reservoirs in the same tributary such as two cascade baise laokou reservoirs in yujiang two parallel yangxi luojiu reservoirs in liujiang and four parallel qingshitan fuzikou chuanjiang and xiaorongjiang reservoirs in guijiang can be aggregated into three virtual reservoirs as piecewise linear operating rules are set for the virtual actual reservoir the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the turning point and endpoint are four parameters to be optimized as there are three aggregated virtual reservoirs and two actual reservoirs longtan reservoir in hongshuihe and datengxia reservoir in qianjiang there are 20 parameters for each flood type and a total of 60 parameters for the three flood types to be optimized the initial storage of each reservoir is corresponding to the initial reservoir water level i e flwl the detailed experimental setup of optimization algorithms ga and nsga ii for fad operating rules has been shown in appendix b the optimization time of fad operating rules for three types of flood is approximately equal to one hour it should also be noted that the maximum streamflow of five flood control sections nanning qianjiang liuzhou wuxuan and guilin on the tributaries in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 are below their safe discharges for mu type and wb type floods in addition the wuzhou section could be damaged for all three flood types therefore there is only a single objective for reducing flood loss at wuzhou section for mu type and wb type floods and two objectives for reducing flood loss on the tributaries and the mainstream for md type floods in scenario fad 2030 the single objective value of flood loss at wuzhou section for mu type floods is 3 87 10 8 which is smaller than that for wb type floods 2 28 10 9 the corresponding parameters are selected as the fad operating rules for mu type and wb type floods the pareto front of multi objective optimization for md type floods is shown in fig 6 the point a denotes a solution whereby five flood control sections on the tributaries are safe and the corresponding parameters are selected as the fad operating rules for md type floods besides the objective values for md type floods in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 are not shown in fig 6 due to large difference in the order of magnitude but all of them are in the dominated region of the pareto front in scenario fad 2030 the fad operating rules of three flood types in scenario fad 2030 are shown in fig 7 the total release from fad operating rules can be allocated for individual reservoirs based on decomposition strategy 4 3 reservoir operation results as cor remains unchanged from the status quo year to the perspective year 2030 the simulation results of four reservoirs baise laokou longtan and qingshitan are the same in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 the operation of longtan reservoir in 1998 md type floods is divided into four periods a b c and d in fig 8 the reservoir water level increased in scenario fad 2030 during period a and c due to the reduction in the flood peak discharge with fad operating rules while that remains largely unchanged with the equilibrium between inflow and release during period b and d in general the release in scenario fad 2030 is smoother and lower than that in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 resulting in a higher water level in scenario fad 2030 however the maximum water level at longtan reservoir in scenario fad 2030 is within the flood control water level fcwl in general fad operating rules could make full use of the flood control capacity of longtan reservoir the maximum release and water level of baise reservoir example of four reservoirs for the status quo year in three scenarios for three flood types are presented as box plots fig 9 the box plots in scenario co sqy are the same as those in scenario co 2030 due to same cor fig 9a shows that the median maximum release of baise reservoir in scenario fad 2030 is lower than that in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 indicating less flood loss at the downstream section nanning fig 9b shows that the median maximum water level of baise reservoir in scenario fad 2030 is higher than that in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 but lower than the fcwl it means that baise reservoir could store more water in flood season to protect the downstream section nanning and the maximum water level is lower than fcwl this further demonstrates the advantages of fad operating rules the maximum water levels of datengxia fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs examples of six reservoirs for the perspective year 2030 in scenarios co 2030 and fad 2030 for three flood types are shown in fig 10 the maximum water level of datengxia reservoir in scenario co 2030 exceeds fcwl for two years 1998 and 2005 in md type floods damage that is more serious for fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs because all their medians in scenario co 2030 for three flood types are higher than fcwls the flood control capacities of fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs are occupied up to 8 million m3 268 97 m in 1978 mu type floods and 2 million m3 268 24 m in 1996 wb type floods respectively these results indicate that the designed cor of the datengxia fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs in scenario co 2030 have insufficient flood control capacity for floods as flwl and fcwl of reservoir cannot be changed the flood control capacity also cannot be increased thus the conventional operation of these reservoirs need to be modified with more cooperation 4 4 comparison of flood control sections fig 11 shows the box plots of the maximum streamflow at six flood control sections in three scenarios and the lowest median maximum streamflow is usually observed in scenario fad 2030 followed by scenarios co 2030 and co sqy the box plot of the maximum streamflow at nanning and qianjiang sections in scenario co sqy is the same as that in scenario co 2030 as no new reservoirs are built in yujiang and hongshuihe a lower median maximum streamflow is preferred due to less flood loss at downstream sections the maximum streamflow at nanning qianjiang wuxuan and liuzhou sections for three flood types are within the safe discharges in the three scenarios the median maximum streamflow at nanning section in scenario fad 2030 for mu type floods is higher than that in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 but also below the safe discharge the median maximum streamflow at liuzhou section is high in scenario co sqy due to no reservoir for flood control for the status quo year but that in scenario co 2030 for three flood types are much lower due to reservoir flood control operation of yangxi and luojiu reservoirs furthermore the median maximum streamflow at wuzhou section the outlet of the xijiang river basin in scenario fad 2030 are the lowest among three scenarios fig 12 shows the variation of streamflow at wuzhou section in 1998 md type floods in three scenarios the natural flood peak discharge at wuzhou section is 52 900 m3 s which far exceeds the safe discharge 41 200 m3 s it could be reduced to 43 290 m3 s in scenario co sqy which however still exceeds the safe discharge it could be further decreased to 40 030 m3 s and 38 720 m3 s in scenarios co 2030 and fad 2030 respectively which are below the safe discharge evidently the minimum flood peak discharge at wuzhou section can be observed by fad operating rules in scenario fad 2030 5 conclusions a novel method based on flood classification aggregation decomposition known as fad is proposed to derive reservoir operating rules for the large scale mixed reservoir system in the xijiang river basin and its performance in the safety of reservoir operation and the peak flow reduction at flood control sections is compared with cor this method involves three steps of flood classification model agdp model and pso framework some important conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the pp model coupled with ga is suitable for flood classification flood classification is found to be useful in the derivation of reservoir operating rules since it can better adapt for flood variability 2 the agdp method can avoid the curse of dimensionality and excessive demands on computing time the aggregation step serves to aggregate several reservoirs in the same tributary into a virtual reservoir and the subsequent decomposition step can divide the total release of the virtual reservoir to individual reservoirs 3 fad operating rules in scenario fad 2030 outperform cor in scenarios co sqy and co 2030 for three flood types as it considers flood variability and the trade offs between flood loss of the tributaries and that of the mainstream whereas fixed cor only considers the flood loss of its downstream section in this paper flood classification plays an important role in deriving fad operating rules however it remains unclear what kind of reservoir operating rules should be used for future floods thus more effort should be devoted to the integration of flood forecasting and selection of fad operating rules in the

high dimensional data into low dimensional data for classification and it is used for flood classification in this paper the main procedures are shown as follows 1 normalization of flood indexes normalization of flood index can be realized by the following formula to eliminate dimension of each index value and unify range of each index value a1 x ij x ij x j min x j max x j min where x ij

6846,the pearl river delta prd is one of the most economically dynamic regions of china and has experienced rapid urbanization during the past decades in this study the effect of urbanization on summer rainfall events in the prd region is investigated using the advanced weather research and forecasting wrf model two comparative urban scenarios 2015 and 1991 were designed to test the sensitivity of summer rainfall to urbanization the results indicate that the wrf model reasonably reproduces the general synoptic weather pattern particularly for air temperature and relative humidity further comparative analysis reveals that extreme rainfall significantly increased in urban areas while the total summer rainfall slight decreased urbanization causes changes in the surface energy balance resulting in more sensible heat flux and less latent heat flux the decreased latent heat flux dampens the moisture availability and results in the decline of the maximum convective available potential energy which lead to the decrease of the total summer rainfall in contrast the increased sensible heat flux enhances the urban surface temperature and boundary layer circulations e g elevated planetary boundary layer height and higher level of free convection and lifted condensation level and carries more water mixing vapor into the atmosphere over urban areas enhancing the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall the results suggest that urbanization plays an important role in the urban change of summer rainfall and causes more extreme rainfall events thereby

ucm modeling performs well in the simulation of mesoscale weather systems because of the full physics scheme options zhang et al 2014 campos and wang 2015 fig 1 shows the double nested model domains

september 1 the first 24 hour period for each simulation is regarded to be a spin up period that is not considered in the following analyses the initial and boundary conditions were provided by fnl data with 1 spatial resolution and 6 hour temporal resolution from the national centers for environmental prediction wang et al 2012 yang et al 2014b the physics schemes used in this study mainly include the lin microphysical scheme lin et al 1983 kain fritsch cumulus scheme kain and fritsch 1993 in d01 no cumulus parameterization scheme was used in d02 and yonsei university pbl scheme hong et al 2006 the noah land surface model is coupled with a single layer urban canopy model slucm to facilitate the simulation of the thermodynamic properties chen et al 2011 see table 1 to evaluate the effects of urban expansion on the summer rainfall in the prd two urban scenarios i e land use in 1991 and 2015 were used for comparison of the rainfall contribution of urbanization fig 2 shows that the land use scenarios in the 1991 and 2015 categories were derived from high resolution satellite imagery landsat 5 and 8 and classified into three subcategories according to the impervious rates ir low intensity residential ir 0 5 high intensity residential 0 5 ir 0 8 and commercial industrial ir 0 8 the urban and built up areas show a significant increase during the past decade especially in

urban environments impacts the urban surface energy budget and moisture sailor 2011 we did not incorporate new anthropogenic heat data but used the default ahr and its diurnal variation coefficient in the wrf ucm models for our simulations 2 2 2 error analysis the model performance was evaluated by using the mean error me root mean squared error rmse and correlation coefficient cc which are calculated as follows 1 m e j 1 t j 1 t si m i j o b s i j 100 2 rms e j 1 t j 1 t si m i j o b s i j 2 3 c c j i 1 t ob s i j obs si m i j sim i 1 t ob s i j obs 2 i 1 t si m i j sim 2 where t is the time period ob s i j represents the ith observation for the jth station and si m i j represents the ith simulation at the jth grid point 3 results 3 1 model validation generally simulation errors of the air temperature and relative humidity may have an important impact on the simulation results of regional rainfall therefore statistical comparisons between the observations and model simulations of 2 m temperature t2 and 2 m relative humidity rh2 were firstly conducted using the mb rmse and cc tables 2 and 3 present the results of model validation in terms of t2 and rh2 respectively the wrf simulates the summer t2 reasonably well with a mb below 2 0 c except for qy rmse with a small range of 1 29 2 97 and large cc of 0 51 0 68 similarly the wrf model reproduces the summer rh2 for most of the stations at the mean annual scale well the mb and rmse range from 9 26 to 7 51 and from 6 92 to 11 43 respectively the cc values are all higher than 0 5 significant at the 0 01 level indicating good agreement between the model simulations and observations fig 3 displays the spatial distributions of extreme daily rainfall 95th percentile during rainy days and mean daily rainfall simulated by the wrf model and that from the trmm data during 2013 2015 the wrf reasonably reproduces the extreme daily rainfall events over the study region with the largest extreme rainfall occurring in the prd urban area fig 3a and c the mean daily rainfall from the trmm is significantly larger in the urban region than in any other region of the prd in contrast the mean daily rainfall simulated by the wrf model shows a strong spatial variability with large mean daily rainfall dispersed over a wide region including the prd overall the wrf model slightly overestimates both the extreme and mean daily rainfall compared with the trmm which is probably due to the simulation biases of t2 and rh2 caused by the initial meteorological and boundary conditions of the model the simulation bias can be regarded as systematic model error and might have little effect on long running climate simulations wang et al 2012 wang et al 2014b yang et al 2014b in addition the discrepancies between the spatial resolution of the trmm 25 km and wrf 4 km might also introduce uncertainties to the evaluation of the wrf performance nevertheless there is a generally consistency between the simulation and observation in the prd region in which the wrf model can reproduce the extreme summer climate events during the study period 3 2 changes in summer rainfall fig 4 shows the spatial changes in the average summer rainfall extreme rainfall intensity 99th percentile of the daily rainfall series and median rainfall intensity 50th percentile of the daily rainfall series between the 2015 and 1991 scenarios the average summer rainfall shows a large spatial heterogeneity over the study area according to the simulation results for the prd region the average summer rainfall decreased by 3 91 in 2013 7 97 in 2014 and 1 15 in 2015 respectively relative to 1991 decreasing average summer rainfall is mainly observed in the northwestern region while increase is mainly determined in the northeastern and southwestern regions compared with the average summer rainfall the extreme rainfall intensity significantly increases up to 50 mm day in most parts of the prd especially in the urban core e g guangzhou and southwestern region these results indicate that changes in the average summer rainfall and extreme rainfall intensity are very sensitive to the urbanization of the prd region in contrast the median rainfall intensity 50th percentile of the daily rainfall series shows little changes in the study area and is insensitive to the urbanization of the study area to further detect changes in the summer rainfall due to urbanization the rainfall events in summer were classified into five categories wang et al 2014a b extreme rainfall above 100 mm day rainstorm 50 1 100 mm day heavy rainfall 25 1 50 mm day moderate rainfall 10 25 mm day and light rainfall 0 1 10 mm day the relative changes of the five different rainfall events in the prd region between the 2015 and 1991 scenarios are shown in fig 5 the magnitude of extreme rainfall above 100 mm day shows a noticeable increase with an average increase of 4 19 while the magnitude of rainstorms 50 1 100 mm day increases by 3 04 on average in contrast changes in heavy rainfall 25 1 50 mm day show a large range from 25 81 to 13 91 which highlights the uncertainty in the assessment of urban change of heavy rainfall overall the magnitude of heavy rainfall shows an average decrease of 5 95 in 2015 compared with 1991 similarly moderate rainfall 10 25 mm day and light rainfall 0 1 10 mm day also exhibit an average decrease of 3 87 and 1 70 respectively in summary the above mentioned analysis indicates that the magnitudes of extreme rainfall and rainstorm events increased in the prd region due to urbanization however heavy moderate and light rainfall events slightly decreased 3 3 changes of the thermodynamic variables and pbl height fig 6 shows the changes of maximum convective available potential energy mcape level of free convection lfc lifted condensation level lcl planetary boundary layer height pblh and maximum convective inhibition micn in 2015 compared with 1991 fig 6a shows that the magnitude of mcape decreases by more than 100 j kg in the prd region especially in central urban areas such as guangzhou and foshan up to 450 j kg on the contrary the magnitude of mcin increased across the urban areas including guangzhou foshan and dongguan at a maximum of 15 j kg fig 6e in general the decrease in mcape changes the spatial distribution of convection initiation in the urban environment and alters the evolution of preexisting convection zhang et al 2014 these changes can be attributed to the decreased latent heat flux lhf fig 7 a and increased sensible heat flux shf fig 7b both the lfc fig 6b and lcl fig 6c exhibit a significant increase in the central urban area of the prd region i e guangzhou and foshan the pblh increases by more than 400 m in the urban area of the prd region fig 6d which is directly linked to the shf changes fig 8 b the increased shf caused by urbanization can alter the key thermodynamic variables e g pblh and lfc lcl which increases the possibility of cloud formation and ultimately enhances the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall in urban areas shem and shepherd 2009 3 4 changes of the 2 m temperature relative humidity and water mixing ratio fig 8 shows the spatial changes of the average summer temperature 2 m relative humidity 2 m water vapor ratio and high layer water vapor ratio in the prd region in 2015 compared with 1991 fig 8a shows that there is a common warming trend across the entire prd region in 2015 compared with 1991 with the most significant warming trend 2 c in the central urban areas of the prd region e g guangzhou foshan huizhou and dongguan as expected the relative humidity decreases in almost the whole study area due to climate warming with the largest decline 20 in the central urban areas fig 8b meanwhile the 2 m water vapor mixing ratio decreases by 0 8 1 6 g kg in central urban areas fig 8c whereas the water vapor mixing ratio at 850hpa increases by 0 05 0 25 g kg fig 8d in addition the urbanization also enhanced the vertical air movement leading to an increase of 2 4 cm s in the vertical wind speed over the urban areas fig 9 therefore it is likely that rapid urbanization enhanced the surface temperature vertical wind speed and boundary layer circulation enabling more water vapor to be carried to the upper atmosphere to enhance the rainfall intensity 4 discussion the effects of urban processes and expansion on localized summer rainfall events in the prd region were explored in this study the results indicate that the number of extreme rainfall events remarkably increases due to rapid urbanization particularly in the urban area of the prd region while the total summer rainfall exhibits a slight decrease the results are generally consistent with the findings of previous studies on the prd region wang et al 2015a indicated that extreme rainfall events show a strong positive spatial correlation with the urban extent in the prd region and that the correlation tends to be stronger at shorter temporal scales wu et al 2015 analyzed the urbanization effects on climate change in south china using meteorological data observed over 50 years their results indicated that the rainfall amounts show a decline throughout the whole prd region from 1960 to 2011 particularly that of light rain the analysis of the rainfall changes between the two land use scenarios 2015 and 1991 highlights the strong effects of urbanization on summer rainfall patterns wang et al 2012 pointed out that urbanization can reduce the regional cloud fraction and hence increase the incoming shortwave radiation on the ground urbanization can also decrease the albedo of land surfaces leading to a decrease in reflected solar radiation due to increases in the emissivity and surface skin temperature more longwave radiation is emitted from the land surface into the atmosphere over urban areas urbanization causes changes in the surface energy balance resulting in more shf and less lhf the increased shf leads to an increase in the surface temperature and an elevated pblh while the lower lhf reduces the moisture availability and results in cape decrease zhang et al 2014 hence the decrease in mcape alters the spatial distribution of convection initiation and causes changes in convective activity evolving in urban areas on the other hand the deficit of 2 m water vapor caused by decreased surface evaporation and elevated pblh is accompanied by an increased lfc lcl which leads to more water vapor mixing in the atmosphere over urban areas yu et al 2017 the increased surface roughness also enhances the mechanical turbulence which leads to stronger low level convergence and convection wang et al 2014b therefore urbanization can alter the patterns of the land sea breezes and circulation by changing the local thermodynamic conditions e g surface temperature vertical wind speeds pblh lhf and shf which provides conditions favorable for producing more extreme rainfall and rainstorm events and less light rainfall summer extreme rainfall is frequently associated with landfalling tropical cyclones over the prd region this study focused on summer rainfall simulations without considering the numerical simulation of tropical cyclones that needs to be coupled with high resolution movable grids this might produce large discrepancies from the observations generally proper interpretations of extreme rainfall trends caused by the urban extent in the prd region are complicated by tropical cyclones from tropical oceans wang et al 2018 indicated that rainfall characteristics are weakly correlated with the urban extent over the prd region during typhoon events yang et al 2018 suggested that urbanization could increase the largest rainfall amount more than 20 mm in the next step a finer resolution numerical model needs to be developed to explore the role of urban extent in tropical cyclone events and to quantify the effect of tropical cyclone on urban rainfall 5 summary and conclusions in this study numerical modeling analysis based on the wrf was used to investigate the effect of urbanization on summer rainfall in the prd region two different urban scenarios 2015 and 1991 were designed to test the sensitivity of the summer rainfall distribution to urbanization the role of the urbanization in the change of rainfall was comprehensively analyzed and the mechanism dominating the impact of urbanization on summer rainfall was discussed the results showed that the wrf model can reasonably reproduce the general synoptic weather pattern over the prd region particularly the air temperature and relative humidity urban processes and urbanization play important roles in the change of rainfall patterns although the total summer rainfall exhibits a slight decrease in the prd region both extreme rainfall 100 mm day and rainstorms 50 1 100 mm day show remarkable increases due to rapid urbanization particularly in the urban area of the prd because of the urban expansion during 1991 2015 the surface energy budget of the study region notably changed especially in central urban areas e g guangzhou and foshan the increase in urban areas led to a lhf decrease and shf increase the decreased lhf dampens the moisture availability and results in a decline in the mcape which provides conditions favorable for the decrease of the total summer rainfall on the other hand the increased shf results in a higher surface air temperature and lower relative humidity and also increases the pblh and lfc lcl hence carrying more water mixing vapor into the atmosphere over urban areas consequently extreme rainfall events are more locally concentrated in urban areas and are more pronounced in both intensity and frequency the effects of urbanization on climate e g rainstorm have been widely investigated in recent decades the general practice is to experimentally reproduce a typical rainfall event to reveal the urban effect in contrast this study is focused on the physical mechanism of urban rainfall climatology which helps to understand the urban effect on rainfall particularly for extreme rainfall events it is worth noting that aerosols have been emitted into the atmosphere in recent decades due to rapid urbanization and industrial activities recent studies highlighted the important role of aerosol levels in the change of rainfall patterns rosenfeld et al 2007 han et al 2012 in addition anthropogenic heat is another important component influencing the intensity and frequency of urban rainfall and its spatial distribution nie et al 2017 therefore future research is needed to quantify the impact of aerosols and anthropogenic heat on urban rainfall change future efforts also require greater sophistication

al 2006 the noah land surface model is coupled with a single layer urban canopy model slucm to facilitate the simulation of the thermodynamic properties chen et al 2011 see table 1 to evaluate the effects of urban expansion on the summer rainfall in the prd two urban scenarios i e land use in 1991 and 2015 were used for comparison of the rainfall contribution of urbanization fig 2 shows that the land use scenarios in the 1991 and 2015 categories were derived from high resolution satellite imagery landsat 5 and 8 and classified into three subcategories according to the impervious rates ir

urban environments impacts the urban surface energy budget and moisture sailor 2011 we did not incorporate new anthropogenic heat data but used the default ahr and its diurnal variation coefficient in the wrf ucm models for our simulations 2 2 2 error analysis the model performance was evaluated by using the mean error me root mean squared error rmse and correlation coefficient cc which are calculated as follows 1 m e j 1 t j 1 t si m i j o b s i j 100 2 rms e j 1 t j 1 t si m i j o b s i j 2 3 c c j i 1 t ob s i j obs si m i j sim i 1 t ob s i j obs 2 i 1 t si m i j sim 2 where t is the time period ob s i j represents the ith observation for the jth station and si m i j represents the ith simulation at the jth grid point 3 results 3 1 model validation generally simulation errors of the air temperature and relative humidity may have an important impact on the simulation results of regional rainfall therefore statistical comparisons between the observations and model simulations of 2 m temperature t2 and 2 m relative humidity rh2 were firstly conducted using the mb rmse and cc tables 2 and 3 present the results of model validation in terms of t2 and rh2 respectively the wrf simulates the summer t2 reasonably well with a mb below 2 0 c except for qy rmse with a small range of 1 29 2 97 and large cc of 0 51 0 68 similarly the wrf model reproduces the summer rh2 for most of the stations at the mean annual scale well the mb and rmse range from 9 26 to 7 51 and from 6 92 to 11 43 respectively the cc values are all higher than 0 5 significant at the 0 01 level indicating good agreement between the model simulations and observations fig 3 displays the spatial distributions of extreme daily rainfall 95th percentile during rainy days and mean daily rainfall simulated by the wrf model and that from the trmm data during 2013 2015 the wrf reasonably reproduces the extreme daily rainfall events over the study region with the largest extreme rainfall occurring in the prd urban area fig 3a and c the mean daily rainfall from the trmm is significantly larger in the urban region than in any other region of the prd in contrast the mean daily rainfall simulated by the wrf model shows a strong spatial variability with large mean daily rainfall dispersed over a wide region including the prd overall the wrf model slightly overestimates both the extreme and mean daily rainfall compared with the trmm which is probably due to the simulation biases of t2 and rh2 caused by the initial meteorological and boundary conditions of the model the simulation bias can be regarded as systematic model error and might have little effect on long running climate simulations wang et al 2012 wang et al 2014b yang et al 2014b in addition the discrepancies between the spatial resolution of the trmm 25 km and wrf 4 km might also introduce uncertainties to the evaluation of the wrf performance nevertheless there is a generally consistency between the simulation and observation in the prd region in which the wrf model can reproduce the extreme summer climate events during the study period 3 2 changes in summer rainfall fig 4 shows the spatial changes in the average summer rainfall extreme rainfall intensity 99th percentile of the daily rainfall series and median rainfall intensity 50th percentile of the daily rainfall series between the 2015 and 1991 scenarios the average summer rainfall shows a large spatial heterogeneity over the study area according to the simulation results for the prd region the average summer rainfall decreased by 3 91 in 2013 7 97 in 2014 and 1 15 in 2015 respectively relative to 1991 decreasing average summer rainfall is mainly observed in the northwestern region while increase is mainly determined in the northeastern and southwestern regions compared with the average summer rainfall the extreme rainfall intensity significantly increases up to 50 mm day in most parts of the prd especially in the urban core e g guangzhou and southwestern region these results indicate that changes in the average summer rainfall and extreme rainfall intensity are very sensitive to the urbanization of the prd region in contrast the median rainfall intensity 50th percentile of the daily rainfall series shows little changes in the study area and is insensitive to the urbanization of the study area to further detect changes in the summer rainfall due to urbanization the rainfall events in summer were classified into five categories wang et al 2014a b extreme rainfall above 100 mm day rainstorm 50 1 100 mm day heavy rainfall 25 1 50 mm day moderate rainfall 10 25 mm day and light rainfall 0 1 10 mm day the relative changes of the five different rainfall events in the prd region between the 2015 and 1991 scenarios are shown in fig 5 the magnitude of extreme rainfall above 100 mm day shows a noticeable increase with an average increase of 4 19 while the magnitude of rainstorms 50 1 100 mm day increases by 3 04 on average in contrast changes in heavy rainfall 25 1 50 mm day show a large range from 25 81 to 13 91 which highlights the uncertainty in the assessment of urban change of heavy rainfall overall the magnitude of heavy rainfall shows an average decrease of 5 95 in 2015 compared with 1991 similarly moderate rainfall 10 25 mm day and light rainfall 0 1 10 mm day also exhibit an average decrease of 3 87 and 1 70 respectively in summary the above mentioned analysis indicates that the magnitudes of extreme rainfall and rainstorm events increased in the prd region due to urbanization however heavy moderate and light rainfall events slightly decreased 3 3 changes of the thermodynamic variables and pbl height fig 6 shows the changes of maximum convective available potential energy mcape level of free convection lfc lifted condensation level lcl planetary boundary layer height pblh and maximum convective inhibition micn in 2015 compared with 1991 fig 6a shows that the magnitude of mcape decreases by more than 100 j kg in the prd region especially in central urban areas such as guangzhou and foshan up to 450 j kg on the contrary the magnitude of mcin increased across the urban areas including guangzhou foshan and dongguan at a maximum of 15 j kg fig 6e in general the decrease in mcape changes the spatial distribution of convection initiation in the urban environment and alters the evolution of preexisting convection zhang et al 2014 these changes can be attributed to the decreased latent heat flux lhf fig 7 a and increased sensible heat flux shf fig 7b both the lfc fig 6b and lcl fig 6c exhibit a significant increase in the central urban area of the prd region i e guangzhou and foshan the pblh increases by more than 400 m in the urban area of the prd region fig 6d which is directly linked to the shf changes fig 8 b the increased shf caused by urbanization can alter the key thermodynamic variables e g pblh and lfc lcl which increases the possibility of cloud formation and ultimately enhances the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall in urban areas shem and shepherd 2009 3 4 changes of the 2 m temperature relative humidity and water mixing ratio fig 8 shows the spatial changes of the average summer temperature 2 m relative humidity 2 m water vapor ratio and high layer water vapor ratio in the prd region in 2015 compared with 1991 fig 8a shows that there is a common warming trend across the entire prd region in 2015 compared with 1991 with the most significant warming trend 2 c in the central urban areas of the prd region e g guangzhou foshan huizhou and dongguan as expected the relative humidity decreases in almost the whole study area due to climate warming with the largest decline 20 in the central urban areas fig 8b meanwhile the 2 m water vapor mixing ratio decreases by 0 8 1 6 g kg in central urban areas fig 8c whereas the water vapor mixing ratio at 850hpa increases by 0 05 0 25 g kg fig 8d in addition the urbanization also enhanced the vertical air movement leading to an increase of 2 4 cm s in the vertical wind speed over the urban areas fig 9 therefore it is likely that rapid urbanization enhanced the surface temperature vertical wind speed and boundary layer circulation enabling more water vapor to be carried to the upper atmosphere to enhance the rainfall intensity 4 discussion the effects of urban processes and expansion on localized summer rainfall events in the prd region were explored in this study the results indicate that the number of extreme rainfall events remarkably increases due to rapid urbanization particularly in the urban area of the prd region while the total summer rainfall exhibits a slight decrease the results are generally consistent with the findings of previous studies on the prd region wang et al 2015a indicated that extreme rainfall events show a strong positive spatial correlation with the urban extent in the prd region and that the correlation tends to be stronger at shorter temporal scales wu et al 2015 analyzed the urbanization effects on climate change in south china using meteorological data observed over 50 years their results indicated that the rainfall amounts show a decline throughout the whole prd region from 1960 to 2011 particularly that of light rain the analysis of the rainfall changes between the two land use scenarios 2015 and 1991 highlights the strong effects of urbanization on summer rainfall patterns wang et al 2012 pointed out that urbanization can reduce the regional cloud fraction and hence increase the incoming shortwave radiation on the ground urbanization can also decrease the albedo of land surfaces leading to a decrease in reflected solar radiation due to increases in the emissivity and surface skin temperature more longwave radiation is emitted from the land surface into the atmosphere over urban areas urbanization causes changes in the surface energy balance resulting in more shf and less lhf the increased shf leads to an increase in the surface temperature and an elevated pblh while the lower lhf reduces the moisture availability and results in cape decrease zhang et al 2014 hence the decrease in mcape alters the spatial distribution of convection initiation and causes changes in convective activity evolving in urban areas on the other hand the deficit of 2 m water vapor caused by decreased surface evaporation and elevated pblh is accompanied by an increased lfc lcl which leads to more water vapor mixing in the atmosphere over urban areas yu et al 2017 the increased surface roughness also enhances the mechanical turbulence which leads to stronger low level convergence and convection wang et al 2014b therefore urbanization can alter the patterns of the land sea breezes and circulation by changing the local thermodynamic conditions e g surface temperature vertical wind speeds pblh lhf and shf which provides conditions favorable for producing more extreme rainfall and rainstorm events and less light rainfall summer extreme rainfall is frequently associated with landfalling tropical cyclones over the prd region this study focused on summer rainfall simulations without considering the numerical simulation of tropical cyclones that needs to be coupled with high resolution movable grids this might produce large discrepancies from the observations generally proper interpretations of extreme rainfall trends caused by the urban extent in the prd region are complicated by tropical cyclones from tropical oceans wang et al 2018 indicated that rainfall characteristics are weakly correlated with the urban extent over the prd region during typhoon events yang et al 2018 suggested that urbanization could increase the largest rainfall amount more than 20 mm in the next step a finer resolution numerical model needs to be developed to explore the role of urban extent in tropical cyclone events and to quantify the effect of tropical cyclone on urban rainfall 5 summary and conclusions in this study numerical modeling analysis based on the wrf was used to investigate the effect of urbanization on summer rainfall in the prd region two different urban scenarios 2015 and 1991 were designed to test the sensitivity of the summer rainfall distribution to urbanization the role of the urbanization in the change of rainfall was comprehensively analyzed and the mechanism dominating the impact of urbanization on summer rainfall was discussed the results showed that the wrf model can reasonably reproduce the general synoptic weather pattern over the prd region particularly the air temperature and relative humidity urban processes and urbanization play important roles in the change of rainfall patterns although the total summer rainfall exhibits a slight decrease in the prd region both extreme rainfall 100 mm day and rainstorms 50 1 100 mm day show remarkable increases due to rapid urbanization particularly in the urban area of the prd because of the urban expansion during 1991 2015 the surface energy budget of the study region notably changed especially in central urban areas e g guangzhou and foshan the increase in urban areas led to a lhf decrease and shf increase the decreased lhf dampens the moisture availability and results in a decline in the mcape which provides conditions favorable for the decrease of the total summer rainfall on the other hand the increased shf results in a higher surface air temperature and lower relative humidity and also increases the pblh and lfc lcl hence carrying more water mixing vapor into the atmosphere over urban areas consequently extreme rainfall events are more locally concentrated in urban areas and are more pronounced in both intensity and frequency the effects of urbanization on climate e g rainstorm have been widely investigated in recent decades the general practice is to experimentally reproduce a typical rainfall event to reveal the urban effect in contrast this study is focused on the physical mechanism of urban rainfall climatology which helps to understand the urban effect on rainfall particularly for extreme rainfall events it is worth noting that aerosols have been emitted into the atmosphere in recent decades due to rapid urbanization and industrial activities recent studies highlighted the important role of aerosol levels in the change of rainfall patterns rosenfeld et al 2007 han et al 2012 in addition anthropogenic heat is another important component influencing the intensity and frequency of urban rainfall and its spatial distribution nie et al 2017 therefore future research is needed to quantify the impact of aerosols and anthropogenic heat on urban rainfall change future efforts also require greater sophistication with respect to the land surface representation to study the specific roles of thermal dynamical hydrological processes in urban rainfall change acknowledgments this study was supported by the

6847,hydrological model parameters are essential for model simulation which may vary with time owing to climatic variations and human activities as a result the implementation of stationary parameters may lead to inaccurate streamflow simulation actual evapotranspiration et is a crucial component of hydrological cycles with an important influence on regional climate characteristics our aim was to investigate an appropriate way to estimate time varying parameters using streamflow and et observations and to explore the how the simulation efficiency would change when et data were added into assimilation data assimilation techniques can automatically adjust hydrological model parameters according to changing conditions the ensemble kalman filter enkf technique was used to assimilate observations into a two parameter monthly water balance model four data assimilation schemes were designed and applied in a synthetic experiment and 173 catchments in usa including 1 sole assimilation of streamflow to update both parameters 2 joint assimilation of streamflow and et to simultaneously update parameters 3 sole assimilation of et first to update parameter c measuring evapotranspiration and then subsequently joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update parameter sc measuring water storage capacity and 4 sole assimilation of et to update parameter c and then sole assimilation of streamflow to update parameter sc the four schemes were compared in terms of deterministic and probabilistic model performances and model parameter correlations the results indicated that 1 the estimation of parameter c can be improved by assimilating et observations into the model and the time varying model parameters obtained by adding et data into assimilation led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and et prediction 2 among the three joint assimilation schemes the deterministic model simulation performances were similar while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2 the joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update both parameters in one step i e scheme 2 outperformed the other two schemes in parameter sc estimation and model performance 3 the ability to enhance simulation accuracy and to weaken correlations between parameters was more significant in humid catchments the joint assimilation was helpful for the application of multiple sources of information into a hydrological simulation keywords multivariate data assimilation time varying model parameter ensemble kalman filter 1 introduction hydrological model parameters play a critical role in model simulation it is generally assumed that model parameters calibrated by limited data will be applicable in the future in other words the parameters of hydrological models are treated as constants while model inputs are vary over time however this assumption may lead to large errors in simulated streamflow owing to climatic temporal variations and human activities there is an increasing awareness of the need to consider model parameters as continuously time varying brigode et al 2013 thirel et al 2015 patil and stieglitz 2015 on one hand model parameters may potentially vary with climatic temporal variations because calibrated parameters are supposed to compensate for model structure and observation data problems wagener et al 2003 merz et al 2011 on the other hand human activities such as the construction of water conservancy projects and urbanization could result in underlying surface changes which also may change model parameters because some parameters represent transient catchment characteristics legesse et al 2003 brown et al 2005 hence it is of paramount importance to study the time variability of hydrological model parameters several approaches have been used to obtain time varying model parameters in response to climatic temporal variations and human activities deng et al 2016 one is to establish the functional form of the selected time varying model parameters e g marshall et al 2006 jeremiah et al 2013 westra et al 2014 proposed a strategy for diagnosing and interpreting hydrological model non stationarity by assuming parameters vary in time as functions of seasonality annual variability and longer term trends another is to divide the data into several consecutive subsets and calibrate the model parameters in each subset based on optimization algorithms e g seibert et al 2010 de vos et al 2010 gharari et al 2013 vaze et al 2010 merz et al 2011 calibrated the parameters of a conceptual rainfall runoff model in six consecutive 5 year periods between 1976 and 2006 for 273 catchments in austria to analyze the temporal changes in model parameters a common shortcoming with these approaches is that scientific judgement is still required to estimate what the identified parameter trends might be and modelers may need to adjust the model framework according to different situations pathiraja et al 2016a data assimilation da method can adjust hydrological model parameters automatically according to changing conditions the basic idea of da is to quantify errors in both the hydrological model and observations and combine model simulations with observations optimally to update hydrological model states clark et al 2008 da has been used to update model states and model parameters simultaneously in real time with the advanced simulation capability of streamflow better than in most other optimization algorithms e g moradkhani et al 2005 wang et al 2009 pathiraja et al 2017 abbaszadeh et al 2018 only a minority of studies have focused on generating time varying parameters with da e g smith et al 2008 moradkhani et al 2012 vrugt et al 2013 pathiraja et al 2016b feng et al 2017 pathiraja et al 2018 applications of da can be classified into univariate and multivariate assimilations according to the assimilated data montzka et al 2012 univariate assimilation using a single observation data type e g streamflow accounts for most data assimilation applications multivariate or joint assimilation refers to the use of more than one data type e g streamflow and soil moisture most studies have concluded that the results obtained from multivariate assimilation are better than from univariate assimilation e g camporese et al 2009 shi et al 2015 yan and moradkhani 2016 compared the joint and separate assimilation of streamflow and satellite soil moisture into the sacramento soil moisture accounting model and found that solely assimilating streamflow could lead to inaccurate soil moisture estimation actual evapotranspiration et is a crucial component of hydrological cycles with an important influence on regional climate characteristics jung et al 2010 several researchers have applied data assimilation techniques to assimilate et data into hydrological models e g schuurmans et al 2003 kalma et al 2008 dong et al 2016 qin et al 2008 assimilated remotely sensed et into a distributed hydrological model and found that this improved the predictions of spatial water distribution over a large river basin zou et al 2017 proposed a catchment scale et data assimilation technique that assimilated remotely sensed et data into a distributed time variant gain hydrological model and found that assimilating et into hydrological models led to improved predictions of soil moisture and streamflow however the current research on the assimilation of et data mainly focuses on estimation of et and has not addressed the impact on time varying parameters the purpose of this study was to investigate an appropriate way to estimate time varying parameters using streamflow and et observations and to explore how the simulation efficiency would change when et data were added into assimilation the ensemble kalman filter enkf method was used to assimilate streamflow and et into the hydrological model this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the hydrological model the enkf method and our experimental design section 3 illustrates the case study including the synthetic experiment the study area and parameter setting results and discussion are presented in section 4 then we conclude with a summary of the main outcomes in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 monthly water balance model the two parameter monthly water balance model developed by xiong and guo 1999 has been widely used in monthly runoff simulation because the model is simple and has a high simulation accuracy e g guo et al 2002 xiong and guo 2012 the inputs of the model are monthly potential evapotranspiration pet and monthly areal precipitation p and the outputs include monthly runoff q and et et is calculated using the following formula 1 e t c e p t tanh p t e p t where et is the actual monthly evapotranspiration pt is the monthly rainfall ept represents the monthly potential evapotranspiration value and c is the first model parameter in the monthly water balance model which comprehensively reflects the variation of precipitation and evapotranspiration table 1 the monthly runoff has close relationship with the soil water content s and is calculated as follows 2 q t s t tanh s t sc where qt is the monthly runoff st is the soil water content and sc is the second model parameter in the monthly water balance model which is used to represent the water storage capacity of catchments table 1 the quantity of the remaining water in the soil at the t th month is computed by s t 1 p t e t next the monthly runoff is calculated as follows 3 q t s t 1 p t e

a sequential data assimilation technique using the monte carlo method to approximate error covariance matrix this is done by generating an ensemble of state simulations to update the state variables and model parameters conditioned on a series of observations evensen 1994 deng et al 2015 an effective method for implementing the enkf is as follows 1 initialize set the ensemble size n and the total length of assimilation time steps n at the first time step the state variable ensembles are generated by a gaussian distribution 2 forecast initialize the background field with the analysis of state

the streamflow data with the state variable being s which is set by a comparative experiment besides et had also been solely assimilated into the hydrological model while the streamflow simulation accuracy decreases nse 0 thus only sole streamflow assimilation is discussed here scheme 1 includes eqs 14 and 17 scheme 2 is joint assimilation updating the state variable s and model parameters c and sc simultaneously by assimilating streamflow and et scheme 2 includes eqs 14 and 19 it is shown in eqs 1 4 that c is used to estimate et while sc has relationship with both streamflow and et therefore schemes 3 and 4 were designed to investigate whether the different assimilation steps of the model parameters in the joint assimilation of q and et had any influence on the parameter estimations and model simulations scheme 3 updates the model parameter c by solely assimilating et first then updates sc and the state variable s by jointly assimilating streamflow and et using the ensemble average of c from the previous step to calculate e t in eqs 3 and 4 the first step of scheme 3 includes eqs 15 and 18 and the update of sc includes eqs 16 and 19 it should be noted that the state variable s will have correlated errors with et observations because et observations have been used to update c in the first step and c is used to generate a forecast of s here scheme 3 is set as an alternative scheme to assimilate et data into the hydrological model scheme 4 is a comparative experiment based on scheme 3 the difference between them is the update of sc scheme 3 uses streamflow and et observations while scheme 4 uses the streamflow information only the update of c includes eqs 15 and 18 and the update of sc includes eqs 16 and 17 2 4 evaluation index the nash sutcliffe

synthetic experiment was designed to evaluate the ability of the assimilation schemes to identify the temporal variation of model parameters the model parameters were given specific variations including trend and periodicity observations for p and pet were generated via a stochastic simulation and streamflow and et observations were then produced using the monthly water balance model the steps to identify the time varying parameters by enkf were as follows 1 scenario settings generated the time variant parameters with different trend variations p and pet on a monthly time scale then computed the streamflow and et observations using the two parameter monthly water balance model 2 initialization set the ensemble size n and the total length of assimilation time steps n at the first time step the parameters and state variable ensembles were generated by a gaussian distribution 3 data assimilation after the initialization of parameters and state variables the hydrological model parameters and state were updated in different schemes using the streamflow and et observations obtained in step 1 finally the assimilated and true model parameters were compared to evaluate the performance of enkf schemes the data set used in this experiment lasted for 252 months the experiment was implemented to identify the variation of model parameters from the scenarios in table 2 3 2 study region and data set the study was carried out in the usa using data from the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 the hydrometeorological dataset includes p monthly streamflow pet and et from the period 1983 2003 pet and et were obtained from the university of montana zhang et al 2010 and pet was quantified by a priesley taylor approach priestley and taylor 1972 the simulation performance may be poor in some regions because of issues with the data or the applicability of the hydrological model therefore we mainly focused on the regions where the performance was acceptable e g nse of streamflow lager than 0 6 deng et al 2018 a total of 173 study catchments were selected according to the following criteria first the values of pet should be larger than et second the nse values for streamflow should be over 0 6 and third the nse values for evapotranspiration should be positive climate and environmental conditions vary from basin to basin to assist in the analyses the 173 gauged catchments with areas ranging from 66 7 to 9889 km2 were classified into humid or arid regions using an aridity index ai here ai is defined as the long term average annual ratio of pet and p budyko 1974 according to budyko catchments with an ai smaller than unity are humid while catchments with an ai larger than unity are arid and semi arid catchments those with an ai larger than two are termed very arid out of the 173 catchments 69 were classified as humid catchments and 104 were classified as arid and semi arid catchments fig 1 shows the location and classification distributions of the catchments and fig 2 shows the annual mean values of p q and pet in the period 1983 2003 as well as catchment areas 3 3 parameter settings there are relevant studies have examined how the ensemble size influences the deterministic and probabilistic performance and also the computational demands e g evensen 2004 moradkhani et al 2005 dechant and moradkhani 2012 the results indicate that the tracking of the observations improves and the estimates are more robust but the computational time is longer and more storage space is needed as the ensemble size increases ensembles of different sizes from 10 to 1000 were tested in the synthetic experiments and the same conclusions were obtained therefore the ensemble size was set to 1000 in this study the state variable used for data assimilation was s the observations were streamflow in univariate assimilations while streamflow and et in joint assimilations the variances of the noises introduced to the parameters state variable and output variables eqs 5 and 6 were proportional to the magnitude of the parameters or variables leisenring and moradkhani 2012 the proportionality factors were determined with the most accurate streamflow simulation as the criterion for the 173 catchments the initial values of the proportionality factors were 1 for c and sc 5 for s and 10 for streamflow and et we adjusted the proportionality factors in the basins where the simulation performance was poor manually by selecting the optimal values at intervals of 0 01 from 0 to 0 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 synthetic experiment to assess the performance of the four assimilation schemes the comparisons of the assimilated and true model parameters under different scenarios are presented in fig 3 table 3 shows the evaluation statistics for parameters streamflow and et fig 3 shows that the assimilated parameters of c and sc had similar trends to the true parameters and the estimation of c in schemes 2 3 and 4 matched the true values more closely when the et observations were added into the assimilation it should be noted that there was a time lag between the assimilated c and the true values because of the defect in the enkf technique in the enkf the state and parameters are updated based on the current observations and previous forecasts and there may be a time lag when the enkf method is adopted to estimate the model parameters and observations clark et al 2008 table 3 also shows that the sc assimilation performed the best in scheme 2 the deterministic measure nse of streamflow and et showed that the estimation of streamflow using the enkf method very closely matched the observations with nseq values of over 0 99 and the simulations of et were more accurate in schemes 2 3 and 4 in terms of the probabilistic performance the er95 values were between 5 and 8 for all four schemes demonstrated that the all four schemes could produce accurate 95 predictive bounds the reliability results suggested that the ensemble predictions were more reliable in schemes 1 and 2 with reliability indexes Œ± over 0 9 the reliability indexes of schemes 3 and 4 were around 0 6 and the p values showed that schemes 3 and 4 tended to underpredict the high flows the above results demonstrated that the time varying model parameter estimation framework using the enkf method was able to identify the temporal variation of the model parameters and to produce accurate 95 predictive bounds for streamflow the estimation of parameter c measuring evapotranspiration can be improved by assimilating et observations into the model for the three joint assimilation schemes the deterministic model performances were similar while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2 the joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update both parameters in one step i e scheme 2 outperformed the other two in parameter sc estimation and reliable ensemble prediction 4 2 model performance with time varying parameters it is of interest to understand the impact of time varying model parameters generated from different assimilation schemes on the hydrological simulation a no assimilation experiment that used the sce ua method to calibrate the time invariant model parameters was compared with the four assimilation schemes fig 4 shows the nses of streamflow nseq and et nseet the nses in the assimilation schemes were calculated based on the states after the analysis step of the enkf fig 5 shows the nses in the assimilation schemes before the analysis step of the enkf as shown in figs 4 and 5 the nses of schemes 3 and 4 were similar to the nses of scheme 2 confirming the results found in the synthetic experiment therefore only schemes 1 and 2 and time invariant parameters scheme were further discussed the difference values of nse between schemes 1 2 and the time invariant parameters scheme are shown in fig 6 a positive value indicates that the performance of the time varying parameter scheme is better for scheme 1 the streamflow simulations for 65 of the catchments were better with the time varying parameters than for the time invariant parameters see fig 6a the forecast nseq values were higher in 98 catchments and the same in 15 catchments and the simulation for the actual evaporation was worse in most catchments see fig 6c perhaps because the estimations for parameter c from scheme 1 were poor for scheme 2 the streamflow simulations for 86 of the catchments were better than those based on the time invariant parameters see fig 6b the forecast nseq values were higher in 139 catchments and the same in 9 catchments and significant improvement of et simulation accuracy can be observed see fig 6d the results indicate that the model with time varying parameters obtained by solely assimilating streamflow data performed better in streamflow simulation than the one with constant parameters but the improvement was small the model simulation improved considerably when the time varying parameters were estimated by adding et data into assimilation with streamflow in addition scheme 2 showed higher nseq and nseet than scheme 1 in 109 and 173 catchments fig 7 respectively where the nseet values increased from 0 06 to 0 7 especially in humid areas besides the model simulation performance with time invariant and time varying scheme 2 model parameters for humid and arid regions is presented in fig 8 it can be illustrated that the climate conditions influenced the model simulation on average the streamflow simulation was better in humid catchments than in arid catchments because of the applicability of the adopted hydrological model while the reverse conclusion was observed for the et simulations overall the time varying model parameters obtained by adding et data into assimilation with streamflow led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and et simulation than the model parameters based on solely assimilating streamflow and time invariant approaches the streamflow simulation was better in humid catchments than in arid catchments for all the parameter schemes while the reverse conclusion was observed for the et simulations 4 3 the effects of joint assimilation on the correlations between parameters all the four data assimilation schemes had excellent performances in streamflow simulation and the three joint assimilation schemes showed an improved accuracy in et simulation to further examine whether the four schemes were reasonable the correlations between model parameters were compared the model parameters were expected to be only weakly correlated otherwise a change in one parameter may cause other parameters to change making the optimal values of parameters not unique therefore it was not necessary to set multiple parameters as if they were highly correlated fig 9 presents the pearson correlation coefficients r between c and sc and their absolute values r for the four schemes given separately for each catchment on average c was positively correlated with sc for scheme 1 the number of positively and negatively correlated catchments for the other three schemes was approximately equal from fig 9b it can be seen that the sole assimilation of streamflow led to the highest correlation between c and sc with r in 110 catchments over 0 3 the three joint assimilation schemes showed weaker correlations with only 6 13 and 12 catchments with r larger than 0 3 respectively the medians and mean correlation coefficients between c and sc were around 0 1 and 0 12 for scheme 2 and around 0 12 and 0 13 for scheme 3 and scheme 4 scheme 2 showed weaker correlation between parameters than scheme 1 in 151 catchments where the absolute values of r decreased from 0 01 to 0 7 especially in humid areas fig 10 in general the joint assimilation schemes could reduce the correlation between model parameters and scheme 2 was able to generate more applicable parameter series 5 conclusions the enkf method was used to assimilate streamflow and et data into a monthly water balance model to identify time varying parameters four data assimilation schemes were designed in this study including 1 sole assimilation of streamflow to update both parameters 2 joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update both parameters 3 sole assimilation of et first to update parameter c and then subsequently joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update parameter sc and 4 sole assimilation of et to update parameter c and then sole assimilation of streamflow to update parameter sc based on the results of the synthetic experiment and case study in 173 catchments in usa we drew the following conclusions 1 the time varying model parameter estimation framework using the enkf method was able to identify the temporal variation of the model parameters and to produce accurate 95 predictive bounds for streamflow the estimation of parameter c measuring evapotranspiration can be improved by assimilating et observations into the model the time varying model parameters obtained by adding et data into assimilation with streamflow led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and et simulation than the model parameters based on solely assimilating streamflow and time invariant approaches 2 for the three joint assimilation schemes the deterministic model performances were similar while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2 the joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update both parameters in one step i e scheme 2 outperformed the other two in parameter sc estimation and reliable ensemble prediction 3 the ability to enhance et simulation accuracy was better in humid catchments with nse values increasing by around 0 7 in some humid areas the ability to reduce correlation between parameters was also better in humid catchments with r values decreasing by more than 0 7 because our research demonstrates the best scheme for estimating time varying parameters future work will be focused on the relationship between parameter variations and input observations or land use changes acknowledgements this study

6847,hydrological model parameters are essential for model simulation which may vary with time owing to climatic variations and human activities as a result the implementation of stationary parameters may lead to inaccurate streamflow simulation actual evapotranspiration et is a crucial component of hydrological cycles with an important influence on regional climate characteristics our aim was to investigate an appropriate way to estimate time varying parameters using streamflow and et observations and to explore the how the simulation efficiency would change when et data were added into assimilation data assimilation techniques can automatically adjust hydrological model parameters according to changing conditions the ensemble kalman filter enkf technique was used to assimilate observations into a two parameter monthly water balance model four data assimilation schemes were designed and applied in a synthetic experiment and 173 catchments in usa including 1 sole assimilation of streamflow to update both parameters 2 joint assimilation of streamflow and et to simultaneously update parameters 3 sole assimilation of et first to update parameter c measuring evapotranspiration and then subsequently joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update parameter sc measuring water storage capacity and 4 sole assimilation of et to update parameter c and then sole assimilation of streamflow to update parameter sc the four schemes were compared in terms of deterministic and probabilistic model performances and model parameter correlations the results indicated that 1 the estimation of parameter c can be improved by assimilating et observations into the model and the time varying model parameters obtained by adding et data into assimilation led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and et prediction 2 among the three joint assimilation schemes the deterministic model simulation performances were similar while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2 the joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update both parameters in one step i e scheme 2 outperformed the other two schemes in parameter sc estimation and model performance 3 the ability to enhance simulation accuracy and to weaken correlations between parameters was more significant in humid catchments the joint assimilation was helpful for the application of multiple sources of information into a hydrological simulation keywords multivariate data assimilation time varying model parameter ensemble kalman filter 1 introduction hydrological model parameters play a critical role in model simulation it is generally assumed that model parameters calibrated by limited data will be applicable in the future in other words the parameters of hydrological models are treated as constants while model inputs are vary over time however this assumption may lead to large errors in simulated streamflow owing to climatic temporal variations and human activities there is an increasing awareness of the need to consider model parameters as continuously time varying brigode et al 2013 thirel et al 2015 patil and stieglitz 2015 on one hand model parameters may potentially vary with climatic temporal variations because calibrated parameters are supposed to compensate for model structure and observation data problems wagener et al 2003 merz et al 2011 on the other hand human activities such as the construction of water conservancy projects and urbanization could result in underlying surface changes which also may change model parameters because some parameters represent transient catchment characteristics legesse et al 2003 brown et al 2005 hence it is of paramount importance to study the time variability of hydrological model parameters several approaches have been used to obtain time varying model parameters in response to climatic temporal variations and human activities deng et al 2016 one is to establish the functional form of the selected time varying model parameters e g marshall et al 2006 jeremiah et al 2013 westra et al 2014 proposed a strategy for diagnosing and interpreting hydrological model non stationarity by assuming parameters vary in time as functions of seasonality annual variability and longer term trends another is to divide the data into several consecutive subsets and calibrate the model parameters in each subset based on optimization algorithms e g seibert et al 2010 de vos et al 2010 gharari et al 2013 vaze et al 2010 merz et al 2011 calibrated the parameters of a conceptual rainfall runoff model in six consecutive 5 year periods between 1976 and 2006 for 273 catchments in austria to analyze the temporal changes in model parameters a common shortcoming with these approaches is that scientific judgement is still required to estimate what the identified parameter trends might be and modelers may need to adjust the model framework according to different situations pathiraja et al 2016a data assimilation da method can adjust hydrological model parameters automatically according to changing conditions the basic idea of da is to quantify errors in both the hydrological model and observations and combine model simulations with observations optimally to update hydrological model states clark et al 2008 da has been used to update model states and model parameters simultaneously in real time with the advanced simulation capability of streamflow better than in most other optimization algorithms e g moradkhani et al 2005 wang et al 2009 pathiraja et al 2017 abbaszadeh et al 2018 only a minority of studies have focused on generating time varying parameters with da e g smith et al 2008 moradkhani et al 2012 vrugt et al 2013 pathiraja et al 2016b feng et al 2017 pathiraja et al 2018 applications of da can be classified into univariate and multivariate assimilations according to the assimilated data montzka et al 2012 univariate assimilation using a single observation data type e g streamflow accounts for most data assimilation applications multivariate or joint assimilation refers to the use of more than one data type e g streamflow and soil moisture most studies have concluded that the results obtained from multivariate assimilation are better than from univariate assimilation e g camporese et al 2009 shi et al 2015 yan and moradkhani 2016 compared the joint and separate assimilation of streamflow and satellite soil moisture into the sacramento soil moisture accounting model and found that solely assimilating streamflow could lead to inaccurate soil moisture estimation actual evapotranspiration et is a crucial component of hydrological cycles with an important influence on regional climate characteristics jung et al 2010 several researchers have applied data assimilation techniques to assimilate et data into hydrological models e g schuurmans et al 2003 kalma et al 2008 dong et al 2016 qin et al 2008 assimilated remotely sensed et into a distributed hydrological model and found that this improved the predictions of spatial water distribution over a large river basin zou et al 2017 proposed a catchment scale et data assimilation technique that assimilated remotely sensed et data into a distributed time variant gain hydrological model and found that assimilating et into hydrological models led to improved predictions of soil moisture and streamflow however the current research on the assimilation of et data mainly focuses on estimation of et and has not addressed the impact on time varying parameters the purpose of this study was to investigate an appropriate way to estimate time varying parameters using streamflow and et observations and to explore how the simulation efficiency would change when et data were added into assimilation the ensemble kalman filter enkf method was used to assimilate streamflow and et into the hydrological model this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the hydrological model the enkf method and our experimental design section 3 illustrates the case study including the synthetic experiment the study area and parameter setting results and discussion are presented in section 4 then we conclude with a summary of the main outcomes in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 monthly water balance model the two parameter monthly water balance model developed by xiong and guo 1999 has been widely used in monthly runoff simulation because the model is simple and has a high simulation accuracy e g guo et al 2002 xiong and guo 2012 the inputs of the model are monthly potential evapotranspiration pet and monthly areal precipitation p and the outputs include monthly runoff q and et et is calculated using the following formula 1 e t c e p t tanh p t e p t where et is the actual monthly evapotranspiration pt is the monthly rainfall ept represents the monthly potential evapotranspiration value and c is the first model parameter in the monthly water balance model which comprehensively reflects the variation of precipitation and evapotranspiration table 1 the monthly runoff has close relationship with the soil water content s and is calculated as follows 2 q t s t tanh s t sc where qt is the monthly runoff st is the soil water content and sc is the second model parameter in the monthly water balance model which is used to represent the water storage capacity of catchments table 1 the quantity of the remaining water in the soil at the t th month is computed by s t 1 p t e t next the monthly runoff is calculated as follows 3 q t s t 1 p t e

a sequential data assimilation technique using the monte carlo method to approximate error covariance matrix this is done by generating an ensemble of state simulations to update the state variables and model parameters conditioned on a series of observations evensen 1994 deng et al 2015 an effective method for implementing the enkf is as follows 1 initialize set the ensemble size n and the total length of assimilation time steps n at the first time step the state variable ensembles are generated by a gaussian distribution 2 forecast initialize the background field with the analysis of state

the streamflow data with the state variable being s which is set by a comparative experiment besides et had also been solely assimilated into the hydrological model while the streamflow simulation accuracy decreases nse 0 thus only sole streamflow assimilation is discussed here scheme 1 includes eqs 14 and 17 scheme 2 is joint assimilation updating the state variable s and model parameters c and sc simultaneously by assimilating streamflow and et scheme 2 includes eqs 14 and 19 it is shown in eqs 1 4 that c is used to estimate et while sc has relationship with both streamflow and et therefore schemes 3 and 4 were designed to investigate whether the different assimilation steps of the model parameters in the joint assimilation of q and et had any influence on the parameter estimations and model simulations scheme 3 updates the model parameter c by solely assimilating et first then updates sc and the state variable s by jointly assimilating streamflow and et using the ensemble average of c from the previous step to calculate e t in eqs 3 and 4 the first step of scheme 3 includes eqs 15 and 18 and the update of sc includes eqs 16 and 19 it should be noted that the state variable s will have correlated errors with et observations because et observations have been used to update c in the first step and c is used to generate a forecast of s here scheme 3 is set as an alternative scheme to assimilate et data into the hydrological model scheme 4 is a comparative experiment based on scheme 3 the difference between them is the update of sc scheme 3 uses streamflow and et observations while scheme 4 uses the streamflow information only the update of c includes eqs 15 and 18 and the update of sc includes eqs 16 and 17 2 4 evaluation index the nash sutcliffe

are consistent with ft the p values will follow a uniform distribution on the interval 0 1 the index Œ± reflects the overall reliability of the pd and it varies between 0 worst reliability with all observed p values equal to 0 or 1 and 1 perfect reliability the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to assess the linear relationship between the estimated parameters 23 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1

synthetic experiment was designed to evaluate the ability of the assimilation schemes to identify the temporal variation of model parameters the model parameters were given specific variations including trend and periodicity observations for p and pet were generated via a stochastic simulation and streamflow and et observations were then produced using the monthly water balance model the steps to identify the time varying parameters by enkf were as follows 1 scenario settings generated the time variant parameters with different trend variations p and pet on a monthly time scale then computed the streamflow and et observations using the two parameter monthly water balance model 2 initialization set the ensemble size n and the total length of assimilation time steps n at the first time step the parameters and state variable ensembles were generated by a gaussian distribution 3 data assimilation after the initialization of parameters and state variables the hydrological model parameters and state were updated in different schemes using the streamflow and et observations obtained in step 1 finally the assimilated and true model parameters were compared to evaluate the performance of enkf schemes the data set used in this experiment lasted for 252 months the experiment was implemented to identify the variation of model parameters from the scenarios in table 2 3 2 study region and data set the study was carried out in the usa using data from the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 the hydrometeorological dataset includes p monthly streamflow pet and et from the period 1983 2003 pet and et were obtained from the university of montana zhang et al 2010 and pet was quantified by a priesley taylor approach priestley and taylor 1972 the simulation performance may be poor in some regions because of issues with the data or the applicability of the hydrological model therefore we mainly focused on the regions where the performance was acceptable e g nse of streamflow lager than 0 6 deng et al 2018 a total of 173 study catchments were selected according to the following criteria first the values of pet should be larger than et second the nse values for streamflow should be over 0 6 and third the nse values for evapotranspiration should be positive climate and environmental conditions vary from basin to basin to assist in the analyses the 173 gauged catchments with areas ranging from 66 7 to 9889 km2 were classified into humid or arid regions using an aridity index ai here ai is defined as the long term average annual ratio of pet and p budyko 1974 according to budyko catchments with an ai smaller than unity are humid while catchments with an ai larger than unity are arid and semi arid catchments those with an ai larger than two are termed very arid out of the 173 catchments 69 were classified as humid catchments and 104 were classified as arid and semi arid catchments fig 1 shows the location and classification distributions of the catchments and fig 2 shows the annual mean values of p q and pet in the period 1983 2003 as well as catchment areas 3 3 parameter settings there are relevant studies have examined how the ensemble size influences the deterministic and probabilistic performance and also the computational demands e g evensen 2004 moradkhani et al 2005 dechant and moradkhani 2012 the results indicate that the tracking of the observations improves and the estimates are more robust but the computational time is longer and more storage space is needed as the ensemble size increases ensembles of different sizes from 10 to 1000 were tested in the synthetic experiments and the same conclusions were obtained therefore the ensemble size was set to 1000 in this study the state variable used for data assimilation was s the observations were streamflow in univariate assimilations while streamflow and et in joint assimilations the variances of the noises introduced to the parameters state variable and output variables eqs 5 and 6 were proportional to the magnitude of the parameters or variables leisenring and moradkhani 2012 the proportionality factors were determined with the most accurate streamflow simulation as the criterion for the 173 catchments the initial values of the proportionality factors were 1 for c and sc 5 for s and 10 for streamflow and et we adjusted the proportionality factors in the basins where the simulation performance was poor manually by selecting the optimal values at intervals of 0 01 from 0 to 0 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 synthetic experiment to assess the performance of the four assimilation schemes the comparisons of the assimilated and true model parameters under different scenarios are presented in fig 3 table 3 shows the evaluation statistics for parameters streamflow and et fig 3 shows that the assimilated parameters of c and sc had similar trends to the true parameters and the estimation of c in schemes 2 3 and 4 matched the true values more closely when the et observations were added into the assimilation it should be noted that there was a time lag between the assimilated c and the true values because of the defect in the enkf technique in the enkf the state and parameters are updated based on the current observations and previous forecasts and there may be a time lag when the enkf method is adopted to estimate the model parameters and observations clark et al 2008 table 3 also shows that the sc assimilation performed the best in scheme 2 the deterministic measure nse of streamflow and et showed that the estimation of streamflow using the enkf method very closely matched the observations with nseq values of over 0 99 and the simulations of et were more accurate in schemes 2 3 and 4 in terms of the probabilistic performance the er95 values were between 5 and 8 for all four schemes demonstrated that the all four schemes could produce accurate 95 predictive bounds the reliability results suggested that the ensemble predictions were more reliable in schemes 1 and 2 with reliability indexes Œ± over 0 9 the reliability indexes of schemes 3 and 4 were around 0 6 and the p values showed that schemes 3 and 4 tended to underpredict the high flows the above results demonstrated that the time varying model parameter estimation framework using the enkf method was able to identify the temporal variation of the model parameters and to produce accurate 95 predictive bounds for streamflow the estimation of parameter c measuring evapotranspiration can be improved by assimilating et observations into the model for the three joint assimilation schemes the deterministic model performances were similar while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2 the joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update both parameters in one step i e scheme 2 outperformed the other two in parameter sc estimation and reliable ensemble prediction 4 2 model performance with time varying parameters it is of interest to understand the impact of time varying model parameters generated from different assimilation schemes on the hydrological simulation a no assimilation experiment that used the sce ua method to calibrate the time invariant model parameters was compared with the four assimilation schemes fig 4 shows the nses of streamflow nseq and et nseet the nses in the assimilation schemes were calculated based on the states after the analysis step of the enkf fig 5 shows the nses in the assimilation schemes before the analysis step of the enkf as shown in figs 4 and 5 the nses of schemes 3 and 4 were similar to the nses of scheme 2 confirming the results found in the synthetic experiment therefore only schemes 1 and 2 and time invariant parameters scheme were further discussed the difference values of nse between schemes 1 2 and the time invariant parameters scheme are shown in fig 6 a positive value indicates that the performance of the time varying parameter scheme is better for scheme 1 the streamflow simulations for 65 of the catchments were better with the time varying parameters than for the time invariant parameters see fig 6a the forecast nseq values were higher in 98 catchments and the same in 15 catchments and the simulation for the actual evaporation was worse in most catchments see fig 6c perhaps because the estimations for parameter c from scheme 1 were poor for scheme 2 the streamflow simulations for 86 of the catchments were better than those based on the time invariant parameters see fig 6b the forecast nseq values were higher in 139 catchments and the same in 9 catchments and significant improvement of et simulation accuracy can be observed see fig 6d the results indicate that the model with time varying parameters obtained by solely assimilating streamflow data performed better in streamflow simulation than the one with constant parameters but the improvement was small the model simulation improved considerably when the time varying parameters were estimated by adding et data into assimilation with streamflow in addition scheme 2 showed higher nseq and nseet than scheme 1 in 109 and 173 catchments fig 7 respectively where the nseet values increased from 0 06 to 0 7 especially in humid areas besides the model simulation performance with time invariant and time varying scheme 2 model parameters for humid and arid regions is presented in fig 8 it can be illustrated that the climate conditions influenced the model simulation on average the streamflow simulation was better in humid catchments than in arid catchments because of the applicability of the adopted hydrological model while the reverse conclusion was observed for the et simulations overall the time varying model parameters obtained by adding et data into assimilation with streamflow led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and et simulation than the model parameters based on solely assimilating streamflow and time invariant approaches the streamflow simulation was better in humid catchments than in arid catchments for all the parameter schemes while the reverse conclusion was observed for the et simulations 4 3 the effects of joint assimilation on the correlations between parameters all the four data assimilation schemes had excellent performances in streamflow simulation and the three joint assimilation schemes showed an improved accuracy in et simulation to further examine whether the four schemes were reasonable the correlations between model parameters were compared the model parameters were expected to be only weakly correlated otherwise a change in one parameter may cause other parameters to change making the optimal values of parameters not unique therefore it was not necessary to set multiple parameters as if they were highly correlated fig 9 presents the pearson correlation coefficients r between c and sc and their absolute values r for the four schemes given separately for each catchment on average c was positively correlated with sc for scheme 1 the number of positively and negatively correlated catchments for the other three schemes was approximately equal from fig 9b it can be seen that the sole assimilation of streamflow led to the highest correlation between c and sc with r in 110 catchments over 0 3 the three joint assimilation schemes showed weaker correlations with only 6 13 and 12 catchments with r larger than 0 3 respectively the medians and mean correlation coefficients between c and sc were around 0 1 and 0 12 for scheme 2 and around 0 12 and 0 13 for scheme 3 and scheme 4 scheme 2 showed weaker correlation between parameters than scheme 1 in 151 catchments where the absolute values of r decreased from 0 01 to 0 7 especially in humid areas fig 10 in general the joint assimilation schemes could reduce the correlation between model parameters and scheme 2 was able to generate more applicable parameter series 5 conclusions the enkf method was used to assimilate streamflow and et data into a monthly water balance model to identify time varying parameters four data assimilation schemes were designed in this study including 1 sole assimilation of streamflow to update both parameters 2 joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update both parameters 3 sole assimilation of et first to update parameter c and then subsequently joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update parameter sc and 4 sole assimilation of et to update parameter c and then sole assimilation of streamflow to update parameter sc based on the results of the synthetic experiment and case study in 173 catchments in usa we drew the following conclusions 1 the time varying model parameter estimation framework using the enkf method was able to identify the temporal variation of the model parameters and to produce accurate 95 predictive bounds for streamflow the estimation of parameter c measuring evapotranspiration can be improved by assimilating et observations into the model the time varying model parameters obtained by adding et data into assimilation with streamflow led to a significant enhancement in deterministic streamflow and et simulation than the model parameters based on solely assimilating streamflow and time invariant approaches 2 for the three joint assimilation schemes the deterministic model performances were similar while the ensemble predictions were more reliable in scheme 2 the joint assimilation of streamflow and et to update both parameters in one step i e scheme 2 outperformed the other two in parameter sc estimation and reliable ensemble prediction 3 the ability to enhance et simulation accuracy was better in humid catchments with nse values increasing by around 0 7 in some humid areas the ability to reduce correlation between parameters was also better in humid catchments with r values decreasing by more than 0 7 because our research demonstrates the best scheme for estimating time varying parameters future work will be focused on the relationship between parameter variations and input observations or land use changes acknowledgements this study

6848,the analog method relies on the subdaily distribution of analog days also called fragments to perform temporal disaggregation the features that serve to define analog days are generally at the daily scale although they are assumed to convey information on the subdaily scale in most cases the only feature used is the daily total at the location of interest features pertaining to the synoptic circulation are also often used although with the purpose of increasing the spatial rather than the temporal resolution precipitation is conditioned not only on synoptic circulation but also on regional features such as orography this combined effect is reflected on the spatial pattern of daily precipitation we propose to rely on descriptions of the spatial pattern to select analog days in order to perform temporal disaggregation three analog method variants based on different sets of spatial pattern features a variant that rely on synoptic circulation alone and a variant that combines synoptic circulation with spatial pattern features are evaluated and compared all the features considered characterize a region therefore the same analog day is employed at all the locations within the region inter site coherence is thus enforced a leave one out procedure is carried out on hourly radar precipitation reanalyses covering a mountainous watershed in the french mediterranean on a 1 km2 grid over the period 1997 2006 uncertainty is taken into account by generating five realizations of each variant performance is measured in terms of return levels 1 20 years at various temporal scales 1 h to 12 h and at two spatial scales grid box and watershed the proposed regional approach to temporal disaggregation globally preserves inter site coherence this can be seen from the relatively good reproduction of the regional pattern of return levels of the study area by all variants synoptic circulation conveys less information on the subdaily scale than spatial pattern features the variant that depends on synoptic circulation alone largely overestimates return levels especially at lower temporal scales 1 h and 3 h combining synoptic circulation with spatial pattern features yielded no significant improvement keywords analog method temporal disaggregation spatial pattern of daily precipitation weather types spatial and temporal coherence french mediterranean 1 introduction in many study areas daily precipitation data are available from relatively dense networks with comparatively long observation periods in contrast subdaily data is often scarce owing to the recent installation of rain gauges with subdaily resolution there is about 10 years of hourly data in the cevennes vivarais area in the french mediterranean seehttp ohmcv osug fr however subdaily precipitation is the main input to several impact models such as rainfall runoff models these models are designed to reproduce flash floods a typical phenomenon of the mediterranean region that occurs within a few hours or less delrieu et al 2005 braud et al 2014 to augment subdaily data bases temporal disaggregation methods can be applied to daily data bases in order to increase the temporal resolution temporal disaggregation methods can be divided into three main categories the first category encompasses random cascade models and approaches based on scale invariance properties serinaldi 2010 kundu and siddani 2011 stochastic weather generators constitute the second category marty et al 2008 allard and bourotte 2015 koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 analog methods sometimes called methods of fragments form the third category mezghani and hingray 2009 westra et al 2012 lee and jeong 2014 in this work we focus on the last category despite being conceptually simple analog approaches have been proven to be competitive pui et al 2012 b√°rdossy and pegram 2016 these methods are non parametric and rely on the core concept of analog days to perform temporal disaggregation the subdaily distribution of analog days also known as fragments is employed to distribute daily precipitation totals into subdaily intervals analog days are defined as days that are similar in terms of a number of features they are selected for each day of the daily data base among the days of the subdaily data base often the only feature used to determine analog days is the daily precipitation total at a given location lee and jeong 2014 b√°rdossy and pegram 2016 in some cases this is supplemented with the information on the wetness states whether it rained or not of the days preceding and following the day of interest westra et al 2012 pui et al 2012 the features employed to select analog days are generally at the daily scale in spite of this they are implicitly assumed to convey information on the subdaily scale in operational forecasts or in climate change impact studies analog approaches rely on the premise that precipitation depends on synoptic circulation to increase the spatial resolution and correct biases a process commonly referred to as statistical downscaling obled et al 2002 bliefernicht and b√°rdossy 2007 radanovics et al 2013 yiou 2014 similarity between days is based on the synoptic circulation predicted or simulated by numerical weather prediction models nwpms or general circulation models gcms nwpms and gcms typically operate at a low spatial resolution with respect to the needs of impact studies the increase in spatial resolution is achieved by selecting analog days from a precipitation data base at high resolution an additional benefit of the approach is to bypass the bias in the precipitation fields predicted or simulated by nwpms and gcms as stated in obled et al 2002 although precipitation is conditioned in part on synoptic circulation it also depends on regional features such as orography the spatial pattern of precipitation in the area of interest where and how much precipitation occurred can be thought of as translating the combined effect of regional features and synoptic circulation to our knowledge there are very few attempts at including features of the spatial pattern of precipitation in statistical downscaling or in temporal disaggregation approaches one such attempt can be found in mezghani and hingray 2009 a single feature the daily spatial average is computed on both temperature and precipitation first the daily spatial averages are estimated from the synoptic circulation a statistical downscaling step they are then employed to define analog days to obtain subdaily distributions a temporal disaggregation step we propose to describe further the spatial pattern of daily precipitation and to consider several of its features in this study our aim is twofold first we seek to assess the ability of features of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation at conveying information on the subdaily distribution of precipitation this ability is evaluated through the performance of temporal disaggregation with the analog method second we seek to evaluate whether synoptic circulation although conventionally used in statistical downscaling can bring useful information in temporal disaggregation since spatial pattern features and synoptic circulation characterize a region temporal disaggregation is performed simultaneously for all the sites in the region of interest more precisely the same analog day is used at all the sites thereby enforcing inter site coherence our analyses are based on the evaluation and comparison of five analog method variants we set a variant based on synoptic circulation as summarized by weather types garavaglia et al 2010 we define three variants that rely on different sets of spatial pattern features the last variant combines synoptic circulation and spatial pattern features the analyses are carried out on radar precipitation reanalyses tabary et al 2012 the selected 1 km2 grid covers a mountainous watershed in the french mediterranean prone to flash floods this is meant as a perfect case study in which the definition of features of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation is not affected by the density of the rain gauge network the analog method variants are evaluated with a leave one out procedure to assess the temporal and spatial coherence of the variants their performance is measured in terms of their ability to reproduce return levels 1 20 years at various temporal scales 1 h to 12 h and at two spatial scales 1 the grid box scale and 2 at the watershed scale 2 study area and data the study area is located in the cevennes range highest peak about 1700 m a mountainous area of the french mediterranean that sits at the southern end of the massif central fig 1 a the study area has a rectangular shape of about 60 km by 30 km 1800 km2 and encompasses the gardon at anduze watershed whose area is approximately 545 km2 fig 1b the watershed features a steep orography with narrow valleys separated by ridges two rivers the gardon at saint jean and gardon at mialet flows from north west to south east the study area is prone to rare but catastrophic flash floods like those which occurred on september 2002 delrieu et al 2005 m√©t√©o france the french weather service provided us with a 10 year 1997 2006 radar reanalysis of hourly precipitation data over a 1 km2 grid tabary et al 2012 the reanalysis is obtained by merging 5 min radar reflectivity images with hourly and daily raingauge data the grid covering the study area in fig 1b contains 2016 boxes 63 in longitude and 32 in latitude we computed daily precipitation totals by aggregating hourly precipitation in the 24 time intervals preceding 7 00 am two subregions that correspond approximately to the mountainous area and the valley are obtained by clustering the grid boxes with k means according to their annual totals for each of the 10 year 1997 2006 period see fig 1c as expected the mean annual total in the mountainous area in white in fig 1c is higher than in the valley in grey in fig 1c 1427 mm in the former as oppposed to 1057 mm in the latter this partition into two subregions is used in section 3 1 to define an analog method variant we also make use of the daily classification into eight weather types of garavaglia et al 2010 the classification is obtained by first identifying typical spatial patterns of daily precipitation over france these patterns are then associated to synoptic circulation as described by geopotential height fields measured at pressure levels 700 and 1000 hpa and at times 0 h and 24 h see garavaglia et al 2010 for all the details the hietograph of daily maximum precipitation over the study area for the 10 year period is shown in fig 2 we can observe that intense precipitation events that can be defined as daily totals greater than 100 mm as in tramblay et al 2011 tend to occur mostly in autumn from september to december in fig 2 each color corresponds to a weather type while the 4th weather type called south circulation has been connected with the occurrence of heavy rainfall tramblay et al 2013 we see from fig 2 that the 7th weather type called central depression is also associated with heavy rainfall in particular with the event in september 2002 which yielded catastrophic flash floods delrieu et al 2005 for the subsequent analyses we selected 1113 days considered as rainy the following criteria were applied at least one grid box has at least 4 mm day and at least 100 grid boxes have at least 1 mm day besides as the reanalyses contain a lot of small values we use a threshold of 1 mm to define positive precipitation totals 3 analog method for regional temporal disaggregation let us call target day a day d for which only the daily precipitation total r d is assumed to be known moreover let us call analog day a day d which is similar to the target day d with respect to some features similarly we denote r d and r d h with 1 h 24 the daily and hourly totals respectively of the analog day the hourly profile p d also known as fragments of day d describes its subdaily distribution it represents the proportion of daily precipitation that fell into each hour and is computed as follows 1 p d r d 1 r d r d 24 r d temporal disaggregation of the target day d is achieved by applying the hourly profile of day d to the daily total of day d yielding 2 r d 1 r d 24 p d r d the observed daily total of the target day is automatically preserved and is distributed into time intervals of 1 h following the hourly profile ot the analog day when performing temporal disaggregation at several locations simultaneously the same analog day serves for all the locations thereby ensuring spatial coherence see dom√≠nguez mora et al 2014 for a similar way to extract a spatial shape in a resampling method if it occurs that r d 0 for some locations then the corresponding hourly profiles are set to p d 1 24 1 24 3 1 selection of analog days we define five analog method variants that differ in the way analog days are selected one variant selects randomly an analog day that shares the same weather type and occurred during the same month as the target day when no days fulfilled these two requirements the selection is made among days with the same weather type only fig 3 illustrates the mean daily precipitation intensities per weather type for the reanalysis data over the study area the spatial pattern changes although moderately so with the weather type three variants are based on different sets of features of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation in these variants an analog day is selected so as to maximize the similarity with the target day in terms of the spatial pattern features to achieve this standardization is performed to bring all the features to a comparable range of values by computing the standard normal quantiles associated to the empirical frequencies of the features more precisely let x be the value taken by a given feature let f n be the associated empirical cumulative distribution function and œÜ be the standard normal cumulative distribution function then the standardized feature value is given by œÜ 1 f n x analog days are selected as days whose standardized features minimize the euclidean distance with the standardized features of the target day the first variant relies on the following three features 1 the spatial average 2 the spatial coefficient of variation and 3 the spatial proportion of daily precipitation intensities leblois 2012 let r d s be the daily total at location s on day d these three features are computed from s d 1 s 2016 r d s 1 the set of locations with positive daily precipitation totals on day d 3 spatialaverage x d 1 s d s s d r d s 4 spatial coefficient of variation 1 s d 1 s s d r d s x d 2 x d 5 spatial proportion s d 2016 fig 4 illustrates the aforementioned three spatial features for each weather type there are some albeit mild changes in the pattern made by these features with the weather type e g between central depression in fig 4g and anticyclonic circulation in fig 4h the second and third variants seek to include information on the location of the rain shower the second variant contains in addition to the three features of the first variant the x and y coordinates of the barycenter of the rain shower these are computed as the average of the x and y coordinates weighted by the precipitation intensities considering only values above the spatial third quartile of the daily precipitation totals more precisely let s d be the set of grid boxes whose daily totals are among the 25 largest on day d moreover for s s d let x s and y s be the coordinates of the grid box and let w d s r d s s s d r d s the coordinates of the barycenter on day d are then defined as s s d w d s x s s s d w d s y s an illustration of a barycenter with the corresponding rain shower shown as the map of its daily totals is given in fig 5 for september 9th 2002 the catastrophic flash flood event analysed in delrieu et al 2005 in fig 6 the barycenters are presented for each weather type there is a tendency for the barycenters to be located over the mountain range particularly for the steady oceanic and south circulation weather types in the third variant information on the location of the rain shower is included by computing the three features of the first variant the spatial average the spatial coefficient of variation and the spatial proportion on the two subregions of the study area shown in fig 1c the representation of the three features restricted on each subregion is very similar to the representation in fig 4 for the whole study area and is therefore not shown variants 1 2 and 3 have respectively 3 5 and 6 features as weather types seem to bring a complementary information to the three features of the first variant see fig 4 we consider a fourth variant which combines the first variant and the weather type classification an analog day is selected among the days sharing the same weather type as the target day by maximizing the similarity in terms of the three features of the first variant 4 return level estimation to evaluate and compare the five analog method variants described in table 1 we employ performance criteria based on return level estimates for a given temporal scale say n hourly a return level of period t years is the n hourly total level which is expected to be exceeded on average once every t years it corresponds to a quantile of the distribution of n hourly totals to estimate return levels we make use of the peaks over threshold approach and rely on the generalized pareto gp distribution indeed for almost all distributions the gp can appproximate the distribution of the excesses over a large threshold arbitrarily well pickands 1975 let y be the random variable that represents the excesses of n hourly totals over u a sufficiently high threshold then y is approximately gp distributed and return levels of period t years for n hourly totals can be estimated as follows 6 u œÉ Œæ t n exc Œæ 1 if Œæ 0 u œÉ log t n exc if Œæ 0 where œÉ 0 and Œæ r are the scale and shape parameters respectively of the gp and n exc corresponds to the average number of excesses per year this can be computed as the product of the probability of exceeding the threshold u and 365 25 24 n the number of observations per year 4 1 regional approach as the radar reanalyses only extend over a 10 year period we employ a regional approach to increase the sample size at each grid box this is particularly useful to reduce the uncertainty linked to the shape parameter estimate kysel√Ω et al 2011 we follow the regional approach described in carreau et al 2017 the main assumption is that the region of interest can be partitioned into subregions with a constant shape parameter the approach is summarized below in our case a subregion is a set of m grid boxes let us assume that the shape parameter of the gp is constant over these m grid boxes i e Œæ i Œæ r i with Œæ r a regional shape parameter let Œº i be the mean of the excesses y i over a threshold u i then the distribution of the scaled excesses y i Œº i is identical for all 1 i m and only depends on the regional shape parameter carreau et al 2017 the inference strategy of the regional approach relies in addition to Œº i on the second probability weighted moment pwm of the scaled excesses diebolt et al 2007 first Œº i is approximated with kernel regression nadaraya 1964 watson 1964 and the scaled excesses are computed second a partition into subregions is performed automatically with k means ripley 1996 based on the second pwm of the scaled excesses finally Œæ r is estimated for each subregion from the second pwm of the scaled excesses and œÉ i is determined by combining the regional shape estimates with Œº i estimates for this case study the threshold is set to the 95 quantile of precipitation intensities i e daily totals greater than 1 mm see ceresetti et al 2012 for instance for a justification of this choice of threshold in a study area that encompasses the present one moreover we fix the partition to contain three subregions in order to capture the upper tail behaviour in the study area 5 evaluation and comparison of analog method variants to evaluate and compare the five analog method variants see table 1 we performed a leave one out analysis also known as jackknife over the 1113 wet days of the 10 year observation period we applied an ensemble approach and selected five analog days for each target day the five days that are most similar in terms of spatial pattern features for variants 1 to 4 and five random days for the weather type variant for each variant we thus obtained an ensemble of five realizations of temporally disaggregated precipitation 5 1 return levels at the grid box scale temporal coherence is assessed by comparing return levels at several temporal scales from the hourly precipitation of the reanalysis and the disaggregated data from each analog variant we estimated return levels for several periods 1 2 5 10 and 20 years at four temporal scales 1 h 3 h 6 h and 12 h at each of the grid boxes for each temporal scale we employed the regional peaks over threshold approach explained in section 4 the maps of the return levels of period 1 year and 20 years for two temporal scales 1 h and 12 h are provided in figs 7 10 for these maps we picked a single realization of the ensemble for variants 1 to 4 it corresponds to the realization provided by the most similar analog for longer return periods that correspond to more intense events and or short temporal scales see figs 7a 9a and 10a precipitation intensities are higher at the foothills than on the mountain range this is typical of this area as the orography tends to have a blocking effect delrieu et al 2005 see also gardes and girard 2010 who obtained a map of hourly return levels of period 10 years estimated from rain gauge data with a similar pattern this pattern is relatively well captured by the analog method variants however the return levels provided by the wt variant are largely overestimated at the temporal scale 1 h the root mean square error rmse can serve to evaluate quantitatively the ability of each analog method variant at reproducing the return levels estimated from the reanalysis data at each of the grid boxes we use a normalized rmse so that the error for each temporal scale is comparable it is defined as the ratio of the rmse and of the standard deviation of the return levels estimated from the reanalysis data 7 1 2016 s 1 2016 z s disag z s rea 2 œÉ rea in eq 7 above z s rea and z s disag are respectively the return levels estimated from the reanalysis data and from an analog method at each grid box 1 s 2016 and œÉ rea is the spatial standard deviation of the return levels estimated from the reanalysis data for a given temporal scale in fig 11 each analog variant is shown as a band whose lower resp upper value is the minimum resp maximum of the normalized rmse of the ensemble of five realizations the wt variant has overall the worst performance especially for lower return periods 5 years or less and for the shorter time scales 6 h or less variants 2 and 3 that include information on the location of the rain shower do not perform systematically better than variant 1 that uses only three features similarly variant 4 which combines variant 1 with weather types did not yield a performance significantly different from variant 1 for all variants the error decreases in magnitude and in spread with increasing temporal scale this is expected since by construction the daily totals are preserved 5 2 return levels at the watershed scale although the return level maps provide information on the spatial coherence of the analog method variants further assessment is made by considering areal rainfall see m√ºller and haberlandt 2015 for other criteria pertaining to spatial coherence we estimated return levels of several return periods 1 2 5 10 and 20 years at several temporal scales 1 h 3 h 6 h and 12 h for the areal rainfall over the gardon at anduze watershed to this end the mean of hourly precipitation totals is computed for the grid boxes belonging to the watershed to obtain hourly areal totals for each temporal scale hourly areal precipitation is aggregated with a sliding window to remove temporal dependence a declustering procedure is applied see the function declust in the r package from southworth et al 2017 and the references therein we then estimated return levels for each temporal scale thanks to the gp approximation see section 4 for the analog methods the estimation is carried out for each member of the ensemble of five realizations in fig 12 return levels of rainfall intensities are shown per time scale 1 3 6 and 12 h the reanalyses levels are represented by a black curve while the analog variants levels are shown as coloured bands the minimum and the maximum of the ensemble of five realizations the bands from the wt variant overestimates the reanalyses curve at all temporal scales for all return periods albeit they get closer at time scale 12 h in contrast the bands from variants 1 to 4 include most of the times the reanalyses curve variants 2 and 3 which contain information on the location of the rain shower and have more features tend to have larger bands at time scales 1 h and 3 h variant 4 does not yield a significant improvement over variant 1 in this respect overall the analog variants bands are closer to the reanalyses curve and are narrower as the temporal scale increases as was mentioned for the normalized rmse in fig 11 this is expected since daily totals are preserved 6 summary and outlook we evaluated and compared five analog method variants to temporally disaggregate daily precipitation totals simultaneously at several sites the variants differ in the sets of features used to select analog days we considered various sets of features of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation together with information on the synoptic circulation in the form of weather types see table 1 our case study relies on radar reanalyses of precipitation which is meant as a perfect case study we selected a 63 by 32 grid with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 the grid covers the gardon at anduze watershed located in the cevennes mountain range in the french mediterranean we carried out a leave one out procedure taking in turn as target day each of 1113 days defined as rainy performance assessment is based on return levels at various temporal scales and at two spatial scales grid box and watershed thereby assessing the temporal and spatial coherence of the analog method variants the conclusions drawn from our case study are twofold first the ability of the spatial pattern features at conveying information on the subdaily distribution of precipitation is assessed this can be seen through the good performance of the analog method variants 1 2 and 3 second although synoptic circulation is often used in statistical downscaling we found that it brings only limited information in temporal disaggregation more specifically our analyses based on figs 7 12 lead to the following findings information on the location of rain showers as defined in this work does not bring significant additional useful information on the subdaily distribution of precipitation this is deduced from the comparison of variants 2 and 3 with variant 1 synoptic circulation alone as summarized by weather types is not sufficient to recover accurate subdaily precipitation distribution this is particularly striking at lower temporal scales 1 h and 3 h this conclusion is drawn from the poor performance of variant wt the combination of spatial pattern features with synoptic circulation variant 4 did not yield significant improvement over spatial pattern features alone this can be seen by comparing variants 1 and 4 in this work we exploited the spatial pattern of daily precipitation to select analog days as it is well known synoptic circulation influences precipitation and is typically employed in statistical downscaling approaches obled et al 2002 bliefernicht and b√°rdossy 2007 radanovics et al 2013 yiou 2014 precipitation is also conditioned by regional features such as orography obled et al 2002 the spatial pattern of daily precipitation can be thought of as a way to capture the interaction of synoptic circulation and regional features in many studies the selection of analog days is based on the daily total precipitation value at a given location on the target day lee and jeong 2014 b√°rdossy and pegram 2016 to our knowledge only mezghani and hingray 2009 made use of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation in the framework of temporal disaggregation with the analog method in their work a single feature the spatial average was considered in this work we built on the three features of the spatial pattern defined in leblois 2012 in order to identify precipitation regimes we proposed two variants that include information on the location of the rain shower as opposed to daily totals which are specific to each location spatial features contain information on the whole area therefore temporal disaggregation can be performed simultaneously and straightforwardly at several sites by selecting a unique analog day for all the sites on the other hand the computation of the spatial pattern features relies on the availability of daily totals at a significant number of sites in the area of interest potential next steps to evaluate the performance of spatial pattern features in the analog method for temporal disaggregation are as follows it could be applied on real raingauged networks or by sub sampling the radar reanalysis grid to assess the sensitivity of the spatial pattern features to the density of gauged sites it would also be interesting to apply the proposed analog approach in other areas in which precipitation is driven by different types of regional features besides inter day coherence was not assessed and it is probably under estimated by the proposed analog variants following westra et al 2012 the wetness states of the days preceding and following the target day could be considered when selecting analog days acknowledgements this work was partially supported by the agence nationale de la recherche french

6848,the analog method relies on the subdaily distribution of analog days also called fragments to perform temporal disaggregation the features that serve to define analog days are generally at the daily scale although they are assumed to convey information on the subdaily scale in most cases the only feature used is the daily total at the location of interest features pertaining to the synoptic circulation are also often used although with the purpose of increasing the spatial rather than the temporal resolution precipitation is conditioned not only on synoptic circulation but also on regional features such as orography this combined effect is reflected on the spatial pattern of daily precipitation we propose to rely on descriptions of the spatial pattern to select analog days in order to perform temporal disaggregation three analog method variants based on different sets of spatial pattern features a variant that rely on synoptic circulation alone and a variant that combines synoptic circulation with spatial pattern features are evaluated and compared all the features considered characterize a region therefore the same analog day is employed at all the locations within the region inter site coherence is thus enforced a leave one out procedure is carried out on hourly radar precipitation reanalyses covering a mountainous watershed in the french mediterranean on a 1 km2 grid over the period 1997 2006 uncertainty is taken into account by generating five realizations of each variant performance is measured in terms of return levels 1 20 years at various temporal scales 1 h to 12 h and at two spatial scales grid box and watershed the proposed regional approach to temporal disaggregation globally preserves inter site coherence this can be seen from the relatively good reproduction of the regional pattern of return levels of the study area by all variants synoptic circulation conveys less information on the subdaily scale than spatial pattern features the variant that depends on synoptic circulation alone largely overestimates return levels especially at lower temporal scales 1 h and 3 h combining synoptic circulation with spatial pattern features yielded no significant improvement keywords analog method temporal disaggregation spatial pattern of daily precipitation weather types spatial and temporal coherence french mediterranean 1 introduction in many study areas daily precipitation data are available from relatively dense networks with comparatively long observation periods in contrast subdaily data is often scarce owing to the recent installation of rain gauges with subdaily resolution there is about 10 years of hourly data in the cevennes vivarais area in the french mediterranean seehttp ohmcv osug fr however subdaily precipitation is the main input to several impact models such as rainfall runoff models these models are designed to reproduce flash floods a typical phenomenon of the mediterranean region that occurs within a few hours or less delrieu et al 2005 braud et al 2014 to augment subdaily data bases temporal disaggregation methods can be applied to daily data bases in order to increase the temporal resolution temporal disaggregation methods can be divided into three main categories the first category encompasses random cascade models and approaches based on scale invariance properties serinaldi 2010 kundu and siddani 2011 stochastic weather generators constitute the second category marty et al 2008 allard and bourotte 2015 koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 analog methods sometimes called methods of fragments form the third category mezghani and hingray 2009 westra et al 2012 lee and jeong 2014 in this work we focus on the last category despite being conceptually simple analog approaches have been proven to be competitive pui et al 2012 b√°rdossy and pegram 2016 these methods are non parametric and rely on the core concept of analog days to perform temporal disaggregation the subdaily distribution of analog days also known as fragments is employed to distribute daily precipitation totals into subdaily intervals analog days are defined as days that are similar in terms of a number of features they are selected for each day of the daily data base among the days of the subdaily data base often the only feature used to determine analog days is the daily precipitation total at a given location lee and jeong 2014 b√°rdossy and pegram 2016 in some cases this is supplemented with the information on the wetness states whether it rained or not of the days preceding and following the day of interest westra et al 2012 pui et al 2012 the features employed to select analog days are generally at the daily scale in spite of this they are implicitly assumed to convey information on the subdaily scale in operational forecasts or in climate change impact studies analog approaches rely on the premise that precipitation depends on synoptic circulation to increase the spatial resolution and correct biases a process commonly referred to as statistical downscaling obled et al 2002 bliefernicht and b√°rdossy 2007 radanovics et al 2013 yiou 2014 similarity between days is based on the synoptic circulation predicted or simulated by numerical weather prediction models nwpms or general circulation models gcms nwpms and gcms typically operate at a low spatial resolution with respect to the needs of impact studies the increase in spatial resolution is achieved by selecting analog days from a precipitation data base at high resolution an additional benefit of the approach is to bypass the bias in the precipitation fields predicted or simulated by nwpms and gcms as stated in obled et al 2002 although precipitation is conditioned in part on synoptic circulation it also depends on regional features such as orography the spatial pattern of precipitation in the area of interest where and how much precipitation occurred can be thought of as translating the combined effect of regional features and synoptic circulation to our knowledge there are very few attempts at including features of the spatial pattern of precipitation in statistical downscaling or in temporal disaggregation approaches one such attempt can be found in mezghani and hingray 2009 a single feature the daily spatial average is computed on both temperature and precipitation first the daily spatial averages are estimated from the synoptic circulation a statistical downscaling step they are then employed to define analog days to obtain subdaily distributions a temporal disaggregation step we propose to describe further the spatial pattern of daily precipitation and to consider several of its features in this study our aim is twofold first we seek to assess the ability of features of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation at conveying information on the subdaily distribution of precipitation this ability is evaluated through the performance of temporal disaggregation with the analog method second we seek to evaluate whether synoptic circulation although conventionally used in statistical downscaling can bring useful information in temporal disaggregation since spatial pattern features and synoptic circulation characterize a region temporal disaggregation is performed simultaneously for all the sites in the region of interest more precisely the same analog day is used at all the sites thereby enforcing inter site coherence our analyses are based on the evaluation and comparison of five analog method variants we set a variant based on synoptic circulation as summarized by weather types garavaglia et al 2010 we define three variants that rely on different sets of spatial pattern features the last variant combines synoptic circulation and spatial pattern features the analyses are carried out on radar precipitation reanalyses tabary et al 2012 the selected 1 km2 grid covers a mountainous watershed in the french mediterranean prone to flash floods this is meant as a perfect case study in which the definition of features of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation is not affected by the density of the rain gauge network the analog method variants are evaluated with a leave one out procedure to assess the temporal and spatial coherence of the variants their performance is measured in terms of their ability to reproduce return levels 1 20 years at various temporal scales 1 h to 12 h and at two spatial scales 1 the grid box scale and 2 at the watershed scale 2 study area and data the study area is located in the cevennes range highest peak about 1700 m a mountainous area of the french mediterranean that sits at the southern end of the massif central fig 1 a the study area has a rectangular shape of about 60 km by 30 km 1800 km2 and encompasses the gardon at anduze watershed whose area is approximately 545 km2 fig 1b the watershed features a steep orography with narrow valleys separated by ridges two rivers the gardon at saint jean and gardon at mialet flows from north west to south east the study area is prone to rare but catastrophic flash floods like those which occurred on september 2002 delrieu et al 2005 m√©t√©o france the french weather service provided us with a 10 year 1997 2006 radar reanalysis of hourly precipitation data over a 1 km2 grid tabary et al 2012 the reanalysis is obtained by merging 5 min radar reflectivity images with hourly and daily raingauge data the grid covering the study area in fig 1b contains 2016 boxes 63 in longitude and 32 in latitude we computed daily precipitation totals by aggregating hourly precipitation in the 24 time intervals preceding 7 00 am two subregions that correspond approximately to the mountainous area and the valley are obtained by clustering the grid boxes with k means according to their annual totals for each of the 10 year 1997 2006 period see fig 1c as expected the mean annual total in the mountainous area in white in fig 1c is higher than in the valley in grey in fig 1c 1427 mm in the former as oppposed to 1057 mm in the latter this partition into two subregions is used in section 3 1 to define an analog method variant we also make use of the daily classification into eight weather types of garavaglia et al 2010 the classification is obtained by first identifying typical spatial patterns of daily precipitation over france these patterns are then associated to synoptic circulation as described by geopotential height fields measured at pressure levels 700 and 1000 hpa and at times 0 h and 24 h see garavaglia et al 2010 for all the details the hietograph of daily maximum precipitation over the study area for the 10 year period is shown in fig 2 we can observe that intense precipitation events that can be defined as daily totals greater than 100 mm as in tramblay et al 2011 tend to occur mostly in autumn from september to december in fig 2 each color corresponds to a weather type while the 4th weather type called south circulation has been connected with the occurrence of heavy rainfall tramblay et al 2013 we see from fig 2 that the 7th weather type called central depression is also associated with heavy rainfall in particular with the event in september 2002 which yielded catastrophic flash floods delrieu et al 2005 for the subsequent analyses we selected 1113 days considered as rainy the following criteria were applied at least one grid box has at least 4 mm day and at least 100 grid boxes have at least 1 mm day besides as the reanalyses contain a lot of small values we use a threshold of 1 mm to define positive precipitation totals 3 analog method for regional temporal disaggregation let us call target day a day d for which only the daily precipitation total r d is assumed to be known moreover let us call analog day a day d which is similar to the target day d with respect to some features similarly we denote r d and r d h with 1 h 24 the daily and hourly totals respectively of the analog day the hourly profile p d also known as fragments of day d describes its subdaily distribution it represents the proportion of daily precipitation that fell into each hour and is computed as follows 1 p d r d 1 r d r d 24 r d temporal disaggregation of the target day d is achieved by applying the hourly profile of day d to the daily total of day d yielding 2 r d 1 r d 24 p d r d the observed daily total of the target day is automatically preserved and is distributed into time intervals of 1 h following the hourly profile ot the analog day when performing temporal disaggregation at several locations simultaneously the same analog day serves for all the locations thereby ensuring spatial coherence see dom√≠nguez mora et al 2014 for a similar way to extract a spatial shape in a resampling method if it occurs that r d 0 for some locations then the corresponding hourly profiles are set to p d 1 24 1 24 3 1 selection of analog days we define five analog method variants that differ in the way analog days are selected one variant selects randomly an analog day that shares the same weather type and occurred during the same month as the target day when no days fulfilled these two requirements the selection is made among days with the same weather type only fig 3 illustrates the mean daily precipitation intensities per weather type for the reanalysis data over the study area the spatial pattern changes although moderately so with the weather type three variants are based on different sets of features of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation in these variants an analog day is selected so as to maximize the similarity with the target day in terms of the spatial pattern features to achieve this standardization is performed to bring all the features to a comparable range of values by computing the standard normal quantiles associated to the empirical frequencies of the features more precisely let x be the value taken by a given feature let f n be the associated empirical cumulative distribution function and œÜ be the standard normal cumulative distribution function then the standardized feature value is given by œÜ 1 f n x analog days are selected as days whose standardized features minimize the euclidean distance with the standardized features of the target day the first variant relies on the following three features 1 the spatial average 2 the spatial coefficient of variation and 3 the spatial proportion of daily precipitation intensities leblois 2012 let r d s be the daily total at location s on day d these three features are computed from s d 1 s 2016 r d s 1 the set of locations with positive daily precipitation totals on day d 3 spatialaverage x d 1 s d s s d r d s 4 spatial coefficient of variation 1 s d 1 s s d r d s x d 2 x d 5 spatial proportion s d 2016 fig 4 illustrates the aforementioned three spatial features for each weather type there are some albeit mild changes in the pattern made by these features with the weather type e g between central depression in fig 4g and anticyclonic circulation in fig 4h the second and third variants seek to include information on the location of the rain shower the second variant contains in addition to the three features of the first variant the x and y coordinates of the barycenter of the rain shower these are computed as the average of the x and y coordinates weighted by the precipitation intensities considering only values above the spatial third quartile of the daily precipitation totals more precisely let s d be the set of grid boxes whose daily totals are among the 25 largest on day d moreover for s s d let x s and y s be the coordinates of the grid box and let w d s r d s s s d r d s the coordinates of the barycenter on day d are then defined as s s d w d s x s s s d w d s y s an illustration of a barycenter with the corresponding rain shower shown as the map of its daily totals is given in fig 5 for september 9th 2002 the catastrophic flash flood event analysed in delrieu et al 2005 in fig 6 the barycenters are presented for each weather type there is a tendency for the barycenters to be located over the mountain range particularly for the steady oceanic and south circulation weather types in the third variant information on the location of the rain shower is included by computing the three features of the first variant the spatial average the spatial coefficient of variation and the spatial proportion on the two subregions of the study area shown in fig 1c the representation of the three features restricted on each subregion is very similar to the representation in fig 4 for the whole study area and is therefore not shown variants 1 2 and 3 have respectively 3 5 and 6 features as weather types seem to bring a complementary information to the three features of the first variant see fig 4 we consider a fourth variant which combines the first variant and the weather type classification an analog day is selected among the days sharing the same weather type as the target day by maximizing the similarity in terms of the three features of the first variant 4 return level estimation to evaluate and compare the five analog method variants described in table 1 we employ performance criteria based on return level estimates for a given temporal scale say n hourly a return level of period t years is the n hourly total level which is expected to be exceeded on average once every t years it corresponds to a quantile of the distribution of n hourly totals to estimate return levels we make use of the peaks over threshold approach and rely on the generalized pareto gp distribution indeed for almost all distributions the gp can appproximate the distribution of the excesses over a large threshold arbitrarily well pickands 1975 let y be the random variable that represents the excesses of n hourly totals over u a sufficiently high threshold then y is approximately gp distributed and return levels of period t years for n hourly totals can be estimated as follows 6 u œÉ Œæ t n exc Œæ 1 if Œæ 0 u œÉ log t n exc if Œæ 0 where œÉ 0 and Œæ r are the scale and shape parameters respectively of the gp and n exc corresponds to the average number of excesses per year this can be computed as the product of the probability of exceeding the threshold u and 365 25 24 n the number of observations per year 4 1 regional approach as the radar reanalyses only extend over a 10 year period we employ a regional approach to increase the sample size at each grid box this is particularly useful to reduce the uncertainty linked to the shape parameter estimate kysel√Ω et al 2011 we follow the regional approach described in carreau et al 2017 the main assumption is that the region of interest can be partitioned into subregions with a constant shape parameter the approach is summarized below in our case a subregion is a set of m grid boxes let us assume that the shape parameter of the gp is constant over these m grid boxes i e Œæ i Œæ r i with Œæ r a regional shape parameter let Œº i be the mean of the excesses y i over a threshold u i then the distribution of the scaled excesses y i Œº i is identical for all 1 i m and only depends on the regional shape parameter carreau et al 2017 the inference strategy of the regional approach relies in addition to Œº i on the second probability weighted moment pwm of the scaled excesses diebolt et al 2007 first Œº i is approximated with kernel regression nadaraya 1964 watson 1964 and the scaled excesses are computed second a partition into subregions is performed automatically with k means ripley 1996 based on the second pwm of the scaled excesses finally Œæ r is estimated for each subregion from the second pwm of the scaled excesses and œÉ i is determined by combining the regional shape estimates with Œº i estimates for this case study the threshold is set to the 95 quantile of precipitation intensities i e daily totals greater than 1 mm see ceresetti et al 2012 for instance for a justification of this choice of threshold in a study area that encompasses the present one moreover we fix the partition to contain three subregions in order to capture the upper tail behaviour in the study area 5 evaluation and comparison of analog method variants to evaluate and compare the five analog method variants see table 1 we performed a leave one out analysis also known as jackknife over the 1113 wet days of the 10 year observation period we applied an ensemble approach and selected five analog days for each target day the five days that are most similar in terms of spatial pattern features for variants 1 to 4 and five random days for the weather type variant for each variant we thus obtained an ensemble of five realizations of temporally disaggregated precipitation 5 1 return levels at the grid box scale temporal coherence is assessed by comparing return levels at several temporal scales from the hourly precipitation of the reanalysis and the disaggregated data from each analog variant we estimated return levels for several periods 1 2 5 10 and 20 years at four temporal scales 1 h 3 h 6 h and 12 h at each of the grid boxes for each temporal scale we employed the regional peaks over threshold approach explained in section 4 the maps of the return levels of period 1 year and 20 years for two temporal scales 1 h and 12 h are provided in figs 7 10 for these maps we picked a single realization of the ensemble for variants 1 to 4 it corresponds to the realization provided by the most similar analog for longer return periods that correspond to more intense events and or short temporal scales see figs 7a 9a and 10a precipitation intensities are higher at the foothills than on the mountain range this is typical of this area as the orography tends to have a blocking effect delrieu et al 2005 see also gardes and girard 2010 who obtained a map of hourly return levels of period 10 years estimated from rain gauge data with a similar pattern this pattern is relatively well captured by the analog method variants however the return levels provided by the wt variant are largely overestimated at the temporal scale 1 h the root mean square error rmse can serve to evaluate quantitatively the ability of each analog method variant at reproducing the return levels estimated from the reanalysis data at each of the grid boxes we use a normalized rmse so that the error for each temporal scale is comparable it is defined as the ratio of the rmse and of the standard deviation of the return levels estimated from the reanalysis data 7 1 2016 s 1 2016 z s disag z s rea 2 œÉ rea in eq 7 above z s rea and z s disag are respectively the return levels estimated from the reanalysis data and from an analog method at each grid box 1 s 2016 and œÉ rea is the spatial standard deviation of the return levels estimated from the reanalysis data for a given temporal scale in fig 11 each analog variant is shown as a band whose lower resp upper value is the minimum resp maximum of the normalized rmse of the ensemble of five realizations the wt variant has overall the worst performance especially for lower return periods 5 years or less and for the shorter time scales 6 h or less variants 2 and 3 that include information on the location of the rain shower do not perform systematically better than variant 1 that uses only three features similarly variant 4 which combines variant 1 with weather types did not yield a performance significantly different from variant 1 for all variants the error decreases in magnitude and in spread with increasing temporal scale this is expected since by construction the daily totals are preserved 5 2 return levels at the watershed scale although the return level maps provide information on the spatial coherence of the analog method variants further assessment is made by considering areal rainfall see m√ºller and haberlandt 2015 for other criteria pertaining to spatial coherence we estimated return levels of several return periods 1 2 5 10 and 20 years at several temporal scales 1 h 3 h 6 h and 12 h for the areal rainfall over the gardon at anduze watershed to this end the mean of hourly precipitation totals is computed for the grid boxes belonging to the watershed to obtain hourly areal totals for each temporal scale hourly areal precipitation is aggregated with a sliding window to remove temporal dependence a declustering procedure is applied see the function declust in the r package from southworth et al 2017 and the references therein we then estimated return levels for each temporal scale thanks to the gp approximation see section 4 for the analog methods the estimation is carried out for each member of the ensemble of five realizations in fig 12 return levels of rainfall intensities are shown per time scale 1 3 6 and 12 h the reanalyses levels are represented by a black curve while the analog variants levels are shown as coloured bands the minimum and the maximum of the ensemble of five realizations the bands from the wt variant overestimates the reanalyses curve at all temporal scales for all return periods albeit they get closer at time scale 12 h in contrast the bands from variants 1 to 4 include most of the times the reanalyses curve variants 2 and 3 which contain information on the location of the rain shower and have more features tend to have larger bands at time scales 1 h and 3 h variant 4 does not yield a significant improvement over variant 1 in this respect overall the analog variants bands are closer to the reanalyses curve and are narrower as the temporal scale increases as was mentioned for the normalized rmse in fig 11 this is expected since daily totals are preserved 6 summary and outlook we evaluated and compared five analog method variants to temporally disaggregate daily precipitation totals simultaneously at several sites the variants differ in the sets of features used to select analog days we considered various sets of features of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation together with information on the synoptic circulation in the form of weather types see table 1 our case study relies on radar reanalyses of precipitation which is meant as a perfect case study we selected a 63 by 32 grid with a spatial resolution of 1 km2 the grid covers the gardon at anduze watershed located in the cevennes mountain range in the french mediterranean we carried out a leave one out procedure taking in turn as target day each of 1113 days defined as rainy performance assessment is based on return levels at various temporal scales and at two spatial scales grid box and watershed thereby assessing the temporal and spatial coherence of the analog method variants the conclusions drawn from our case study are twofold first the ability of the spatial pattern features at conveying information on the subdaily distribution of precipitation is assessed this can be seen through the good performance of the analog method variants 1 2 and 3 second although synoptic circulation is often used in statistical downscaling we found that it brings only limited information in temporal disaggregation more specifically our analyses based on figs 7 12 lead to the following findings information on the location of rain showers as defined in this work does not bring significant additional useful information on the subdaily distribution of precipitation this is deduced from the comparison of variants 2 and 3 with variant 1 synoptic circulation alone as summarized by weather types is not sufficient to recover accurate subdaily precipitation distribution this is particularly striking at lower temporal scales 1 h and 3 h this conclusion is drawn from the poor performance of variant wt the combination of spatial pattern features with synoptic circulation variant 4 did not yield significant improvement over spatial pattern features alone this can be seen by comparing variants 1 and 4 in this work we exploited the spatial pattern of daily precipitation to select analog days as it is well known synoptic circulation influences precipitation and is typically employed in statistical downscaling approaches obled et al 2002 bliefernicht and b√°rdossy 2007 radanovics et al 2013 yiou 2014 precipitation is also conditioned by regional features such as orography obled et al 2002 the spatial pattern of daily precipitation can be thought of as a way to capture the interaction of synoptic circulation and regional features in many studies the selection of analog days is based on the daily total precipitation value at a given location on the target day lee and jeong 2014 b√°rdossy and pegram 2016 to our knowledge only mezghani and hingray 2009 made use of the spatial pattern of daily precipitation in the framework of temporal disaggregation with the analog method in their work a single feature the spatial average was considered in this work we built on the three features of the spatial pattern defined in leblois 2012 in order to identify

performance of spatial pattern features in the analog method for temporal disaggregation are as follows it could be applied on real raingauged networks or by sub sampling the radar reanalysis grid to assess the sensitivity of the spatial pattern features to the density of gauged sites it would also be interesting to apply the proposed analog approach in other areas in which precipitation is driven by different types of regional features besides inter day coherence was not assessed and it is probably under estimated by the proposed analog variants following westra et al 2012 the wetness states of the days preceding and following the target day could be considered when selecting analog days acknowledgements this work was partially supported by the agence nationale de la recherche french

vanderlinden associate editor graphical abstract biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and hydropedological processes have attracted increasing attention in dryland ecosystems but are nevertheless subjected to great controversy according to some scholars infiltration was assumed to decrease due to repellency and to increase with the organic matter content due to its role in increasing aggregate stability and porosity these assumptions were checked in our study on the loess plateau of china by using double ring and disc infiltrometers the infiltration curves of cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts as well as on bare soil were continuously measured and the characteristics of water infiltration on biocrust covered soil and its correlations with soil properties were analyzed our results showed that the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts had significantly lower constant infiltration rates under ponding conditions 0 265 and 0 180 cm min 1 respectively as compared with the bare sand 0 372 cm min 1 and they took significantly more time 41 and 105 and water 14 and 73 to reach steady state infiltration similarly the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were 39 0 514 cm min 1 and 65 0 295 cm min 1 lower than that of the bare sand 0 839 cm min 1 respectively more importantly biocrust infiltrability was closely related with biocrust characteristics and soil properties especially particle size distribution and crust thickness contrary to some assumptions that attributed impeded infiltration to crust repellency and increased infiltration to the role played by om both variables could not have explained the current results under tension and ponding conditions cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were found to greatly reduce surface soil infiltrability and impede soil water infiltration these findings should be considered for future analyses of hydropedological processes in arid and semiarid regions keywords biological soil crust microbiotic crust soil infiltrability double ring infiltrometer disc infiltrometer loess plateau in china 1 introduction as a critical component in hydrologic processes soil water infiltration has been intensively investigated in various soils and climate regions at different scales it is particularly important in dryland ecosystems with limited precipitation such as the loess plateau of china due to its role in supporting the ecosystem s vegetation and biodiversity zhang et al 2016 although the rate of soil water infiltration is regulated by many factors it is basically determined by edaphic properties which generally depended on soil particle size distribution structure the continuity and stability of pores and soil suction and especially soil surface crusts angulo jaramillo et al 2016 in most arid and semi arid soils the physical structural or depositional soil crusts have been intensively investigated in the past decades the results showed that the formation of a physical crust can seal the surface and thus to decrease soil infiltrability nciizah and wakindiki 2015 similarly biocrusts also named biological soil crusts which are a combination of microorganisms residing within the top few millimeters centimeters of the soil in dryland ecosystems bowker et al 2018 may greatly affect infiltration however their effects on soil infiltrability and soil water infiltration are still controversial belnap 2006 biocrusts are highly specialized soil layers created by symbiotic photoautotrophic communities formed by cyanobacteria mosses lichens green algae fungi and bacteria and their closely bonding soil particles in the uppermost few centimeters of the soil surface belnap et al 2016 they are extensively developed and widely distributed in arid and semiarid regions and they have been regarded as an important component of land cover bowker et al 2018 it is widely accepted that biocrusts are ecosystem engineers and play an important role for numerous soil processes and functioning garibotti et al 2018 their rehabilitation is therefore important for combating land degradation and desertification rossi et al 2017 while their role in halting soil water erosion gao et al 2017 and wind erosion ma et al 2017 increasing soil carbon mu√±oz rojas et al 2018 and nitrogen heindel et al 2018 and promoting biodiversity castillo monroy et al 2011 were substantiated controversy still exists regarding their hydrological roles especially soil water infiltration chen et al 2018 wang et al 2017 currently contradicting results are reported from many parts of the world whereas some scholars report on the crust role in increasing infiltration jiang et al 2018 kidron et al 2012 other report on the crust role in impeding infiltration chen et al 2018 wang et al 2017 or alternatively not affecting infiltration kidron and b√ºdel 2014 williams et al 1999 these contradictory findings were attributed to soil texture and structure biocrust types and coverage climate disturbance history and spatial temporal scale belnap 2006 while impeded infiltration was explained by pore clogging due to exopolysaccharide excretion by cyanobacteria kidron et al 2003 malam issa et al 2009 it was also explained by water repellency keck et al 2016 on the other hand increased infiltration was explained by higher organic matter om which may enhance aggregate stability algayer et al 2014 and increased soil porosity menon et al 2011 the question remains whether infiltration will be determined by repellency rodriguez caballero et al 2013 om induced aggregate stability chamizo et al 2012b or by the crust properties kidron et al 2003 malam issa et al 2009 all of which may greatly change surface soil infiltrability and soil water infiltration process in dryland ecosystem hypothesizing that the presence of biocrusts would significantly impede soil water infiltration a series of infiltration measurements were conducted on cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts as well as on bare soil sand on the loess plateau of china using double ring infiltrometer and disc infiltrometer the infiltration curves were continuously measured from initial to steady state infiltration aiming to characterize soil water infiltration under ponding and tension conditions in the presence or absence of biocrusts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in a 6 9 km2 watershed named liudaogou 38 46 38 51 n 110 21 110 23 e 1081 1274 m above sea level see fig 1 a in the northern loess plateau of china long term mean precipitation is 409 mm with 80 occurring in summer and mean annual evaporation is 1337 mm xiao et al 2016 mean annual temperature is 8 4 c and mean monthly temperatures range from 9 7 c in winter dec feb to 23 7 c in summer jun aug xiao et al 2016 the watershed is hilly with numerous gullies reflecting the sparse vegetation frequent droughts and poor land use since the 1600s runoff events are common and as a result this region experiences the most serious soil erosion in the loess plateau serving therefore as the main source of coarse sediments for the yellow river in order to combat land degradation and desertification the grain for green program has been implemented in recent decades to recover vegetation during the program the agricultural activities have ceased over a large area and a large number of native shrubs have been artificially planted to conserve soil and water cao et al 2009 owing to the resultant surface stabilization biocrust establishment took place the biocrusts dominated by moss and cyanobacteria are extensively developed on fallow lands shrub lands and grass lands of the watershed with coverage of 30 on average and up to 70 80 in some areas xiao et al 2010 in the current study a representative area 0 5 km2 with sparse shrubland and well developed cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts was selected as the experimental area figs 1b 1c and 2a the soil on the experimental area was an aeolian sandy soil entisols in soil taxonomy of the united states department of agriculture and its texture was generally loamy sand classification system of the united states department of agriculture with 81 of sand 50 2000 Œºm 2 2 experimental design three treatments with four replicates were conducted in this study including i bare sand aeolian sand without biocrusts see fig 2 b which was located far away from shrubs and thus suffered serious wind erosion in winter ii cyanobacteria biocrusts biocrusts dominated by cyanobacteria see fig 2c which were located among sparse shrubs and are naturally developed on fixed aeolian sand and iii moss biocrusts biocrusts dominated by moss with 30 years age and 95 moss coverage see fig 2d which characterize fixed aeolian sand the moss biocrusts proliferate next to shrubs which provide them with stable surface conditions and partial shading according to the experimental design four infiltration plots 200 m2 in area see fig 1c with moss and cyanobacteria biocrusts as well as nearby bare sand were selected as replicates under similar conditions e g biocrust characteristics soil texture slope gradient and orientation coverage and type of shrubs 2 3 measurements of biocrust characteristics and soil properties at each infiltration plot the index of soil water repellency was measured in 10 replicates for each treatment by the molarity of ethanol droplet and mini disk infiltrometer alagna et al 2017 respectively moreover 100 cm2 of samples of biocrusts and topsoil were randomly taken from 10 sub sampling points using 10 10 2 cm petri dishes the samples were stored at 20 c and further processed in the laboratory to measure biocrust characteristics soil particle size distribution and om content during the sampling the petri dishes were pushed into the ground 2 cm depth thus containing the biocrusts and the underlying soil and then they were scooped out using a small shovel fig 2e additionally 5 cm of the top soil was sampled by a ring 5 cm in height and 100 cm3 in volume in 10 replicates to measure bulk density saturated water content and field capacity in laboratory the biocrust layer biological components and their closely attached soil particles see fig 2f for an example was carefully separated from the underling soil for each biocrust sample and its thickness was measured with a digital caliper the particle size distribution and om content of the biocrust layer were measured and compared to the bare soil the moss plants were separated from soil with water through a 2 mm screen and dried at 65 c for 24 h for the measurement of moss biomass the total chlorophyll content of the samples was determined through a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 5000 hach company in usa to evaluate the cryptogam biomass of the biocrusts the soil particle size distribution of the samples 20 g from biocrust layer or bare sand in petri dishes was determined through a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd in uk after being separated with sodium hexametaphosphate the soil om content was also measured using the dichromate redox titration method described by carter and gregorich 2006 additionally the bulk density saturated water content and field capacity of the samples taken by the ring were determined in accordance with carter and gregorich 2006 2 4 measurement of soil water infiltration under ponding condition at the four infiltration plots the infiltration measurements were conducted with a double ring infiltrometer for each treatment the double ring infiltrometer consisted of an external ring 50 cm in diameter 30 cm in height and an internal ring 20 cm in diameter 30 cm in height during the experiment the double ring infiltrometer was carefully pushed into the soil leaving a 5 cm rim above the surface afterwards the double ring infiltrometer was filled with deionized water and a constant water depth 1 5 cm was maintained by a mariotte bottle the mariotte bottle was weighted continuously by a balance with 1 g resolution and the weight was recorded every 10 s until a steady state infiltration was reached the mariotte bottle was re filled with water if necessary once the water weight remained almost constant for 5 intervals infiltration was considered to reach steady state infiltration additionally the water temperature was measured during the experiment to eliminate the effect of water temperature on soil water infiltration according to suwardji and eberbach 1998 the mean water temperature 22 2 c was used to convert the measured soil infiltration rate to standard soil infiltration rate at 10 c 1 i 60 Œ¥ w œÄ r 2 Œ¥ t 0 7 0 03 t where i is the

infiltration plots the infiltration measurement was conducted with a disc infiltrometer for each treatment the disc infiltrometer was 15 cm in diameter and its reservoir tower was 3 5 cm in diameter and 100 cm in height the tension of the disc infiltrometer was adjustable between 0 and 20 cm of water head and it was set to 1 0 cm in this study during the measurement 2 mm layer of fine sand 0 25 mm was placed within a circular area on the infiltration sites and the disc infiltrometer the disc infiltrometer was filled with water and installed on the fine sand the height of the water level in the reservoir tower was recorded every 5 s until reaching a steady state infiltration the reservoir tower was refilled with water if necessary eq 1 was used to convert the measured soil infiltration rate for mean water temperature 24 7 c to standard soil infiltration rate at 10 c moreover the surface 5 cm soil was collected by a ring 100 cm3 before and after each measurement and their water content and bulk density were measured following oven drying at 105 c for 24 h the infiltration data collected with the disc infiltrometer under tension condition were analyzed through the following procedures first the three dimensional steady state infiltration under tension condition with disc infiltrometer was described by the following forms of wooding s equation wooding 1968 2 q œÄ r 1 2 k

Œª m 7 4 Œª c 2 6 data analysis the characteristics of soil water infiltration and soil infiltrability represented by constant infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity were analyzed based on the infiltration and cumulative infiltration curves under ponding and tension conditions respectively the differences between biocrusts and bare sand were analyzed to explore biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and these effects were explained by biocrust characteristics and soil properties through correlation analyses the experimental data were analyzed based on the descriptive statistics in ibm spss statistics 22 the final results of each treatment came from the mean values of replicates and expressed as the mean standard error the differences among the treatments were statistically evaluated at the 5 probability level by one way anova in sas 8 01 the representation and graphical fits of experimental data were obtained using originpro 9 2 3 results 3 1 characteristics of biocrusts and their effects on soil properties the cyanobacteria biocrusts were dominated by lyngbya allorgei and phormidium angustissimum while the moss biocrusts were dominated by bryum arcticum r brown b s g and didymodon vinealis brid zander the moss density and biomass were 55 9 gametophyte cm 2 and 153 0 g m 2 respectively in comparison with the cyanobacteria biocrusts the moss biocrusts was significantly thicker 135 and had significantly higher chlorophyll content 45 table 1 moreover the particle size distribution for both cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts has a high amount of silt 42 with sand being 55 while the amount of sand in the bare sand reached 92 more specifically the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts greatly increased by 14 and 50 respectively the percentage of soil particles between 0 01 and 0 05 mm correspondingly they greatly decreased by 46 and 50 respectively the percentage of soil particles between 0 2 and 0 5 mm fig 3 as listed in table 1 both the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts had significantly lower bulk density 14 and 20 but higher saturated water content 13 and 26 and field capacity 8 and 22 as compared with the bare sand top 2 cm respectively the biocrusts generated slightly higher water repellency index of 4 5 in comparison to 2 of the bare sand additionally in comparison to the bare sand the om content was by 10 3 and 2 4 fold higher in the moss and cyanobacteria biocrusts respectively 3 2 biocrust effects on soil water infiltration under ponding condition the infiltration fig 4 a and cumulative infiltration fig 4b curves of the bare sand and moss biocrusts were the highest and lowest respectively while that of the cyanobacteria biocrusts exhibited intermediate values the initial infiltration rates of the three treatments were similar table 2 but the constant infiltration rates of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were significantly lower by 29 and 52 respectively f 92 0 p 0 001 than that of the bare sand moreover the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts took longer time by 41 and 105 respectively f 93 0 p 0 001 and water by 14 and 73 respectively f 68 8 p 0 001 to reach a steady state infiltration as compared with the bare sand the cyanobacteria biocrusts took additionally 5 7 min and 10 0 mm of water to reach steady state infiltration while the moss biocrusts took additionally 8 7 min and 54 2 mm of water to reach a steady state infiltration table 2 by generating decreasing effects on the infiltration rate and increasing effects on the time to steady state infiltration biocrusts reduced the amount of water that infiltrated within 30 min 17 for cyanobacteria and 27 for mosses respectively f 20 6 p 0 001 3 3 biocrust effects on soil water infiltration under tension condition the infiltration and cumulative infiltration curves of the bare sand and the moss biocrusts under tension condition exhibited the highest and lowest values respectively while that of the cyanobacteria biocrusts exhibited intermediate values fig 5 the constant infiltration rates of the three treatments under tension conditions were obtained as the slope of the cumulative infiltration curves omitting the initial 1 2 min infiltration data fig 6 a while the sorptivity was obtained as the intercept of the fitted line between the cumulative infiltration increment and time increment fig 6b the constant infiltration rates of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were significantly lower than that of the bare sand by 66 and 34 respectively f 169 3 p 0 001 and the moss biocrusts had significantly lower sorptivity as compared with the cyanobacteria biocrusts and the bare sand by 57 and 60 respectively f 125 7 p 0 001 from the constant infiltration rates the sorptivity and the initial and final soil water contents the hydraulic parameters were obtained as listed in table 3 as shown in table 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were 39 and 65 lower f 169 3 p 0 001 than that of the bare sand respectively as far as the macroscopic capillary length is concerned table 3 it was smaller in biocrusts and may thus explain the lower infiltration rates on biocrusts under ponding the larger microscopic pore radius of the biocrusts table 3 may however attest to the fact that the microscopic grains may have not been closely adhered to each other hindering in turn sorptivity 3 4 correlations between infiltration parameters and soil properties the pearson s correlation coefficients listed in table 4 showed that the infiltration parameters obtained under ponding and tension conditions were closely r 0 874 p 0 242 correlated with the biocrust characteristics and soil properties particularly the constant infiltration rate and time to steady state infiltration under ponding condition as well as the saturated hydraulic conductivity under tension condition were significantly r 0 899 p 0 050 correlated with the biocrust characteristics particle size distribution bulk density water holding capacity water repellency index and om content moreover the constant infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity had negative correlations with biocrust thickness chlorophyll content percentage of clay and silt soil water holding capacity water repellency index and om content while having positive correlations with the percentage of sand and bulk density conversely the time to steady state infiltration had opposite correlations with the above mentioned biocrust characteristics and soil properties 4 discussion in our study the findings obtained by the double ring infiltrometer and disc infiltrometer showed consistent results under ponding or tension conditions infiltration rate was the highest and lowest for the bare sand and the moss dominated crust respectively with the cyanobacterial crust exhibiting intermediate values tables 2 3 and figs 4 5 yet soil infiltrability as measured with double ring infiltrometer under ponding condition table 2 was slightly higher than that measured by the disc infiltrometer under tension condition table 3 this can be explained by the unconfined three dimensional infiltration vertical and lateral flow under disc infiltrometer vandervaere et al 1997 while on the other hand owing to the parallel infiltration through the exterior ring only one dimensional vertical flow took place in the interior ring of the double ring infiltrometer our study showed that both infiltration devices exhibited similar results with the biocrusted surfaces yielding lower soil infiltration our results are in agreement with other reports on soil infiltration under ponding conditions mainly executed with double ring infiltrometers table 5 our results are also in agreement with other infiltration data using disc infiltrometers under tension conditions table 5 especially with those reported from the loess plateau of china yu et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 and the center of the iberian peninsula spain eldridge et al 2010 most findings reported a reduced infiltration over biocrusts under tension and ponding conditions this could not have been explained by soil water repellency nor by the higher content of om at the biocrusted surfaces table 1 impediment of infiltration under the biocrusted surfaces was in disagreement with the role attributed to om content by increasing aggregate stability it is generally accepted that om is beneficial for soil water infiltration chamizo et al 2012b chenu et al 2000 om is believed to increase soil porosity malam issa et al 2009 menon et al 2011 and to improve the physical structure of the soil felde et al 2018 zhang 2005 this was not the case during the current research which showed that biocrusted surfaces impeded soil water infiltration despite the fact that they had a higher om content although ranging between 2 and 5 the values of water repellency index ri in our study did not necessarily indicate crust hydrophobicity water repellency in general ri 1 is theoretically assumed to denote water repellency fischer et al 2010 hallett and young 1999 but field measurements do not always correspond with the theoretical values in agreement with hallett et al 2001 and lamparter et al 2006 low ri may not necessarily imply hydrophobicity and even pure sand which allows for immediate infiltration may has ri 1 as found in the negev felde et al 2018 and in the current research with ri 2 1 see table 1 the impediment of infiltration under ponding conditions may be therefore reasonably attributed to two factors increased fine content silt and clay and greater crust thickness in comparison to the large pores of sand as also indicated by the larger macroscopic capillary length see table 3 the presence of a fine enriched layer at the biocrusts is expected to decrease infiltrability and the thicker the fine enriched layer the higher the expected impediment soils with high content of fines for instance such as loessial soils exhibit substantially lower infiltrability than sandy soils hillel and tadmor 1962 the rich fine particles in biocrusts stems from dust capture reynolds et al 2001 as well as from bioweathering by the rich microbial communities of the biocrusts ortega morales et al 2016 souza egipsy et al 2004 nevertheless one may wonder if such differences in the fine content especially between the cyanobacterial crust and the sand may suffice to explain the large differences in infiltration suggesting that another factor may also be involved although not examined during the current research the involvement of extracellular polymeric substance eps cannot be ruled out with the ability of the eps to drastically increase their volume upon water absorption by up to 50 fold see chenu 1993 the cyanobacteria capability to excrete copious amounts of eps pereira et al 2009 raddadi et al 2018 and the fact that cyanobacteria also inhabit the moss dominated crust adessi et al 2018 rossi et al 2018 an efficient impediment of infiltration is expected this may also explain the fact that as far as the micropores are concerned the microscopic pore radius is larger for biocrusts table 3 this may be explained by the presence of eps that may not always facilitate direct adherence between the microscopic grains eps was found indeed to drastically impede water infiltration in water reservoirs once the bottom of the reservoirs was covered with biofilms katznelson 1989 they were also found to drastically reduce surface macropores verrecchia et al 1995 explaining water infiltration under tension unsaturated conditions presents a greater challenge similarly to ponding conditions both biocrusts exhibited impeded infiltration thus albeit the higher amounts of fines at the biocrusted surfaces they exhibited lower infiltration under tension conditions moreover contrary to expectation and although having higher amounts of fines which should have increased sorptivity philip 1957 they exhibited lower sorptivity the findings indicate that the biological components of the crusts may have an overwhelming effect on sorptivity and subsequently on water flow under tension conditions the issue is currently intensively investigated tension conditions may take place during the beginning of a rain event in the negev desert runoff was not generated on a dry soil even under medium and high intensity rains that otherwise may generate runoff for instance although runoff generation took place already at an intensity of 9 12 mm h 1 lasting for 1 2 min on a wet crust high intensities of 30 mm h 1 did not generate runoff on initially dry crusts kidron and yair 1997 this may also explain the similar results of the initial infiltration during the current work table 2 only following extended wetting which allowed imbibition of the filaments the fine minerals and presumably the eps pore clogging took place facilitating in turn runoff generation runoff will concentrate in turn in runon zones commonly small size close depression see kidron and aloni 2018 where infiltration under ponding conditions will take place similarly to the eps role in impeding infiltration under hortonian flow kidron et al 2003 eps excreted by the crusts may also assist together with the fine content in impeding infiltration under ponding conditions low amounts of eps may explain in turn lack of runoff generation from certain crusts kidron and b√ºdel 2014 kidron et al 2012 low amounts of eps may also explain the fact that 20 of the biocrusts reported in table 5 did not exhibit decreased infiltration this issue deserves further research however the current findings point to the important role played by the fines and crust thickness in the impediment of infiltration under ponding conditions our findings point also to the fact that the impediment of infiltration under tension conditions on the biocrusts develop already during unsaturated conditions this may enhance in turn the onset of runoff 5 summary and conclusions our results showed that the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts under unsaturated conditions had significantly lower constant infiltration rates 0 265 and 0 180 cm min 1 respectively as compared with the bare sand 0 372 cm min 1 biocrusts exhibited also significantly longer time 41 and 105 and required more water 14 and 73 in order to reach steady state infiltration in comparison to sand similarly the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were respectively 39 0 514 cm min 1 and 65 0 295 cm min 1 lower than that of the bare sand 0 839 cm min 1 under the current conditions water repellency could not have explained the infiltration rates while om was found to decrease rather than increase infiltration possibly attributed to pore clogging mainly by eps the reduced infiltrability of biocrusts was explained by the increase of soil fine particles and by the crust thickness and apparently also to the eps role in clogging the surface the findings point also to the fact that the impediment of infiltration under tension conditions on the biocrusts develop already during unsaturated conditions which may shorten the onset of runoff the findings should be considered for future analyses of hydropedological processes in arid and semiarid regions conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict

vanderlinden associate editor graphical abstract biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and hydropedological processes have attracted increasing attention in dryland ecosystems but are nevertheless subjected to great controversy according to some scholars infiltration was assumed to decrease due to repellency and to increase with the organic matter content due to its role in increasing aggregate stability and porosity these assumptions were checked in our study on the loess plateau of china by using double ring and disc infiltrometers the infiltration curves of cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts as well as on bare soil were continuously measured and the characteristics of water infiltration on biocrust covered soil and its correlations with soil properties were analyzed our results showed that the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts had significantly lower constant infiltration rates under ponding conditions 0 265 and 0 180 cm min 1 respectively as compared with the bare sand 0 372 cm min 1 and they took significantly more time 41 and 105 and water 14 and 73 to reach steady state infiltration similarly the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were 39 0 514 cm min 1 and 65 0 295 cm min 1 lower than that of the bare sand 0 839 cm min 1 respectively more importantly biocrust infiltrability was closely related with biocrust characteristics and soil properties especially particle size distribution and crust thickness contrary to some assumptions that attributed impeded infiltration to crust repellency and increased infiltration to the role played by om both variables could not have explained the current results under tension and ponding conditions cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were found to greatly reduce surface soil infiltrability and impede soil water infiltration these findings should be considered for future analyses of hydropedological processes in arid and semiarid regions keywords biological soil crust microbiotic crust soil infiltrability double ring infiltrometer disc infiltrometer loess plateau in china 1 introduction as a critical component in hydrologic processes soil water infiltration has been intensively investigated in various soils and climate regions at different scales it is particularly important in dryland ecosystems with limited precipitation such as the loess plateau of china due to its role in supporting the ecosystem s vegetation and biodiversity zhang et al 2016 although the rate of soil water infiltration is regulated by many factors it is basically determined by edaphic properties which generally depended on soil particle size distribution structure the continuity and stability of pores and soil suction and especially soil surface crusts angulo jaramillo et al 2016 in most arid and semi arid soils the physical structural or depositional soil crusts have been intensively investigated in the past decades the results showed that the formation of a physical crust can seal the surface and thus to decrease soil infiltrability nciizah and wakindiki 2015 similarly biocrusts also named biological soil crusts which are a combination of microorganisms residing within the top few millimeters centimeters of the soil in dryland ecosystems bowker et al 2018 may greatly affect infiltration however their effects on soil infiltrability and soil water infiltration are still controversial belnap 2006 biocrusts are highly specialized soil layers created by symbiotic photoautotrophic communities formed by cyanobacteria mosses lichens green algae fungi and bacteria and their closely bonding soil particles in the uppermost few centimeters of the soil surface belnap et al 2016 they are extensively developed and widely distributed in arid and semiarid regions and they have been regarded as an important component of land cover bowker et al 2018 it is widely accepted that biocrusts are ecosystem engineers and play an important role for numerous soil processes and functioning garibotti et al 2018 their rehabilitation is therefore important for combating land degradation and desertification rossi et al 2017 while their role in halting soil water erosion gao et al 2017 and wind erosion ma et al 2017 increasing soil carbon mu√±oz rojas et al 2018 and nitrogen heindel et al 2018 and promoting biodiversity castillo monroy et al 2011 were substantiated controversy still exists regarding their hydrological roles especially soil water infiltration chen et al 2018 wang et al 2017 currently contradicting results are reported from many parts of the world whereas some scholars report on the crust role in increasing infiltration jiang et al 2018 kidron et al 2012 other report on the crust role in impeding infiltration chen et al 2018 wang et al 2017 or alternatively not affecting infiltration kidron and b√ºdel 2014 williams et al 1999 these contradictory findings were attributed to soil texture and structure biocrust types and coverage climate disturbance history and spatial temporal scale belnap 2006 while impeded infiltration was explained by pore clogging due to exopolysaccharide excretion by cyanobacteria kidron et al 2003 malam issa et al 2009 it was also explained by water repellency keck et al 2016 on the other hand increased infiltration was explained by higher organic matter om which may enhance aggregate stability algayer et al 2014 and increased soil porosity menon et al 2011 the question remains whether infiltration will be determined by repellency rodriguez caballero et al 2013 om induced aggregate stability chamizo et al 2012b or by the crust properties kidron et al 2003 malam issa et al 2009 all of which may greatly change surface soil infiltrability and soil water infiltration process in dryland ecosystem hypothesizing that the presence of biocrusts would significantly impede soil water infiltration a series of infiltration measurements were conducted on cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts as well as on bare soil sand on the loess plateau of china using double ring infiltrometer and disc infiltrometer the infiltration curves were continuously measured from initial to steady state infiltration aiming to characterize soil water infiltration under ponding and tension conditions in the presence or absence of biocrusts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in a 6 9 km2 watershed named liudaogou 38 46 38 51 n 110 21 110 23 e 1081 1274 m above sea level see fig 1 a in the northern loess plateau of china long term mean precipitation is 409 mm with 80 occurring in summer and mean annual evaporation is 1337 mm xiao et al 2016 mean annual temperature is 8 4 c and mean monthly temperatures range from 9 7 c in winter dec feb to 23 7 c in summer jun aug xiao et al 2016 the watershed is hilly with numerous gullies reflecting the sparse vegetation frequent droughts and poor land use since the 1600s runoff events are common and as a result this region experiences the most serious soil erosion in the loess plateau serving therefore as the main source of coarse sediments for the yellow river in order to combat land degradation and desertification the grain for green program has been implemented in recent decades to recover vegetation during the program the agricultural activities have ceased over a large area and a large number of native shrubs have been artificially planted to conserve soil and water cao et al 2009 owing to the resultant surface stabilization biocrust establishment took place the biocrusts dominated by moss and cyanobacteria are extensively developed on fallow lands shrub lands and grass lands of the watershed with coverage of 30 on average and up to 70 80 in some areas xiao et al 2010 in the current study a representative area 0 5 km2 with sparse shrubland and well developed cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts was selected as the experimental area figs 1b 1c and 2a the soil on the experimental area was an aeolian sandy soil entisols in soil taxonomy of the united states department of agriculture and its texture was generally loamy sand classification system of the united states department of agriculture with 81 of sand 50 2000 Œºm 2 2 experimental design three treatments with four replicates were conducted in this study including i bare sand aeolian sand without biocrusts see fig 2 b which was located far away from shrubs and thus suffered serious wind erosion in winter ii cyanobacteria biocrusts biocrusts dominated by cyanobacteria see fig 2c which were located among sparse shrubs and are naturally developed on fixed aeolian sand and iii moss biocrusts biocrusts dominated by moss with 30 years age and 95 moss coverage see fig 2d which characterize fixed aeolian sand the moss biocrusts proliferate next to shrubs which provide them with stable surface conditions and partial shading according to the experimental design four infiltration plots 200 m2 in area see fig 1c with moss and cyanobacteria biocrusts as well as nearby bare sand were selected as replicates under similar conditions e g biocrust characteristics soil texture slope gradient and orientation coverage and type of shrubs 2 3 measurements of biocrust characteristics and soil properties at each infiltration plot the index of soil water repellency was measured in 10 replicates for each treatment by the molarity of ethanol droplet and mini disk infiltrometer alagna et al 2017 respectively moreover 100 cm2 of samples of biocrusts and topsoil were randomly taken from 10 sub sampling points using 10 10 2 cm petri dishes the samples were stored at 20 c and further processed in the laboratory to measure biocrust characteristics soil particle size distribution and om content during the sampling the petri dishes were pushed into the ground 2 cm depth thus containing the biocrusts and the underlying soil and then they were scooped out using a small shovel fig 2e additionally 5 cm of the top soil was sampled by a ring 5 cm in height and 100 cm3 in volume in 10 replicates to measure bulk density saturated water content and field capacity in laboratory the biocrust layer biological components and their closely attached soil particles see fig 2f for an example was carefully separated from the underling soil for each biocrust sample and its thickness was measured with a digital caliper the particle size distribution and om content of the biocrust layer were measured and compared to the bare soil the moss plants were separated from soil with water through a 2 mm screen and dried at 65 c for 24 h for the measurement of moss biomass the total chlorophyll content of the samples was determined through a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 5000 hach company in usa to evaluate the cryptogam biomass of the biocrusts the soil particle size distribution of the samples 20 g from biocrust layer or bare sand in petri dishes was determined through a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd in uk after being separated with sodium hexametaphosphate the soil om content was also measured using the dichromate redox titration method described by carter and gregorich 2006 additionally the bulk density saturated water content and field capacity of the samples taken by the ring were determined in accordance with carter and gregorich 2006 2 4 measurement of soil water infiltration under ponding condition at the four infiltration plots the infiltration measurements were conducted with a double ring infiltrometer for each treatment the double ring infiltrometer consisted of an external ring 50 cm in diameter 30 cm in height and an internal ring 20 cm in diameter 30 cm in height during the experiment the double ring infiltrometer was carefully pushed into the soil leaving a 5 cm rim above the surface afterwards the double ring infiltrometer was filled with deionized water and a constant water depth 1 5 cm was maintained by a mariotte bottle the mariotte bottle was weighted continuously by a balance with 1 g resolution and the weight was recorded every 10 s until a steady state infiltration was reached the mariotte bottle was re filled with water if necessary once the water weight remained almost constant for 5 intervals infiltration was considered to reach steady state infiltration additionally the water temperature was measured during the experiment to eliminate the effect of water temperature on soil water infiltration according to suwardji and eberbach 1998 the mean water temperature 22 2 c was used to convert the measured soil infiltration rate to standard soil infiltration rate at 10 c 1 i 60 Œ¥ w œÄ r 2 Œ¥ t 0 7 0 03 t where i is the

infiltration plots the infiltration measurement was conducted with a disc infiltrometer for each treatment the disc infiltrometer was 15 cm in diameter and its reservoir tower was 3 5 cm in diameter and 100 cm in height the tension of the disc infiltrometer was adjustable between 0 and 20 cm of water head and it was set to 1 0 cm in this study during the measurement 2 mm layer of fine sand 0 25 mm was placed within a circular area on the infiltration sites and the disc infiltrometer the disc infiltrometer was filled with water and installed on the fine sand the height of the water level in the reservoir tower was recorded every 5 s until reaching a steady state infiltration the reservoir tower was refilled with water if necessary eq 1 was used to convert the measured soil infiltration rate for mean water temperature 24 7 c to standard soil infiltration rate at 10 c moreover the surface 5 cm soil was collected by a ring 100 cm3 before and after each measurement and their water

Œª m 7 4 Œª c 2 6 data analysis the characteristics of soil water infiltration and soil infiltrability represented by constant infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity were analyzed based on the infiltration and cumulative infiltration curves under ponding and tension conditions respectively the differences between biocrusts and bare sand were analyzed to explore biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and these effects were explained by biocrust characteristics and soil properties through correlation analyses the experimental data were analyzed based on the descriptive statistics in ibm spss statistics 22 the final results of each treatment came from the mean values of replicates and expressed as the mean standard error the differences among the treatments were statistically evaluated at the 5 probability level by one way anova in sas 8 01 the representation and graphical fits of experimental data were obtained using originpro 9 2 3 results 3 1 characteristics of biocrusts and their effects on soil properties the cyanobacteria biocrusts were dominated by lyngbya allorgei and phormidium angustissimum while the moss biocrusts were dominated by bryum arcticum r brown b s g and didymodon vinealis brid zander the moss density and biomass were 55 9 gametophyte cm 2 and 153 0 g m 2 respectively in comparison with the cyanobacteria biocrusts the moss biocrusts was significantly thicker 135 and had significantly higher chlorophyll content 45 table 1 moreover the particle size distribution for both cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts has a high amount of silt 42 with sand being 55 while the amount of sand in the bare sand reached 92 more specifically the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts greatly increased by 14 and 50 respectively the percentage of soil particles between 0 01 and 0 05 mm correspondingly they greatly decreased by 46 and 50 respectively the percentage of soil particles between 0 2 and 0 5 mm fig 3 as listed in table 1 both the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts had significantly lower bulk density 14 and 20 but higher saturated water content 13 and 26 and field capacity 8 and 22 as compared with the bare sand top 2 cm respectively the biocrusts generated slightly higher water repellency index of 4 5 in comparison to 2 of the bare sand additionally in comparison to the bare sand the om content was by 10 3 and 2 4 fold higher in the moss and cyanobacteria biocrusts respectively 3 2 biocrust effects on soil water infiltration under ponding condition the infiltration fig 4 a and cumulative infiltration fig 4b curves of the bare sand and moss biocrusts were the highest and lowest respectively while that of the cyanobacteria biocrusts exhibited intermediate values the initial infiltration rates of the three treatments were similar table 2 but the constant infiltration rates of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were significantly lower by 29 and 52 respectively f 92 0 p 0 001 than that of the bare sand moreover the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts took longer time by 41 and 105 respectively f 93 0 p 0 001 and water by 14 and 73 respectively f 68 8 p 0 001 to reach a steady state infiltration as compared with the bare sand the cyanobacteria biocrusts took additionally 5 7 min and 10 0 mm of water to reach steady state infiltration while the moss biocrusts took additionally 8 7 min and 54 2 mm of water to reach a steady state infiltration table 2 by generating decreasing effects on the infiltration rate and increasing effects on the time to steady state infiltration biocrusts reduced the amount of water that infiltrated within 30 min 17 for cyanobacteria and 27 for mosses respectively f 20 6 p 0 001 3 3 biocrust effects on soil water infiltration under tension condition the infiltration and cumulative infiltration curves of the bare sand and the moss biocrusts under tension condition exhibited the highest and lowest values respectively while that of the cyanobacteria biocrusts exhibited intermediate values fig 5 the constant infiltration rates of the three treatments under tension conditions were obtained as the slope of the cumulative infiltration curves omitting the initial 1 2 min infiltration data fig 6 a while the sorptivity was obtained as the intercept of the fitted line between the cumulative infiltration increment and time increment fig 6b the constant infiltration rates of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were significantly lower than that of the bare sand by 66 and 34 respectively f 169 3 p 0 001 and the moss biocrusts had significantly lower sorptivity as compared with the cyanobacteria biocrusts and the bare sand by 57 and 60 respectively f 125 7 p 0 001 from the constant infiltration rates the sorptivity and the initial and final soil water contents the hydraulic parameters were obtained as listed in table 3 as shown in table 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were 39 and 65 lower f 169 3 p 0 001 than that of the bare sand respectively as far as the macroscopic capillary length is concerned table 3 it was smaller in biocrusts and may thus explain the lower infiltration rates on biocrusts under ponding the larger microscopic pore radius of the biocrusts table 3 may however attest to the fact that the microscopic grains may have not been closely adhered to each other hindering in turn sorptivity 3 4 correlations between infiltration parameters and soil properties the pearson s correlation coefficients listed in table 4 showed that the infiltration parameters obtained under ponding and tension conditions were closely r 0 874 p 0 242 correlated with the biocrust characteristics and soil properties particularly the constant infiltration rate and time to steady state infiltration under ponding condition as well as the saturated hydraulic conductivity under tension condition were significantly r 0 899 p 0 050 correlated with the biocrust characteristics particle size distribution bulk density water holding capacity water repellency index and om content moreover the constant infiltration rate and saturated hydraulic conductivity had negative correlations with biocrust thickness chlorophyll content percentage of clay and silt soil water holding capacity water repellency index and om content while having positive correlations with the percentage of sand and bulk density conversely the time to steady state infiltration had opposite correlations with the above mentioned biocrust characteristics and soil properties 4 discussion in our study the findings obtained by the double ring infiltrometer and disc infiltrometer showed consistent results under ponding or tension conditions infiltration rate was the highest and lowest for the bare sand and the moss dominated crust respectively with the cyanobacterial crust exhibiting intermediate values tables 2 3 and figs 4 5 yet soil infiltrability as measured with double ring infiltrometer under ponding condition table 2 was slightly higher than that measured by the disc infiltrometer under tension condition table 3 this can be explained by the unconfined three dimensional infiltration vertical and lateral flow under disc infiltrometer vandervaere et al 1997 while on the other hand owing to the parallel infiltration through the exterior ring only one dimensional vertical flow took place in the interior ring of the double ring infiltrometer our study showed that both infiltration devices exhibited similar results with the biocrusted surfaces yielding lower soil infiltration our results are in agreement with other reports on soil infiltration under ponding conditions mainly executed with double ring infiltrometers table 5 our results are also in agreement with other infiltration data using disc infiltrometers under tension conditions table 5 especially with those reported from the loess plateau of china yu et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 and the center of the iberian peninsula spain eldridge et al 2010 most findings reported a reduced infiltration over biocrusts under tension and ponding conditions this could not have been explained by soil water repellency nor by the higher content of om at the biocrusted surfaces table 1 impediment of infiltration under the biocrusted surfaces was in disagreement with the role attributed to om content by increasing aggregate stability it is generally accepted that om is beneficial for soil water infiltration chamizo et al 2012b chenu et al 2000 om is believed to increase soil porosity malam issa et al 2009 menon et al 2011 and to improve the physical structure of the soil felde et al 2018 zhang 2005 this was not the case during the current research which showed that biocrusted surfaces impeded soil water infiltration despite the fact that they had a higher om content although ranging between 2 and 5 the values of water repellency index ri in our study did not necessarily indicate crust hydrophobicity water repellency in general ri 1 is theoretically assumed to denote water repellency fischer et al 2010 hallett and young 1999 but field measurements do not always correspond with the theoretical values in agreement with hallett et al 2001 and lamparter et al 2006 low ri may not necessarily imply hydrophobicity and even pure sand which allows for immediate infiltration may has ri 1 as found in the negev felde et al 2018 and in the current research with ri 2 1 see table 1 the impediment of infiltration under ponding conditions may be therefore reasonably attributed to two factors increased fine content silt and clay and greater crust thickness in comparison to the large pores of sand as also indicated by the larger macroscopic capillary length see table 3 the presence of a fine enriched layer at the biocrusts is expected to decrease infiltrability and the thicker the fine enriched layer the higher the expected impediment soils with high content of fines for instance such as loessial soils exhibit substantially lower infiltrability than sandy soils hillel and tadmor 1962 the rich fine particles in biocrusts stems from dust capture reynolds et al 2001 as well as from bioweathering by the rich microbial communities of the biocrusts ortega morales et al 2016 souza egipsy et al 2004 nevertheless one may wonder if such differences in the fine content especially between the cyanobacterial crust and the sand may suffice to explain the large differences in infiltration suggesting that another factor may also be involved although not examined during the current research the involvement of extracellular polymeric substance eps cannot be ruled out with the ability of the eps to drastically increase their volume upon water absorption by up to 50 fold see chenu 1993 the cyanobacteria capability to excrete copious amounts of eps pereira et al 2009 raddadi et al 2018 and the fact that cyanobacteria also inhabit the moss dominated crust adessi et al 2018 rossi et al 2018 an efficient impediment of infiltration is expected this may also explain the fact that as far as the micropores are concerned the microscopic pore radius is larger for biocrusts table 3 this may be explained by the presence of eps that may not always facilitate direct adherence between the microscopic grains eps was found indeed to drastically impede water infiltration in water reservoirs once the bottom of the reservoirs was covered with biofilms katznelson 1989 they were also found to drastically reduce surface macropores verrecchia et al 1995 explaining water infiltration under tension unsaturated conditions presents a greater challenge similarly to ponding conditions both biocrusts exhibited impeded infiltration thus albeit the higher amounts of fines at the biocrusted surfaces they exhibited lower infiltration under tension conditions moreover contrary to expectation and although having higher amounts of fines which should have increased sorptivity philip 1957 they exhibited lower sorptivity the findings indicate that the biological components of the crusts may have an overwhelming effect on sorptivity and subsequently on water flow under tension conditions the issue is currently intensively investigated tension conditions may take place during the beginning of a rain event in the negev desert runoff was not generated on a dry soil even under medium and high intensity rains that otherwise may generate runoff for instance although runoff generation took place already at an intensity of 9 12 mm h 1 lasting for 1 2 min on a wet crust high intensities of 30 mm h 1 did not generate runoff on initially dry crusts kidron and yair 1997 this may also explain the similar results of the initial infiltration during the current work table 2 only following extended wetting which allowed imbibition of the filaments the fine minerals and presumably the eps pore clogging took place facilitating in turn runoff generation runoff will concentrate in turn in runon zones commonly small size close depression see kidron and aloni 2018 where infiltration under ponding conditions will take place similarly to the eps role in impeding infiltration under hortonian flow kidron et al 2003 eps excreted by the crusts may also assist together with the fine content in impeding infiltration under ponding conditions low amounts of eps may explain in turn lack of runoff generation from certain crusts kidron and b√ºdel 2014 kidron et al 2012 low amounts of eps may also explain the fact that 20 of the biocrusts reported in table 5 did not exhibit decreased infiltration this issue deserves further research however the current findings point to the important role played by the fines and crust thickness in the impediment of infiltration under ponding conditions our findings point also to the fact that the impediment of infiltration under tension conditions on the biocrusts develop already during unsaturated conditions this may enhance in turn the onset of runoff 5 summary and conclusions our results showed that the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts under unsaturated conditions had significantly lower constant infiltration rates 0 265 and 0 180 cm min 1 respectively as compared with the bare sand 0 372 cm min 1 biocrusts exhibited also significantly longer time 41 and 105 and required more water 14 and 73 in order to reach steady state infiltration in comparison to sand similarly the saturated hydraulic conductivities of the cyanobacteria and moss biocrusts were respectively 39 0 514 cm min 1 and 65 0 295 cm min 1 lower than that of the bare sand 0 839 cm min 1 under the current conditions water repellency could not have explained the infiltration rates while om was found to decrease rather than increase infiltration possibly attributed to pore clogging mainly by eps the reduced infiltrability of biocrusts was explained by the increase of soil fine particles and by the crust thickness and apparently also to the eps role in clogging the surface the findings point also to the fact that the impediment of infiltration under tension conditions on the biocrusts develop already during unsaturated conditions which may shorten the onset of runoff the findings should be considered for future analyses of hydropedological processes in arid and semiarid regions conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict
