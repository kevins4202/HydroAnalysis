8255,study region sixty four river gauging stations distributed over sweden study focus to investigate the influence of climate teleconnection patterns tp on streamflow in sweden streamflow data is regionalized and the average hydrographs of each homogeneous region is divided into hydrological seasons thereafter the impact of different tps on the streamflow per homogeneous region and per hydrological season is analyzed new hydrological insights for the region five homogeneous regions are identified three located in the north where snow dominates the hydrological processes and two located in the south where rain dominates hydrological processes the northern hydrographs are separated into three hydrological periods low streamflow when snow is accumulated high streamflow during the melting of the snowpack and a transition period in between the southern hydrographs are characterized by streamflow above the yearly average during the winter and below during the summer hydrological periods in different homogeneous regions are influenced by diverse combinations of tps arctic oscillation north atlantic oscillation and scandinavian pattern influence the streamflow in most of the regions during most hydrological periods the further south and east the region is located the more tps influence the streamflow the resulting streamflow variability is related to the interplay between different tps both before and during each hydrological period this interplay may enhance or decrease the individual influence of each tp on streamflow keywords climate variability teleconnections patterns hydrological variability streamflow climate wavelet analysis 1 introduction the northern hemisphere climate circulation patterns and their interactions have a profound effect on the seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation patterns over sweden by altering the transport of moist air masses over scandinavia e g barnston and livezey 1987 comas bru and mcdermott 2014 hurrell et al 2003 rogers 1997 this will in turn strongly influence also scandinavia s hydrological processes in general and streamflow in particular sweden is characterized by a heterogeneous hydrological regime with streamflow being dominated by snow processes in the northern two thirds of the country and by a mixture of rain and snow processes in the southern third krasovskaia and gottschalk 1992 melin 1970 peel et al 2007 in the snow dominated catchments peak flows coincide with the snow melt in the spring while in the rain dominated catchments peak flows are associated with precipitation events and are more common in the cooler months from autumn to early spring teleconnection patterns tps are a natural part of the chaotic movement of the atmosphere they can be described as persistent and recurring patterns of circulation or air pressure anomalies that affect the climate over a large geographical area by influencing the intensity and location of the jet stream and storm tracks and in turn temperature and precipitation consequently tps have a significant positive or negative correlation with the variability of a hydro meteorological variable in a geographically separated region panagiotopoulos et al 2002 this work concerns the northern hemisphere teleconnection patterns defined by barnston and livezey 1987 governing the long term 1 month variability of streamflow in many rivers in sweden although the connection between climate and streamflow is not new to researchers it has traditionally been investigated at the local or river basin scale the influence of remote drivers was generally not contemplated until the early 21st century when enfield et al 2001 and barlow et al 2001 related the climate variability to streamflows in the us the relation between climate variability and rivers have since then been studied worldwide e g barros et al 2004 for the paraguay river basin and bonsal and shabbar 2008 in canada for europe kingston et al 2006a b 2009 showed how the icelandic low the azores high and the difference between their pressure intensity hence the north atlantic oscillation nao and artic oscillation ao are connected to streamflow around north atlantic ocean their studies are clear in demonstrating that the higher the difference between the pressure fields the higher the streamflows in northern europe trigo et al 2004 also focus on the influence of nao but on water resources in the iberian peninsula showing that negative nao was connected to the increase in water resources in that region giuntoli et al 2013 showed that low flows in france were connected to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo as well as to nao bierkens and van beek 2009 used nao as model input to predict winter discharge in major rivers in europe ionita et al 2012 2014 2015 and ionita 2014 2015 showed that river discharge in europe is impacted by further tps than nao and ao depending on the region and season for scandinavia despite the effects of climate variables on temperature and precipitation being well understood the links between large scale climate patterns land surface and hydrologic variability are not as well understood kingston et al 2009 changes in precipitation and temperature at the seasonal scale over sweden have been showed to be connected to the low frequency variations in the northern hemisphere teleconnection patterns e g wallace and gutzler 1981 barnston and livezey 1987 hurrell 1995 uvo 2003 and these changes affect the nested cascade of processes that link the atmospheric and hydrological processes kingston et al 2009 even though most of the swedish rivers are regulated to some extent the spatial and temporal variability of streamflow has noticeable societal impacts nearly half of sweden s electricity comes from hydropower scb 2014 but the uneven distribution of streamflow over the year as well as its interannual variability requires a skilful water management to control electricity production most of the hydropower plants in sweden are located in the northern part of the country here during the cold and dark winter months when the electricity demand is highest the streamflow is at its lowest because precipitation is stored in the form of snow conversely during the warmer months when demand is typically lowest the streamflow is at highest due to the melting season that typically occurs in early summer months and somewhat high due to autumn rains consequently water needs to be stored over the summer and autumn months to allow operators to meet demand during the winter implying that timely and reliable forecasts of streamflow are invaluable to water resource managers as climate is a large source of hydrological variability busuioc et al 2001 krasovskaia et al 1994 the aim of this work is to identify and understand the climatic drivers behind the seasonal and interannual variability in swedish streamflow in light of the complex and diverse hydrological regimes found in sweden as outlined above our hypothesis is that different tps govern the hydrology in different parts of the country as well as during different parts of the year this is a first attempt to systematically investigating these connections which are highly relevant both for understanding the impacts of natural climate variability but also for assessing climate change ones to distinguish between the different hydrological processes rivers in sweden are initially divided into homogeneous hydrological regions which are used to identify and characterize the connections between time series of streamflow and teleconnection pattern indices after establishing links to the most relevant tps a characterization of the underlying relationships is attempted by using wavelet analysis 2 data analyses were performed using time series of streamflow and of teleconnection pattern indices as described below 2 1 streamflow observed daily streamflow data used in this study were collected from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi database homogenization and quality control of the data was performed by smhi before being made available in the public database available online at http vattenwebb smhi se station gauging stations were selected following the four criteria below degree of regulation stations with the least regulation were preferred to ensure that the streamflow was as near to natural as possible length of time series stations with longer time series were preferred to allow for more robust analyses number of missing data stations with fewer missing data were preferred to minimize data filling effects influencing the study results geographic location stations were selected to maximize the geographical coverage of sweden sixty four unregulated or low regulated gauging stations with daily streamflow data from january 1960 to december 2010 were selected their distribution over the swedish territory is shown in fig 1 eleven time series had missing data a total of 4836 days or 2 4 a multiple linear regression of surrounding station data was used to infill those missing data daily streamflow data were averaged into monthly values the nash sutcliffe efficiency values between the regressed time series and the target series ranged between 0 69 and 0 98 when the data is aggregated to monthly data all series were standardized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation prior of their use the standardization allows the statistical comparison among series with large differences in absolute values the standardized series were used in the clustering process and for calculating regional composite series as described in section 3 1 2 2 teleconnection patterns tps monthly indices of selected tps were collected from the climate prediction center cpc available online at http www cpc ncep noaa gov data teledoc telecontents shtml for the period january 1958 to december 2010 the tps used for analysis in this work are summarized in table 1 and their known effects on temperature and precipitation in sweden are briefly described other tested tps among them el niño southern oscillation and pacific decadal oscillation that generated inconclusive results either due to insignificant correlations or because the available data period is too short for a robust physical analysis were omitted from further analysis prior of use hydrological data was detrended and then standardized by month to remove the influences of climate change dimensionality and seasonality it has been previously shown that runoff and teleconnection data can be autocorrelated and this can lead to overestimation of statistical significances in the case of series with considerable autocorrelation and thus they should be interpreted with care e g ptak et al 2018 yue et al 2002 by breaking the data up into seasons and performing the analyses on each season independently reduces any influence autocorrelation might have on the results checks on these discharge data for the different hydrological periods showed that there are no significant autocorrelations ea and pdo are found to have low but significant and considerable autocorrelations respectively the autocorrelations in the pdo data are not unexpected due to the robust nature of that teleconnection pattern 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological characterization to identify regions of homogeneous temporal hydrological variability a cluster analysis was applied to the collection of 64 series of monthly averaged streamflow time series q m where m denotes month 1 m 612 clustering is used for grouping variables into subsets that are linearly related to each other conventionally illustrated by tree like hierarchical diagrams dendrograms that show relations among all variables in a given set krumbein and graybill 1965 the correlation matrix is used as a basis for assessing the strength of the relationships occurring among the variables one pair or more pairs of attributes are selected as highly connected and connections between these pairs and the remaining variables are calculated to develop a hierarchy of interrelations showing the degree of connection within the dataset the hierarchical cluster algorithm chosen for this work was ward ward 1963 due to its simplicity and broad practice prior to applying the cluster analysis the monthly streamflow data was filtered for noise by means of principal component analysis pca so that 90 of the original streamflow variance was kept eliminating 10 of the variance that is expected to be related to noise in the data the use of filtered data as input for the cluster analyses as was done here is common practice and convenient e g uvo and berndtsson 1996 to avoid connections being established based on noise in the data the resulting clusters were validated by means of three different methodologies a correlating the individual records with the cluster mean and in this way ascertaining that all members in the cluster are well related to the cluster mean b by physical understanding of the geographical location of the clusters and c by using silhouettes silhouettes are a graphical aid based on the comparison of the dissimilarity of the members of each cluster and the mean silhouette width gives a measure for the clustering solution s validity forgy 1965 rousseeuw 1987 to represent the streamflow in each cluster a composite monthly streamflow time series was created as the average of the time series from all stations composing the cluster the composite series is denoted q c m where c stands for cluster the benefit with using a composite is that it acts as a generalized time series for the entire cluster and thus is not biased toward any individual time series to define hydrological periods both the station time series q m and the cluster composite time series q c m were averaged into monthly mean annual hydrographs denoted q 1 12 and q c 1 12 respectively where 1 12 stands for calendar month the definition of different hydrological periods for each cluster was made predominantly based on visual inspection of the mean annual hydrographs from individual cluster members q 1 12 superimposed over the cluster mean annual hydrograph q c 1 12 periods of similar hydrological activity or state hereafter referred to as hydrological periods were defined by visual inspection of the hydrograph considering the intensity of the monthly flow five periods were defined accumulation period spring flow period post flood period high flow period and low flow period the detailed description of the characteristics of these periods may be found in section 4 2 for analyzing the links to tps the composite streamflow series q c m were annually averaged over the hydrological periods into q h p c y where hp denotes hydrological period and y denotes year 1 y 51 fig 2 exemplifies how the hydrological seasons were determined for a cluster which is characterized by a snow dominated hydrology the elevated hydrograph flows in august that may be seen in fig 4 are mainly due to three sub basins that due to their geographical position present a delayed signal from the others in this case we chose to not consider august as part of the spring flow period to minimize the risk of outliers from having a too strong influence in the analysis as a result the accumulation period is defined as november to april spring flow period as may to july and post flow period as august to october 3 1 1 definition of hydrological periods based on the monthly composite hydrographs of each cluster five hydrological periods were defined 3 1 1 1 accumulation period period during which precipitation is accumulated in the basin in the form of snow and the streamflow is below the annual mean streamflow during this period is almost entirely due to base flow which is the result of the meteorological conditions during the antecedent months the accumulation period starts with a sharp decline in streamflow typically through november and december due to the little contribution from precipitation to the flow as the majority of it is intercepted and stored in the catchment in the form of a snowpack the flow declines until it is in equilibrium with the base flow after reaching this equilibrium there is a slow but steady decline in streamflow until the onset of the spring flood due to the base flow storages being depleted over time 3 1 1 2 spring flow period the month s after winter when the streamflow is significantly elevated compared to the rest of the year the positive temperature in spring results in a relative rapid snowpack ablation moreover the occurrence of rain on snow might accelerate the ablation process snow melt is the majority contributor to streamflow during the spring flow period followed by the leading minority contributors precipitation and base flow however towards the end of the period the snowpack becomes depleted and rain events become the dominant contributor to streamflow it is not uncommon to have some snow still on the ground in some areas at the end of the spring flow period due to the size of the initial snowpack elevation and or favorable meteorological conditions 3 1 1 3 post flood period the months between the spring flow period and the accumulation period in the snow dominated clusters when there is a steady decline in streamflow from the elevated levels during the spring flow period the typically high streamflow of the spring flow period is receding and the majority contributors to streamflow during the post flood period are precipitation events base flow and glacial ablation where glaciers exist it is a combination of this glacial ablation melt water from higher elevations and base flow that accounts for the extended tail of the spring flow period recession towards the end of the post flood period when the temperature approaches freezing there is a general decrease in both temperature and precipitation this means that although there is a steady drop in streamflow there is also a drop in evapotranspiration rates that leads to a net increase in groundwater and lake levels 3 1 1 4 high flow period the period with above average streamflow over the winter months in the rain dominated clusters that typically starts in november and ends in march or april although precipitation might be in the form of snow during the high flow period there is a higher likelihood that most of this snow will be lost during the high flow period due to thaw and rain on snow processes during the high flow period the evapotranspiration rates are depressed due to the average daily temperature being around zero and there is a relatively high amount of precipitation this results in higher soil moisture and lake levels that in turn coupled with the precipitation results in increased runoff 3 1 1 5 low flow period the period with below average streamflow over the summer months in the r clusters that typically starts in may or june and ends in october although there is a small increase in the amount of precipitation throughout the low flow period the evapotranspiration rates are elevated due to the higher average daily temperature which cause the streamflow to drop below the annual means the majority contributors to streamflow are precipitation events and base flow 3 2 climatological characterization 3 2 1 definition of teleconnection periods each series of monthly tp indices tpi m was averaged over time windows that were connected to the defined hydrological periods considering different lead times and windows lengths fig 3 the time windows were either concurrent with the hydrological periods which are listed above and detailed described in section 4 2 or had a lead time to them for clarification fig 3 shows the example of a 4 month tp window with a 1 month lead time to the hydrological period aug oct for each cluster and hydrological period an ensemble of 145 tp windows were defined one tp window was defined as concurrent with the hydrological period and its corresponding average indices denoted t p i h p c y the other 144 tp windows were a combination of different lead times lt 0 lt 11 months to the hydrological period and window lengths wl 1 wl 12 months the resulting average tp indices may be denoted t p i h p c y l t w l where lt is taken relative to the start of hydrological period hp for cluster c in the following for simplification the expression t p i t w c y is used to denote the averaged tp indices over a certain time window tw which is related to a specific hydrological period in cluster c see fig 3 t p i t w c y thus includes the averaged tp indices both in the concurrent hydrological period t p i h p c y and prior to the hydrological period t p i h p c y l t w l 3 3 linking hydrological regions and teleconnection patterns pca was used to determine connections between tps and streamflow for every hydrological period and hydrological cluster for each cluster and hydrological period a pca was applied to the data matrix composed by the time series of the streamflow composite q h p c y and the time series of the accompanying averaged tp indices t p i t w c y a biplot of the first two pca modes was used to identify within all tps and time windows the ones that were most strongly related to the streamflow composite of each cluster and hydrological period in total 200 matrices were generated considering the five clusters five hydrological seasons and all climate indices considered initially by this study generating 200 biplots that were analyzed some examples of such biplots may be found in the supplementary material fig s1 in the supplementary material the accumulated explained variance of the first two modes ranged from 67 to near 100 with an average of 84 the spearman correlation coefficient was calculated between q h p c y and the tp time series t p i t w c y that were selected from the pca biplot analysis tp time windows for which correlation coefficients were not significant at the 0 01 level were disregarded from further analysis further connections identified by significant correlations but without any discernible physical explanation i e meteorological mechanism able to transfer the information from the teleconnection pattern to the local hydrology were also discarded 3 3 1 temporal variability of the climate hydrology connections the temporal variability of the hydrological and climatological series was analyzed by means of continuous wavelet transform cwt the so called wavelet power spectrum cwts were calculated for each streamflow composite time series q h p c y and the corresponding tps and time windows t p i t w c y that were found connected the wavelet analysis first introduced by morlet et al 1982a morlet et al 1982b and grossmann and morlet 1984 decomposes a time series into scale components allowing distinction between the oscillations that occur at different time scales the wavelet analysis keeps information about the occurrence of non stationary events in both time and frequency domains highlighting localized intermittent periodicities grinsted et al 2004 the morlet ψ 0 wavelet was used in this study since it is efficient in extracting features maintaining a good balance between frequency and time information torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 to determine the connections between the temporal variability of the composite streamflow series q h p c y and the associated tp averages t p i t w c y cross wavelet transforms xwt were calculated grinsted et al 2004 the xwt shows periodicities and time intervals in which the individual cwts have common high power and a common local phase to avoid the pitfalls of xwt analysis identified by mauran and kurths 2004 the wavelet transform coherence wtc was used it is a measure of the coherence between the signals from the individual cwt developed by grinsted et al 2004 and can be thought of as the local correlation between the wavelet transform of each time series used in the xwt the interpretation of the wtc as local correlation was explored in this work as a mean to identify different scales and time periods when composite streamflow time series and the associated tp averages were locally correlated this is an attempt to overcome the non linearity of the impact on streamflow that results from the interactions among different tps tps may enhance or diminish each other s impact on streamflow depending on their state at the specific moment this characteristic generates non linearity in the signal that are not captured by simple correlation analysis between the discharge indices and one of the tps the xwt and wtc were calculated and displayed using the cross wavelet and wavelet coherence toolbox for matlab provided by a grinsted http www glaciology net wavelet coherence the wavelet spectrum was calculated and displayed using the wavelet software provided by c torrence and g compo http atoc colorado edu research wavelets 4 results and discussion fig 4 is a compilation of the main results achieved by this work it displays the location of the stations that compose the different clusters of homogeneous hydrological variability the standardized composite hydrograph for each cluster the identified hydrological periods and the tps that have a statistically significant p 0 01 correlation with the streamflow variability of each cluster each cluster occupies a mutually exclusive and distinct geographical region however due to the limited number of stations it is not possible to exclude the possibility of intrusions along the boundaries between the clusters 4 1 hydrological clusters and their characteristics the hierarchical clustering of the 64 monthly streamflow time series resulted in the five unique clusters represented by different symbols in fig 4 the robustness of this result is supported by the average silhouette width for the clusters being 0 52 indicating that a reasonable structure was found struyf et al 1997 and by the time series of the individual cluster members showing high correlations 0 79 0 025 p 0 01 with their cluster mean time series three clusters are located in the snow dominated northern part of sweden these clusters are named s1 s2 and s3 where s refers to snow dominate and the numbers 1 2 and 3 representing the relative intensity of this hydrological characteristic from least to most intense the stations that constitute the s3 cluster circles in fig 4 are located in the mountainous highlands and forested inland plains in the northern third of the country this is the only cluster that does not include any stations near the coast the s2 cluster stars in fig 4 is split into two separate regions one in the mountainous highlands in central sweden south of cluster s3 and one along the finnish border from the inland plateau in the north down to the coast this spatially discontinuous cluster is in agreement with clusters found in uvo 2003 when examining the variability in precipitation over northern europe the stations in cluster s1 diamonds in fig 4 are mostly located along the northern coastline and inland plains at its southernmost part the stations in s1 also extend up into the mountainous highlands south of s2 in common the annual hydrographs of the s clusters present a well defined melting season characterized by peak flows more detailed descriptions of the hydrographs are presented in section 4 2 two clusters are located in the rain dominated southern part of sweden r1 and r2 in this case r refers to rain dominated and the numbers for the intensity of this characteristic r1 plusses fig 4 extends from low lying areas north of stockholm down to the south eastern coast into the southern highlands and up to the norwegian border the stations in cluster r2 squares fig 4 are located in a band that extends along the western and southern coastlines and a short way up the eastern coast although r1 falls under the rain dominated category its composite hydrograph displays a snow process related signal in the form of a distinct snow melt period in april and may the hydrograph for the cluster r2 displays only a minor snow process related signal with a weak signal of snow melt in april fig 4 the relatively mild winter temperature around 0 c typical of these regions results in several snow melt events as well as rain on snow events that most often result in the snow melting during the winter and consequently only limited periods with snow accumulation on the ground typically from a few days to some weeks as expressed by the normal number of days with snow cover below 75 days average 1961 1990 presented by smhi 2019a some statistics such as number of gauging stations per cluster elevation of the gauging stations the upstream catchment area and the percentage of this area covered by water bodies are summarized in table 2 previous cluster analyses of river streamflow in sweden were made by gottschalk 1985 and for the southern part of sweden by kingston et al 2011 the choice to remake the analysis in this work is based on the fact that the data set used here spans a longer period of time that includes different climatic characteristics as compared to the dataset used by gottschalk 1985 the current dataset 1960 2010 includes the climate shift observed during the 1970 s baines and folland 2007 which is characterized by an important and simultaneous change of phase in several tps among others the climate shift separates a period of predominantly very negative values of nao during the 60 s and 70 s from the predominantly very positive nao period that was most intense during the 1990 s hurrell 2017 moreover a different clustering methodology was used in this study instead of analyzing all catchments at once gottschalk 1985 analyzed streamflows in small and large catchments separately and used correlation coefficient and p space euclidian distance without data pre filtering while kingston et al 2011 used a similar method as the one used here their study area included only a few swedish stations located exclusively in southern sweden gottschalk 1985 identified seven clusters for small basins and three for large ones within sweden the five clusters identified here are an intermediary solution coherent with his results additionally these results are also coherent with the northern north atlantic hydrological regions identified by kingston et al 2011 they found that sweden s hydrology was coarsely divided into two groups one group in the southern third and another in the north 4 2 hydrological periods the annual streamflow in the snow dominated clusters is characterized by three distinct hydrological periods the accumulation period during winter months spring flow period at melting season and the post flood period through november and december as seen in the s1 s2 and s3 hydrographs in fig 4 accumulation period exists only in the snow dominated clusters and is defined as november to march in clusters s1 and s2 and november to april in cluster s3 the start of the spring flow period in the snow dominated clusters ranges from mid to late april for s1 and early to mid may for s3 s1 which is the closest cluster to the coast and lowest in both elevation and latitude shows the earliest start fig 4 s hydrographs the northern clusters s3 and s2 have a longer time from the start of the spring flow period to the spring flow peak if compared to the s1 due to their geographic locations basically spring temperature take longer time to rise in those latitudes cluster s1 has the most distinct spring flow peak that approaches 2 5 standard deviations of the annual mean flow fig 4 s1 hydrograph as its catchments have smaller snowpacks and a more rapid rise in daily temperatures in spring smhi 2019b cluster r1 has a shorter spring flow period figs 4 r1 and r2 hydrographs as compared to the s clusters the lack of spring flow period in r2 is related to the small and intermittent presence of snow in the catchments so that no snowpack is formed during winter the higher elevations and latitudes of the catchments in r1 result in the generation of a more substantial snowpack and a later timing of the spring flow period typically during april and early may the post flood period begins in july for s1 and in august for s3 and s2 the slow fall in the average daily temperature as the summer turns into autumn and a slight increase in precipitation during the autumn months mostly in s2 results in a slow down stabilization and rise in streamflow in the s clusters the hydrographs of the rain dominated clusters are characterized by only two distinct periods the high flow period with above annual average flows in winter and the low flow period during the warm months characterized by below annual average flows see the r1 and r2 hydrographs in fig 4 this binary hydrograph is due to the mild temperatures in the southern parts of sweden during the winter period this results in the low characteristic evapotranspiration rates and an increased likelihood of liquid precipitation and freeze thaw events if compared to colder regions especially in catchments with low elevation and close proximity to the sea the high flow period starts in november for both r1 and r2 with an increase in streamflow through december followed by a drop in february and march due to decrease in precipitation similar to the pattern seen in the s clusters there is a delayed reaction in r1 streamflow due to its higher elevation and latitude and consequently lower temperature the low flow period starts in may in r2 and june in r1 with decreasing streamflow until august after which it increases again as the average daily temperature and evapotranspiration decreases in the following the five hydrological periods identified in the analysis of monthly composite hydrographs from each cluster are described and discussed 4 3 climate streamflow connections fig 5 presents the combinations of tps and associated time windows that are significantly correlated to each cluster and hydrological period the choice of tps and periods tested was made based on the biplots that resulted from the pca analysis examples on figure s1 applied on a matrix containing time series of tps and streamflow in different hydrological periods the presented selection is based on both correlations significant at 0 01 level and a clear physical explanation that supports the correlation in an attempt to simplify visualization fig 5 is divided in five panels corresponding to the five clusters in fig 4 the panels are positioned and named similarly to the clusters in fig 4 for example fig 5 s3 shows that for the s3 cluster located in north west sweden the streamflow during accumulation period is negatively correlated 0 44 to the sca index averaged over the same period and positively correlated to nao 0 42 and ao 0 59 with zero month lead time and a 2 month time window the information provided by the spearman rank correlation analysis is complemented by the wavelet analysis in order to highlight the temporal distribution of the relationship between the composite hydrographs q h p c y and the associated mean tp indices t p i t w c y along the time span of the data set the objective is to quantify the local correlation between streamflow and tp over time which reflects the degree of possibly nonlinear association between the inter annual variability of the streamflow and the tp respectively 4 3 1 snow dominated clusters 4 3 1 1 accumulation period fig 5 shows that s3 streamflow during accumulation period is negatively correlated with the average sca index over the same period concurrent and positively correlated with the average nao and ao indices for lead time lt zero and two months window length wl lt0 wl2 to the accumulation period hereafter the superscript sign following the tp acronym indicates the sign of the correlation the cwt of s3 accumulation period streamflow fig 6 highlights that its interannual variability has two preferred bands of oscillation 2 4 year and 8 16 year the 2 4 year oscillation was most active during the second half of the 1970 s and the first half of 2000 s and was particularly inactive during late 1980 s the 8 16 year oscillation was present during most of the study period even if it does not show as statistically significant at 95 on the wavelet spectrum diagram fig 6a the wtc of s3 accumulation period streamflow and different tps fig 7 a b and c clarifies that the 2 4 year oscillation is locally correlated in anti phase with the concurrent sca along the time span with the strongest intensity from mid 1980 s to mid 2000 s whereas the 8 16 year oscillation is locally correlated in phase to both nao lt0 wl2 fig 7a and ao lt0 wl2 fig 7b during the whole time span of the series the phase of the local correlation is in agreement with the impact of the climate mode represented by the index on the precipitation and temperature over scandinavia a high sca index is commonly associated with a decrease in precipitation and thus discharge over scandinavia which results show to be in anti phase with sca the opposite is true for nao which results show to be in phase with discharge this will be discussed further and in more detailed discussed later in this section it should be emphasized that the high powers showed by the cwt at 2 4 year periodicity fig 6a are connected to different tps during 1975 1980 s3 accumulation period streamflow is locally correlated to nao and ao on the other hand during 1995 2005 sca is the tp to which the streamflow is locally correlated for the s2 cluster the mean streamflow during the accumulation period is correlated with the average indices of nao sca and ao during the concomitant season and with the average indices of eawr and ao in the four and five months prior to the accumulation period respectively fig 5 s2 the cwt clarifies that interannual variability of the streamflow at s2 during accumulation period presents two preferred bands of oscillation the 2 4 year band was most active during late 1960 s and late 1990 s to mid 2000 s but also evident during late 1970 s and 1990 the 8 10 year band is clear throughout the whole data time span but most active during the 1990 s fig 6b the wtc of s2 accumulation period streamflow and tps fig 7d e f and g reveals that the 2 4 year oscillation is locally correlated in phase similarly with the average nao fig 7d and ao not shown concurrent to accumulation period before 1970 s between 1985 1990 and between 2000 2005 and with ao prior lt0 wl4 to accumulation period during the same years but not after 1995 fig 7g moreover it is locally correlated in anti phase with the concomitant sca before 1975 and after 2000 the oscillation on 8 10 year band is locally correlated with nao and ao in phase and sca anti phase at the concomitant period along the whole time span fig 7d and e as well as to eawr lt0 wl5 out of phase during 1975 1995 fig 7f noticeable for the accumulation period streamflow in s2 is that it clearly shows that the variability in streamflow may result from the interaction between different tps either during short time intervals as for the 2 4 year band oscillation or for long time spans as for the 8 16 year band the accumulation period streamflow in s1 is correlated with the average ea and eawr indices in the three and one months prior to the accumulation period respectively fig 5 the cwt shows that s1 accumulation period streamflow did not show any period of preferred oscillation statistical significant power is only present between 1990 and 2010 spanning from 2 to 10 year periodicity fig 6c such power showed on wtc to be locally correlated to ea lt0 wl3 in phase in the longer band of oscillation the negative spearman correlation found with eawr may be related to a local correlation in anti phase at periods 4 years before 1980 fig 7i 4 3 1 2 spring flow period the spring flow period streamflow in s3 and s2 are both correlated with the average nao sca and ao indices during the seven eight and seven months prior to the spring flow period respectively fig 5 s3 and s2 the long time window prior to the spring flow period clearly indicates the impact of the tps on the amount of snow that is stored in the basin during winter as the main contribution to the streamflow during spring flow period comes from snow melt the cwt of the streamflow in s3 during the spring flow period shows one centre of statistically significant power at about 2 year band of oscillation active during the 1990 s and one at the 4 8 year around mid 1970 s fig 6d the wtcs of the s3 spring flow period show that both centers of action are locally correlated in phase with nao lt0 wl7 and ao lt0 wl7 fig 7j and k in addition the activity centre at about 2 year periodicity is locally correlated in anti phase with sca lt0 wl8 fig 7l clearly the centre of high power at the 2 year band is a result from the interaction among several climate modes of variability tps ao nao and sca the wavelet spectrum for the s2 spring flow period streamflow presents different characteristics than the one for s3 spring flow period flows despite similar rank correlations with ao nao and sca it indicates that the 2 year oscillation is present during most of the study time however statistically significant only during the second part of the 1990 s fig 6e a centre of significant power at 8 year oscillation is present around early 1970 s the wtc charts show that the short period oscillation is locally correlated in phase with nao l0 p7 and in a similar way with ao lt0 wl7 fig 7m and n at the same time this oscillation is locally correlated in anti phase with sca lt0 wl8 fig 7o the 8 year oscillation is however locally correlated in phase mostly to nao lt0 wl7 the spring flow period in s1 is correlated to the mean nao and sca indices six and two months prior to the spring flow period respectively fig 5 s1 the cwt of the s1 average streamflow during spring flow period fig 6f shows a preferred oscillation of about 6 8 year periodicity that was distinctly active during the 1960 s and from the mid 1980 s to the early 2000 s the wtc clarifies that the active period in the 1960 s is locally correlated to nao lt0 wl6 in phase whereas the one from the mid 1980 s to the early 2000 s is locally correlated in phase with nao lt0 wl6 and in anti phase with sca lt0 wl2 fig 7p and q a 2 year period oscillation active during the late 1970 s is also evident in the cwt of s1 spring flow period streamflow this however is not locally correlated to any of the tps considered in this work this example again underlines that different tps may be connected to streamflow at different periods and time spans but also that other causes beyond the known climate modes of variability may be related to streamflow variability the interesting opposite influence that nao ao and sca exert on the spring flow deserves to be further discussed positive negative nao ao increases decreases spring flow and the oppositely for sca the meteorological processes connected to this opposing behavior may be clarified as during positive negative ao nao conditions the north atlantic storm track is shifted northwards southwards over scandinavia southern europe and the polar jet is stronger weaker and more zonal meridional in nature hurrell 1995 this increases reduces the transport of mild and moist air masses from the atlantic towards scandinavia and limits enhances the intrusion of a cold polar trough over the region on the other hand a positive sca is associated with a decrease of the number of extra tropical cyclones in northern europe resulting from a weak storm track located northward of the normal track and to a blocking high pressure over scandinavia mailier et al 2006 vitolo et al 2009 moreover a positive sca is also associated to a reduced frequency of winter atmospheric rivers towards northern europe lavers et al 2012 that is an important source of moisture to the region indeed comas bru and mcdermott 2014 suggests that sca has an additive effect on the nao precipitation relationship over the southwest coastal region of sweden and a subtractive one on the rest of the country when the tp indices have the same signs when the tp indices have opposite signs there is a general additive effect on the nao precipitation relationship over the entire country it is argued that this is due to the shifting of their net centers of activity in the atlantic eurasian domain it should be emphasized that different tps that are connected to the same homogeneous region and hydrological period very often have opposite impacts on the streamflow in this way the impact of diverse tps may strengthen or cancel each other enhancing or decreasing the effect of individual tps in a linear or non linear manner such dynamics of opposing influences have been described before by e g ionita 2014 and lim 2015 as well as for the impacts of sst on precipitation e g uvo et al 1998 for precipitation in northeast brazil when these relations are analyzed in more detail by means of wavelets it becomes clear that the strong cwt powers for spring flow in the s clusters fig 6 second row shows to be locally correlated to both nao ao and sca as seen by the corresponding wtc fig 7j to q however when examining the different periodicities of oscillation it shows that in s3 and s2 the high power with about 2 year periodicity is locally correlated to the three tps but that the long periodicity oscillations 8 16 years are only locally correlated to nao ao on the other hand in s1 only the power at 8 to 16 year periodicity is locally correlated to nao and sca this is probably due to the eastern placement of s1 that makes the baltic sea its main source of moisture the r1 cluster presents a shorter and less marked spring flow period the variability in the mean spring flow period streamflow is clearly connected to the variability of ao and nao on longer periodicities and to eawr on shorter less active ones this example provides us with the perspective that the influences of different tps and the consequences of their interaction may also happen in different oscillation periodicities that might accentuate the resulting non linearity in the interannual streamflow variability from fig 5 it is noticeable that the streamflow during spring flow period in the northern snow dominated s clusters is influenced by tps during longer time windows than the southern rain dominated r clusters this characteristic is in agreement with the longer time during which snow is accumulated in the northern clusters and increases the possibility of long term forecasting 4 3 1 3 post flood period in the post flood period the contributions to streamflow from base flow and snow processes are matched or exceeded by the contribution from precipitation events consequently no tp showed a significant teleconnection with the post flood period in s3 and s2 however the s1 post flood period streamflow is correlated with the average pol index in the concomitant period fig 5 s1 the cwt for s1 post flood period streamflow shows preferred oscillation periodicities at 2 4 year and 6 8 year bands the shorter period oscillation was most active from the mid 1990 s to the mid 2000 s and the longer most active from mid 1980 s to early 2000 s fig 6g the wtc reveals that both oscillations are locally correlated in anti phase with the concurrent pol index fig 7r this result suggests that the activity of the pol may modulate the precipitation in s1 during summer and autumn 4 3 2 rain dominated clusters 4 3 2 1 high flow period the high flow period in r1 is correlated with the average ea eawr and pol indices in the five one and twelve months prior to the high flow period respectively fig 5 r1 the cwt analysis of the r1 high flow period streamflow fig 6h indicates oscillations in two preferred periodicities 2 4 year and 8 year bands the oscillation at 2 4 year band was most active during the 1970 s and 2000 s the wtc of r1 high flow period streamflow and different tps showed that the activity during the 1970 s is locally correlated in anti phase with eawr lt0 wl1 fig 8 b while the activity during 2000 s was locally correlated in anti phase with pol lt0 wl12 fig 8c these results once more highlight the impact of two different modes of climate variability on the streamflow at different times the oscillation of about 8 year periodicity was active during the 2000 s despite being under the cone of influence the wtc shows that it is locally correlated with ea lt0 wl5 in phase eawr lt0 wl1 and pol l0 p12 the last two in anti phase fig 8a b and c which is in agreement with the rank correlation coefficients found the r2 high flow period streamflow fig 5 r2 is correlated with the concurrent average nao sca and ao indices and the average ea index in the four months period with a lead time of one month lt1 wl4 as seen in fig 5 r2 the cwt fig 6i suggests two preferred oscillation periodicities 2 4 year and 6 8 year a clear strengthening of the activity of the 2 4 year period oscillation happens at about every decade however its power was significant only during late 1970 s the wtc of r2 high flow period streamflow and the different tps evidenced that the shorter oscillation is locally correlated with the concurrent ao ea lt1 wl4 and concurrent sca in anti phase fig 8e f and g however the phase of the first two wtcs varies significantly along the time span which indicates that the local correlations might not be physically supported in agreement with that no significant correlation was found between r2 high flow period streamflow and ea index and the correlation coefficient between ao index and r2 high flow period streamflow is the lowest presented in fig 5 the 6 8 year oscillation was most active from late 1980 s to late 2000 s fig 6i despite its strong power the wtc analyses show that it is only weakly locally correlated with the ea lt1 wl4 in phase fig 8f none of the analyzed tps exhibit a clear connection to the power and oscillations showed by the cwt in general ao and nao are linearly correlated 0 01 level to streamflow in all clusters and all hydrological periods except for the post flood period in the northern group however the correlations found between nao ao and flows during high flow period in r2 0 37 is despite being statistically significant not supported by the results from the wavelet analyses wtc fig 8d e f and g these are inconclusive with respect to local correlation as they present both few areas of significant local correlation and arrows pointing to different directions within each of the few significant periods this lack of or low correlation between nao ao and flows in the southernmost clusters is supported by the findings of uvo 2003 who found that winter precipitation in southern sweden has very little near zero of its variability explained by nao streamflow during the high flow period is a combination of base flow lake out flows and concurrent meteorological conditions ea and pol are the tps connected to the high flow period in r2 whereas only ea is connected in r1 their connection to r1 and r2 high flow period streamflow is possibly connected to groundwater and lake storage levels as ea positively negatively influences the recharge of these storages in r1 and r2 by transporting mild and moist air masses over away from sweden resulting in milder and wetter cooler and dryer conditions on the other hand the concomitant conditions of sca ao and eawr influence high flow period streamflow by driving the meteorological conditions during the period the wavelet analysis is inconclusive in showing local correlation between tps and high flow period flows in r2 except for ea at shorter periods of oscillation 2 years in r1 local correlations are distinct at longer periodicities of oscillation with ea and eawr with opposite phases fig 8a b and c also in this case an interaction of tps ea and eawr with a resulting strengthening or weakening of their effect on streamflow is suggested eawr is negatively correlated with precipitation over southern sweden and the coastal northern region during winter and most of the country during the summer e g ionita 2014 lim 2015 this is due to the blocking influence of the anticyclonic centre of activity over the north sea between scandinavia and the united kingdom and the resulting north westerly circulation over the scandinavian peninsula 4 3 2 2 spring flow period the spring flow period in r1 is correlated with the average nao and ao indices in the four months prior to the spring flow period and the average eawr index in the three month period with a one month lead time to spring flow period fig 5 r1 the cwt for the r1 spf streamflow suggests two preferred oscillation periodicities both active mostly during the first half of the study span the wtc analysis clarifies that the oscillation of 2 4 year periodicity is locally correlated in anti phase to both ao lt0 wl4 and nao lt0 wl4 the 8 year oscillation is locally correlated in anti phase with ao nao lt0 wl4 fig 8h and i as well as with eawr lt1 wl3 fig 8j 4 3 2 3 low flow period the low flow period in r1 is correlated with the average ea and eawr indices over the low flow period and the average nao and ao indices in the four months prior to the low flow period fig 5 r1 the cwt for the r1 low flow period streamflow suggests two preferred oscillation periodicities of 2 4 year periodicity most active during the mid 1980 s to the early 1990 s and in the mid 2000 s and a 8 years periodicity most active from the mid 1970 s to 2000 however not statistically significant fig 6k the wtc suggest that the active period of 2 4 year oscillation in the mid 1980 s to the early 1990 s is locally correlated with ao nao l0 p5 in anti phase figs 8k and l whereas the activity during the mid 2000 s is locally correlated in anti phase with the concurrent eawr fig 8n the wtc analysis supports that the 8 year oscillation even if not statistically significant at the cwt is locally correlated with both nao lt0 wl5 in anti phase and the concurrent eawr which leads the oscillation by 90 as represented by the vertical arrows pointing down in fig 8m the low flow period in r2 is correlated with the average nao and ao indices in the four and five months prior to the low flow period respectively fig 5 r2 its cwt fig 6l shows a 2 4 year oscillation most active during 1985 1990 and during the 2000 s this oscillation is connected in anti phase to ao lt0 wl5 and nao lt0 wl4 figs 8o and p as well as the post flood period for the s clusters the low flow period for the r clusters are periods when the streamflow is strongly related to rainfall interestingly in these periods average streamflow is connected to different tps eawr pol nao ao and ea or even not connected to any of the studied tps s2 the wavelet analysis show that most of the local correlations with the different tps are associated with long periodicity oscillations 8 16 years the analysis of the relation between the interannual variability of streamflow and tps developed here by means of rank correlation and wavelet analysis clarifies that different tps affect the streamflows in different homogenous hydrological regions clusters during different hydrological periods ao nao before the spring flow period are positively correlated to streamflow during the spring flow period in all snow dominated clusters s clusters on the other hand ao nao is negative correlated to streamflow during the low flow period and the spring flow period in r1 in all clusters sca is negatively correlated to the streamflow both prior and concurrent to most of the hydrological periods ea at time windows prior to the high flow period showed to be positively correlated to streamflow in r1 and r2 and to the accumulation period in s1 pol showed negative correlations with accumulation period in s2 and s1 and the spring flow period in r2 finally eawr showed negatively correlation to high flow period long prior the hydrological period in r1 the spring flood resulting from the melting of snow accumulated during the accumulation period showed to be most influenced by nao ao and sca up to eight months prior spring flow period in the s clusters as the spring flood is responsible for refilling dams this knowledge opens up new possibilities for seasonal hydrological forecasting to support decision making in the hydropower industry e g olsson et al 2016 foster et al 2018 also for forecasting hydrological droughts this knowledge might be a key factor as summer droughts are conditioned on the winter and spring climate laaha et al 2017 5 conclusions the work described here allows the conclusion that in terms of streamflow natural variability as represented by data from 64 gauging stations in unregulated systems the swedish territory may be divided into five homogeneous regions three of these regions are characterized by the dominance of snow processes in their hydrology the northern group clusters s1 s2 s3 and two by rain processes the southern group clusters r1 r2 the hydrographs of the snow dominated group are characterized by three hydrological periods classified as accumulation period spring flow period and post flood period for the rain dominated group the hydrographs show two half year periods one with streamflow below the annual average low flow period and one with flows above the average high flow period the variability of the streamflow in each of the homogenous regions and hydrological periods is influenced by diverse teleconnection patterns tps that can affect the streamflow individually or in combination by defining the climatic meteorological conditions prior to or during each hydrological period the location of the homogeneous hydrological region is largely governing how the streamflow is influenced by climate despite uncertainties connected to averaging tp indices it is possible to conclude that streamflow in the snow dominated regime of cluster s3 is influenced mostly by arctic oscillation ao north atlantic oscillation nao and scandinavian pattern sca the influence of climate begins up to eight months prior to the hydrological period similar conditions are observed for the s2 cluster however in this case east atlantic ea also influences streamflow interestingly no significant connection to the tps was found for the flows during the post flow period in this cluster the streamflow of s1 cluster is influenced by fewer tps than the other s clusters unique for it is the influence of the polar eurasian pattern pol on its post flow period the further south and east the cluster is located the more tps influence the streamflow streamflow in the r1 cluster that is located mostly to the south and east is influenced not only by ao nao and sca but also by ea pol and east atlantic western russia pattern the impact of the different tps which are connected to the same homogeneous region and hydrological period on streamflow is often in conflict with each other this suggests that the interplay between these tps may have a net positive or negative effect on their activity which in turn would enhance or reduce their individual influence on streamflow in a linear or non linear manner to conclude all clusters exhibit a distinct influence of tps on their streamflows by defining the meteorological conditions prior to the start of the hydrological period this creates a clear potential for the development of seasonal hydrological as it is the behavior of certain tps months in advance that governs the average streamflow in the hydrological periods this is especially true for the spring flow period in the northern group where the influence of nao ao and sca begins up to eight months prior to the hydrological period this potential however does not exist in all hydrological periods especially the periods that are simultaneous with the autumn low flow period and post flood period have their average flow closely connected to the meteorological evolution during the period itself i e no connections to the previous climatic

8255,study region sixty four river gauging stations distributed over sweden study focus to investigate the influence of climate teleconnection patterns tp on streamflow in sweden streamflow data is regionalized and the average hydrographs of each homogeneous region is divided into hydrological seasons thereafter the impact of different tps on the streamflow per homogeneous region and per hydrological season is analyzed new hydrological insights for the region five homogeneous regions are identified three located in the north where snow dominates the hydrological processes and two located in the south where rain dominates hydrological processes the northern hydrographs are separated into three hydrological periods low streamflow when snow is accumulated high streamflow during the melting of the snowpack and a transition period in between the southern hydrographs are characterized by streamflow above the yearly average during the winter and below during the summer hydrological periods in different homogeneous regions are influenced by diverse combinations of tps arctic oscillation north atlantic oscillation and scandinavian pattern influence the streamflow in most of the regions during most hydrological periods the further south and east the region is located the more tps influence the streamflow the resulting streamflow variability is related to the interplay between different tps both before and during each hydrological period this interplay may enhance or decrease the individual influence of each tp on streamflow keywords climate variability teleconnections patterns hydrological variability streamflow climate wavelet analysis 1 introduction the northern hemisphere climate circulation patterns and their interactions have a profound effect on the seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation patterns over sweden by altering the transport of moist air masses over scandinavia e g barnston and livezey 1987 comas bru and mcdermott 2014 hurrell et al 2003 rogers 1997 this will in turn strongly influence also scandinavia s hydrological processes in general and streamflow in particular sweden is characterized by a heterogeneous hydrological regime with streamflow being dominated by snow processes in the northern two thirds of the country and by a mixture of rain and snow processes in the southern third krasovskaia and gottschalk 1992 melin 1970 peel et al 2007 in the snow dominated catchments peak flows coincide with the snow melt in the spring while in the rain dominated catchments peak flows are associated with precipitation events and are more common in the cooler months from autumn to early spring teleconnection patterns tps are a natural part of the chaotic movement of the atmosphere they can be described as persistent and recurring patterns of circulation or air pressure anomalies that affect the climate over a large geographical area by influencing the intensity and location of the jet stream and storm tracks and in turn temperature and precipitation consequently tps have a significant positive or negative correlation with the variability of a hydro meteorological variable in a geographically separated region panagiotopoulos et al 2002 this work concerns the northern hemisphere teleconnection patterns defined by barnston and livezey 1987 governing the long term 1 month variability of streamflow in many rivers in sweden although the connection between climate and streamflow is not new to researchers it has traditionally been investigated at the local or river basin scale the influence of remote drivers was generally not contemplated until the early 21st century when enfield et al 2001 and barlow et al 2001 related the climate variability to streamflows in the us the relation between climate variability and rivers have since then been studied worldwide e g barros et al 2004 for the paraguay river basin and bonsal and shabbar 2008 in canada for europe kingston et al 2006a b 2009 showed how the icelandic low the azores high and the difference between their pressure intensity hence the north atlantic oscillation nao and artic oscillation ao are connected to streamflow around north atlantic ocean their studies are clear in demonstrating that the higher the difference between the pressure fields the higher the streamflows in northern europe trigo et al 2004 also focus on the influence of nao but on water resources in the iberian peninsula showing that negative nao was connected to the increase in water resources in that region giuntoli et al 2013 showed that low flows in france were connected to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo as well as to nao bierkens and van beek 2009 used nao as model input to predict winter discharge in major rivers in europe ionita et al 2012 2014 2015 and ionita 2014 2015 showed that river discharge in europe is impacted by further tps than nao and ao depending on the region and season for scandinavia despite the effects of climate variables on temperature and precipitation being well understood the links between large scale climate patterns land surface and hydrologic variability are not as well understood kingston et al 2009 changes in precipitation and temperature at the seasonal scale over sweden have been showed to be connected to the low frequency variations in the northern hemisphere teleconnection patterns e g wallace and gutzler 1981 barnston and livezey 1987 hurrell 1995 uvo 2003 and these changes affect the nested cascade of processes that link the atmospheric and hydrological processes kingston et al 2009 even though most of the swedish rivers are regulated to some extent the spatial and temporal variability of streamflow has noticeable societal impacts nearly half of sweden s electricity comes from hydropower scb 2014 but the uneven distribution of streamflow over the year as well as its interannual variability requires a skilful water management to control electricity production most of the hydropower plants in sweden are located in the northern part of the country here during the cold and dark winter months when the electricity demand is highest the streamflow is at its lowest because precipitation is stored in the form of snow conversely during the warmer months when demand is typically lowest the streamflow is at highest due to the melting season that typically occurs in early summer months and somewhat high due to autumn rains consequently water needs to be stored over the summer and autumn months to allow operators to meet demand during the winter implying that timely and reliable forecasts of streamflow are invaluable to water resource managers as climate is a large source of hydrological variability busuioc et al 2001 krasovskaia et al 1994 the aim of this work is to identify and understand the climatic drivers behind the seasonal and interannual variability in swedish streamflow in light of the complex and diverse hydrological regimes found in sweden as outlined above our hypothesis is that different tps govern the hydrology in different parts of the country as well as during different parts of the year this is a first attempt to systematically investigating these connections which are highly relevant both for understanding the impacts of natural climate variability but also for assessing climate change ones to distinguish between the different hydrological processes rivers in sweden are initially divided into homogeneous hydrological regions which are used to identify and characterize the connections between time series of streamflow and teleconnection pattern indices after establishing links to the most relevant tps a characterization of the underlying relationships is attempted by using wavelet analysis 2 data analyses were performed using time series of streamflow and of teleconnection pattern indices as described below 2 1 streamflow observed daily streamflow data used in this study were collected from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi database homogenization and quality control of the data was performed by smhi before being made available in the public database available online at http vattenwebb smhi se station gauging stations were selected following the four criteria below degree of regulation stations with the least regulation were preferred to ensure that the streamflow was as near to natural as possible length of time series stations with longer time series were preferred to allow for more robust analyses number of missing data stations with fewer missing data were preferred to minimize data filling effects influencing the study results geographic location stations were selected to maximize the geographical coverage of sweden sixty four unregulated or low regulated gauging stations with daily streamflow data from january 1960 to december 2010 were selected their distribution over the swedish territory is shown in fig 1 eleven time series had missing data a total of 4836 days or 2 4 a multiple linear regression of surrounding station data was used to infill those missing data daily streamflow data were averaged into monthly values the nash sutcliffe efficiency values between the regressed time series and the target series ranged between 0 69 and 0 98 when the data is aggregated to monthly data all series were standardized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation prior of their use the standardization allows the statistical comparison among series with large differences in absolute values the standardized series were used in the clustering process and for calculating regional composite series as described in section 3 1 2 2 teleconnection patterns tps monthly indices of selected tps were collected from the climate prediction center cpc available online at http www cpc ncep noaa gov data teledoc telecontents shtml for the period january 1958 to december 2010 the tps used for analysis in this work are summarized in table 1 and their known effects on temperature and precipitation in sweden are briefly described other tested tps among them el niño southern oscillation and pacific decadal oscillation that generated inconclusive results either due to insignificant correlations or because the available data period is too short for a robust physical analysis were omitted from further analysis prior of use hydrological data was detrended and then standardized by month to remove the influences of climate change dimensionality and seasonality it has been previously shown that runoff and teleconnection data can be autocorrelated and this can lead to overestimation of statistical significances in the case of series with considerable autocorrelation and thus they should be interpreted with care e g ptak et al 2018 yue et al 2002 by breaking the data up into seasons and performing the analyses on each season independently reduces any influence autocorrelation might have on the results checks on these discharge data for the different hydrological periods showed that there are no significant autocorrelations ea and pdo are found to have low but significant and considerable autocorrelations respectively the autocorrelations in the pdo data are not unexpected due to the robust nature of that teleconnection pattern 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological characterization to identify regions of homogeneous temporal hydrological variability a cluster analysis was applied to the collection of 64 series of monthly averaged streamflow time series q m where m denotes month 1 m 612 clustering is used for grouping variables into subsets that are linearly related to each other conventionally illustrated by tree like hierarchical diagrams dendrograms that show relations among all variables in a given set krumbein and graybill 1965 the correlation matrix is used as a basis for assessing the strength of the relationships occurring among the variables one pair or more pairs of attributes are selected as highly connected and connections between these pairs and the remaining variables are calculated to develop a hierarchy of interrelations showing the degree of connection within the dataset the hierarchical cluster algorithm chosen for this work was ward ward 1963 due to its simplicity and broad practice prior to applying the cluster analysis the monthly streamflow data was filtered for noise by means of principal component analysis pca so that 90 of the original streamflow variance was kept eliminating 10 of the variance that is expected to be related to noise in the data the use of filtered data as input for the cluster analyses as was done here is common practice and convenient e g uvo and berndtsson 1996 to avoid connections being established based on noise in the data the resulting clusters were validated by means of three different methodologies a correlating the individual records with the cluster mean and in this way ascertaining that all members in the cluster are well related to the cluster mean b by physical understanding of the geographical location of the clusters and c by using silhouettes silhouettes are a graphical aid based on the comparison of the dissimilarity of the members of each cluster and the mean silhouette width gives a measure for the clustering solution s validity forgy 1965 rousseeuw 1987 to represent the streamflow in each cluster a composite monthly streamflow time series was created as the average of the time series from all stations composing the cluster the composite series is denoted q c m where c stands for cluster the benefit with using a composite is that it acts as a generalized time series for the entire cluster and thus is not biased toward any individual time series to define hydrological periods both the station time series q m and the cluster composite time series q c m were averaged into monthly mean annual hydrographs denoted q 1 12 and q c 1 12 respectively where 1 12 stands for calendar month the definition of different hydrological periods for each cluster was made predominantly based on visual inspection of the mean annual hydrographs from individual cluster members q 1 12 superimposed over the cluster mean annual hydrograph q c 1 12 periods of similar hydrological activity or state hereafter referred to as hydrological periods were defined by visual inspection of the hydrograph considering the intensity of the monthly flow five periods were defined accumulation period spring flow period post flood period high flow period and low flow period the detailed description of the characteristics of these periods may be found in section 4 2 for analyzing the links to tps the composite streamflow series q c m were annually averaged over the hydrological periods into q h p c y where hp denotes hydrological period and y denotes year 1 y 51 fig 2 exemplifies how the hydrological seasons were determined for a cluster which is characterized by a snow dominated hydrology the elevated hydrograph flows in august that may be seen in fig 4 are mainly due to three sub basins that due to their geographical position present a delayed signal from the others in this case we chose to not consider august as part of the spring flow period to minimize the risk of outliers from having a too strong influence in the analysis as a result the accumulation period is defined as november to april spring flow period as may to july and post flow period as august to october 3 1 1 definition of hydrological periods based on the monthly composite hydrographs of each cluster five hydrological periods were defined 3 1 1 1 accumulation period period during which precipitation is accumulated in the basin in the form of snow and the streamflow is below the annual mean streamflow during this period is almost entirely due to base flow which is the result of the meteorological conditions during the antecedent months the accumulation period starts with a sharp decline in streamflow typically through november and december due to the little contribution from precipitation to the flow as the majority of it is intercepted and stored in the catchment in the form of a snowpack the flow declines until it is in equilibrium with the base flow after reaching this equilibrium there is a slow but steady decline in streamflow until the onset of the spring flood due to the base flow storages being depleted over time 3 1 1 2 spring flow period the month s after winter when the streamflow is significantly elevated compared to the rest of the year the positive temperature in spring results in a relative rapid snowpack ablation moreover the occurrence of rain on snow might accelerate the ablation process snow melt is the majority contributor to streamflow during the spring flow period followed by the leading minority contributors precipitation and base flow however towards the end of the period the snowpack becomes depleted and rain events become the dominant contributor to streamflow it is not uncommon to have some snow still on the ground in some areas at the end of the spring flow period due to the size of the initial snowpack elevation and or favorable meteorological conditions 3 1 1 3 post flood period the months between the spring flow period and the accumulation period in the snow dominated clusters when there is a steady decline in streamflow from the elevated levels during the spring flow period the typically high streamflow of the spring flow period is receding and the majority contributors to streamflow during the post flood period are precipitation events base flow and glacial ablation where glaciers exist it is a combination of this glacial ablation melt water from higher elevations and base flow that accounts for the extended tail of the spring flow period recession towards the end of the post flood period when the temperature approaches freezing there is a general decrease in both temperature and precipitation this means that although there is a steady drop in streamflow there is also a drop in evapotranspiration rates that leads to a net increase in groundwater and lake levels 3 1 1 4 high flow period the period with above average streamflow over the winter months in the rain dominated clusters that typically starts in november and ends in march or april although precipitation might be in the form of snow during the high flow period there is a higher likelihood that most of this snow will be lost during the high flow period due to thaw and rain on snow processes during the high flow period the evapotranspiration rates are depressed due to the average daily temperature being around zero and there is a relatively high amount of precipitation this results in higher soil moisture and lake levels that in turn coupled with the precipitation results in increased runoff 3 1 1 5 low flow period the period with below average streamflow over the summer months in the r clusters that typically starts in may or june and ends in october although there is a small increase in the amount of precipitation throughout the low flow period the evapotranspiration rates are elevated due to the higher average daily temperature which cause the streamflow to drop below the annual means the majority contributors to streamflow are precipitation events and base flow 3 2 climatological characterization 3 2 1 definition of teleconnection periods each series of monthly tp indices tpi m was averaged over time windows that were connected to the defined hydrological periods considering different lead times and windows lengths fig 3 the time windows were either concurrent with the hydrological periods which are listed above and detailed described in section 4 2 or had a lead time to them for clarification fig 3 shows the example of a 4 month tp window with a 1 month lead time to the hydrological period aug oct for each cluster and hydrological period an ensemble of 145 tp windows were defined one tp window was defined as concurrent with the hydrological period and its corresponding average indices denoted t p i h p c y the other 144 tp windows were a combination of different lead times lt 0 lt 11 months to the hydrological period and window lengths wl 1 wl 12 months the resulting average tp indices may be denoted t p i h p c y l t w l where lt is taken relative to the start of hydrological period hp for cluster c in the following for simplification the expression t p i t w c y is used to denote the averaged tp indices over a certain time window tw which is related to a specific hydrological period in cluster c see fig 3 t p i t w c y thus includes the averaged tp indices both in the concurrent hydrological period t p i h p c y and prior to the hydrological period t p i h p c y l t w l 3 3 linking hydrological regions and teleconnection patterns pca was used to determine connections between tps and streamflow for every hydrological period and hydrological cluster for each cluster and hydrological period a pca was applied to the data matrix composed by the time series of the streamflow composite q h p c y and the time series of the accompanying averaged tp indices t p i t w c y a biplot of the first two pca modes was used to identify within all tps and time windows the ones that were most strongly related to the streamflow composite of each cluster and hydrological period in total 200 matrices were generated considering the five clusters five hydrological seasons and all climate indices considered initially by this study generating 200 biplots that were analyzed some examples of such biplots may be found in the supplementary material fig s1 in the supplementary material the accumulated explained variance of the first two modes ranged from 67 to near 100 with an average of 84 the spearman correlation coefficient was calculated between q h p c y and the tp time series t p i t w c y that were selected from the pca biplot analysis tp time windows for which correlation coefficients were not significant at the 0 01 level were disregarded from further analysis further connections identified by significant correlations but without any discernible physical explanation i e meteorological mechanism able to transfer the information from the teleconnection pattern to the local hydrology were also discarded 3 3 1 temporal variability of the climate hydrology connections the temporal variability of the hydrological and climatological series was analyzed by means of continuous wavelet transform cwt the so called wavelet power spectrum cwts were calculated for each streamflow composite time series q h p c y and the corresponding tps and time windows t p i t w c y that were found connected the wavelet analysis first introduced by morlet et al 1982a morlet et al 1982b and grossmann and morlet 1984 decomposes a time series into scale components allowing distinction between the oscillations that occur at different time scales the wavelet analysis keeps information about the occurrence of non stationary events in both time and frequency domains highlighting localized intermittent periodicities grinsted et al 2004 the morlet ψ 0 wavelet was used in this study since it is efficient in extracting features maintaining a good balance between frequency and time information torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 to determine the connections between the temporal variability of the composite streamflow series q h p c y and the associated tp averages t p i t w c y cross wavelet transforms xwt were calculated grinsted et al 2004 the xwt shows periodicities and time intervals in which the individual cwts have common high power and a common local phase to avoid the pitfalls of xwt analysis identified by mauran and kurths 2004 the wavelet transform coherence wtc was used it is a measure of the coherence between the signals from the individual cwt developed by grinsted et al 2004 and can be thought of as the local correlation between the wavelet transform of each time series used in the xwt the interpretation of the wtc as local correlation was explored in this work as a mean to identify different scales and time periods when composite streamflow time series and the associated tp averages were locally correlated this is an attempt to overcome the non linearity of the impact on streamflow that results from the interactions among different tps tps may enhance or diminish each other s impact on streamflow depending on their state at the specific moment this characteristic generates non linearity in the signal that are not captured by simple correlation analysis between the discharge indices and one of the tps the xwt and wtc were calculated and displayed using the cross wavelet and wavelet coherence toolbox for matlab provided by a grinsted http www glaciology net wavelet coherence the wavelet spectrum was calculated and displayed using the wavelet software provided by c torrence and g compo http atoc colorado edu research wavelets 4 results and discussion fig 4 is a compilation of the main results achieved by this work it displays the location of the stations that compose the different clusters of homogeneous hydrological variability the standardized composite hydrograph for each cluster the identified hydrological periods and the tps that have a statistically significant p 0 01 correlation with the streamflow variability of each cluster each cluster occupies a mutually exclusive and distinct geographical region however due to the limited number of stations it is not possible to exclude the possibility of intrusions along the boundaries between the clusters 4 1 hydrological clusters and their characteristics the hierarchical clustering of the 64 monthly streamflow time series resulted in the five unique clusters represented by different symbols in fig 4 the robustness of this result is supported by the average silhouette width for the clusters being 0 52 indicating that a reasonable structure was found struyf et al 1997 and by the time series of the individual cluster members showing high correlations 0 79 0 025 p 0 01 with their cluster mean time series three clusters are located in the snow dominated northern part of sweden these clusters are named s1 s2 and s3 where s refers to snow dominate and the numbers 1 2 and 3 representing the relative intensity of this hydrological characteristic from least to most intense the stations that constitute the s3 cluster circles in fig 4 are located in the mountainous highlands and forested inland plains in the northern third of the country this is the only cluster that does not include any stations near the coast the s2 cluster stars in fig 4 is split into two separate regions one in the mountainous highlands in central sweden south of cluster s3 and one along the finnish border from the inland plateau in the north down to the coast this spatially discontinuous cluster is in agreement with clusters found in uvo 2003 when examining the variability in precipitation over northern europe the stations in cluster s1 diamonds in fig 4 are mostly located along the northern coastline and inland plains at its southernmost part the stations in s1 also extend up into the mountainous highlands south of s2 in common the annual hydrographs of the s clusters present a well defined melting season characterized by peak flows more detailed descriptions of the hydrographs are presented in section 4 2 two clusters are located in the rain dominated southern part of sweden r1 and r2 in this case r refers to rain dominated and the numbers for the intensity of this characteristic r1 plusses fig 4 extends from low lying areas north of stockholm down to the south eastern coast into the southern highlands and up to the norwegian border the stations in cluster r2 squares fig 4 are located in a band that extends along the western and southern coastlines and a short way up the eastern coast although r1 falls under the rain dominated category its composite hydrograph displays a snow process related signal in the form of a distinct snow melt period in april and may the hydrograph for the cluster r2 displays only a minor snow process related signal with a weak signal of snow melt in april fig 4 the relatively mild winter temperature around 0 c typical of these regions results in several snow melt events as well as rain on snow events that most often result in the snow melting during the winter and consequently only limited periods with snow accumulation on the ground typically from a few days to some weeks as expressed by the normal number of days with snow cover below 75 days average 1961 1990 presented by smhi 2019a some statistics such as number of gauging stations per cluster elevation of the gauging stations the upstream catchment area and the percentage of this area covered by water bodies are summarized in table 2 previous cluster analyses of river streamflow in sweden were made by gottschalk 1985 and for the southern part of sweden by kingston et al 2011 the choice to remake the analysis in this work is based on the fact that the data set used here spans a longer period of time that includes different climatic characteristics as compared to the dataset used by gottschalk 1985 the current dataset 1960 2010 includes the climate shift observed during the 1970 s baines and folland 2007 which is characterized by an important and simultaneous change of phase in several tps among others the climate shift separates a period of predominantly very negative values of nao during the 60 s and 70 s from the predominantly very positive nao period that was most intense during the 1990 s hurrell 2017 moreover a different clustering methodology was used in this study instead of analyzing all catchments at once gottschalk 1985 analyzed streamflows in small and large catchments separately and used correlation coefficient and p space euclidian distance without data pre filtering while kingston et al 2011 used a similar method as the one used here their study area included only a few swedish stations located exclusively in southern sweden gottschalk 1985 identified seven clusters for small basins and three for large ones within sweden the five clusters identified here are an intermediary solution coherent with his results additionally these results are also coherent with the northern north atlantic hydrological regions identified by kingston et al 2011 they found that sweden s hydrology was coarsely divided into two groups one group in the southern third and another in the north 4 2 hydrological periods the annual streamflow in the snow dominated clusters is characterized by three distinct hydrological periods the accumulation period during winter months spring flow period at melting season and the post flood period through november and december as seen in the s1 s2 and s3 hydrographs in fig 4 accumulation period exists only in the snow dominated clusters and is defined as november to march in clusters s1 and s2 and november to april in cluster s3 the start of the spring flow period in the snow dominated clusters ranges from mid to late april for s1 and early to mid may for s3 s1 which is the closest cluster to the coast and lowest in both elevation and latitude shows the earliest start fig 4 s hydrographs the northern clusters s3 and s2 have a longer time from the start of the spring flow period to the spring flow peak if compared to the s1 due to their geographic locations basically spring temperature take longer time to rise in those latitudes cluster s1 has the most distinct spring flow peak that approaches 2 5 standard deviations of the annual mean flow fig 4 s1 hydrograph as its catchments have smaller snowpacks and a more rapid rise in daily temperatures in spring smhi 2019b cluster r1 has a shorter spring flow period figs 4 r1 and r2 hydrographs as compared to the s clusters the lack of spring flow period in r2 is related to the small and intermittent presence of snow in the catchments so that no snowpack is formed during winter the higher elevations and latitudes of the catchments in r1 result in the generation of a more substantial snowpack and a later timing of the spring flow period typically during april and early may the post flood period begins in july for s1 and in august for s3 and s2 the slow fall in the average daily temperature as the summer turns into autumn and a slight increase in precipitation during the autumn months mostly in s2 results in a slow down stabilization and rise in streamflow in the s clusters the hydrographs of the rain dominated clusters are characterized by only two distinct periods the high flow period with above annual average flows in winter and the low flow period during the warm months characterized by below annual average flows see the r1 and r2 hydrographs in fig 4 this binary hydrograph is due to the mild temperatures in the southern parts of sweden during the winter period this results in the low characteristic evapotranspiration rates and an increased likelihood of liquid precipitation and freeze thaw events if compared to colder regions especially in catchments with low elevation and close proximity to the sea the high flow period starts in november for both r1 and r2 with an increase in streamflow through december followed by a drop in february and march due to decrease in precipitation similar to the pattern seen in the s clusters there is a delayed reaction in r1 streamflow due to its higher elevation and latitude and consequently lower temperature the low flow period starts in may in r2 and june in r1 with decreasing streamflow until august after which it increases again as the average daily temperature and evapotranspiration decreases in the following the five hydrological periods identified in the analysis of monthly composite hydrographs from each cluster are described and discussed 4 3 climate streamflow connections fig 5 presents the combinations of tps and associated time windows that are significantly correlated to each cluster and hydrological period the choice of tps and periods tested was made based on the biplots that resulted from the pca analysis examples on figure s1 applied on a matrix containing time series of tps and streamflow in different hydrological periods the presented selection is based on both correlations significant at 0 01 level and a clear physical explanation that supports the correlation in an attempt to simplify visualization fig 5 is divided in five panels corresponding to the five clusters in fig 4 the panels are positioned and named similarly to the clusters in fig 4 for example fig 5 s3 shows that for the s3 cluster located in north west sweden the streamflow during accumulation period is negatively correlated 0 44 to the sca index averaged over the same period and positively correlated to nao 0 42 and ao 0 59 with zero month lead time and a 2 month time window the information provided by the spearman rank correlation analysis is complemented by the wavelet analysis in order to highlight the temporal distribution of the relationship between the composite hydrographs q h p c y and the associated mean tp indices t p i t w c y along the time span of the data set the objective is to quantify the local correlation between streamflow and tp over time which reflects the degree of possibly nonlinear association between the inter annual variability of the streamflow and the tp respectively 4 3 1 snow dominated clusters 4 3 1 1 accumulation period fig 5 shows that s3 streamflow during accumulation period is negatively correlated with the average sca index over the same period concurrent and positively correlated with the average nao and ao indices for lead time lt zero and two months window length wl lt0 wl2 to the accumulation period hereafter the superscript sign following the tp acronym indicates the sign of the correlation the cwt of s3 accumulation period streamflow fig 6 highlights that its interannual variability has two preferred bands of oscillation 2 4 year and 8 16 year the 2 4 year oscillation was most active during the second half of the 1970 s and the first half of 2000 s and was particularly inactive during late 1980 s the 8 16 year oscillation was present during most of the study period even if it does not show as statistically significant at 95 on the wavelet spectrum diagram fig 6a the wtc of s3 accumulation period streamflow and different tps fig 7 a b and c clarifies that the 2 4 year oscillation is locally correlated in anti phase with the concurrent sca along the time span with the strongest intensity from mid 1980 s to mid 2000 s whereas the 8 16 year oscillation is locally correlated in phase to both nao lt0 wl2 fig 7a and ao lt0 wl2 fig 7b during the whole time span of the series the phase of the local correlation is in agreement with the impact of the climate mode represented by the index on the precipitation and temperature over scandinavia a high sca index is commonly associated with a decrease in precipitation and thus discharge over scandinavia which results show to be in anti phase with sca the opposite is true for nao which results show to be in phase with discharge this will be discussed further and in more detailed discussed later in this section it should be emphasized that the high powers showed by the cwt at 2 4 year periodicity fig 6a are connected to different tps during 1975 1980 s3 accumulation period streamflow is locally correlated to nao and ao on the other hand during 1995 2005 sca is the tp to which the streamflow is locally correlated for the s2 cluster the mean streamflow during the accumulation period is correlated with the average indices of nao sca and ao during the concomitant season and with the average indices of eawr and ao in the four and five months prior to the accumulation period respectively fig 5 s2 the cwt clarifies that interannual variability of the streamflow at s2 during accumulation period presents two preferred bands of oscillation the 2 4 year band was most active during late 1960 s and late 1990 s to mid 2000 s but also evident during late 1970 s and 1990 the 8 10 year band is clear throughout the whole data time span but most active during the 1990 s fig 6b the wtc of s2 accumulation period streamflow and tps fig 7d e f and g reveals that the 2 4 year oscillation is locally correlated in phase similarly with the average nao fig 7d and ao not shown concurrent to accumulation period before 1970 s between 1985 1990 and between 2000 2005 and with ao prior lt0 wl4 to accumulation period during the same years but not after 1995 fig 7g moreover it is locally correlated in anti phase with the concomitant sca before 1975 and after 2000 the oscillation on 8 10 year band is locally correlated with nao and ao in phase and sca anti phase at the concomitant period along the whole time span fig 7d and e as well as to eawr lt0 wl5 out of phase during 1975 1995 fig 7f noticeable for the accumulation period streamflow in s2 is that it clearly shows that the variability in streamflow may result from the interaction between different tps either during short time intervals as for the 2 4 year band oscillation or for long time spans as for the 8 16 year band the accumulation period streamflow in s1 is correlated with the average ea and eawr indices in the three and one months prior to the accumulation period respectively fig 5 the cwt shows that s1 accumulation period streamflow did not show any period of preferred oscillation statistical significant power is only present between 1990 and 2010 spanning from 2 to 10 year periodicity fig 6c such power showed on wtc to be locally correlated to ea lt0 wl3 in phase in the longer band of oscillation the negative spearman correlation found with eawr may be related to a local correlation in anti phase at periods 4 years before 1980 fig 7i 4 3 1 2 spring flow period the spring flow period streamflow in s3 and s2 are both correlated with the average nao sca and ao indices during the seven eight and seven months prior to the spring flow period respectively fig 5 s3 and s2 the long time window prior to the spring flow period clearly indicates the impact of the tps on the amount of snow that is stored in the basin during winter as the main contribution to the streamflow during spring flow period comes from snow melt the cwt of the streamflow in s3 during the spring flow period shows one centre of statistically significant power at about 2 year band of oscillation active during the 1990 s and one at the 4 8 year around mid 1970 s fig 6d the wtcs of the s3 spring flow period show that both centers of action are locally correlated in phase with nao lt0 wl7 and ao lt0 wl7 fig 7j and k in addition the activity centre at about 2 year periodicity is locally correlated in anti phase with sca lt0 wl8 fig 7l clearly the centre of high power at the 2 year band is a result from the interaction among several climate modes of variability tps ao nao and sca the wavelet spectrum for the s2 spring flow period streamflow presents different characteristics than the one for s3 spring flow period flows despite similar rank correlations with ao nao and sca it indicates that the 2 year oscillation is present during most of the study time however statistically significant only during the second part of the 1990 s fig 6e a centre of significant power at 8 year oscillation is present around early 1970 s the wtc charts show that the short period oscillation is locally correlated in phase with nao l0 p7 and in a similar way with ao lt0 wl7 fig 7m and n at the same time this oscillation is locally correlated in anti phase with sca lt0 wl8 fig 7o the 8 year oscillation is however locally correlated in phase mostly to nao lt0 wl7 the spring flow period in s1 is correlated to the mean nao and sca indices six and two months prior to the spring flow period respectively fig 5 s1 the cwt of the s1 average streamflow during spring flow period fig 6f shows a preferred oscillation of about 6 8 year periodicity that was distinctly active during the 1960 s and from the mid 1980 s to the early 2000 s the wtc clarifies that the active period in the 1960 s is locally correlated to nao lt0 wl6 in phase whereas the one from the mid 1980 s to the early 2000 s is locally correlated in phase with nao lt0 wl6 and in anti phase with sca lt0 wl2 fig 7p and q a 2 year period oscillation active during the late 1970 s is also evident in the cwt of s1 spring flow period streamflow this however is not locally correlated to any of the tps considered in this work this example again underlines that different tps may be connected to streamflow at different periods and time spans but also that other causes beyond the known climate modes of variability may be related to streamflow variability the interesting opposite influence that nao ao and sca exert on the spring flow deserves to be further discussed positive negative nao ao increases decreases spring flow and the oppositely for sca the meteorological processes connected to this opposing behavior may be clarified as during positive negative ao nao conditions the north atlantic storm track is shifted northwards southwards over scandinavia southern europe and the polar jet is stronger weaker and more zonal meridional in nature hurrell 1995 this increases reduces the transport of mild and moist air masses from the atlantic towards scandinavia and limits enhances the intrusion of a cold polar trough over the region on the other hand a positive sca is associated with a decrease of the number of extra tropical cyclones in northern europe resulting from a weak storm track located northward of the normal track and to a blocking high pressure over scandinavia mailier et al 2006 vitolo et al 2009 moreover a positive sca is also associated to a reduced frequency of winter atmospheric rivers towards northern europe lavers et al 2012 that is an important source of moisture to the region indeed comas bru and mcdermott 2014 suggests that sca has an additive effect on the nao precipitation relationship over the southwest coastal region of sweden and a subtractive one on the rest of the country when the tp indices have the same signs when the tp indices have opposite signs there is a general additive effect on the nao precipitation relationship over the entire country it is argued that this is due to the shifting of their net centers of activity in the atlantic eurasian domain it should be emphasized that different tps that are connected to the same homogeneous region and hydrological period very often have opposite impacts on the streamflow in this way the impact of diverse tps may strengthen or cancel each other enhancing or decreasing the effect of individual tps in a linear or non linear manner such dynamics of opposing influences have been described before by e g ionita 2014 and lim 2015 as well as for the impacts of sst on precipitation e g uvo et al 1998 for precipitation in northeast brazil when these relations are analyzed in more detail by means of wavelets it becomes clear that the strong cwt powers for spring flow in the s clusters fig 6 second row shows to be locally correlated to both nao ao and sca as seen by the corresponding wtc fig 7j to q however when examining the different periodicities of oscillation it shows that in s3 and s2 the high power with about 2 year periodicity is locally correlated to the three tps but that the long periodicity oscillations 8 16 years are only locally correlated to nao ao on the other hand in s1 only the power at 8 to 16 year periodicity is locally correlated to nao and sca this is probably due to the eastern placement of s1 that makes the baltic sea its main source of moisture the r1 cluster presents a shorter and less marked spring flow period the variability in the mean spring flow period streamflow is clearly connected to the variability of ao and nao on longer periodicities and to eawr on shorter less active ones this example provides us with the perspective that the influences of different tps and the consequences of their interaction may also happen in different oscillation periodicities that might accentuate the resulting non linearity in the interannual streamflow variability from fig 5 it is noticeable that the streamflow during spring flow period in the northern snow dominated s clusters is influenced by tps during longer time windows than the southern rain dominated r clusters this characteristic is in agreement with the longer time during which snow is accumulated in the northern clusters and increases the possibility of long term forecasting 4 3 1 3 post flood period in the post flood period the contributions to streamflow from base flow and snow processes are matched or exceeded by the contribution from precipitation events consequently no tp showed a significant teleconnection with the post flood period in s3 and s2 however the s1 post flood period streamflow is correlated with the average pol index in the concomitant period fig 5 s1 the cwt for s1 post flood period streamflow shows preferred oscillation periodicities at 2 4 year and 6 8 year bands the shorter period oscillation was most active from the mid 1990 s to the mid 2000 s and the longer most active from mid 1980 s to early 2000 s fig 6g the wtc reveals that both oscillations are locally correlated in anti phase with the concurrent pol index fig 7r this result suggests that the activity of the pol may modulate the precipitation in s1 during summer and autumn 4 3 2 rain dominated clusters 4 3 2 1 high flow period the high flow period in r1 is correlated with the average ea eawr and pol indices in the five one and twelve months prior to the high flow period respectively fig 5 r1 the cwt analysis of the r1 high flow period streamflow fig 6h indicates oscillations in two preferred periodicities 2 4 year and 8 year bands the oscillation at 2 4 year band was most active during the 1970 s and 2000 s the wtc of r1 high flow period streamflow and different tps showed that the activity during the 1970 s is locally correlated in anti phase with eawr lt0 wl1 fig 8 b while the activity during 2000 s was locally correlated in anti phase with pol lt0 wl12 fig 8c these results once more highlight the impact of two different modes of climate variability on the streamflow at different times the oscillation of about 8 year periodicity was active during the 2000 s despite being under the cone of influence the wtc shows that it is locally correlated with ea lt0 wl5 in phase eawr lt0 wl1 and pol l0 p12 the last two in anti phase fig 8a b and c which is in agreement with the rank correlation coefficients found the r2 high flow period streamflow fig 5 r2 is correlated with the concurrent average nao sca and ao indices and the average ea index in the four months period with a lead time of one month lt1 wl4 as seen in fig 5 r2 the cwt fig 6i suggests two preferred oscillation periodicities 2 4 year and 6 8 year a clear strengthening of the activity of the 2 4 year period oscillation happens at about every decade however its power was significant only during late 1970 s the wtc of r2 high flow period streamflow and the different tps evidenced that the shorter oscillation is locally correlated with the concurrent ao ea lt1 wl4 and concurrent sca in anti phase fig 8e f and g however the phase of the first two wtcs varies significantly along the time span which indicates that the local correlations might not be physically supported in agreement with that no significant correlation was found between r2 high flow period streamflow and ea index and the correlation coefficient between ao index and r2 high flow period streamflow is the lowest presented in fig 5 the 6 8 year oscillation was most active from late 1980 s to late 2000 s fig 6i despite its strong power the wtc analyses show that it is only weakly locally correlated with the ea lt1 wl4 in phase fig 8f none of the analyzed tps exhibit a clear connection to the power and oscillations showed by the cwt in general ao and nao are linearly correlated 0 01 level to streamflow in all clusters and all hydrological periods except for the post flood period in the northern group however the correlations found between nao ao and flows during high flow period in r2 0 37 is despite being statistically significant not supported by the results from the wavelet analyses wtc fig 8d e f and g these are inconclusive with respect to local correlation as they present both few areas of significant local correlation and arrows pointing to different directions within each of the few significant periods this lack of or low correlation between nao ao and flows in the southernmost clusters is supported by the findings of uvo 2003 who found that winter precipitation in southern sweden has very little near zero of its variability explained by nao streamflow during the high flow period is a combination of base flow lake out flows and concurrent meteorological conditions ea and pol are the tps connected to the high flow period in r2 whereas only ea is connected in r1 their connection to r1 and r2 high flow period streamflow is possibly connected to groundwater and lake storage levels as ea positively negatively influences the recharge of these storages in r1 and r2 by transporting mild and moist air masses over away from sweden resulting in milder and wetter cooler and dryer conditions on the other hand the concomitant conditions of sca ao and eawr influence high flow period streamflow by driving the meteorological conditions during the period the wavelet analysis is inconclusive in showing local correlation between tps and high flow period flows in r2 except for ea at shorter periods of oscillation 2 years in r1 local correlations are distinct at longer periodicities of oscillation with ea and eawr with opposite phases fig 8a b and c also in this case an interaction of tps ea and eawr with a resulting strengthening or weakening of their effect on streamflow is suggested eawr is negatively correlated with precipitation over southern sweden and the coastal northern region during winter and most of the country during the summer e g ionita 2014 lim 2015 this is due to the blocking influence of the anticyclonic centre of activity over the north sea between scandinavia and the united kingdom and the resulting north westerly circulation over the scandinavian peninsula 4 3 2 2 spring flow period the spring flow period in r1 is correlated with the average nao and ao indices in the four months prior to the spring flow period and the average eawr index in the three month period with a one month lead time to spring flow period fig 5 r1 the cwt for the r1 spf streamflow suggests two preferred oscillation periodicities both active mostly during the first half of the study span the wtc analysis clarifies that the oscillation of 2 4 year periodicity is locally correlated in anti phase to both ao lt0 wl4 and nao lt0 wl4 the 8 year oscillation is locally correlated in anti phase with ao nao lt0 wl4 fig 8h and i as well as with eawr lt1 wl3 fig 8j 4 3 2 3 low flow period the low flow period in r1 is correlated with the average ea and eawr indices over the low flow period and the average nao and ao indices in the four months prior to the low flow period fig 5 r1 the cwt for the r1 low flow period streamflow suggests two preferred oscillation periodicities of 2 4 year periodicity most active during the mid 1980 s to the early 1990 s and in the mid 2000 s and a 8 years periodicity most active from the mid 1970 s to 2000 however not statistically significant fig 6k the wtc suggest that the active period of 2 4 year oscillation in the mid 1980 s to the early 1990 s is locally correlated with ao nao l0 p5 in anti phase figs 8k and l whereas the activity during the mid 2000 s is locally correlated in anti phase with the concurrent eawr fig 8n the wtc analysis supports that the 8 year oscillation even if not statistically significant at the cwt is locally correlated with both nao lt0 wl5 in anti phase and the concurrent eawr which leads the oscillation by 90 as represented by the vertical arrows pointing down in fig 8m the low flow period in r2 is correlated with the average nao and ao indices in the four and five months prior to the low flow period respectively fig 5 r2 its cwt fig 6l shows a 2 4 year oscillation most active during 1985 1990 and during the 2000 s this oscillation is connected in anti phase to ao lt0 wl5 and nao lt0 wl4 figs 8o and p as well as the post flood period for the s clusters the low flow period for the r clusters are periods when the streamflow is strongly related to rainfall interestingly in these periods average streamflow is connected to different tps eawr pol nao ao and ea or even not connected to any of the studied tps s2 the wavelet analysis show that most of the local correlations with the different tps are associated with long periodicity oscillations 8 16 years the analysis of the relation between the interannual variability of streamflow and tps developed here by means of rank correlation and wavelet analysis clarifies that different tps affect the streamflows in different homogenous hydrological regions clusters during different hydrological periods ao nao before the spring flow period are positively correlated to streamflow during the spring flow period in all snow dominated clusters s clusters on the other hand ao nao is negative correlated to streamflow during the low flow period and the spring flow period in r1 in all clusters sca is negatively correlated to the streamflow both prior and concurrent to most of the hydrological periods ea at time windows prior to the high flow period showed to be positively correlated to streamflow in r1 and r2 and to the accumulation period in s1 pol showed negative correlations with accumulation period in s2 and s1 and the spring flow period in r2 finally eawr showed negatively correlation to high flow period long prior the hydrological period in r1 the spring flood resulting from the melting of snow accumulated during the accumulation period showed to be most influenced by nao ao and sca up to eight months prior spring flow period in the s clusters as the spring flood is responsible for refilling dams this knowledge opens up new possibilities for seasonal hydrological forecasting to support decision making in the hydropower industry e g olsson et al 2016 foster et al 2018 also for forecasting hydrological droughts this knowledge might be a key factor as summer droughts are conditioned on the winter and spring climate laaha et al 2017 5 conclusions the work described here allows the conclusion that in terms of streamflow natural variability as represented by data from 64 gauging stations in unregulated systems the swedish territory may be divided into five homogeneous regions three of these regions are characterized by the dominance of snow processes in their hydrology the northern group clusters s1 s2 s3 and two by rain processes the southern group clusters r1 r2 the hydrographs of the snow dominated group are characterized by three hydrological periods classified as accumulation period spring flow period and post flood period for the rain dominated group the hydrographs show two half year periods one with streamflow below the annual average low flow period and one with flows above the average high flow period the variability of the streamflow in each of the homogenous regions and hydrological periods is influenced by diverse teleconnection patterns tps that can affect the streamflow individually or in combination by defining the climatic meteorological conditions prior to or during each hydrological period the location of the homogeneous hydrological region is largely governing how the streamflow is influenced by climate despite uncertainties connected to averaging tp indices it is possible to conclude that streamflow in the snow dominated regime of cluster s3 is influenced mostly by arctic oscillation ao north atlantic oscillation nao and scandinavian pattern sca the influence of climate begins up to eight months prior to the hydrological period similar conditions are observed for the s2 cluster however in this case east atlantic ea also influences streamflow interestingly no significant connection to the tps was found for the flows during the post flow period in this cluster the streamflow of s1 cluster is influenced by fewer tps than the other s clusters unique for it is the influence of the polar eurasian pattern pol on its post flow period the further south and east the cluster is located the more tps influence the streamflow streamflow in the r1 cluster that is located mostly to the south and east is influenced not only by ao nao and sca but also by ea pol and east atlantic western russia pattern the impact of the different tps which are connected to the same homogeneous region and hydrological period on streamflow is often in conflict with each other this suggests that the interplay between these tps may have a net positive or negative effect on their activity which in turn would enhance or reduce their individual influence on streamflow in a linear or non linear manner to conclude all clusters exhibit a distinct influence of tps on their streamflows by defining the meteorological conditions prior to the start of the hydrological period this creates a clear potential for the development of seasonal hydrological as it is the behavior of certain tps months in advance that governs the average streamflow in the hydrological periods this is especially true for the spring flow period in the northern group where the influence of nao ao and sca begins up to eight months prior to the hydrological period this potential however does not exist in all hydrological periods especially the periods that are simultaneous with the autumn low flow period and post flood period have their average flow closely connected to the meteorological evolution during the period itself i e no connections to the previous climatic

8256,study region the current study evaluates the isotopic and chemical compositions of rainfall from central to leeward hawaiʻi island an area characterized by the interactions of pacific trade wind flow with two 4 000 meter high mountains as well as one of the largest natural emitters of sulfur dioxide on the planet study focus our study collected cumulative rainfall samples at regular intervals over a 28 month period from 20 stations spanning a range of elevations across this region and determined average isotopic and dissolved ion compositions in those samples the study period included an extreme weather event hurricane lane a major volcanic eruption at kīlauea in 2018 and the nearly complete cessation of long term volcanic emissions following that eruptive event new hydrological insights to the region consistent with previous literature results show long term variability through our establishment of an enhanced local meteoric water line lmwl for west hawaiʻi we hypothesize the two lmwl represent ends of a spectrum due to the variability in atmospheric and climate processes in this region additionally results of stable isotope compositions and bulk ion deposition highlight how extreme events such as volcanic eruptions and hurricanes can affect the chemistry of precipitation sulfate concentrations in bulk precipitation decreased by a mean of 70 p 0 032 after the 2018 kīlauea eruption ceased the results from this study can be used to better quantify and characterize precipitation which is the ultimate source of hawai i s groundwater keywords stable isotopes bulk deposition precipitation groundwater hawaii island local meteoric water line 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of potable water in the state of hawaiʻi to better understand the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge on hawaiʻi island we look to the source precipitation understanding the source of hawaiʻi s groundwater is critical to future water security questions including the degree of connectivity between aquifers and the sustainability of groundwater withdrawal continue to puzzle hydrogeologists and draw concerns from growing communities and water managers across the state including west hawaiʻi complex subsurface geologic structures in west hawaiʻi island are inferred which require further investigation oki 1999 tillman et al 2014 kelly and glenn 2015 attias et al 2020 building upon other studies e g fackrell et al 2020 we investigate the variable chemistry of precipitation from central to west hawaiʻi island given its link to source storage and flow of groundwater this research is part of the national science foundation epscor track 1 ʻike wai project a key science goal of ʻike wai is to investigate groundwater recharge storage and flow within an ocean island volcanic enivornment ʻike wai collected and is currently analyzing new geophysical microbiological and geochemical data in the west hawaiʻi study region the objective of this paper specifically is to investigate isotopic and bulk ion deposition variability in precipitation across an extended region of central and west hawai i island here we present results from precipitation samples collected at 20 sites on an approximately quarterly basis between august 2017 and november 2019 fig 1 during the 28 month sampling period kīlauea volcano experienced a large volume east rift zone eruption from early may to september 2018 that at its conclusion terminated a 35 year period of nearly continuous eruptive activity at kīlauea hurricane lane impacted the state of hawaiʻi and specifically hawaiʻi island in late august 2018 these events allowed us the rare opportunity to investigate the impact of volcanic gases also known as vog and a hurricane respectively on the precipitation chemistry the stable isotopes of water 18o and 2h also referred to as deuterium or d have been used around the world to identify the source and flow trajectories of water the global meteoric water line gmwl is a linear trendline that describes the majority of precipitation that falls on earth by relating δ 18o and δd as δd 8 δ 18o 10 craig 1961 two main factors that control the isotopic composition of precipitation are the temperature of condensation and the amount of rainout from the air mass dansgaard 1964 seasonal variations in δ 18o and δd precipitation values at tropical latitudes can be attributed to the source of moisture and to the amount effect as well as elevation and types of convection torri et al 2017 these variations remain fairly constant at tropical latitudes due to their consistent annual climatic patterns dansgaard 1964 a first publication on the stable isotope variations in hawaiʻi rainfall was by friedman and woodcock 1957 and focused on east hawaiʻi island more recent work in hawaiʻi has been conducted in the kīlauea region of hawaiʻi island on haleakalā on maui on the island of oʻahu and in west hawaiʻi island scholl et al 1996 2002 tillman et al 2014 fackrell et al 2020 dores et al 2020 this research expands on the work of fackrell et al 2020 in west hawaiʻi between october 2012 and december 2014 fackrell et al 2020 collected and analyzed isotopic compositions of precipitation recovered at six month collection intervals from eight sites and produced a local meteoric water line lmwl for the west hawaiʻi region using the lmwl in conjunction with groundwater data their study determined recharge elevations to develop new conceptual models for groundwater flow paths one of their conclusions is the suggestion that precipitation from high elevations on mauna kea and mauna loa volcanoes recharge the hualālai aquifers however no data were collected from the high elevation regions demonstrating the need for an expanded investigation in order to more fully comprehend the complex hydrogeology of west hawaiʻi precipitation studies focusing on chemical composition ph and the effects of kīlauea gases on acid rain have been conducted on hawaiʻi island for more than six decades eriksson 1957 miller and yoshinaga 1981 harding and miller 1982 nachbar hapai et al 1989 siegel et al 1990 scholl and ingebritsen 1995 similar coastal and volcanic studies of wet and bulk wet dry deposition of major ions in precipitation have been conducted around the world such as in mexico cerón et al 2005 korea lee et al 2000 and italy aiuppa et al 2006 a study by zuo et al 2020 used rainfall and vog emission observations in a numerical model to demonstrate that increased aerosols from kīlauea volcano have reduced rainfall for the downwind regions of hawaiʻi island although challenging to collect we contend that long term precipitation geochemistry data over a broad area of hawaiʻi island are needed to develop a lmwl that is able to characterize the isotopic composition of rainfall recharge and its evolution to local groundwater this paper provides the most comprehensive such dataset to date 2 material and methods 2 1 study site there are three volcanoes located within the west hawaiʻi study region hualālai mauna kea and mauna loa fig 1 hualālai volcano is the western most volcano on hawaiʻi island standing at an elevation of 2 523 m above mean sea level amsl although the age of hualālai versus mauna kea has been debated over time moore and clague 1992 the most recent research identifying the superposition of shore breaks supports that hualālai is older taylor 2019 mauna loa is one of the most voluminous volcanoes on the planet rising to 4 169 m amsl mauna kea is slightly taller standing at 4 207 m amsl hualālai and mauna loa are considered volcanically active and all three volcanoes have surface lava flows that extend to the coast within the study area the study area experiences a diverse range of climates mean annual air temperatures range from 22 24 c in coastal regions to 4 6 c in the high summit regions of mauna loa and mauna kea giambelluca et al 2014 due to hualālai s placement in the rain shadow of mauna kea and mauna loa trade wind derived orographic precipitation does not reach this region instead land breeze sea breeze patterns are experienced almost daily annual rainfall averages for hawaiʻi island range from 204 mm to 2 750 mm giambelluca et al 2013 the kona coffee region of kailua kona has a unique pattern of rainfall with a band of higher rainfall at mid elevations 300 m 500 m amsl fig 1 airflow travels from the eastern side of hawaiʻi island kīlauea around the southern tip and back up the western slopes of mauna loa causing a persistent band of clouds and rain almost daily giambelluca et al 2013 afternoon land breezes typically enhance the cloud belt west hawaiʻi experiences more intense rain events during the summer months in contrast with much of the rest of the state of hawaiʻi which experiences the most rain in the winter leopold 1949 precipitation above the trade wind inversion found at around 2 000 m decreases steeply with elevation resulting in a dry environment that receives rain dominantly from extra tropical and subtropical storms giambelluca et al 2013 kīlauea is the eastern most volcano on hawaiʻi island and has until recently been in a state of nearly continous eruption for more than 35 years volcanic gases emitted by kīlauea are dominantly carbon dioxide co2 sulfur dioxide so2 hydrogen sulfide h2s and hydrogen halides hf hcl hbr and are distributed throughout hawaiʻi by varying weather systems sutton and elias 2014 from 1983 2018 eruptive activity occurred along kīlauea s east rift zone as well as at the summit where a lava lake at halemaʻumaʻu crater produced heavy gas plumes between 2008 and 2018 neal and anderson 2020 kīlauea erupted on its lower east rift zone lerz between late may to september 2018 draining the lava lake causing a more than 10 fold increase in gas emissions and at the conclusion of that event bringing a cessation in eruptive activity for the first time in decades williams et al 2020 2 2 sampling methods twenty rain collectors were deployed throughout the study site three of our sites exactly replicated and two were located within two kilometers and 100 m elevation of fackrell et al 2020 sites such replicated sites are denoted by single and double asterisks respectively table 1 samples were collected on an approximately quarterly basis to assess seasonal trends in rainfall including cumulative volume during the sampling intervals isotopic composition δ 18o and δd and ion chemistry two models of rain collectors were used in this study fig 2 1 novalynx rain and snow gauges which have a 20 cm diameter funnel and are secured in a tripod stand that is bolted to cement platforms and 2 a hand made design based on that of previous studies scholl et al 1996 fackrell et al 2020 which uses a 5 gallon hdpe bucket with a 101 6 or 152 4 mm diameter funnel protruding from the bucket lid these bucket style rain collectors were secured to common potting stands which were secured into the ground with metal stakes a 1 cm thick layer of mineral oil was poured into both styles of collectors to prevent rainwater from evaporating the novalynx gauges were deployed at the uh88 telescope on the summit of mauna kea and at the mauna loa observatory research facility the hand made design was deployed at the other 18 sites at the time of each sample collection the weather conditions temperature and total volume of water was recorded following methods described in fackrell et al 2020 the volumes presented in tachera 2020 are the measured total volume of precipitation in each collector for each sampling interval co located rain gages were not used of the total volume a 500 ml sample in a hdpe bottle was taken for further analyses the rest was poured out at the site a 0 2 μm milliporesigma sterile syringe filter was used to remove any biological material or mineral oil from the 500 ml sample each 500 ml sample was then partitioned into two 60 ml hdpe bottles and refrigerated until sample analysis was conducted which was typically within two to six weeks of sample collection one 60 ml bottle was used for major ion and the other for δ 18o and δd analyses 2 3 analytical methods stable isotopes were analyzed by the biogeochemical stable isotope facility at the university of hawaiʻi at mānoa stable isotope analyses for δ 18o and δd were performed using a picarro l1102 i wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds following similar methods as godoy et al 2012 relative to v smow within our dataset the minimum standard deviation for δ 18o and δd was 0 01 and the maximum standard deviation was 0 07 and 0 59 for δ 18o and δd respectively major ion analyses for cations na k mg ca and anions f cl br so4 were performed by the water resources research center laboratory at the university of hawaiʻi at mānoa using a dual dionex ics 1100 ion chromatograph following the us epa method 300 1 for determining inorganic ions in drinking water hautman and munch 1997 sample precision at one standard deviation based on duplicate sample pairs indicate variances of 0 342 μm f 28 36 μm cl 0 28 μm br 18 96 μm so4 24 78 μm na 5 47 μm nh4 1 40 μm k 13 22 μm mg and 16 45 μm ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 short term trends in stable isotopes the accumulated precipitation mm δ 18o and δd results for each sampling period are presented in fig 3 to show the variability in the precipitation rate over time at each site tachera 2020 of the 20 rain collectors 9 were visited immediately after hurricane lane to collect a hurricane specific sample the volume weighted averages vwa of δ 18o and δd values of all the samples collected at each site are shown in fig 4 and table 1 in fig 3 the samples are separated as follows seven low elevation sites below 500 m relative to mean sea level msl seven mid elevation sites between 500 and 2 000 m msl and six high elevation sites above 2 000 m msl low elevation sites are distinguished from those above 500 m because they exhibit similar trends in rainfall mm and isotopic composition fig 5 high elevation sites are separated out because they are above the trade wind inversion that typically occurs at around 2 000 m and therefore experiences different patterns of rainfall giambelluca et al 2013 the shaded region in fig 5 represents the kīlauea lerz eruption from may to september 2018 observed quarterly cumulative rainfall at low elevation sites was less than 250 mm until after the cessation of the 2018 kīlauea eruption the rainfall during the eruption period of may to september 2018 was particularly low as summer is typically the rainy season in west hawaiʻi at these low elevations isotopic variability throughout the study period is observed with the most depleted isotopic compositions collected during hurricane lane the remaining depleted samples were collected during the dry winter season possibly indicating that rather than local storms produced by daily heating larger storm systems contribute to the rainfall in this region during these months as was also noticed by dores et al 2020 at mid elevations quarterly cumulative rainfall generally peaked at 500 mm with one outlier kaloko collecting over 1 000 mm in a sample period similar to the low elevation sites rainfall remained relatively low throughout the summer of 2018 until the cessation of the kīlauea eruption isotopic variability is observed with hurricane lane not making much of an impact at mid elevations isotopic variability is observed at these elevations but the impact of hurricane lane on isotopic values is more muted here than seen at the lower elevation sites similarly relative seasonal variations in isotopic compositions at the mid elevations are less than seen at the lower elevations at high elevation sites quarterly cumulative rainfall appears to be higher during the 2018 kīlauea eruption however sampling at puʻu lāʻau hale pōhaku and mauna kea ended early in march 2019 also due to the central location of many of the high elevation sites on hawaiʻi island it is likely that these sites are influenced by weather systems that pass over the island particularly larger more organized systems like cold fronts or kona lows high elevation sites observed the most isotopically depleted compositions overall and the strongest isotopic variability similar to the low and mid elevation sites the winter season is observed to have the most depleted samples besides those collected during hurricane lane possibly due to the influence of larger storm systems that originate at higher latitudes that travel toward the islands e g dores et al 2020 the west hawaiʻi local meteoric water line was calculated by determining the linear regression through the vwa of δ 18o and δd for all sites and is described as δd 8 14 δ 18o 12 83 r2 0 99 the lmwl from this study is nearly identical to the east hawaiʻi lmwl δd 8 0 δ 18o 12 defined by scholl et al 1996 and differs from the lmwl defined for the west hawaiʻi region by fackrell et al 2020 δd 7 65 δ 18o 15 25 fig 4 the variability between the lmwl is discussed further in section 3 2 the δ 18o isotope elevation relationship is shown in fig 5 the linear regression is defined as δ 18o 0 0017 h 2 54 for low and mid elevation sites lapse rate 0 17 100 m and δ 18o 0 0030 h 0 33 for high elevation sites lapse rate 0 30 100 m where h is the elevation of each site in meters relative to msl the isotope elevation relationships observed are similar to those found by scholl et al 1996 for trade wind below 2 000 m and high elevation above 2 000 m areas comparing these regressions and lapse rates to previous studies worldwide poage and chamberlain 2001 compiled 68 studies from around the world and determined a global lapse rate of 0 28 100 m paternoster et al 2008 found a similar lapse rate of 0 17 100 m for mt vulture italy kong and pang 2016 found a positive lapse rate of 0 12 100 m for the tianshan mountains the δ 18o lapse rates observed which are on the low end of the global δ 18o lapse rates are likely a function of temperature lapse rates and the sources of moisture there does not appear to be a strong relationship between elevation and isotopic composition below an elevation of 1 000 m all of the sites deployed in the lowest annual rainfall zone fig 1 have vwa values that are isotopically depleted relative to the calculated regression lines fig 5 the exceptions are three sites keahuolū waikoloa and puʻu o uo fig 5 as squares which are enriched relative to the regression lines despite being located in the lowest annual rainfall zone it is important to note however that these sites collected precipitation for under one year previous studies in hawaiʻi determined that elevation effects were difficult to observe below the inversion layer dores et al 2020 the lowest annual rainfall zone likely only receives rainfall during extratropical and subtropical storm events which would therefore have already depleted δ 18o isotopic compositions resulting in depleted δ 18o samples compared to the regression lines gedzelman and lawrence 1990 good et al 2014 dütch et al 2016 precipitation sites that are enriched relative to the linear regression with the exception of the three mentioned just above fall within the orange 751 2 000 mm annual rainfall zone fig 1 given that rainfall in the orange zone has been interfacing with the land as it travels from the windward to leeward side of the island it is possible that there may be isotopic enrichment of the water at the base of the cloud scholl et al 2002 2007 another explanation for the observed enrichment is that more of the rainfall here occurs in frequent lower intensity rain events that are related to the diurnal wind cycles and thus is not as depleted due to the amount effect as precipitation from infrequent storms that contribute more to the lower elevation red zone these hypotheses could explain the enrichment of samples above the regression line however more data are necessary to provide a conclusive answer 3 2 comparison of stable isotopes across studies there is a distinct difference between the lmwl produced by the data of fackrell et al 2020 versus this study fig 6 which potentially addresses the discrepancy of 18o enrichment in groundwater samples observed in previous studies tillman et al 2014 kelly and glenn 2015 fig 5 of fackrell et al 2020 shows that the salinity corrected groundwater sample group averages plot with an offset to the right of the west hawaiʻi lmwl described as δd 7 65 δ 18o 15 25 indicating an 18o enrichment in groundwater relative to precipitation they propose four hypotheses for this difference 1 variability in precipitation δd and δ 18o values during the study period compared to a long term average 2 some degree of preferential evaporation of d and 18o during infiltration 3 hydrothermal water rock interactions in high temperature regions of the groundwater system or 4 a combination of these effects five of the eight precipitation collectors deployed by fackrell et al 2020 were replicated to within 1 5 km three of which were identical placements fackrell et al 2020 concluded that rainfall sourced at higher elevations possibly from the slopes of mauna kea or mauna loa are recharging into the hualālai aquifers in order to test this conclusion we strategically placed precipitation collectors at higher elevations we computed combined vwa for the five replicated sites which resulted in better characterization of the groundwater data presented in previous literature tillman et al 2014 kelly and glenn 2015 fackrell et al 2020 the 2012 2014 sampling period of fackrell et al 2020 remained relatively neutral however the 2017 2019 study period experienced both a la niña from october 2017 to march 2018 and an el niño from october 2018 to june 2019 noaa national 2021 previous work in hawaiʻi observed lower than normal rainfall during el niño which can be further exacerbated by the influence of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo chu and chen 2005 giambelluca et al 2013 frazier and giambelluca 2017 elison timm et al 2020 changes in the atmospheric circulation resulting in strong surface westerly anomalies have been observed to reduce trade wind rainfall in hawaiʻi e g chu and chen 2005 we hypothesize that the two lmwl represent ends of a spectrum due to such variability in atmospheric and climate processes in this region however specific investigations into the cause of such variability is beyond the scope of this project long term variations such as those shown above have not been previously observed and highlight the need for long term sampling in order to accurately characterize rainfall for groundwater recharge studies to our knowledge the longest collection of isotope data in hawaiʻi was conducted by the international atomic energy agency through the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip through this project data for only a few years 1962 1969 and from a single station was collected we hope however that the results presented here will serve as motivation for the creation of long term monitoring of water isotopes in hawaiʻi 3 3 variability of ions in precipitation the investigation into bulk deposition for the west hawaiʻi study area specifically chloride and sulfate concentrations is to explore whether our results are similar to those of previous studies that observed increased aerosols downwind of a volcano contributing to the development of acid rain eriksson 1957 miller and yoshinaga 1981 harding and miller 1982 nachbar hapai et al 1989 siegel et al 1990 scholl and ingebritsen 1995 however direct comparison is difficult due to the large spatial difference between the focus of the previous studies on east hawaiʻi and ours in west hawaiʻi major ion concentrations as bulk wet dry deposition for each sampling trip are reported in tachera 2020 quarterly cumulative rainfall in low and mid elevations was relatively low less than 250 mm for each sampling period prior to and during the 2018 kīlauea lerz eruption fig 7 after the eruption ended in september 2018 precipitation amounts increased to 500 mm or higher the low rainfall observations during the kīlauea eruption particularly below the inversion layer corroborate those of zuo et al 2020 who present rainfall and gas emission data in parallel with a numerical model suggesting reduced rainfall during periods of increased aerosols spikes in chloride and sulfate concentrations μm were observed during two periods 1 june 2018 to august 2018 and 2 november 2018 to march 2019 the first spike coincided with the 2018 kīlauea eruption which caused heavy vog in west hawaiʻi low rainfall less than 250 mm precipitation was also observed at all sites during this time despite coinciding with the typical wet season for west hawaiʻi the second spike was observed in only a few sites and was more pronounced for chloride than sulfate again quarterly cumulative rainfall measurements did not exceed 250 mm for all sites however november to march is the expected dry season for west hawaiʻi previous studies have also observed higher major ion concentrations during periods of lower rainfall e g lee et al 2000 3 4 event based impacts on precipitation two events during our study period affected the chemistry of precipitation 1 the lower east rift zone lerz eruption of kīlauea volcano from may to september 2018 and 2 hurricane lane which dissipated into a tropical storm upon approach to the hawaiian islands in august 2018 to better understand the impacts of these events on the ion concentrations in rainfall we compared chloride and sulfate concentrations to sodium concentrations fig 8 a and 8b stable isotopic compositions were also investigated fig 8c the observed chloride concentrations approximated those of seawater with the largest deficiencies occurring at lower concentrations particularly the samples collected during hurricane lane fig 8a this may be attributed to the low chloride and sodium concentrations approaching the detection limits as similar observations were made in previous studies e g scholl and ingebritsen 1995 crustal dust could also cause the sodium concentrations to increase relative to chloride keene et al 1986 scholl and ingebritsen 1995 however indicators like al and fe were not collected during this study therefore we are unable to determine if the higher abundance of sodium is due to this deposition chloride concentrations do not appear to be affected by the 2018 kīlauea eruption as the spread of pre during and post eruption samples were similar a welch s t test performed on pre during p 0 535 during post p 0 151 and pre post p 0 349 groups concluded there is no statistical difference between the samples sulfate concentrations exceeded the seawater ratio even at the start of our sampling due to the long term puʻu ʻōʻō eruption of kīlauea volcano which began in 1983 and terminated just prior to the start of the 2018 kīlauea lerz eruption fig 8b between march 2014 and december 2017 daily summit and east rift zone sulfur dioxide emission rates were between 1 227 and 9 970 metric tonnes per day t d averaging 4 783 t d elias et al 2018 this emission rate dramatically increased during the 2018 kīlauea lower east rift zone eruption preliminary analyses from the u s geological survey indicate that sulfur dioxide gas emissions averaged more than 50 000 tons per day and during some periods exceeded 100 000 tons per day williams et al 2020 during the 2018 kīlauea eruption hurricane lane impacted the state of hawaiʻi in august 2018 during which sulfate concentrations also exceeded the seawater ratio the lane samples also display the lowest sulfate concentrations observed during the eruption after the cessation of the 2018 kīlauea eruption sulfate concentrations decreased approximately 70 to yield chloride ratios approaching those in seawater a welch s t test performed on the sulfate concentrations concluded that there is a statistical difference between during post groups p 0 032 0 05 however there is no statistical difference between pre during p 0 118 and pre post p 0 159 groups downwind of the volcano ammonium sulfate is typically observed due to the reaction of terrigenous and volcanic ammonia and the sulfate compounds in the atmosphere cornell et al 2001 tachera 2020 reports the ammonium concentrations observed during this study demonstrating that the highest concentrations of ammonium ion during our study period were recorded during the 2018 kīlauea eruption stable isotopic compositions before during and after the eruption are spread throughout the range of samples fig 8c rainfall during the hurricane was less than 200 mm at low to mid elevations and was between 200 400 mm at high elevations although the rainfall amounts were not notable at low elevations samples collected during hurricane lane observed the most depleted isotopic compositions observed during our study period for this elevation interval a welch s t test performed on the isotopic compositions shows that there is no statistical difference between the pre during p 0 686 during post p 0 781 and pre post p 0 511 groups 4 conclusions samples of precipitation were collected at 20 sites from central to west hawaiʻi between august 2017 and november 2019 the isotopic composition and bulk ion deposition of such samples were measured and compared to previous studies conducted on hawai i island and maui to better characterize the source of groundwater in central to west hawaiʻi island significant findings support our assertion that long term precipitation data are crucial when developing a lmwl for hawai i these findings include the local meteoric water line established during this study is similar to those for east hawaiʻi and east maui as well as the global meteoric water line it differs from the local meteoric water line established in the previous west hawai i study by fackrell et al 2020 combined vwa for replicated sites produce averages that better characterize the groundwater isotopic compositions observed in previous studies long term studies are needed to better understand the variations observed in the meteoric water lines spanning a near decade long sampling of these sites the δ 18o isotope elevation relationship established for west hawaiʻi is similar to the trade wind for low and mid elevations and high elevation relationships observed in east hawaiʻi depletion in vwa δ 18o is observed in sites within low annual rainfall areas less than 750 mm relative to the isotope elevation regression these sites possibly experience rainfall mainly during extratropical and subtropical storms which already have depleted δ 18o compositions enrichment in vwa δ 18o is observed for sites in the rain band which wraps around the southern tip of hawaiʻi island and flows up the leeward slopes of mauna loa and hualālai additional results provide insight into extreme events which can impact the chemical composition of precipitation these findings include during periods of low rainfall less than 250 mm as well as the 2018 kīlauea eruption all sites observed increased concentrations of sulfate and chloride precipitation at low and mid elevation sites remained low during the 2018 kīlauea eruption supporting previous research that an increase in aerosols decreases rainfall downwind of the volcano sulfate concentrations increased during the kīlauea eruption however chloride concentrations did not welch s t tests demonstrated a statistical difference only between sulfate concentrations observed during and after the eruption ended p 0 032 and no statistical difference between the rest of the samples this paper provides a foundation to follow on work including 1 incorporation of the data presented herein with new groundwater chemistry data in order to investigate the recharge zones interconnectivity and storage of west hawaiʻi aquifers and 2 analyses of the effects of seasalt aerosol deposition on ecological processes and water quality continued collection of bulk deposition particularly in the current quiet period of kīlauea volcano would aid in understanding the importance and impacts of volcanic emissions on rainfall rates and compositions multi decadal

8256,study region the current study evaluates the isotopic and chemical compositions of rainfall from central to leeward hawaiʻi island an area characterized by the interactions of pacific trade wind flow with two 4 000 meter high mountains as well as one of the largest natural emitters of sulfur dioxide on the planet study focus our study collected cumulative rainfall samples at regular intervals over a 28 month period from 20 stations spanning a range of elevations across this region and determined average isotopic and dissolved ion compositions in those samples the study period included an extreme weather event hurricane lane a major volcanic eruption at kīlauea in 2018 and the nearly complete cessation of long term volcanic emissions following that eruptive event new hydrological insights to the region consistent with previous literature results show long term variability through our establishment of an enhanced local meteoric water line lmwl for west hawaiʻi we hypothesize the two lmwl represent ends of a spectrum due to the variability in atmospheric and climate processes in this region additionally results of stable isotope compositions and bulk ion deposition highlight how extreme events such as volcanic eruptions and hurricanes can affect the chemistry of precipitation sulfate concentrations in bulk precipitation decreased by a mean of 70 p 0 032 after the 2018 kīlauea eruption ceased the results from this study can be used to better quantify and characterize precipitation which is the ultimate source of hawai i s groundwater keywords stable isotopes bulk deposition precipitation groundwater hawaii island local meteoric water line 1 introduction groundwater is the main source of potable water in the state of hawaiʻi to better understand the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge on hawaiʻi island we look to the source precipitation understanding the source of hawaiʻi s groundwater is critical to future water security questions including the degree of connectivity between aquifers and the sustainability of groundwater withdrawal continue to puzzle hydrogeologists and draw concerns from growing communities and water managers across the state including west hawaiʻi complex subsurface geologic structures in west hawaiʻi island are inferred which require further investigation oki 1999 tillman et al 2014 kelly and glenn 2015 attias et al 2020 building upon other studies e g fackrell et al 2020 we investigate the variable chemistry of precipitation from central to west hawaiʻi island given its link to source storage and flow of groundwater this research is part of the national science foundation epscor track 1 ʻike wai project a key science goal of ʻike wai is to investigate groundwater recharge storage and flow within an ocean island volcanic enivornment ʻike wai collected and is currently analyzing new geophysical microbiological and geochemical data in the west hawaiʻi study region the objective of this paper specifically is to investigate isotopic and bulk ion deposition variability in precipitation across an extended region of central and west hawai i island here we present results from precipitation samples collected at 20 sites on an approximately quarterly basis between august 2017 and november 2019 fig 1 during the 28 month sampling period kīlauea volcano experienced a large volume east rift zone eruption from early may to september 2018 that at its conclusion terminated a 35 year period of nearly continuous eruptive activity at kīlauea hurricane lane impacted the state of hawaiʻi and specifically hawaiʻi island in late august 2018 these events allowed us the rare opportunity to investigate the impact of volcanic gases also known as vog and a hurricane respectively on the precipitation chemistry the stable isotopes of water 18o and 2h also referred to as deuterium or d have been used around the world to identify the source and flow trajectories of water the global meteoric water line gmwl is a linear trendline that describes the majority of precipitation that falls on earth by relating δ 18o and δd as δd 8 δ 18o 10 craig 1961 two main factors that control the isotopic composition of precipitation are the temperature of condensation and the amount of rainout from the air mass dansgaard 1964 seasonal variations in δ 18o and δd precipitation values at tropical latitudes can be attributed to the source of moisture and to the amount effect as well as elevation and types of convection torri et al 2017 these variations remain fairly constant at tropical latitudes due to their consistent annual climatic patterns dansgaard 1964 a first publication on the stable isotope variations in hawaiʻi rainfall was by friedman and woodcock 1957 and focused on east hawaiʻi island more recent work in hawaiʻi has been conducted in the kīlauea region of hawaiʻi island on haleakalā on maui on the island of oʻahu and in west hawaiʻi island scholl et al 1996 2002 tillman et al 2014 fackrell et al 2020 dores et al 2020 this research expands on the work of fackrell et al 2020 in west hawaiʻi between october 2012 and december 2014 fackrell et al 2020 collected and analyzed isotopic compositions of precipitation recovered at six month collection intervals from eight sites and produced a local meteoric water line lmwl for the west hawaiʻi region using the lmwl in conjunction with groundwater data their study determined recharge elevations to develop new conceptual models for groundwater flow paths one of their conclusions is the suggestion that precipitation from high elevations on mauna kea and mauna loa volcanoes recharge the hualālai aquifers however no data were collected from the high elevation regions demonstrating the need for an expanded investigation in order to more fully comprehend the complex hydrogeology of west hawaiʻi precipitation studies focusing on chemical composition ph and the effects of kīlauea gases on acid rain have been conducted on hawaiʻi island for more than six decades eriksson 1957 miller and yoshinaga 1981 harding and miller 1982 nachbar hapai et al 1989 siegel et al 1990 scholl and ingebritsen 1995 similar coastal and volcanic studies of wet and bulk wet dry deposition of major ions in precipitation have been conducted around the world such as in mexico cerón et al 2005 korea lee et al 2000 and italy aiuppa et al 2006 a study by zuo et al 2020 used rainfall and vog emission observations in a numerical model to demonstrate that increased aerosols from kīlauea volcano have reduced rainfall for the downwind regions of hawaiʻi island although challenging to collect we contend that long term precipitation geochemistry data over a broad area of hawaiʻi island are needed to develop a lmwl that is able to characterize the isotopic composition of rainfall recharge and its evolution to local groundwater this paper provides the most comprehensive such dataset to date 2 material and methods 2 1 study site there are three volcanoes located within the west hawaiʻi study region hualālai mauna kea and mauna loa fig 1 hualālai volcano is the western most volcano on hawaiʻi island standing at an elevation of 2 523 m above mean sea level amsl although the age of hualālai versus mauna kea has been debated over time moore and clague 1992 the most recent research identifying the superposition of shore breaks supports that hualālai is older taylor 2019 mauna loa is one of the most voluminous volcanoes on the planet rising to 4 169 m amsl mauna kea is slightly taller standing at 4 207 m amsl hualālai and mauna loa are considered volcanically active and all three volcanoes have surface lava flows that extend to the coast within the study area the study area experiences a diverse range of climates mean annual air temperatures range from 22 24 c in coastal regions to 4 6 c in the high summit regions of mauna loa and mauna kea giambelluca et al 2014 due to hualālai s placement in the rain shadow of mauna kea and mauna loa trade wind derived orographic precipitation does not reach this region instead land breeze sea breeze patterns are experienced almost daily annual rainfall averages for hawaiʻi island range from 204 mm to 2 750 mm giambelluca et al 2013 the kona coffee region of kailua kona has a unique pattern of rainfall with a band of higher rainfall at mid elevations 300 m 500 m amsl fig 1 airflow travels from the eastern side of hawaiʻi island kīlauea around the southern tip and back up the western slopes of mauna loa causing a persistent band of clouds and rain almost daily giambelluca et al 2013 afternoon land breezes typically enhance the cloud belt west hawaiʻi experiences more intense rain events during the summer months in contrast with much of the rest of the state of hawaiʻi which experiences the most rain in the winter leopold 1949 precipitation above the trade wind inversion found at around 2 000 m decreases steeply with elevation resulting in a dry environment that receives rain dominantly from extra tropical and subtropical storms giambelluca et al 2013 kīlauea is the eastern most volcano on hawaiʻi island and has until recently been in a state of nearly continous eruption for more than 35 years volcanic gases emitted by kīlauea are dominantly carbon dioxide co2 sulfur dioxide so2 hydrogen sulfide h2s and hydrogen halides hf hcl hbr and are distributed throughout hawaiʻi by varying weather systems sutton and elias 2014 from 1983 2018 eruptive activity occurred along kīlauea s east rift zone as well as at the summit where a lava lake at halemaʻumaʻu crater produced heavy gas plumes between 2008 and 2018 neal and anderson 2020 kīlauea erupted on its lower east rift zone lerz between late may to september 2018 draining the lava lake causing a more than 10 fold increase in gas emissions and at the conclusion of that event bringing a cessation in eruptive activity for the first time in decades williams et al 2020 2 2 sampling methods twenty rain collectors were deployed throughout the study site three of our sites exactly replicated and two were located within two kilometers and 100 m elevation of fackrell et al 2020 sites such replicated sites are denoted by single and double asterisks respectively table 1 samples were collected on an approximately quarterly basis to assess seasonal trends in rainfall including cumulative volume during the sampling intervals isotopic composition δ 18o and δd and ion chemistry two models of rain collectors were used in this study fig 2 1 novalynx rain and snow gauges which have a 20 cm diameter funnel and are secured in a tripod stand that is bolted to cement platforms and 2 a hand made design based on that of previous studies scholl et al 1996 fackrell et al 2020 which uses a 5 gallon hdpe bucket with a 101 6 or 152 4 mm diameter funnel protruding from the bucket lid these bucket style rain collectors were secured to common potting stands which were secured into the ground with metal stakes a 1 cm thick layer of mineral oil was poured into both styles of collectors to prevent rainwater from evaporating the novalynx gauges were deployed at the uh88 telescope on the summit of mauna kea and at the mauna loa observatory research facility the hand made design was deployed at the other 18 sites at the time of each sample collection the weather conditions temperature and total volume of water was recorded following methods described in fackrell et al 2020 the volumes presented in tachera 2020 are the measured total volume of precipitation in each collector for each sampling interval co located rain gages were not used of the total volume a 500 ml sample in a hdpe bottle was taken for further analyses the rest was poured out at the site a 0 2 μm milliporesigma sterile syringe filter was used to remove any biological material or mineral oil from the 500 ml sample each 500 ml sample was then partitioned into two 60 ml hdpe bottles and refrigerated until sample analysis was conducted which was typically within two to six weeks of sample collection one 60 ml bottle was used for major ion and the other for δ 18o and δd analyses 2 3 analytical methods stable isotopes were analyzed by the biogeochemical stable isotope facility at the university of hawaiʻi at mānoa stable isotope analyses for δ 18o and δd were performed using a picarro l1102 i wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy ws crds following similar methods as godoy et al 2012 relative to v smow within our dataset the minimum standard deviation for δ 18o and δd was 0 01 and the maximum standard deviation was 0 07 and 0 59 for δ 18o and δd respectively major ion analyses for cations na k mg ca and anions f cl br so4 were performed by the water resources research center laboratory at the university of hawaiʻi at mānoa using a dual dionex ics 1100 ion chromatograph following the us epa method 300 1 for determining inorganic ions in drinking water hautman and munch 1997 sample precision at one standard deviation based on duplicate sample pairs indicate variances of 0 342 μm f 28 36 μm cl 0 28 μm br 18 96 μm so4 24 78 μm na 5 47 μm nh4 1 40 μm k 13 22 μm mg and 16 45 μm ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 short term trends in stable isotopes the accumulated precipitation mm δ 18o and δd results for each sampling period are presented in fig 3 to show the variability in the precipitation rate over time at each site tachera 2020 of the 20 rain collectors 9 were visited immediately after hurricane lane to collect a hurricane specific sample the volume weighted averages vwa of δ 18o and δd values of all the samples collected at each site are shown in fig 4 and table 1 in fig 3 the samples are separated as follows seven low elevation sites below 500 m relative to mean sea level msl seven mid elevation sites between 500 and 2 000 m msl and six high elevation sites above 2 000 m msl low elevation sites are distinguished from those above 500 m because they exhibit similar trends in rainfall mm and isotopic composition fig 5 high elevation sites are separated out because they are above the trade wind inversion that typically occurs at around 2 000 m and therefore experiences different patterns of rainfall giambelluca et al 2013 the shaded region in fig 5 represents the kīlauea lerz eruption from may to september 2018 observed quarterly cumulative rainfall at low elevation sites was less than 250 mm until after the cessation of the 2018 kīlauea eruption the rainfall during the eruption period of may to september 2018 was particularly low as summer is typically the rainy season in west hawaiʻi at these low elevations isotopic variability throughout the study period is observed with the most depleted isotopic compositions collected during hurricane lane the remaining depleted samples were collected during the dry winter season possibly indicating that rather than local storms produced by daily heating larger storm systems contribute to the rainfall in this region during these months as was also noticed by dores et al 2020 at mid elevations quarterly cumulative rainfall generally peaked at 500 mm with one outlier kaloko collecting over 1 000 mm in a sample period similar to the low elevation sites rainfall remained relatively low throughout the summer of 2018 until the cessation of the kīlauea eruption isotopic variability is observed with hurricane lane not making much of an impact at mid elevations isotopic variability is observed at these elevations but the impact of hurricane lane on isotopic values is more muted here than seen at the lower elevation sites similarly relative seasonal variations in isotopic compositions at the mid elevations are less than seen at the lower elevations at high elevation sites quarterly cumulative rainfall appears to be higher during the 2018 kīlauea eruption however sampling at puʻu lāʻau hale pōhaku and mauna kea ended early in march 2019 also due to the central location of many of the high elevation sites on hawaiʻi island it is likely that these sites are influenced by weather systems that pass over the island particularly larger more organized systems like cold fronts or kona lows high elevation sites observed the most isotopically depleted compositions overall and the strongest isotopic variability similar to the low and mid elevation sites the winter season is observed to have the most depleted samples besides those collected during hurricane lane possibly due to the influence of larger storm systems that originate at higher latitudes that travel toward the islands e g dores et al 2020 the west hawaiʻi local meteoric water line was calculated by determining the linear regression through the vwa of δ 18o and δd for all sites and is described as δd 8 14 δ 18o 12 83 r2 0 99 the lmwl from this study is nearly identical to the east hawaiʻi lmwl δd 8 0 δ 18o 12 defined by scholl et al 1996 and differs from the lmwl defined for the west hawaiʻi region by fackrell et al 2020 δd 7 65 δ 18o 15 25 fig 4 the variability between the lmwl is discussed further in section 3 2 the δ 18o isotope elevation relationship is shown in fig 5 the linear regression is defined as δ 18o 0 0017 h 2 54 for low and mid elevation sites lapse rate 0 17 100 m and δ 18o 0 0030 h 0 33 for high elevation sites lapse rate 0 30 100 m where h is the elevation of each site in meters relative to msl the isotope elevation relationships observed are similar to those found by scholl et al 1996 for trade wind below 2 000 m and high elevation above 2 000 m areas comparing these regressions and lapse rates to previous studies worldwide poage and chamberlain 2001 compiled 68 studies from around the world and determined a global lapse rate of 0 28 100 m paternoster et al 2008 found a similar lapse rate of 0 17 100 m for mt vulture italy kong and pang 2016 found a positive lapse rate of 0 12 100 m for the tianshan mountains the δ 18o lapse rates observed which are on the low end of the global δ 18o lapse rates are likely a function of temperature lapse rates and the sources of moisture there does not appear to be a strong relationship between elevation and isotopic composition below an elevation of 1 000 m all of the sites deployed in the lowest annual rainfall zone fig 1 have vwa values that are isotopically depleted relative to the calculated regression lines fig 5 the exceptions are three sites keahuolū waikoloa and puʻu o uo fig 5 as squares which are enriched relative to the regression lines despite being located in the lowest annual rainfall zone it is important to note however that these sites collected precipitation for under one year previous studies in hawaiʻi determined that elevation effects were difficult to observe below the inversion layer dores et al 2020 the lowest annual rainfall zone likely only receives rainfall during extratropical and subtropical storm events which would therefore have already depleted δ 18o isotopic compositions resulting in depleted δ 18o samples compared to the regression lines gedzelman and lawrence 1990 good et al 2014 dütch et al 2016 precipitation sites that are enriched relative to the linear regression with the exception of the three mentioned just above fall within the orange 751 2 000 mm annual rainfall zone fig 1 given that rainfall in the orange zone has been interfacing with the land as it travels from the windward to leeward side of the island it is possible that there may be isotopic enrichment of the water at the base of the cloud scholl et al 2002 2007 another explanation for the observed enrichment is that more of the rainfall here occurs in frequent lower intensity rain events that are related to the diurnal wind cycles and thus is not as depleted due to the amount effect as precipitation from infrequent storms that contribute more to the lower elevation red zone these hypotheses could explain the enrichment of samples above the regression line however more data are necessary to provide a conclusive answer 3 2 comparison of stable isotopes across studies there is a distinct difference between the lmwl produced by the data of fackrell et al 2020 versus this study fig 6 which potentially addresses the discrepancy of 18o enrichment in groundwater samples observed in previous studies tillman et al 2014 kelly and glenn 2015 fig 5 of fackrell et al 2020 shows that the salinity corrected groundwater sample group averages plot with an offset to the right of the west hawaiʻi lmwl described as δd 7 65 δ 18o 15 25 indicating an 18o enrichment in groundwater relative to precipitation they propose four hypotheses for this difference 1 variability in precipitation δd and δ 18o values during the study period compared to a long term average 2 some degree of preferential evaporation of d and 18o during infiltration 3 hydrothermal water rock interactions in high temperature regions of the groundwater system or 4 a combination of these effects five of the eight precipitation collectors deployed by fackrell et al 2020 were replicated to within 1 5 km three of which were identical placements fackrell et al 2020 concluded that rainfall sourced at higher elevations possibly from the slopes of mauna kea or mauna loa are recharging into the hualālai aquifers in order to test this conclusion we strategically placed precipitation collectors at higher elevations we computed combined vwa for the five replicated sites which resulted in better characterization of the groundwater data presented in previous literature tillman et al 2014 kelly and glenn 2015 fackrell et al 2020 the 2012 2014 sampling period of fackrell et al 2020 remained relatively neutral however the 2017 2019 study period experienced both a la niña from october 2017 to march 2018 and an el niño from october 2018 to june 2019 noaa national 2021 previous work in hawaiʻi observed lower than normal rainfall during el niño which can be further exacerbated by the influence of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo chu and chen 2005 giambelluca et al 2013 frazier and giambelluca 2017 elison timm et al 2020 changes in the atmospheric circulation resulting in strong surface westerly anomalies have been observed to reduce trade wind rainfall in hawaiʻi e g chu and chen 2005 we hypothesize that the two lmwl represent ends of a spectrum due to such variability in atmospheric and climate processes in this region however specific investigations into the cause of such variability is beyond the scope of this project long term variations such as those shown above have not been previously observed and highlight the need for long term sampling in order to accurately characterize rainfall for groundwater recharge studies to our knowledge the longest collection of isotope data in hawaiʻi was conducted by the international atomic energy agency through the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip through this project data for only a few years 1962 1969 and from a single station was collected we hope however that the results presented here will serve as motivation for the creation of long term monitoring of water isotopes in hawaiʻi 3 3 variability of ions in precipitation the investigation into bulk deposition for the west hawaiʻi study area specifically chloride and sulfate concentrations is to explore whether our results are similar to those of previous studies that observed increased aerosols downwind of a volcano contributing to the development of acid rain eriksson 1957 miller and yoshinaga 1981 harding and miller 1982 nachbar hapai et al 1989 siegel et al 1990 scholl and ingebritsen 1995 however direct comparison is difficult due to the large spatial difference between the focus of the previous studies on east hawaiʻi and ours in west hawaiʻi major ion concentrations as bulk wet dry deposition for each sampling trip are reported in tachera 2020 quarterly cumulative rainfall in low and mid elevations was relatively low less than 250 mm for each sampling period prior to and during the 2018 kīlauea lerz eruption fig 7 after the eruption ended in september 2018 precipitation amounts increased to 500 mm or higher the low rainfall observations during the kīlauea eruption particularly below the inversion layer corroborate those of zuo et al 2020 who present rainfall and gas emission data in parallel with a numerical model suggesting reduced rainfall during periods of increased aerosols spikes in chloride and sulfate concentrations μm were observed during two periods 1 june 2018 to august 2018 and 2 november 2018 to march 2019 the first spike coincided with the 2018 kīlauea eruption which caused heavy vog in west hawaiʻi low rainfall less than 250 mm precipitation was also observed at all sites during this time despite coinciding with the typical wet season for west hawaiʻi the second spike was observed in only a few sites and was more pronounced for chloride than sulfate again quarterly cumulative rainfall measurements did not exceed 250 mm for all sites however november to march is the expected dry season for west hawaiʻi previous studies have also observed higher major ion concentrations during periods of lower rainfall e g lee et al 2000 3 4 event based impacts on precipitation two events during our study period affected the chemistry of precipitation 1 the lower east rift zone lerz eruption of kīlauea volcano from may to september 2018 and 2 hurricane lane which dissipated into a tropical storm upon approach to the hawaiian islands in august 2018 to better understand the impacts of these events on the ion concentrations in rainfall we compared chloride and sulfate concentrations to sodium concentrations fig 8 a and 8b stable isotopic compositions were also investigated fig 8c the observed chloride concentrations approximated those of seawater with the largest deficiencies occurring at lower concentrations particularly the samples collected during hurricane lane fig 8a this may be attributed to the low chloride and sodium concentrations approaching the detection limits as similar observations were made in previous studies e g scholl and ingebritsen 1995 crustal dust could also cause the sodium concentrations to increase relative to chloride keene et al 1986 scholl and ingebritsen 1995 however indicators like al and fe were not collected during this study therefore we are unable to determine if the higher abundance of sodium is due to this deposition chloride concentrations do not appear to be affected by the 2018 kīlauea eruption as the spread of pre during and post eruption samples were similar a welch s t test performed on pre during p 0 535 during post p 0 151 and pre post p 0 349 groups concluded there is no statistical difference between the samples sulfate concentrations exceeded the seawater ratio even at the start of our sampling due to the long term puʻu ʻōʻō eruption of kīlauea volcano which began in 1983 and terminated just prior to the start of the 2018 kīlauea lerz eruption fig 8b between march 2014 and december 2017 daily summit and east rift zone sulfur dioxide emission rates were between 1 227 and 9 970 metric tonnes per day t d averaging 4 783 t d elias et al 2018 this emission rate dramatically increased during the 2018 kīlauea lower east rift zone eruption preliminary analyses from the u s geological survey indicate that sulfur dioxide gas emissions averaged more than 50 000 tons per day and during some periods exceeded 100 000 tons per day williams et al 2020 during the 2018 kīlauea eruption hurricane lane impacted the state of hawaiʻi in august 2018 during which sulfate concentrations also exceeded the seawater ratio the lane samples also display the lowest sulfate concentrations observed during the eruption after the cessation of the 2018 kīlauea eruption sulfate concentrations decreased approximately 70 to yield chloride ratios approaching those in seawater a welch s t test performed on the sulfate concentrations concluded that there is a statistical difference between during post groups p 0 032 0 05 however there is no statistical difference between pre during p 0 118 and pre post p 0 159 groups downwind of the volcano ammonium sulfate is typically observed due to the reaction of terrigenous and volcanic ammonia and the sulfate compounds in the atmosphere cornell et al 2001 tachera 2020 reports the ammonium concentrations observed during this study demonstrating that the highest concentrations of ammonium ion during our study period were recorded during the 2018 kīlauea eruption stable isotopic compositions before during and after the eruption are spread throughout the range of samples fig 8c rainfall during the hurricane was less than 200 mm at low to mid elevations and was between 200 400 mm at high elevations although the rainfall amounts were not notable at low elevations samples collected during hurricane lane observed the most depleted isotopic compositions observed during our study period for this elevation interval a welch s t test performed on the isotopic compositions shows that there is no statistical difference between the pre during p 0 686 during post p 0 781 and pre post p 0 511 groups 4 conclusions samples of precipitation were collected at 20 sites from central to west hawaiʻi between august 2017 and november 2019 the isotopic composition and bulk ion deposition of such samples were measured and compared to previous studies conducted on hawai i island and maui to better characterize the source of groundwater in central to west hawaiʻi island significant findings support our assertion that long term precipitation data are crucial when developing a lmwl for hawai i these findings include the local meteoric water line established during this study is similar to those for east hawaiʻi and east maui as well as the global meteoric water line it differs from the local meteoric water line established in the previous west hawai i study by fackrell et al 2020 combined vwa for replicated sites produce averages that better characterize the groundwater isotopic compositions observed in previous studies long term studies are needed to better understand the variations observed in the meteoric water lines spanning a near decade long sampling of these sites the δ 18o isotope elevation relationship established for west hawaiʻi is similar to the trade wind for low and mid elevations and high elevation relationships observed in east hawaiʻi depletion in vwa δ 18o is observed in sites within low annual rainfall areas less than 750 mm relative to the isotope elevation regression these sites possibly experience rainfall mainly during extratropical and subtropical storms which already have depleted δ 18o compositions enrichment in vwa δ 18o is observed for sites in the rain band which wraps around the southern tip of hawaiʻi island and flows up the leeward slopes of mauna loa and hualālai additional results provide insight into extreme events which can impact the chemical composition of precipitation these findings include during periods of low rainfall less than 250 mm as well as the 2018 kīlauea eruption all sites observed increased concentrations of sulfate and chloride precipitation at low and mid elevation sites remained low during the 2018 kīlauea eruption supporting previous research that an increase in aerosols decreases rainfall downwind of the volcano sulfate concentrations increased during the kīlauea eruption however chloride concentrations did not welch s t tests demonstrated a statistical difference only between sulfate concentrations observed during and after the eruption ended p 0 032 and no statistical difference between the rest of the samples this paper provides a foundation to follow on work including 1 incorporation of the data presented herein with new groundwater chemistry data in order to investigate the recharge zones interconnectivity and storage of west hawaiʻi aquifers and 2 analyses of the effects of seasalt aerosol deposition on ecological processes and water quality continued collection of bulk deposition particularly in the current quiet period of kīlauea volcano would aid in understanding the importance and impacts of volcanic emissions on rainfall rates and compositions multi decadal

8257,study region the study region comprises 25 lowland polish lakes in the northern part of the country the studied lakes provide domestic industrial and agricultural water supply and are major attractions for tourism thus playing a significant role in the polish economy study focus the expected impact of future climate change on lake surface water temperature lswt was predicted using the air2water model which relies solely on daily air temperature at as model input lswt and at observations for the period 1987 2016 were used for model calibration and validation then historical 1987 2005 and future 2006 2100 at time series from nine euro cordex climate models were used to project future lswt under emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 new hydrological insights for the region the results showed that air2water can well reproduce daily lwst with root mean square errors lower than 1 c on average the warming trends of both at and lswt are expected to be lower than those observed in the past decades after the 1980s and ice cover and weak stratification conditions are expected to partially buffer the lswt response to the high at warming expected in future winters however the overall enduring warming will substantially alter future thermal dynamics leading to a shortening of ice cover and inverse stratification periods possibly leading to serious consequences for lake water quality and ecosystem health keywords air temperature lake surface water temperature air2water climate models limnology euro cordex 1 introduction water temperature is a key variable controlling many physical and biochemical processes within water bodies including lentic environments such as ponds and lakes it controls vertical stratification thus affecting vertical exchanges of mass and

ecological processes such as metabolism and growth of organisms lürling et al 2013 in the past decades lake surface water temperature lswt in many lakes around the world underwent clear warming trends

productivity o reilly et al 2003 and increasing the expansion of harmful cyanobacteria paerl and paul 2012 posch et al 2012 mantzouki et al 2018 under this scenario the possible consequences on the ecosystem services of lakes are relevant primarily concerning future water use for drinking agricultural and industrial water supply fisheries management and recreational activities being able to assess the impact of climate warming on lake thermal dynamics can therefore offer a valuable support for designing an efficient and sustainable management of lakes using a long term view over the coming decades mathematical models can be successfully used to forecast lake water temperature under future climate scenarios in the past three decades due to the endeavor of the scientific community different types of models have been proposed and applied for lake water temperature forecasting generally these models can be divided into two main categories simple statistical models livingstone and lotter 1998 kettle et al 2004 czernecki and ptak 2018 zhu et al 2020a including artificial neural network models sharma et al 2008 liu and chen 2012 and more complex process based deterministic models based on laws of physics fang and stefan 1996 peeters et al 2002 perroud et al 2009 martynov et al 2010 weinberger and vetter 2012 thiery et al 2014 hetherington et al 2015 statistical models are simple to implement however their accuracies are generally lower compared with other models and their applicability is often restricted to the system and climatic conditions for which they are calibrated on the other hand process based deterministic models are accurate and can be more generalizable across different systems but they are complex and typically need a large number of input data such as lake morphology a complete set of meteorological data inflow and outflow conditions etc which make them impractical for regions with limited data a third category of models there exists which is in between deterministic and statistical models and that can be referred to as hybrid statistical physically based models these models need few inputs similarly to statistical models but their mathematical structure accounts for the main physical processes thus producing more reliable results a clear example is the hybrid air2water model piccolroaz et al 2013 piccolroaz 2016 which combines a physical derivation of the key equation with a stochastic calibration of parameters the model uses only at as input and has been proven to be a robust tool for lake water temperature prediction piccolroaz et al 2013 2015 piccolroaz 2016 javaheri et al 2016 schmid and köster 2016 flaim et al 2020 calamita et al 2021 and climate change assessment wood et al 2016 czernecki and ptak 2018 piccolroaz et al 2018 2020 also when applied to lakes with different morphological characteristics toffolon et al 2014 prats and danis 2019 zhu et al 2020b here we use the hybrid air2water model to investigate how the lowland lakes distributed in the northern part of poland are expected to respond to future climate change previous studies indicated that lswt in polish lakes rose significantly in the past decades based on available observations dąbrowski et al 2004 wrzesiński et al 2015 czernecki and ptak 2018 ptak et al 2018a 2018b 2019a however little attention has been payed to investigate the impact of climate change on lwst in these lakes and only one study is available on the topic czernecki and ptak 2018 where an empirical statistical downscaling model was used to assess the impact of global warming on lswt in 10 polish lakes this previous study limited the analysis to the projection of future lswt while it did not explore how changing lswt is expected to affect other lake processes such as ice cover formation and mixing regime in the present study we extend the analysis to 25 polish lowland lakes focusing on evaluating the lakes thermal sensitivity to climate change across the year through the analysis of long term trends of different variables and indicators including temperature anomaly trends ice cover duration and mixing patterns to this end we consider two future emission scenarios representative concentration pathways rcp the intermediate rcp4 5 and the most severe rcp8 5 scenarios the results of this study are expected to enrich the existing knowledge concerning lakes response to ongoing climate change to be used to inform policymakers and authorities in charge of the management of lakes in poland as well as to provide a possible reference for climate change studies in other regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and available data as a result of the impact of the last glaciation approximately 12 000 years ago the majority of lakes are distributed in the northern part of poland fig 1 where a transitional climate dominates moderate marine climate characterizes the western part and it gradually transitions into a continental climate towards the east in the present study 25 lowland polish lakes were studied fig 1 these lakes play a significant role in various aspects of economic development in poland as they provide domestic industrial and agricultural water supply and are major attractions for tourism the main morphological characteristics of the study lakes are summarized in table 1 which shows that the considered lakes span relatively different morphological ranges the mean water depth ranges from 1 3 m to 15 5 m and the lake area varies between 1 545 km2 and 114 88 km2 daily lswt and at data were used for these lakes daily lswt is measured at a water depth of 0 4 m below water surface or ice cover when present at 7 or 8 a m local time by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute water temperature was measured at the shore by means of well scoop thermometers for each lake daily at data were obtained from the nearest meteorological station fig 1 and table 1 for 21 lakes observed data were available for 30 years 1987 2016 while for the other four lakes including sławskie lubie roś and wigry observed data were available for 28 years 1987 2014 finally data on the duration of the ice cover period for all lakes except for lake bachotek were provided in reference to earlier studies choiński et al 2015 wrzesiński et al 2015 ptak et al 2019b 2020 based on monitoring of ice phenomena conducted by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute ice cover start and end dates are defined as the first and last dates when the lake is completely ice covered 2 2 air2water model the air2water model is a parsimonious model for lswt prediction which uses only at as external forcing piccolroaz et al 2013 piccolroaz 2016 due to its simplicity and high accuracy it has been widely used for lswt predictions in many lakes worldwide toffolon et al 2014 piccolroaz et al 2015 2018 2020 javaheri et al 2016 schmid and köster 2016 czernecki and ptak 2018 prats and danis 2019 flaim et al 2020 piccolroaz et al 2020 zhu et al 2020b calamita et al 2021 when tested using different at datasets in situ gridded and modeling data the model has been shown to produce consistent lswt projections irrespective of the at dataset used to drive the model piccolroaz et al 2018 in fact air2water is a data driven model where the value of the calibrating parameters are derived from observations this makes the model highly versatile and its successful use possible even when using coarse gridded datasets with resolution larger than 0 5 1 piccolroaz et al 2018 the air2water model is based on the volume integrated heat balance of the surface mixed layer of the lake through simple linearization of the heat flux terms using taylor expansion piccolroaz et al 2013 and using at as a proxy for the integrated effect of the relevant processes and fluxes livingstone and padisák 2007 the volume integrated heat balance equation reduces to a simple ordinary differential equation depending on at lswt and a number of parameters summarizing the main climatic and thermo physical properties of the lake piccolroaz et al 2013 piccolroaz 2016 in this study we used the 6 parameter version of the model which recently has been successfully applied by piccolroaz et al 2020 in a global reconstruction of twentieth century lswt this global application showed good performance for lakes located in snow and polar climate regions thus motivating the use of this version of the model for the present climate change study the air2water model in its 6 parameter version reads as follows 1 d t w d t 1 δ a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w a 5 c o s 2 π t t y a 6 2 δ exp t w t h a 4 for t w t h 1 for t w t h where t is time expressed in days ty is the duration of the year in days tw is lswt ta is at th is a reference value for the deep lake temperature δ is a dimensionless term representing the ratio between the volume of the surface lake layer and a reference volume and a1 a6 are model parameters resulting from linearization of the heat flux terms see piccolroaz et al 2013 and piccolroaz 2016 for details the dimensionless depth δ is a time varying term that quantifies thermal stratification through the difference between surface and deep water temperatures according to the empirical relationship in eq 2 δ ranges from 0 to 1 with values decreasing for increasing temperature difference i e thermal stratification and δ approaching 1 when the lake is well mixed i e when tw th the value of th is fixed to 4 c for dimictic lakes i e lakes that mix completely twice each year and to the minimum or maximum annual lswt for warm and cold monomictic lakes i e lakes that mix completely once each year respectively the inclusion of lake stratification through δ is the key term that distinguishes air2water from traditional statistical models and that has been proven to be crucial to satisfactorily predict lswt dynamics eq 1 was solved with a daily time step using the crank nicolson method and considering a lower bound of lswt at 0 c the model parameters were calibrated using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm see kennedy and eberhart 1995 using the observed lswt data to infer the parameters value the pso is an evolutionary self adaptive search optimization technique inspired by animal social behavior this method is based on an iterative procedure that explores the hyperspace of parameters to converge to the set of parameters that minimizes the error between simulated and observed data in this case lswt detailed descriptions of the air2water model can be found in piccolroaz et al 2013 and piccolroaz 2016 the model was calibrated for each lake using daily at data measured at the nearest meteorological station fig 1 and table 1 as model input and observed lswt as reference time series for computing model performance model performance was evaluated using the following three metrics according to other water temperature prediction studies e g piccolroaz et al 2018 graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2020b nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae 3 n s e 1 i 1 n t m i t o i 2 i 1 n t o i t o 2 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n t m i t o i 2 5 m a e 1 n i 1 n t m i t o i where n is the number of samples i e daily averages to i and tm i are the observed and modeled daily water temperature values at time i and t o is the average value of t o model calibration and validation was performed using the historical at and lswt observational dataset 1987 2016 the available times series were divided into two subsets 2 3 of the time series for model calibration and the remaining 1 3 for model validation the above metrics of model performance were evaluated for each lake and for both calibration and validation periods separately a shorter validation period was preferred in favor of a more robust calibration of model parameters because the validity of air2water has already been demonstrated in several previous applications in this regard we refer to piccolroaz 2016 for details about the model performance with different ratios between the number of data in calibration and validation model validation years were sampled every third year of the time series thus allowing to evenly distribute calibration and validation years over the study period in this way possible long term warming trends are included in the model calibration making the optimization of the model parameters more robust 2 3 future climate data historical 1987 2005 and projected 2006 2100 at data relative to the intermediate rcp4 5 and high rcp8 5 emission scenarios were obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex www cordex org an international coordinated effort under the auspices of the world climate research programme specifically cordex provides a collection of high resolution regional climate simulations for different domains around the world by dynamically downscaling the outputs of general circulation models gcms using regional climate models rcms regional downscaling plays an important role for the accurate assessment of local impacts and effective definition of regional adaptation plans indeed while gcms provide projections of how the climate may change in the future at the global scale rcms use these projections to provide information with greater detail and on smaller spatial scales in the present study simulations for the european domain euro cordex https euro cordex net at the spatial resolution of 0 44 degree eur 44 50 km were downloaded from the earth system grid federation esgf node hosted by the german climate computing centre dkrz https esgf data dkrz de projects esgf dkrz the euro cordex ensemble available for the emission scenarios and periods considered in this study consists of the nine different gcm rcm combinations summarized in table 2 that is all the available combinations relative to ensemble r1i1p1 and downscaling realization v1 other emission scenarios were not considered since these would have drastically reduced the number of gcm rcm combinations contemporaneously available for all the emission scenarios despite the high grid resolution of the eur 44 cordex product possible biases remain due to epistemic and parametric errors which suggests the need to further adjust rcms outputs christensen et al 2008 notwithstanding previous studies demonstrated good performance of cordex products for limnological applications mailhot et al 2019 shatwell et al 2019 musie et al 2020 and for climate change studies in poland romanowicz et al 2016 mezghani et al 2017 piniewski et al 2017 in order to account for the possible under representation of at from the climate models the change factor method diaz nieto and wilby 2005 minville et al 2008 was used to downscale the future at scenarios this downscaling method allows for adjusting future projections of a climate variable for which in situ observations are available during a historical period h by simply adding projected changes in such climate variable relative to the same baseline period h to the historical in situ observed climatological year hence for each lake and for the generic climate model and emission scenario we extracted the modeled at t a m o d from the grid cell containing the barycenter of that lake and we computed the adjusted at time series in the year y t a y as follows 6 t a y t a h t a m o d y t a m o d h where t a m o d y is the predicted daily at time series in the year y for the given climate model and emission scenario and t a h and t a m o d h are the observed i e at the nearest meteorological station to the lake see table 1 and modeled climatological mean annual cycles on daily basis for the same historical period h respectively in the present case y spans the period 2006 2100 i e when climate models projections are available and the reference historical period h is 1987 2005 i e the period covered by both observed and historical climate models outputs we note that by construction this approach is fully consistent with running the future climate scenarios using the model parameter values obtained for each lake from calibrating the model with the historical at data measured at the corresponding meteorological station see table 1 the expected long term variations of at and lakes thermal behavior were analyzed in terms of anomalies a standard and consolidated practice in climate change studies e g luterbacher et al 2004 hansen et al 2012 while the international standard is to use a baseline period of 30 years for calculating anomalies due to data limitation and for the sake of consistency the anomalies were evaluated comparing air2water projections under future scenarios with air2water simulations obtained using at from climate models historical runs i e 1987 2005 without loss of generality anomalies were calculated for each lake separately and to emphasize the inter lake variability of lswt expected for polish lakes in the next century the temperature anomalies were averaged across the different gcm rcm combinations multi model average while keeping the variability among the lakes this choice was motivated by the wish to provide a combined and synthesized overview of the results making it easily accessible also to policymakers and a non scientific audience for the sake of completeness the full modeling outputs file air2water results 7z and the future annual and seasonal trends of at and lswt for all the gcm rcm combinations tables s1 s5 are available in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 model performance for the historical period table 3 summarizes the optimal values of the model parameters a1 a6 along with the metrics of model performance which we recall were calculated based on daily lswt values for each lake separately in the calibration period nse values varied between 0 958 and 0 993 among the 25 lakes with an average value of 0 982 rmse values varied between 0 78 c and 1 50 c with an average value of 0 99 c mae values varied between 0 62 c and 1 12 c with an average value of 0 76 c in the validation period nse values ranged from 0 952 to 0 992 average value 0 982 rmse values ranged from 0 71 c to 1 59 c average value 0 99 c mae values ranged from 0 55 c to 1 17 c average value 0 76 c in both the model calibration and validation periods nse values for all the lakes were close to unity and in any case larger than 0 950 indicating high performance of the air2water model i e small residual variance compared to the observed data variance in addition both rmse and mae were lower than 1 00 c on average and did not show meaningful differences between calibration and validation periods indicating robust identification of model parameters and overall good accuracy of the predicted lswt values the results of the model performance are graphically summarized in fig 2 which shows the heat map scatter plot between observed and simulated daily lswt in the calibration and validation periods for all the lakes together all the points are well aligned along the 1 1 line with low dispersion as indicated by the heat map color and with absence of any visible bias depending on lwst only a minor systematic deviation is recognizable for lower lswt i e lower than about 2 c where the model slightly underestimates observations 3 2 long term trends and lakes thermal sensitivity to climate change lake surface water temperatures in the future scenarios were projected using the calibrated air2water model for each lake in this section we provide an analysis of the results in terms of mean annual and seasonal at and lswt trends and we use the model s output to characterize lakes thermal sensitivity to climate change table s1 summarizes the warming rates c per decade of the projected mean annual at and lswt for

follows jfm january february march winter amj april may june spring jas july august september summer ond october november december autumn as commented above in the following analysis we averaged the at and lswt trends from the nine gcm rcm combinations obtaining a representative and compact overview of the expected long term trends while the trends for each lake and climate model are available in

c per decade for the scenario rcp8 5 with the warming rates of ats varying between 0 34 c per decade and 0 86 c per decade average value 0 54 c per decade lswt is expected to warm by 0 35 c per decade

rates of ats varying between 0 35 c per decade and 0 58 c per decade average value 0 44 c per decade lswt is expected to warm by 0 30 c per decade range 0 21 0 39 c per decade overall the projected warming rates of lswt are lower than those of at for the mean annual and the four seasons tables s1 s5 although in spring lswt in some lakes is projected to warm at similar or higher rates than at table s3 for both scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the highest warming rates of lswt are obtained in spring amj followed by winter jfm while the seasons with the lowest lswt warming rates are summer jas and fall ond boxplots summarizing at and lswt long term trends at monthly scale for all lakes are presented in fig 3 panels a b d and e the analysis of the single months confirms the seasonal long term lswt trends discussed above the shape of the monthly at warming rates between the two emission scenarios is overall similar except that in the rcp4 5 scenario the minimum at warming trend is expected in august while in the rcp8 5 scenario in may the effect on the resulting lswt trends is the absence of a second warming peak in late summer under the rcp4 5 scenario which on the contrary is expected under the rcp8 5 scenario more important the intra annual distribution of monthly lswt warming rates is substantially different compared to that of the driving at warming rates fig 3 panels b and c vs panels a and b this is primarily motivated by the seasonality of lakes stratification that determines lakes thermal inertia and hence together with ice dynamics shapes the lswt response to changes in at piccolroaz et al 2015 zhong et al 2016 shatwell et al 2019 in particular while at in winter months from january to march shows the highest warming trends a contextual marked lswt response is not evident as a consequence of the weak stratification hence large thermal inertia and insulating effect of the ice cover when present see also fig 8 and the discussion section the combination of these two factors makes the lakes less thermally sensitive in this period of the year according to piccolroaz et al 2020 lake thermal sensitivity to changes in at was evaluated for each lake as the slope of the regression line without intercept between lswt and at monthly anomalies evaluated relative to the reference period 1987 2005 and is shown in fig 3c and f this metric summarizes the reactivity of lswt to changes in at and clearly indicates low thermal sensitivity resiliency values 0 6 of lakes in winter jfm and autumn ond compared to a larger thermal sensitivity values 0 8 in spring and summer the time series of at and lswt mean annual anomalies relative to the reference period 1987 2005 are presented in fig 4 for both the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the at warming predicted for the next century is expected to be followed by a contextual progressive warming of lswt although lswt is expected to warm less than at in both scenarios the lswt long term trends being 72 and 76 of the at long term trends under scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively 3 3 the impact of climate change on lswt extremes mixing regime and ice cover in this section the projected lswt are analyzed to gather insights into how lakes thermal dynamics are expected to be impacted by future warming for each lake we identified the 50th 90th and 99th percentiles of lswt during the reference period 1987 2005 and evaluated how the number of days in a year with lswt above these reference thresholds is expected to change in the future the first percentile is the median of annual lswt thus is the value of lswt that has been exceeded half of the time during the reference period while statistical thresholds ranging from 90th to 99th percentiles are typically used to define extreme conditions mcphillips et al 2018 the expected anomalies trends averaged across lakes are shown in figs 5 and 6 for the 50th and 99th percentiles respectively for the sake of conciseness the results for the 90th percentile are not shown but only commented below while the lswt values associated to the two percentiles are lake dependent figs 5a and 6 a the future trends are coherent the variability i e confidence band across lakes is relatively small and a progressive increase of the number of days with lswt above these thresholds is evident for both percentiles the expected trends are comparable between the two scenarios until around 2050 while afterwards the rcp8 5 scenario is characterized by faster trends according to the stronger at warming in the second half of the century relative to the rcp4 5 scenario see e g fig 4 as a consequence in the last decade of the century we expect that under the rcp4 5 scenario the number of days per year with lswt warmer than the current median value will increase by 17 2 days i e 9 1 versus an increase of 35 5 days i e 19 2 under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 5 more relevant for the aquatic ecosystem and from a water resources perspective the number of days per year with lswt warmer than what nowadays can be defined an extreme event i e the 99th percentile is expected to increase by 9 1 days i e 235 41 and 21 4 days i e 582 98 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively when considering the number of days above the 90th percentile of lswt during the reference period they are expected to increase by 25 3 days i e 67 8 and 48 4 days i e 130 8 respectively under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios by the end of the century all the lakes considered in the analysis are dimictic meaning that lswt crosses the temperature of maximum density equal to about 4 c at atmospheric pressure two times per year in spring when lakes stratify and in fall when they mix before inverse stratification in winter accordingly we defined the winter inverse stratification period as the period when lswt is colder than 4 c mccormick 1990 and evaluated how the number of days characterized by inverse stratification conditions will change in the future the anomalies relative to past 1987 2005 conditions when inverse stratification was 121 5 days per year on average are shown in fig 7 for both scenarios the number of days with lswt below 4 c present clear decreasing trends indicating a progressive shortening of the inverse stratification period hence a contextual lengthening of summer stratification on average winter inverse stratification is expected to be 37 4 days i e 31 4 and 64 10 days i e 53 11 shorter in the last decade of the 21st century relative to current conditions under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively finally results allowed for the projection of how the number of annual ice covered days will change in the future here the number of ice cover days were defined as the days with lswt 1 5 c to account for both the fact that lswt in winter was measured below ice and for model limitations in simulating the ice cover further hampered by the use of at from historical climate models runs which provided a rmse between simulated and observed ice cover duration of 13 days during the reference historical period 1987 2005 the comparison between observed and modelled ice cover duration is provided in fig 8 which also shows the projected future trends for the decades 2040 2050 and 2090 2100 while under current conditions all lakes are ice covered in winter under the rcp4 5 scenario the ice cover period will reduce by 22 2 by middle of the century and by 60 12 by the end of the century with a long term trend of 3 7 1 days per decade the projected shortening of the ice cover period is more severe under the rcp8 5 scenario with the number of ice cover days reducing by 36 7 by middle of the century and by 86 7 by the end of the century with a long term trend of 6 7 1 days per decade that is expected to significantly shorten the ice cover period in most of the lakes by the end of the century 10 7 days per year in the last decade of the 21st century to be compared to 68 16 days per year under reference conditions 4 discussion 4 1 model performance and limitations the only input data required by the air2water model is at assumed as reasonable proxy for the overall external forcing livingstone and padisák 2007 although this is certainly a simplification the model explicitly includes the effect of the thermal inertia and of the stratification of the lake through the dependence on lswt in eq 1 and the well mixed layer thickness defined in eq 2 respectively in addition the contributions to the heat budget that are not directly dependent on at and lswt such as solar radiation wind speed air humidity etc are at least partially summarized by the sinusoidal term in eq 1 in this way the air2water model shares the same simplicity and parsimony of statistical models but its physically based derivation ensures high performance comparable to that of more complex deterministic models toffolon et al 2014 piccolroaz 2016 indeed the good performance and reliable predictions found in previous applications of the air2water model have also been confirmed in the present study where we obtained daily rmse and mae lower than 1 c on average both in calibration and in validation the results evidenced absence of any systematic bias between simulated and observed lswt except for a slight model underestimation around the lowest values of lswt in winter fig 2 in this respect it should be noted that the observed lswt only rarely approaches 0 c due to sampling 0 4 m below ice cover in winter while a lower bound at 0 c was used in the air2water model in absence of any better estimate from the available data notwithstanding the overall model performance is high and the lack of precise information on the timing of ice cover from the available lswt observations since measurements are taken 0 4 m below ice cover did not preclude from identifying the duration of the ice cover period with reasonable accuracy fig 8 indeed the rmse is 13 days corresponding to 19 of the mean ice cover duration across lakes under current conditions and smaller than the corresponding average standard deviation equal to 30 days while the error in the duration of the ice cover period could have been reduced by considering lake specific lswt thresholds for the sake of simplicity we preferred to consider a fixed 1 5 c threshold larger than 0 c for the reason discussed above for all lakes which still provided estimated ice cover duration always within the confidence band of observations in addition the use of a fixed threshold allowed to identify an interesting clustering between lakes in the eastern and western part of poland the performance for lakes in the eastern zone ids 12 25 average rmse 9 days is higher than for lakes in the western side of poland ids 1 10 average rmse 17 days the evident division into two zones reflects the features of transitional climate in the analyzed region according to woś 2010 the western part is under the influence of marine warmer and more humid climate and the eastern part is dominated by continental dry and colder climate the ice cover is therefore more dynamic and less persistent in the western region hampering its precise prediction in the lakes located in this part of the country this pattern is confirmed by the decrease in ice cover thickness and increase in ice cover duration observed when moving from east to west choiński et al 2015 thus further explaining the higher rmse values found in the western side of poland despite the overall good performance and reasonable model errors obtained in the present application of the air2water model still the results are inevitably affected by some uncertainties and limitations the absence of a physically based ice module in the air2water model is certainly the first main limitation of the present application a dedicated ice module is currently under development and will be available soon second the use of only one lake model limits the representation of plausible future lake temperature scenarios and may bias the results due to the unavoidable epistemic uncertainty expanding the present lswt projections by using an ensemble of deterministic lake models is certainly advisable in a further development of the present study in this regard we do not advise the use of purely statistical models as they are deemed controversial in climate change applications piccolroaz et al 2018 2020 finally here we averaged the results obtained by applying the air2water model with at from nine different gcm rcm combinations the drawbacks of considering multi model averages have been commented in recent literature knutti et al 2010 madsen et al 2017 and this may bias some analyses aimed at investigating the variability of extreme values however multi model averages are still largely used in the literature e g knutti and sedláček 2013 and in reports by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ipcc stocker et al 2013 as they have the advantage of providing a combined and synthesized overview of the results accessible also to a non scientific audience while here we preferred to push on the easy accessibility of the results to a larger audience we suggest that further research efforts should be spent on properly quantifying the uncertainty stemming from the use of multiple climate and lake models in this regard tables s1 s5 suggest that the variance of at and lswt future trends across the nine gcm rcm combinations may be relevant for example when the mean annual trends are concerned table s1 the coefficient of variation i e the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean relative to the nine gcm rcm combinations averaged across the 25 lakes is 27 and 29 for at and lswt respectively under the rcp4 5 scenario and it is 16 and 17 for at and lswt respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario these averaged values increase to a maximum of 47 for at and 46 for lswt when summer trends are considered under the rcp4 5 scenario with peaks up to 59 for at in some lakes table s4 in general inter model variability increases moving from lakes located in the western warmer and more humid zone to lakes located in the eastern colder and dry zone of poland tables s1 s5 4 2 future trends and lakes thermal sensitivity lakes thermal sensitivity to changes in at has been found to be highly variable throughout the year with spring and summer months being the most responsive to changes in at fig 3 confirming previous studies based on historical observations in other lakes winslow et al 2017 woolway et al 2017 toffolon et al 2020 in particular we found thermal sensitivity values equal to 0 70 for annual means and between 0 70 0 90 in spring and summer coherently with studies of lake surface heat budgets schmid et al 2014 on the other hand lower thermal sensitivity values 0 6 has been found for winter and autumn due to the weaker absent thermal stratification thus higher thermal inertia and insulating effect of the ice cover when present we recall that the concept of lake thermal sensitivity used here is an indicator of the sensitivity of lswt to changes in at and should not be confused with a measure of the ratio between lswt and at long term warming trends in this regard previous studies of other lakes around the world austin and colman 2008 o reilly et al 2015 piccolroaz et al 2015 and in europe woolway et al 2017 found that lswt warming can be faster than that of at especially in summer and for deep and cold lakes o reilly et al 2015 woolway and merchant 2017 different explanations have been proposed for this amplified response of lswt to at including changes in the timing of lake stratification austin and colman 2007 piccolroaz et al 2015 zhong et al 2016 changes in large scale climatic forcing such as solar radiation fink et al 2014 variation of lake clarity rose et al 2016 timing and duration of the ice cover austin and colman 2007 o reilly et al 2016 but also the methodological approach and averaged indicators used in the data analysis toffolon et al 2020 the results of the present study showed that lswt will warm at lower rates than at in the future in all the investigated lakes and under both scenarios warming at 72 and 76 than at on average for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 4 coherently with previous modeling studies in other lakes e g butcher et al 2015 czernecki and ptak 2018 shatwell et al 2019 the projected warming trends at both monthly and annual time scales throughout the 21st century are in agreement with projections for some lakes in north eastern germany obtained using the lake model flake under the rcp4 5 scenario shatwell et al 2019 specifically in both cases the modeling projections suggest that the study lakes will warm predominantly in spring and winter determining a shortening of inverse stratification and ice cover periods and to a lower extent in summer and autumn as a consequence of the seasonal pattern of at trends expected in the future fig 3 the results are coherent also with previous estimates obtained for some of the study lakes by czernecki and ptak 2018 using an empirical statistical model for lswt which projected similar annual lswt trends and lower warming rates of lswt compared to at however when looking at the seasonal pattern of the expected warming rates the results by czernecki and ptak 2018 do not agree with what shown in the present study and in shatwell et al 2019 for the contiguous german lakes the reason is likely attributable to the coarser resolution of gcms projections used in that previous study ranging between 0 5 and 4 then linearly interpolated at 0 25 which is expected to introduce larger inaccuracies especially in the regions at the border between sea and land where most of the study lakes are located when comparing the future warming trends fig 3 with those observed in the recent period for which lswt observations are available 1987 2016 fig 9 interesting considerations can be drawn the mean annual lswt warming rate expected under scenario rcp4 5 0 15 c per decade will be lower than what observed in the period 1987 2016 0 44 c per decade according to a milder warming of at expected for this scenario 0 21 c per decade compared to past at observations 0 34 c per decade higher lswt warming 0 34 c per decade is expected under the rcp8 5 scenario due to larger at warming 0 44 c per decade but still the projected lswt warming trend is expected to be lower than that observed in recent decades the large warming observed in 1987 2016 is coherent with the substantial lswt warming occurred since the 1980s worldwide piccolroaz et al 2020 including europe woolway et al 2017 as a consequence of an abrupt shift in the climate during this period the observed lswt trend was larger than that of at consistently with what observed in similar studies woolway et al 2017 czernecki and ptak 2018 this condition is not expected in the future primarily because of a seasonal shift in the at warming patterns relative to past conditions indeed the largest at warming is expected in the winter months both scenarios particularly in january and february fig 3a and d compared to past conditions when it was occurring during the rest of the year fig 9a the future at warming is therefore not expected to be followed by an equally intense lswt warming since in the winter period the insulating effect of the ice cover and the large thermal inertia due to weak stratification reduce lakes thermal sensitivity figs 3c and f and 9 c and hence inhibit the lswt response to warming at fig 3b and e in general the different pattern of future at warming trends compared to past conditions fig 3a and d vs fig 3a is expected to alter the seasonal pattern of lakes thermal sensitivity fig 3c f vs fig 9c through changing stratification and ice cover timing and duration for example under the rcp8 5 scenario the substantial shortening of the ice cover and inverse stratification periods figs 7 and 8 is expected to progressively increase the lakes thermal sensitivity in the winter period fig 3f related to this the projected shortening of the ice cover duration under the rcp8 5 scenario 6 7 1 days per decade is expected to be larger than that observed in the period 1961 2010 by choiński et al 2015 and quantified in 5 6 days per decade finally while under both scenarios no lakes are projected to undergo a regime shift from dimictic to warm monomictic i e lakes mixing once per year fig 7 under the more severe rcp8 5 scenario the projected halving of the number of days with lswt staying below 4 c relative to reference conditions suggests that this scenario may lead to serious consequences for the water quality and ecosystem health of these lakes 4 3 implications for management and conservation plans the generally warmer lswt and shortening of inverse stratification and ice cover periods projected under both scenarios are likely to have serious consequences for the aquatic life and water quality of the analyzed lakes jeopardizing their ecological health and use as water resources tilzer and goldman 1978 coloso et al 2011 leach et al 2018 as an example water temperature changes in the future may affect many fish species especially with respect to their spatio temporal distribution patterns pandit et al 2017 and with particular concern for cold water habitats williams et al 2015 this is particularly true in light of the projected tendency of climate change towards shorter ice cover periods fig 8 and intensification of high lswt values fig 6 in the future these aspects should be carefully considered in medium to long term management and conservation plans of these lowland polish lakes as ignoring the rate of climatic change could result in ineffective restoration plans lin et al 2017 being able to design effective management and conservation plans is particularly relevant for the study lakes given their strategic importance in many areas of the economy in northern poland tourism agriculture industry in this regard the results of the present study are expected to provide an useful support for local policymakers and authorities in charge of the management of these lakes in compliance with the water quality objectives set by the eu water framework directive 2000 60 ec besides presenting an overview of the expected impact of climate change on lswt ice cover and mixing dynamics for several lowland lakes in poland the present analysis is also aimed at being used as a reference for identifying the most vulnerable lakes where detailed studies should be focused similarly the availability of climate change projections of lakes thermal evolution are expected to be useful for prioritizing the numerous local level restoration projects aimed at preserving and improving the water quality of these lakes łopata et al 2013 gołdyn et al 2014 dondajewska et al 2018 kowalczewska madura et al 2018 grochowska et al 2019 supporting the continuity of lake restoration programs in the future years and helping to revise the undertaken and planned lake management projects in order to make them more effective finally the outcome of the present study is also expected to be useful for ongoing governmental programmes among others the plan of counteracting effects of droughts aimed at facing the ongoing and forecasted water deficit this is expected to become an increasing problem in poland where the country s water resources per inhabitant are among the lowest in europe nowak and ptak 2018 one of the strategies to address this problem is the damming of existent lakes reducing the outflows and increasing the available water resource while this operation if realized is expected to further affect the lakes thermal and mixing dynamics knowing the expected impact of climate change on the existing lakes is a fundamental pre requisite for designing any future management plan going in this direction 5 conclusions in this study the air2water model was employed to forecast lswt in 25 lowland lakes in poland under two future emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projected at time series from nine different gcm rcm combinations provided by eur 44 cordex spatial resolution 0 44 were used as model input to evaluate the impact of climate change on lswt ice cover and mixing patterns the analysis of results in terms of future 2006 2100 anomalies and long term trends compared to past 1987 2005 conditions lead to the following conclusions 1 the air2water model performed well for lswt forecasting for all the lakes with average values of nse rmse and mae are 0 982 0 99 c and 0 76 c in model calibration and validation no systematic biases were introduced by the model expect for a slight underestimation at low i e close to 0 c temperatures which however is attributable to the fact that in winter water temperature measurements are taken 0 4 m below the ice cover hence are always slightly warmer than 0 c used as lower lswt threshold in the model 2 the warming trends of both at and lswt projected under the future scenarios are expected to be lower than those observed in past decades 1987 2016 and with a different timing throughout the year as a result of different at and in turn thermal stratification patterns particularly at is expected to warm the most in the winter period while in the past decades the larger warming occurred during the rest of the year 3 seasonal and monthly analysis showed that lswt is expected to warm slower than at throughout the 21st century i e lswt long term trends being 72 and 76 than the corresponding at trends for scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the mean annual lswt is expected to warm up to 0 15 c per decade and 0 34 c per decade under scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively on average across all lakes in both cases spring amj will be the season with the highest lswt warming 0 21 c per decade and 0 36 c per decade for the two scenarios respectively while fall ond will be the season with the lower warming trend 0 11 c per decade and 0 30 c per decade for the two scenarios respectively 4 the at warming expected in winter months will contribute to shortening the inverse stratification and ice cover periods particularly under the rcp8 5 scenario that if realized could seriously threaten lakes mixing regime and the existence of the ice cover period with at warming projected for this scenario inverse stratification is expected to reduce by 53 11 64 10 days and the ice cover period by 86 7 6 7 1 days per decade by the end of the 21st century on average for the milder rcp4 5 scenarios the expected shortening of inverse stratification is quantified in 31 4 37 4 days and that of the ice cover period in 60 12 3 7 1 days per decade by the end of the 21st century on average 5 the low thermal sensitivity of lakes in winter due to the insulating effect of the ice cover and large thermal inertia associated with weak stratification conditions is expected to partially buffer the lswt response to at warming 6 all lakes are expected to undergo significant warming especially in the high range of lswt with a substantial increase in the number of days with lswt above thresholds that nowadays can be defined as extreme events i e 90th and 99th percentile for example the number of days per year with lswt above the 99th percentile calculated for the reference period are expected to increase by 9 1 days i e 235 41 and 21 4 days i e 582 98 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively though the air2water model performed well it does not explicitly account for the effects of external forcing other than at such as solar radiation wind speed and air humidity we therefore suggest that as a further step some efforts should be spent in validating the lakes thermal dynamics projections presented here complementing the present future projections with results from more sophisticated deterministic models notwithstanding the results presented in this study provide useful insights about the future thermal dynamics of lowland lakes in poland which are expected to be beneficial for policymakers and

8257,study region the study region comprises 25 lowland polish lakes in the northern part of the country the studied lakes provide domestic industrial and agricultural water supply and are major attractions for tourism thus playing a significant role in the polish economy study focus the expected impact of future climate change on lake surface water temperature lswt was predicted using the air2water model which relies solely on daily air temperature at as model input lswt and at observations for the period 1987 2016 were used for model calibration and validation then historical 1987 2005 and future 2006 2100 at time series from nine euro cordex climate models were used to project future lswt under emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 new hydrological insights for the region the results showed that air2water can well reproduce daily lwst with root mean square errors lower than 1 c on average the warming trends of both at and lswt are expected to be lower than those observed in the past decades after the 1980s and ice cover and weak stratification conditions are expected to partially buffer the lswt response to the high at warming expected in future winters however the overall enduring warming will substantially alter future thermal dynamics leading to a shortening of ice cover and inverse stratification periods possibly leading to serious consequences for lake

ecosystem services of lakes are relevant primarily concerning future water use for drinking agricultural and industrial water supply fisheries management and recreational activities being able to assess the impact of climate warming on lake thermal dynamics can therefore offer a valuable support for designing an efficient and sustainable management of lakes using a long term view over the coming decades mathematical models can be successfully used to forecast lake water temperature under future climate scenarios in the past three decades due to the endeavor of the scientific community different types of models have been proposed and applied for lake water temperature forecasting generally these models can be divided into two main categories simple statistical models livingstone and lotter 1998 kettle et al 2004 czernecki and ptak 2018 zhu et al 2020a including artificial neural network models sharma et al 2008 liu and chen 2012 and more complex process based deterministic models based on laws of physics fang and stefan 1996 peeters et al 2002 perroud et al 2009 martynov et al 2010 weinberger and vetter 2012 thiery et al 2014 hetherington et al 2015 statistical models are simple to implement however their accuracies are generally lower compared with other models and their applicability is often restricted to the system and climatic conditions for which they are calibrated on the other hand process based deterministic models are accurate and can be more generalizable across different systems but they are complex and typically need a large number of input data such as lake morphology a complete set of meteorological data inflow and outflow conditions etc which make them impractical for regions with limited data a third category of models there exists which is in between deterministic and statistical models and that can be referred to as hybrid statistical physically based models these models need few inputs similarly to statistical models but their mathematical structure accounts for the main physical processes thus producing more reliable results a clear example is the hybrid air2water model piccolroaz et al 2013 piccolroaz 2016 which combines a physical derivation of the key equation with a stochastic calibration of parameters the model uses only at as input and has been proven to be a robust tool for lake water temperature prediction piccolroaz et al 2013 2015 piccolroaz 2016 javaheri et al 2016 schmid and köster 2016 flaim et al 2020 calamita et al 2021 and climate change assessment wood et al 2016 czernecki and ptak 2018 piccolroaz et al 2018 2020 also when applied to lakes with different morphological characteristics toffolon et al 2014 prats and danis 2019 zhu et al 2020b here we use the hybrid air2water model to investigate how the lowland lakes distributed in the northern part of poland are expected to respond to future climate change previous studies indicated that lswt in polish lakes rose significantly in the past decades based on available observations dąbrowski et al 2004 wrzesiński et al 2015 czernecki and ptak 2018 ptak et al 2018a 2018b 2019a however little attention has been payed to investigate the impact of climate change on lwst in these lakes and only one study is available on the topic czernecki and ptak 2018 where an empirical statistical downscaling model was used to assess the impact of global warming on lswt in 10 polish lakes this previous study limited the analysis to the projection of future lswt while it did not explore how changing lswt is expected to affect other lake processes such as ice cover formation and mixing regime in the present study we extend the analysis to 25 polish lowland lakes focusing on evaluating the lakes thermal sensitivity to climate change across the year through the analysis of long term trends of different variables and indicators including temperature anomaly trends ice cover duration and mixing patterns to this end we consider two future emission scenarios representative concentration pathways rcp the intermediate rcp4 5 and the most severe rcp8 5 scenarios the results of this study are expected to enrich the existing knowledge concerning lakes response to ongoing climate change to be used to inform policymakers and authorities in charge of the management of lakes in poland as well as to provide a possible reference for climate change studies in other regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and available data as a result of the impact of the last glaciation approximately 12 000 years ago the majority of lakes are distributed in the northern part of poland fig 1 where a transitional climate dominates moderate marine climate characterizes the western part and it gradually transitions into a continental climate towards the east in the present study 25 lowland polish lakes were studied fig 1 these lakes play a significant role in various aspects of economic development in poland as they provide domestic industrial and agricultural water supply and are major attractions for tourism the main morphological characteristics of the study lakes are summarized in table 1 which shows that the considered lakes span relatively different morphological ranges the mean water depth ranges from 1 3 m to 15 5 m and the lake area varies between 1 545 km2 and 114 88 km2 daily lswt and at data were used for these lakes daily lswt is measured at a water depth of 0 4 m below water surface or ice cover when present at 7 or 8 a m local time by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute water temperature was measured at the shore by means of well scoop thermometers for each lake daily at data were obtained from the nearest meteorological station fig 1 and table 1 for 21 lakes observed data were available for 30 years 1987 2016 while for the other four lakes including sławskie lubie roś and wigry observed data were available for 28 years 1987 2014 finally data on the duration of the ice cover period for all lakes except for lake bachotek were provided in reference to earlier studies choiński et al 2015 wrzesiński et al 2015 ptak et al 2019b 2020 based on monitoring of ice phenomena conducted by the institute of meteorology and water management national research institute ice cover start and end dates are defined as the first and last dates when the lake is completely ice covered 2 2 air2water model the air2water model is a parsimonious model for lswt prediction which uses only at as external forcing piccolroaz et al 2013 piccolroaz 2016 due to its simplicity and high accuracy it has been widely used for lswt predictions in many lakes worldwide toffolon et al 2014 piccolroaz et al 2015 2018 2020 javaheri et al 2016 schmid and köster 2016 czernecki and ptak 2018 prats and danis 2019 flaim et al 2020 piccolroaz et al 2020 zhu et al 2020b calamita et al 2021 when tested using different at datasets in situ gridded and modeling data the model has been shown to produce consistent lswt projections irrespective of the at dataset used to drive the model piccolroaz et al 2018 in fact air2water is a data driven model where the value of the calibrating parameters are derived from observations this makes the model highly versatile and its successful use possible even when using coarse gridded datasets with resolution larger than 0 5 1 piccolroaz et al 2018 the air2water model is based on the volume integrated heat balance of the surface mixed layer of the lake through simple linearization of the heat flux terms using taylor expansion piccolroaz et al 2013 and using at as a proxy for the integrated effect of the relevant processes and fluxes livingstone and padisák 2007 the volume integrated heat balance equation reduces to a simple ordinary differential equation depending on at lswt and a number of parameters summarizing the main climatic and thermo physical properties of the lake piccolroaz et al 2013 piccolroaz 2016 in this study we used the 6 parameter version of the model which recently has been successfully applied by piccolroaz et al 2020 in a global reconstruction of twentieth century lswt this global application showed good performance for lakes located in snow and polar climate regions thus motivating the use of this version of the model for the present climate change study the air2water model in its 6 parameter version reads as follows 1 d t w d t 1 δ a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w a 5 c o s 2 π t t y a 6 2 δ exp t w t h a 4 for t w t h 1 for t w t h where t is time expressed in days ty is the duration of the year in days tw is lswt ta is at th is a reference value for the deep lake temperature δ is a dimensionless term representing the ratio between the volume of the surface lake layer and a reference volume and a1 a6 are model parameters resulting from linearization of the heat flux terms see piccolroaz et al 2013 and piccolroaz 2016 for details the dimensionless depth δ is a time varying term that quantifies thermal stratification through the difference between surface and deep water temperatures according to the empirical relationship in eq 2 δ ranges from 0 to 1 with values decreasing for increasing temperature difference i e thermal stratification and δ approaching 1 when the lake is well mixed i e when tw th the value of th is fixed to 4 c for dimictic lakes i e lakes that mix completely twice each year and to the minimum or maximum annual lswt for warm and cold monomictic lakes i e lakes that mix completely once each year respectively the inclusion of lake stratification through δ is the key term that distinguishes air2water from traditional statistical models and that has been proven to be crucial to satisfactorily predict lswt dynamics eq 1 was solved with a daily time step using the crank nicolson method and considering a lower bound of lswt at 0 c the model parameters were calibrated using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm see kennedy and eberhart 1995 using the observed lswt data to infer the parameters value the pso is an evolutionary self adaptive search optimization technique inspired by animal social behavior this method is based on an iterative procedure that explores the hyperspace of parameters to converge to the set of parameters that minimizes the error between simulated and observed data in this case lswt detailed descriptions of the air2water model can be found in piccolroaz et al 2013 and piccolroaz 2016 the model was calibrated for each lake using daily at data measured at the nearest meteorological station fig 1 and table 1 as model input and observed lswt as reference time series for computing model performance model performance was evaluated using the following three metrics according to other water temperature prediction studies e g piccolroaz et al 2018 graf et al 2019 zhu et al 2020b nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae 3 n s e 1 i 1 n t m i t o i 2 i 1 n t o i t o 2 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n t m i t o i 2 5 m a e 1 n i 1 n t m i t o i where n is the number of samples i e daily averages to i and tm i are the observed and modeled daily water temperature values at time i and t o is the average value of t o model calibration and validation was performed using the historical at and lswt observational dataset 1987 2016 the available times series were divided into two subsets 2 3 of the time series for model calibration and the remaining 1 3 for model validation the above metrics of model performance were evaluated for each lake and for both calibration and validation periods separately a shorter validation period was preferred in favor of a more robust calibration of model parameters because the validity of air2water has already been demonstrated in several previous applications in this regard we refer to piccolroaz 2016 for details about the model performance with different ratios between the number of data in calibration and validation model validation years were sampled every third year of the time series thus allowing to evenly distribute calibration and validation years over the study period in this way possible long term warming trends are included in the model calibration making the optimization of the model parameters more robust 2 3 future climate data historical 1987 2005 and projected 2006 2100 at data relative to the intermediate rcp4 5 and high rcp8 5 emission scenarios were obtained from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex www cordex org an international coordinated effort under the auspices of the world climate research programme specifically cordex provides a collection of high resolution regional climate simulations for different domains around the world by dynamically downscaling the outputs of general circulation models gcms using regional climate models rcms regional downscaling plays an important role for the accurate assessment of local impacts and effective definition of regional adaptation plans indeed while gcms provide projections of how the climate may change in the future at the global scale rcms use these projections to provide information with greater detail and on smaller spatial scales in the present study simulations for the european domain euro cordex https euro cordex net at the spatial resolution of 0 44 degree eur 44 50 km were downloaded from the earth system grid federation esgf node hosted by the german climate computing centre dkrz https esgf data dkrz de projects esgf dkrz the euro cordex ensemble available for the emission scenarios and periods considered in this study consists of the nine different gcm rcm combinations summarized in table 2 that is all the available combinations relative to ensemble r1i1p1 and downscaling realization v1 other emission scenarios were not considered since these would have drastically reduced the number of gcm rcm combinations contemporaneously available for all the emission scenarios despite the high grid resolution of the eur 44 cordex product possible biases remain due to epistemic and parametric errors which suggests the need to further adjust rcms outputs christensen et al 2008 notwithstanding previous studies demonstrated good performance of cordex products for limnological applications mailhot et al 2019 shatwell et al 2019 musie et al 2020 and for climate change studies in poland romanowicz et al 2016 mezghani et al 2017 piniewski et al 2017 in order to account for the possible under representation of at from the climate models the change factor method diaz nieto and wilby 2005 minville et al 2008 was used to downscale the future at scenarios this downscaling method allows for adjusting future projections of a climate variable for which in situ observations are available during a historical period h by simply adding projected changes in such climate variable relative to the same baseline period h to the historical in situ observed climatological year hence for each lake and for the generic climate model and emission scenario we extracted the modeled at t a m o d from the grid cell containing the barycenter of that lake and we computed the adjusted at time series in the year y t a y as follows 6 t a y t a h t a m o d y t a m o d h where t a m o d y is the predicted daily at time series in the year y for the given climate model and emission scenario and t a h and t a m o d h are the observed i e at the nearest meteorological station to the lake see table 1 and modeled climatological mean annual cycles on daily basis for the same historical period h respectively in the present case y spans the period 2006 2100 i e when climate models projections are available and the reference historical period h is 1987 2005 i e the period covered by both observed and historical climate models outputs we note that by construction this approach is fully consistent with running the future climate scenarios using the model parameter values obtained for each lake from calibrating the model with the historical at data measured at the corresponding meteorological station see table 1 the expected long term variations of at and lakes thermal behavior were analyzed in terms of anomalies a standard and consolidated practice in climate change studies e g luterbacher et al 2004 hansen et al 2012 while the international standard is to use a baseline period of 30 years for calculating anomalies due to data limitation and for the sake of consistency the anomalies were evaluated comparing air2water projections under future scenarios with air2water simulations obtained using at from climate models historical runs i e 1987 2005 without loss of generality anomalies were calculated for each lake separately and to emphasize the inter lake variability of lswt expected for polish lakes in the next century the temperature anomalies were averaged across the different gcm rcm combinations multi model average while keeping the variability among the lakes this choice was motivated by the wish to provide a combined and synthesized overview of the results making it easily accessible also to policymakers and a non scientific audience for the sake of completeness the full modeling outputs file air2water results 7z and the future annual and seasonal trends of at and lswt for all the gcm rcm combinations tables s1 s5 are available in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 model performance for the historical period table 3 summarizes the optimal values of the model parameters a1 a6 along with the metrics of model performance which we recall were calculated based on daily lswt values for each lake separately in the calibration period nse values varied between 0 958 and 0 993 among the 25 lakes with an average value of 0 982 rmse values varied between 0 78 c and 1 50 c with an average value of 0 99 c mae values varied between 0 62 c and 1 12 c with an average value of 0 76 c in the validation period nse values ranged from 0 952 to 0 992 average value 0 982 rmse values ranged from 0 71 c to 1 59 c average value 0 99 c mae values ranged from 0 55 c to 1 17 c average value 0 76 c in both the model calibration and validation periods nse values for all the lakes were close to unity and in any case larger than 0 950 indicating high performance of the air2water model i e small residual variance compared to the observed data variance in addition both rmse and mae were lower than 1 00 c on average and did not show meaningful differences between calibration and validation periods indicating robust identification of model parameters and overall good accuracy of the predicted lswt values the results of the model performance are graphically summarized in fig 2 which shows the heat map scatter plot between observed and simulated daily lswt in the calibration and validation periods for all the lakes together all the points are well aligned along the 1 1 line with low dispersion as indicated by the heat map color and with absence of any visible bias depending on lwst only a minor systematic deviation is recognizable for lower lswt i e lower than about 2 c where the model slightly underestimates observations 3 2 long term trends and lakes thermal sensitivity to climate change lake surface water temperatures in the future scenarios were projected using the calibrated air2water model for each lake in this section we provide an analysis of the results in terms of mean annual and seasonal at and lswt trends and we use the model s output to characterize lakes thermal sensitivity to climate change table s1 summarizes the warming rates c per decade of the projected mean annual at and lswt for each lake under the two scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 while the seasonal warming rates for spring summer autumn and winter at and lswt for each lake are listed in tables s2 s5 seasons were defined as follows jfm january february march winter amj april may june spring jas july august september summer ond october november december autumn as commented above in the following analysis we averaged the at and lswt trends from the nine gcm rcm combinations obtaining a representative and compact overview of the expected long term trends while the trends for each lake and climate model are available in tables s1 s5 and the raw modeling outputs are made accessible in the supplementary material file air2water results 7z annual average table s1 for the scenario rcp4 5 with the warming rates of at

rates of ats varying between 0 35 c per decade and 0 58 c per decade average value 0 44 c per decade lswt is expected to warm by 0 30 c per decade range 0 21 0 39 c per decade overall the projected warming rates of lswt are lower than those of at for the mean annual and the four seasons tables s1 s5 although in spring lswt in some lakes is projected to warm at similar or higher rates than at table s3 for both scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the highest warming rates of lswt are obtained in spring amj followed by winter jfm while the seasons with the lowest lswt warming rates are summer jas and fall ond boxplots summarizing at and lswt long term trends at monthly scale for all lakes are presented in fig 3 panels a b d and e the analysis of the single months confirms the seasonal long term lswt trends discussed above the shape of the monthly at warming rates between the two emission scenarios is overall similar except that in the rcp4 5 scenario the minimum at warming trend is expected in august while in the rcp8 5 scenario in may the effect on the resulting lswt trends is the absence of a second warming peak in late summer under the rcp4 5 scenario which on the contrary is expected under the rcp8 5 scenario more important the intra annual distribution of monthly lswt warming rates is substantially different compared to that of the driving at warming rates fig 3 panels b and c vs panels a and b this is primarily motivated by the seasonality of lakes stratification that determines lakes thermal inertia and hence together with ice dynamics shapes the lswt response to changes in at piccolroaz et al 2015 zhong et al 2016 shatwell et al 2019 in particular while at in winter months from january to march shows the highest warming trends a contextual marked lswt response is not evident as a consequence of the weak stratification hence large thermal inertia and insulating effect of the ice cover when present see also fig 8 and the discussion section the combination of these two factors makes the lakes less thermally sensitive in this period of the year according to piccolroaz et al 2020 lake thermal sensitivity to changes in at was evaluated for each lake as the slope of the regression line without intercept between lswt and at monthly anomalies evaluated relative to the reference period 1987 2005 and is shown in fig 3c and f this metric summarizes the reactivity of lswt to changes in at and clearly indicates low thermal sensitivity resiliency values 0 6 of lakes in winter jfm and autumn ond compared to a larger thermal sensitivity values 0 8 in spring and summer the time series of at and lswt mean annual anomalies relative to the reference period 1987 2005 are presented in fig 4 for both the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the at warming predicted for the next century is expected to be followed by a contextual progressive warming of lswt although lswt is expected to warm less than at in both scenarios the lswt long term trends being 72 and 76 of the at long term trends under scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively 3 3 the impact of climate change on lswt extremes mixing regime and ice cover in this section the projected lswt are analyzed to gather insights into how lakes thermal dynamics are expected to be impacted by future warming for each lake we identified the 50th 90th and 99th percentiles of lswt during the reference period 1987 2005 and evaluated how the number of days in a year with lswt above these reference thresholds is expected to change in the future the first percentile is the median of annual lswt thus is the value of lswt that has been exceeded half of the time during the reference period while statistical thresholds ranging from 90th to 99th percentiles are typically used to define extreme conditions mcphillips et al 2018 the expected anomalies trends averaged across lakes are shown in figs 5 and 6 for the 50th and 99th percentiles respectively for the sake of conciseness the results for the 90th percentile are not shown but only commented below while the lswt values associated to the two percentiles are lake dependent figs 5a and 6 a the future trends are coherent the variability i e confidence band across lakes is relatively small and a progressive increase of the number of days with lswt above these thresholds is evident for both percentiles the expected trends are comparable between the two scenarios until around 2050 while afterwards the rcp8 5 scenario is characterized by faster trends according to the stronger at warming in the second half of the century relative to the rcp4 5 scenario see e g fig 4 as a consequence in the last decade of the century we expect that under the rcp4 5 scenario the number of days per year with lswt warmer than the current median value will increase by 17 2 days i e 9 1 versus an increase of 35 5 days i e 19 2 under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 5 more relevant for the aquatic ecosystem and from a water resources perspective the number of days per year with lswt warmer than what nowadays can be defined an extreme event i e the 99th percentile is expected to increase by 9 1 days i e 235 41 and 21 4 days i e 582 98 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively when considering the number of days above the 90th percentile of lswt during the reference period they are expected to increase by 25 3 days i e 67 8 and 48 4 days i e 130 8 respectively under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios by the end of the century all the lakes considered in the analysis are dimictic meaning that lswt crosses the temperature of maximum density equal to about 4 c at atmospheric pressure two times per year in spring when lakes stratify and in fall when they mix before inverse stratification in winter accordingly we defined the winter inverse stratification period as the period when lswt is colder than 4 c mccormick 1990 and evaluated how the number of days characterized by inverse stratification conditions will change in the future the anomalies relative to past 1987 2005 conditions when inverse stratification was 121 5 days per year on average are shown in fig 7 for both scenarios the number of days with lswt below 4 c present clear decreasing trends indicating a progressive shortening of the inverse stratification period hence a contextual lengthening of summer stratification on average winter inverse stratification is expected to be 37 4 days i e 31 4 and 64 10 days i e 53 11 shorter in the last decade of the 21st century relative to current conditions under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively finally results allowed for the projection of how the number of annual ice covered days will change in the future here the number of ice cover days were defined as the days with lswt 1 5 c to account for both the fact that lswt in winter was measured below ice and for model limitations in simulating the ice cover further hampered by the use of at from historical climate models runs which provided a rmse between simulated and observed ice cover duration of 13 days during the reference historical period 1987 2005 the comparison between observed and modelled ice cover duration is provided in fig 8 which also shows the projected future trends for the decades 2040 2050 and 2090 2100 while under current conditions all lakes are ice covered in winter under the rcp4 5 scenario the ice cover period will reduce by 22 2 by middle of the century and by 60 12 by the end of the century with a long term trend of 3 7 1 days per decade the projected shortening of the ice cover period is more severe under the rcp8 5 scenario with the number of ice cover days reducing by 36 7 by middle of the century and by 86 7 by the end of the century with a long term trend of 6 7 1 days per decade that is expected to significantly shorten the ice cover period in most of the lakes by the end of the century 10 7 days per year in the last decade of the 21st century to be compared to 68 16 days per year under reference conditions 4 discussion 4 1 model performance and limitations the only input data required by the air2water model is at assumed as reasonable proxy for the overall external forcing livingstone and padisák 2007 although this is certainly a simplification the model explicitly includes the effect of the thermal inertia and of the stratification of the lake through the dependence on lswt in eq 1 and the well mixed layer thickness defined in eq 2 respectively in addition the contributions to the heat budget that are not directly dependent on at and lswt such as solar radiation wind speed air humidity etc are at least partially summarized by the sinusoidal term in eq 1 in this way the air2water model shares the same simplicity and parsimony of statistical models but its physically based derivation ensures high performance comparable to that of more complex deterministic models toffolon et al 2014 piccolroaz 2016 indeed the good performance and reliable predictions found in previous applications of the air2water model have also been confirmed in the present study where we obtained daily rmse and mae lower than 1 c on average both in calibration and in validation the results evidenced absence of any systematic bias between simulated and observed lswt except for a slight model underestimation around the lowest values of lswt in winter fig 2 in this respect it should be noted that the observed lswt only rarely approaches 0 c due to sampling 0 4 m below ice cover in winter while a lower bound at 0 c was used in the air2water model in absence of any better estimate from the available data notwithstanding the overall model performance is high and the lack of precise information on the timing of ice cover from the available lswt observations since measurements are taken 0 4 m below ice cover did not preclude from identifying the duration of the ice cover period with reasonable accuracy fig 8 indeed the rmse is 13 days corresponding to 19 of the mean ice cover duration across lakes under current conditions and smaller than the corresponding average standard deviation equal to 30 days while the error in the duration of the ice cover period could have been reduced by considering lake specific lswt thresholds for the sake of simplicity we preferred to consider a fixed 1 5 c threshold larger than 0 c for the reason discussed above for all lakes which still provided estimated ice cover duration always within the confidence band of observations in addition the use of a fixed threshold allowed to identify an interesting clustering between lakes in the eastern and western part of poland the performance for lakes in the eastern zone ids 12 25 average rmse 9 days is higher than for lakes in the western side of poland ids 1 10 average rmse 17 days the evident division into two zones reflects the features of transitional climate in the analyzed region according to woś 2010 the western part is under the influence of marine warmer and more humid climate and the eastern part is dominated by continental dry and colder climate the ice cover is therefore more dynamic and less persistent in the western region hampering its precise prediction in the lakes located in this part of the country this pattern is confirmed by the decrease in ice cover thickness and increase in ice cover duration observed when moving from east to west choiński et al 2015 thus further explaining the higher rmse values found in the western side of poland despite the overall good performance and reasonable model errors obtained in the present application of the air2water model still the results are inevitably affected by some uncertainties and limitations the absence of a physically based ice module in the air2water model is certainly the first main limitation of the present application a dedicated ice module is currently under development and will be available soon second the use of only one lake model limits the representation of plausible future lake temperature scenarios and may bias the results due to the unavoidable epistemic uncertainty expanding the present lswt projections by using an ensemble of deterministic lake models is certainly advisable in a further development of the present study in this regard we do not advise the use of purely statistical models as they are deemed controversial in climate change applications piccolroaz et al 2018 2020 finally here we averaged the results obtained by applying the air2water model with at from nine different gcm rcm combinations the drawbacks of considering multi model averages have been commented in recent literature knutti et al 2010 madsen et al 2017 and this may bias some analyses aimed at investigating the variability of extreme values however multi model averages are still largely used in the literature e g knutti and sedláček 2013 and in reports by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ipcc stocker et al 2013 as they have the advantage of providing a combined and synthesized overview of the results accessible also to a non scientific audience while here we preferred to push on the easy accessibility of the results to a larger audience we suggest that further research efforts should be spent on properly quantifying the uncertainty stemming from the use of multiple climate and lake models in this regard tables s1 s5 suggest that the variance of at and lswt future trends across the nine gcm rcm combinations may be relevant for example when the mean annual trends are concerned table s1 the coefficient of variation i e the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean relative to the nine gcm rcm combinations averaged across the 25 lakes is 27 and 29 for at and lswt respectively under the rcp4 5 scenario and it is 16 and 17 for at and lswt respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario these averaged values increase to a maximum of 47 for at and 46 for lswt when summer trends are considered under the rcp4 5 scenario with peaks up to 59 for at in some lakes table s4 in general inter model variability increases moving from lakes located in the western warmer and more humid zone to lakes located in the eastern colder and dry zone of poland tables s1 s5 4 2 future trends and lakes thermal sensitivity lakes thermal sensitivity to changes in at has been found to be highly variable throughout the year with spring and summer months being the most responsive to changes in at fig 3 confirming previous studies based on historical observations in other lakes winslow et al 2017 woolway et al 2017 toffolon et al 2020 in particular we found thermal sensitivity values equal to 0 70 for annual means and between 0 70 0 90 in spring and summer coherently with studies of lake surface heat budgets schmid et al 2014 on the other hand lower thermal sensitivity values 0 6 has been found for winter and autumn due to the weaker absent thermal stratification thus higher thermal inertia and insulating effect of the ice cover when present we recall that the concept of lake thermal sensitivity used here is an indicator of the sensitivity of lswt to changes in at and should not be confused with a measure of the ratio between lswt and at long term warming trends in this regard previous studies of other lakes around the world austin and colman 2008 o reilly et al 2015 piccolroaz et al 2015 and in europe woolway et al 2017 found that lswt warming can be faster than that of at especially in summer and for deep and cold lakes o reilly et al 2015 woolway and merchant 2017 different explanations have been proposed for this amplified response of lswt to at including changes in the timing of lake stratification austin and colman 2007 piccolroaz et al 2015 zhong et al 2016 changes in large scale climatic forcing such as solar radiation fink et al 2014 variation of lake clarity rose et al 2016 timing and duration of the ice cover austin and colman 2007 o reilly et al 2016 but also the methodological approach and averaged indicators used in the data analysis toffolon et al 2020 the results of the present study showed that lswt will warm at lower rates than at in the future in all the investigated lakes and under both scenarios warming at 72 and 76 than at on average for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 4 coherently with previous modeling studies in other lakes e g butcher et al 2015 czernecki and ptak 2018 shatwell et al 2019 the projected warming trends at both monthly and annual time scales throughout the 21st century are in agreement with projections for some lakes in north eastern germany obtained using the lake model flake under the rcp4 5 scenario shatwell et al 2019 specifically in both cases the modeling projections suggest that the study lakes will warm predominantly in spring and winter determining a shortening of inverse stratification and ice cover periods and to a lower extent in summer and autumn as a consequence of the seasonal pattern of at trends expected in the future fig 3 the results are coherent also with previous estimates obtained for some of the study lakes by czernecki and ptak 2018 using an empirical statistical model for lswt which projected similar annual lswt trends and lower warming rates of lswt compared to at however when looking at the seasonal pattern of the expected warming rates the results by czernecki and ptak 2018 do not agree with what shown in the present study and in shatwell et al 2019 for the contiguous german lakes the reason is likely attributable to the coarser resolution of gcms projections used in that previous study ranging between 0 5 and 4 then linearly interpolated at 0 25 which is expected to introduce larger inaccuracies especially in the regions at the border between sea and land where most of the study lakes are located when comparing the future warming trends fig 3 with those observed in the recent period for which lswt observations are available 1987 2016 fig 9 interesting considerations can be drawn the mean annual lswt warming rate expected under scenario rcp4 5 0 15 c per decade will be lower than what observed in the period 1987 2016 0 44 c per decade according to a milder warming of at expected for this scenario 0 21 c per decade compared to past at observations 0 34 c per decade higher lswt warming 0 34 c per decade is expected under the rcp8 5 scenario due to larger at warming 0 44 c per decade but still the projected lswt warming trend is expected to be lower than that observed in recent decades the large warming observed in 1987 2016 is coherent with the substantial lswt warming occurred since the 1980s worldwide piccolroaz et al 2020 including europe woolway et al 2017 as a consequence of an abrupt shift in the climate during this period the observed lswt trend was larger than that of at consistently with what observed in similar studies woolway et al 2017 czernecki and ptak 2018 this condition is not expected in the future primarily because of a seasonal shift in the at warming patterns relative to past conditions indeed the largest at warming is expected in the winter months both scenarios particularly in january and february fig 3a and d compared to past conditions when it was occurring during the rest of the year fig 9a the future at warming is therefore not expected to be followed by an equally intense lswt warming since in the winter period the insulating effect of the ice cover and the large thermal inertia due to weak stratification reduce lakes thermal sensitivity figs 3c and f and 9 c and hence inhibit the lswt response to warming at fig 3b and e in general the different pattern of future at warming trends compared to past conditions fig 3a and d vs fig 3a is expected to alter the seasonal pattern of lakes thermal sensitivity fig 3c f vs fig 9c through changing stratification and ice cover timing and duration for example under the rcp8 5 scenario the substantial shortening of the ice cover and inverse stratification periods figs 7 and 8 is expected to progressively increase the lakes thermal sensitivity in the winter period fig 3f related to this the projected shortening of the ice cover duration under the rcp8 5 scenario 6 7 1 days per decade is expected to be larger than that observed in the period 1961 2010 by choiński et al 2015 and quantified in 5 6 days per decade finally while under both scenarios no lakes are projected to undergo a regime shift from dimictic to warm monomictic i e lakes mixing once per year fig 7 under the more severe rcp8 5 scenario the projected halving of the number of days with lswt staying below 4 c relative to reference conditions suggests that this scenario may lead to serious consequences for the water quality and ecosystem health of these lakes 4 3 implications for management and conservation plans the generally warmer lswt and shortening of inverse stratification and ice cover periods projected under both scenarios are likely to have serious consequences for the aquatic life and water quality of the analyzed lakes jeopardizing their ecological health and use as water resources tilzer and goldman 1978 coloso et al 2011 leach et al 2018 as an example water temperature changes in the future may affect many fish species especially with respect to their spatio temporal distribution patterns pandit et al 2017 and with particular concern for cold water habitats williams et al 2015 this is particularly true in light of the projected tendency of climate change towards shorter ice cover periods fig 8 and intensification of high lswt values fig 6 in the future these aspects should be carefully considered in medium to long term management and conservation plans of these lowland polish lakes as ignoring the rate of climatic change could result in ineffective restoration plans lin et al 2017 being able to design effective management and conservation plans is particularly relevant for the study lakes given their strategic importance in many areas of the economy in northern poland tourism agriculture industry in this regard the results of the present study are expected to provide an useful support for local policymakers and authorities in charge of the management of these lakes in compliance with the water quality objectives set by the eu water framework directive 2000 60 ec besides presenting an overview of the expected impact of climate change on lswt ice cover and mixing dynamics for several lowland lakes in poland the present analysis is also aimed at being used as a reference for identifying the most vulnerable lakes where detailed studies should be focused similarly the availability of climate change projections of lakes thermal evolution are expected to be useful for prioritizing the numerous local level restoration projects aimed at preserving and improving the water quality of these lakes łopata et al 2013 gołdyn et al 2014 dondajewska et al 2018 kowalczewska madura et al 2018 grochowska et al 2019 supporting the continuity of lake restoration programs in the future years and helping to revise the undertaken and planned lake management projects in order to make them more effective finally the outcome of the present study is also expected to be useful for ongoing governmental programmes among others the plan of counteracting effects of droughts aimed at facing the ongoing and forecasted water deficit this is expected to become an increasing problem in poland where the country s water resources per inhabitant are among the lowest in europe nowak and ptak 2018 one of the strategies to address this problem is the damming of existent lakes reducing the outflows and increasing the available water resource while this operation if realized is expected to further affect the lakes thermal and mixing dynamics knowing the expected impact of climate change on the existing lakes is a fundamental pre requisite for designing any future management plan going in this direction 5 conclusions in this study the air2water model was employed to forecast lswt in 25 lowland lakes in poland under two future emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projected at time series from nine different gcm rcm combinations provided by eur 44 cordex spatial resolution 0 44 were used as model input to evaluate the impact of climate change on lswt ice cover and mixing patterns the analysis of results in terms of future 2006 2100 anomalies and long term trends compared to past 1987 2005 conditions lead to the following conclusions 1 the air2water model performed well for lswt forecasting for all the lakes with average values of nse rmse and mae are 0 982 0 99 c and 0 76 c in model calibration and validation no systematic biases were introduced by the model expect for a slight underestimation at low i e close to 0 c temperatures which however is attributable to the fact that in winter water temperature measurements are taken 0 4 m below the ice cover hence are always slightly warmer than 0 c used as lower lswt threshold in the model 2 the warming trends of both at and lswt projected under the future scenarios are expected to be lower than those observed in past decades 1987 2016 and with a different timing throughout the year as a result of different at and in turn thermal stratification patterns particularly at is expected to warm the most in the winter period while in the past decades the larger warming occurred during the rest of the year 3 seasonal and monthly analysis showed that lswt is expected to warm slower than at throughout the 21st century i e lswt long term trends being 72 and 76 than the corresponding at trends for scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the mean annual lswt is expected to warm up to 0 15 c per decade and 0 34 c per decade under scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively on average across all lakes in both cases spring amj will be the season with the highest lswt warming 0 21 c per decade and 0 36 c per decade for the two scenarios respectively while fall ond will be the season with the lower warming trend 0 11 c per decade and 0 30 c per decade for the two scenarios respectively 4 the at warming expected in winter months will contribute to shortening the inverse stratification and ice cover periods particularly under the rcp8 5 scenario that if realized could seriously threaten lakes mixing regime and the existence of the ice cover period with at warming projected for this scenario inverse stratification is expected to reduce by 53 11 64 10 days and the ice cover period by 86 7 6 7 1 days per decade by the end of the 21st century on average for the milder rcp4 5 scenarios the expected shortening of inverse stratification is quantified in 31 4 37 4 days and that of the ice cover period in 60 12 3 7 1 days per decade by the end of the 21st century on average 5 the low thermal sensitivity of lakes in winter due to the insulating effect of the ice cover and large thermal inertia associated with weak stratification conditions is expected to partially buffer the lswt response to at warming 6 all lakes are expected to undergo significant warming especially in the high range of lswt with a substantial increase in the number of days with lswt above thresholds that nowadays can be defined as extreme events i e 90th and 99th percentile for example the number of days per year with lswt above the 99th percentile calculated for the reference period are expected to increase by 9 1 days i e 235 41 and 21 4 days i e 582 98 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively though the air2water model performed well it does not explicitly account for the effects of external forcing other than at such as solar radiation wind speed and air humidity we therefore suggest that as a further step some efforts should be spent in validating the lakes thermal dynamics projections presented here complementing the present future projections with results from more sophisticated deterministic models notwithstanding the results presented in this study provide useful insights about the future thermal dynamics of lowland lakes in poland which are expected to be beneficial for policymakers and

8258,the paper considers a methodology to assess rainfall erosivity in italy for the recent decades 1981 2010 building on datasets and materials freely available such as those included within the climate data store cds of the copernicus climate change service c3s twenty one referenced empirical models to assess rainfall erosivity r factor based on coarse rainfall data are tested and compared then a custom model is calibrated with the support of seasonal rainfall pattern clustering by means of the self organizing map moreover a large database of sub hourly rainfall observations covering the period 2002 2011 is collected and used for validation model performances are analysed at the point scale of the rain gauges and at the spatial scale of different relevant gridded rainfall products the fifth generation of ecmwf reanalysis era5 era5 land the gridded european observational dataset e obs all included in the cds and scia ispra the italian standard rainfall gridded dataset new hydrological insights from the region the proposed methodology provides four alternatives of spatially distributed rainfall erosivity datasets covering italy with diverse levels of reliability analysis of results shows that the best performance is achieved by the combined use of the custom model and the scia ispra dataset followed by era5 land with the main source of error lying in the use of an empirical model instead of the rigorous model for r factor estimation and secondly in the use of gridded rainfall data instead of point scale rainfall observations keywords climate reanalysis copernicus climate data store empirical r factor models gridded observations dataset rainfall erosivity italy 1 introduction in the last decades soil erosion and erosion related issues have raised great attention at the european level for instance soil erosion was among the threats on soils listed within the soil thematic strategy of 2006 ec 2006 it was recognized as of interest for the eu common agricultural policy cap ec 2013a and the 7th environment action programme ec 2013b it was included as indicator in the 2012 climate change impacts and vulnerability report of the european environment agency eea eea 2012 and concerning italy in the draft of national climate change adaptation plan mattm 2017 across europe soil loss rates due to water more than twice than those due to wind eea 1995 cause damages to agriculture with costs reaching 1 26 billion 295 million and 155 million in terms of crop production net agricultural production and gross domestic product gdp respectively with the italian country at the top of these costs panagos et al 2018 and of affected area panagos et al 2015b therefore a proper evaluation of soil loss rates represents a pivotal step for zoning the most susceptible areas and identifying effective mitigation measures limiting to rainfall related rill and sheet erosion the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 has been widely adopted rusle is an empirical regression equation that enables identifying the main drivers of the process and calibrating validating the related significance and reciprocal weight it is not able to provide event based assessments but only annual evaluations of spatially and temporally lumped soil loss rusle was developed as an improvement of the usle method wischmeier and smith 1978 and similarly to the main empirical models on soil loss potential due to erosion it is a combination of the erosivity factor detaching particles from their position in the soil rainfall in this case r factor and the soil susceptibility factors i e those characteristics that make a soil more or less prone to erosion including here not only the intrinsic and state soil physical and chemical properties erodibility k factor but also the topographic settings slope length and steepness ls factor as well as land cover and management c factor and support practices to prevent mitigate erosion p factor largely depending on human actions the characterization and proper evaluation of rainfall erosivity is commonly recognized a challenging issue r factors represent an average annual rainfall erosivity due to all the storm events occurred over a significant number of years according to the rusle methodology r factor estimation should rely on long series of sub hourly rainfall observations so that storm events causing erosion usually identified by the maximum intensity over a 30 minute window whose estimation requires rainfall data at least at 30 minute resolution can be correctly assessed renard et al 1997 however poor availability of long and complete time series of high resolution rainfall data ferro et al 1991 verstraeten and poesen 2006 fiener et al 2013 makes this rigorous approach quite difficult to apply requiring the adoption of alternative simplified empirical models relying on rainfall data with coarser temporal resolutions such as the daily monthly and annual scales benavidez et al 2018 empirical models for the estimation of r factors are affected by different degrees of approximation resulting in different performance levels when compared to the rigorous approach bonilla and vidal 2011 ramos and durán 2014 benavidez et al 2018 guesri et al 2020 daily rainfall time series and related aggregations at the monthly or annual scale can be used to detect variables such as cumulative values number of days exceeding a threshold in rainfall volumes or intensities that can be assumed as proxies of either single storm erosivity or of the r factor ramos and durán 2014 however significant deviations from rigorous r factor values considered as the most correct representation of reality can be observed even for models relying on daily data ramos and durán 2014 a large number of models exist that only rely on the average annual precipitation benavidez et al 2018 indeed relating variables representing complex physical processes to simple climate covariates at the annual scale is not an uncommon approach del giudice et al 2014 such models are suitable to assess r factors only over areas where large rainfall erosivity corresponds to large rainfall intensities ferro et al 1999 in this perspective it should be noted that by definition r factors represent average erosivity conditions in time and space so that extremely intense storm events should be treated as outliers and neglected for erosivity assessments yin et al 2017 given the above mentioned considerations regional studies for the assessment of r factors and consequent soil losses are still an open research topic applications of empirical models can be found to assess spatial and temporal trends of rainfall erosivity using daily choukri et al 2016 lai et al 2016 xie et al 2016 beguería et al 2018 bouderbala et al 2019 liu et al 2020 polykretis et al 2020 monthly renard and freimund 1994 terranova and gariano 2015 mondal et al 2016 ballabio et al 2017 and annual rainfall observations data bonilla and vidal 2011 heusch 1970 oduro afriyie 1996 da silva 2004 yin et al 2015 toubal et al 2018 fernandez et al 2019 some examples of r factor assessments relying on sub hourly data can be found for a few regions of the world nanko et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 diodato et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2017 auerswald et al 2019 at the european level the redes project by the eu joint research centre jrc provided an r factor map with a horizontal resolution of 500 m building on an extensive database of sub hourly rainfall records as well as on a dataset of climate and physical covariates collected for the italian country at 251 rain gauges covering the period 2002 2011 panagos et al 2015a for italy an r factor map with a horizontal resolution of 300 m is also available that builds on the application of six different empirical models relying on monthly annual rainfall data bazzoffi 2007 it is worth noting that the above mentioned investigations differ not only for the model used for r factor assessment and consequently for the spatial temporal resolution of input rainfall data but also for the temporal coverage and especially for the specific interpolation technique adopted to move from the rain gauge point scale to spatially distributed maps the present research focuses on the assessment of rainfall erosivity represented by the r factor variable over italy where rainfall data sources with different temporal and horizontal resolutions are available and several rainfall erosivity estimations have already been carried out in recent years adopting different standards for datasets methods and assumptions the manuscript is organized as follows first the rationale of the research here briefly introduced is described in detail in order to show the positioning of the paper in the field literature second the exploited materials are described with particular focus on the rainfall products available in climate data store cds of the copernicus climate change service c3s and the additional support rainfall datasets used for validation purposes and the adopted methodology is recalled finally the main results are presented and discussed and significant conclusions are drawn 2 rationale of the research the assessment of spatially distributed r factors describing current rainfall erosivity conditions requires spatialized observational datasets describing rainfall regimes for several decades these datasets should be characterized by i a temporal resolution adequate to apply one or multiple models to compute r factors ii a horizontal resolution adequate to infer about locations where no information is available iii a temporal coverage adequate to efficiently describe erosivity regime as shown in the introduction section previous research may fail to comprehensively address all the issues specifically temporal coverage of historical time series of rainfall observations could be too short compared to suggested lengths of 20 30 years verstraeten and poesen 2006 meusburger et al 2012 this happens in italy because local authorities in charge of rainfall monitoring systems equipped rain gauges with high resolution but often different sensors with sub hourly data acquisition only after 2000 on average for example data used for the redes rainfall erosivity database at european scale project by jrc panagos et al 2015a only cover the period 2002 2011 for italy moreover it is well recognized that sub hourly rainfall data require deeper post processing in terms of missing data and outlier detection padulano and del giudice 2020 compared to hourly daily data with a computational effort that increases with increasing length and native time step of time series instead large long and reliable processed datasets of daily rainfall observations over italy are already available the distribution of rain gauges over the region of interest could be very heterogeneous for example italian rain gauges are managed by distinct local authorities resulting in different sensors spatial density acquisition frequency instrumental accuracy temporal coverage data validation and post processing this can require additional effort to homogenize rainfall data to feed erosivity computations moreover moving from point scale erosivity data to gridded erosivity datasets requires the adoption of one among the great number of existing spatial interpolation techniques from simple geostatistical approaches to numerical models introducing additional uncertainty and leading to possibly divergent results and different horizontal resolutions in the final maps for italy the adoption of empirical models building on a daily rainfall dataset bazzoffi 2007 led to a finer resolution in the r factor map compared to the redes product building on sub hourly data panagos et al 2015a the aim of the present research is to explore and discuss the usefulness of r factor maps describing current rainfall erosivity regime over italy building on consolidated literature approaches on climate data available from the cds datasets also embedding other spatialized geographic and topographic information e g latitude elevation and on other datasets used as benchmark and for evaluation comparison purposes the main features of the research address the above mentioned issues multiple gridded datasets derived from rainfall observations and included in the cds or other national portals are used to feed empirical rainfall erosivity models some datasets provide hourly rainfall values e g era5 and era5 land climate reanalysis datasets although the horizontal resolution and the associated parametrizations can entail noteworthy biases in the reproduction of sub daily rainfall dynamics hindering the straightforward adoption of hourly values other gridded datasets from observations interpolation such as e obs and scia ispra are characterized by a native daily time resolution under such constraints the application of empirical models driven by precipitation data based on coarser time step instead of the rigorous definition of r factor requiring sub hourly values is considered however a support rainfall dataset with sub hourly observations for a significant number of rain gauges across italy is collected for validation purposes the horizontal resolution of the gridded precipitation products drives the resolution of target r factor maps bypassing the choice and application of any spatial interpolation technique in other words the interpolation uncertainty in the r factor map which is the final product of the present research strongly builds on the interpolation uncertainty of the underlying rainfall map an ensemble of multiple empirical models retrieved in literature is used to account for the uncertainty coming from the adoption of methods that were conceived for different regions of the world basing on possibly different rainfall datasets additionally a custom model relying on the same coarse time step climate variables and geographic topographic attributes is calibrated 3 materials table 1 provides a list of the rainfall and r factor datasets used in the present research along with short relevant information the reference period adopted for baseline estimations is 1981 2010 in line with the current historical reference of the world meteorological organization climatological standard normals wmo 2020 and the reference spatial domain is the italian country all the datasets are available to cover such time and space domains unless otherwise specified the datasets included in the cds used for the main computations are the following era5 gridded rainfall reanalysis dataset with about 31 km horizontal resolution wide temporal 1950 present and spatial global coverage native hourly resolution but also directly available as monthly time series era5 land gridded rainfall reanalysis dataset coming from the interpolation of era5 at a finer horizontal resolution about 9 km for the same spatial domain with temporal coverage 1981 present and available at both hourly and monthly temporal resolution e obs v 20 gridded rainfall observational dataset coming from the interpolation of rainfall time series collected at a large number of rain gauges all over europe 1950 present the dataset is available at the daily scale with a horizontal resolution of about 11 km the datasets not included in the cds are the following scia ispra national system for collection and processing of climate data scia gridded observational rainfall dataset provided by the italian environmental protection agency ispra available at a horizontal resolution of 5 km this dataset comes from the interpolation of a large number of rain gauges with daily resolution covering the entire 20th century up to the present date with different reliability due to the different number of interpolated rain gauges available each year and providing data with different temporal aggregations including maximum daily rainfall and cumulative monthly and annual values desiato et al 2011 sub hourly rainfall shr sub hourly observational time series over the period 2002 2011 to ensure consistency at least with the redes product see below the dataset includes 191 rain gauges over 17 italian regions with different time steps in the range 5 30 min table 2 coarser time resolutions were not considered useful for rainfall erosivity computation sub hourly data were subject to a basic quality check in order to remove outliers and 20 rain gauges were rejected because of the anomalous number of outliers and or missing data with a final number of 171 reliable time series table 2 shows a list of the italian regions with available data along with the number of investigated rain gauges their temporal resolution and the local authority in charge of data collection and delivery to users as it will be discussed in detail in the methodology section this dataset is used to obtain point scale values for r factor that will be compared to the gridded results of the proposed models in order to test their accuracy and to quantify uncertainties redes grid r factor gridded dataset provided by the redes rainfall erosivity database at european scale project panagos et al 2015a covering the whole europe with a horizontal resolution of 500 m providing annual and monthly values of the r factor averaged over the period 1950 2013 2002 2011 for italy and building on a highly complex spatial kriging of r factors building on sub hourly rainfall observations from a large number of rain gauges more than for italy borrelli et al 2016 also accounting for correlations with relevant climate and physical covariates as particularly concerns the above mentioned gridded rainfall datasets era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra for increasing horizontal resolution it should be noticed that such datasets stem from the application of different techniques for instance era5 hersbach et al 2020 and era5 land muñoz sabater 2019 are reanalysis products coming from the data assimilation of historical observations provided by different sources satellite in situ multiple variables but not homogeneously distributed around the globe within a single consistent numerical weather prediction model they only differ for the detail level of the land module resulting in two different horizontal resolutions for the final rainfall dataset e obs is an ensemble made up of a large number of interpolation experiments covering europe with different levels of temporal and spatial coverage according to specific data availability and as a consequence with different performances cornes et al 2018 padulano et al 2020 similarly scia ispra comes from the spatial interpolation of a larger number of rain gauges but it is limited to the italian country despite the finer horizontal resolution of scia ispra suggesting a higher accuracy in representing observed rainfall the other rainfall datasets have recently gained a considerable popularity not only for their wider coverage but also because of the continuously improving quality testified by the frequently released updated versions 4 methods in this section the general framework for the estimation of r factor basing on sub hourly data is provided then the proposed methodology for the assessment of r factor basing on gridded precipitation data is described and additional tools and strategies for the analysis of results are mentioned 4 1 r factor definition rainfall erosivity r factor is a multi annual average index that measures rainfall kinetic energy and intensity describing the effect of rainfall on sheet and rill erosion wischmeier and smith 1978 the r factor is usually computed as the cumulative value of rainfall erosivities referred to erosive storm events occurred over a number of years and it is generally provided at the annual or monthly time scale wischmeier and smith 1978 provide a methodology to identify erosive storm events that consists in omitting rain showers of less than 12 7 mm unless 6 4 mm or more rain fell in 15 min a storm period with less than 1 3 mm in over 6 h is used to divide a longer storm period into two storms the rainfall erosivity of a given storm s is equal to the product of the total storm energy e mj ha with its maximum 30 minutes rainfall intensity i 30 mm h eq 1 1 r s e i 30 s as described by renard et al 1997 e is computed by discretizing the event into parts with constant intensity i as the cumulative product of specific rainfall energy e r mj ha mm by rainfall depth δvr mm for the r th increment eq 2 specific rainfall energy e r can be computed as suggested by brown and foster 1987 eq 3 2 e e r δ v r 3 e r 0 29 1 0 72 e x p 0 05 i r by considering all the storm events occurred in a specific month m over a period of n years it is possible to define the monthly averaged factor rm and the properly defined factor r as described in eq 4 and eq 5 4 r m 1 n i 1 n s 1 s m i e i 30 s 5 r 1 n i 1 n s 1 s i e i 30 s the empirical models used in the present research relate by means of simple linear or quadratic empirical equations the average annual monthly r factor r rm to the average annual monthly cumulative precipitation pr pr m or to the so called modified fournier index mfi defined by arnoldus 1977 as 6 m f i 1 p r m 1 12 p r m 2 table 3 shows a list of the empirical models used in the present research 4 2 preliminary assessment of empirical r factors application of empirical models in table 3 requires the extraction of monthly cumulative rainfall values from the four gridded rainfall datasets listed in table 1 era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra then those values are used to obtain spatially distributed annual mean of cumulative rainfall pr and mean annual modified fournier index mfi in eq 6 successively pr and mfi maps are used as input for the 21 empirical models in table 3 to obtain 21 4 84 different r factor maps describing rainfall erosivity over italy for current climate conditions at this stage the considered time period is 2002 2011 to ensure comparison with redes grid according to bazzoffi 2007 for each dataset a reliable estimate of annual r factor is obtained averaging the results of multiple models providing the best representation of actual rainfall erosivity thus the final output is one r factor map for each observational dataset each map has a spatial resolution equal to the resolution of the reference dataset 31km 11km 9km and 5 km for era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively and represents rainfall erosivity conditions averaged over the period 2002 2011 possible discrepancies can be evaluated to investigate the effect of using different spatial resolutions for rainfall erosivity prediction as well as to understand the potentialities or possible drawbacks of the different observational datasets and interpolation methods 4 3 validation in accordance with catari et al 2011 and also accounting for the peculiarities of the present research the main sources of uncertainty in the proposed r factor estimation strategy lie in the adoption of empirical models and in the use of gridded precipitation datasets instead of point scale sub hourly rainfall observations other recognized sources of uncertainty are not in the scope of this research such as the efficiency of the equations used to estimate kinetic energy of rainfall and the possible measurement errors enabled only if raw rainfall data at the rain gauge level are used in order to validate empirical r factors the research builds on an extensive database of sub hourly rainfall observations covering the period 2002 2011 with a resolution ranging between 5 and 30 min collected at 191 rain gauges over 17 italian regions table 2 that can be used to derive point scale r factors according to the rigorous definition in eq 5 the proposed validation strategy is twofold the efficiency of the empirical models in table 3 in predicting rainfall erosivity can be tested comparing for each rain gauge the output of each empirical model or of the ensemble of multiple models obtained using observed cumulative rainfall against the output of the rigorous approach in eq 5 fed by the same sub hourly data for this purpose reference dataset is shr the efficiency of the gridded rainfall products to compute rainfall erosivity can be tested by using them as input of the empirical models and comparing outputs with the redes grid dataset which is the only referenced r factor map for italy so far panagos et al 2015a aggregated at the same resolution of the gridded datasets 4 3 1 conversion factors for rainfall erosivity homogenisation a practical issue that must be faced when estimating rigorous r factors consists in the difference among the time resolutions of the adopted rain gauges that typically range between 1 and 30 min in case of sub hourly acquisition coarser time resolutions provide underestimated r factors with respect to higher resolutions since the i 30 parameter is underestimated when the time step approaches the 30 min window to address the problem a homogenization is performed by calibrating conversion equations relating high resolution r factors namely r factors computed at the native resolution of each rain gauge in shr to low resolution r factors namely r factors computed for each rain gauge in shr using aggregated rainfall data at the coarsest resolution borrelli et al 2016 in the present research the coarsest resolution is 30 min whereas other rain gauges are available at 5 10 and 15 min so that the following relationships can be assumed 7 r 30 m i n α k r k where subscript k identifies available resolutions finer than 30 min from previous considerations calibration parameter αk is expected to be 1 for the region of interest the significance of the dependence should be verified both on a monthly and on an annual basis finally it is worth noting that for the calibration of eq 7 sub hourly data can be aggregated in cascade for instance 5 min data can be used for the calibration of eq 7 with k 5 min and successively aggregated at 10 min resolution for the calibration of eq 7 with k 10 min and at 15 min resolution for the calibration of eq 7 with k 15 min in addition to data at the corresponding native resolution with no distortion in the estimates rain gauges provide sub hourly rainfall observations that can be aggregated at the monthly annual scale to obtain average annual cumulative precipitation pr and average mfi over the period 2002 2011 in turn the use of those observed values of pr and mfi can be used as the input for the empirical models in table 3 resulting point scale empirical r factor values can be statistically compared to homogenized point scale rigorous r factor values to understand the reliability of empirical models 4 4 spatio temporal patterns and calibration of a new model as a novelty element a customized empirical model is proposed and then tested relying on simple geographic topographic and climate variables retrievable in the gridded precipitation datasets adopted to drive the choice of the variables and to provide further insights on the variability of the italian rainfall erosivity regime a pattern detection is also performed to identify possible regions with similar behaviours in the present research pattern detection focuses on observed monthly precipitation data averaged over the period 2002 2011 pattern detection is performed by means of the self organizing map som an unsupervised clustering tool based on neural networks kohonen 1982 the output of som is represented by the output neuron grid where each neuron is populated by input patterns according to some distance measures that should be minimized within each neuron and maximized among the neurons the number of possible output clusters is one of the key settings in case of completely unsupervised clustering as in the present research a small grid size should be preferred at least for preliminary assessments padulano and del giudice 2018 each output neuron can be empty or filled with one or more input patterns each neuron can be regarded to as a separate cluster or additional considerations such as visual inspection of neighbouring distances component planes or data labels verdú et al 2006 laspidou et al 2015 can lead to a merging of the nearest neurons with the consequent refinement and reduction of clusters padulano and del giudice 2018 finally the average pattern of each cluster can be regarded to as the representative or centroid of the cluster basing on the observed precipitation data for the 171 available rain gauges the som is run to identify possible patterns in average monthly precipitation to study the performance of empirical models in predicting rainfall erosivity for large areas such as the italian country using as input the average monthly and annual precipitation values for each rain gauge the som is run with a grid dimension equal to 3 thus the total number of expected clusters is 3 3 9 chosen as sufficiently small to capture regional climate variability as will be shown in the following sections for the present research the main aim of the clustering is demonstrating the existence of relevant rainfall patterns instead of a randomly scattered behaviour and that also rainfall erosivity has recognizable patterns within identified rainfall clusters for this reason the number of clusters is not subject to any in deep analysis and no further cluster refinement is conducted accounting for possible clustering effects calibration of a novel empirical model to compute annual r factor is performed by means of a regression procedure including the potentially relevant variables used as covariates which can be summarized in annual cumulative precipitation pr mm elevation z m a s l and latitude lat north although these variables are characterized by a certain degree of correlation due to the peculiar geographic orographic settings of italy e g with higher precipitation usually at higher either elevation or latitude this choice is consistent both with the aforementioned assumption of only relying on simple climate geographic and topographic covariates and with literature grimm et al 2003 diodato and bellocchi 2007 nearing et al 2015 panagos et al 2015a grimm et al 2003 as expected from the literature review table 3 the major role is expected to be played by cumulative annual precipitation as concerns the mathematical expression for the empirical model a multivariate linear regression should be avoided since there are relevant chances that negative predicted values could result from specific combinations of the predictors in addition a linear model would predict finite rainfall erosivity for zero rainfall in the present paper the proposed empirical model for the estimation of average annual r factors is the following 8 r p r c 1 c 2 z c 3 l a t c 4 where c1 c2 c3 and c4 are the regression coefficients the proposed model whose expression is novel in the framework of rainfall erosivity represents an alternative version of a multivariate power regression the main difference lying in the location of the intercept in this way the model is able to predict r 0 for pr 0 and it also provides finite positive rainfall erosivity for zero elevation if c2 0 the mathematical complexity of eq 8 coupled with the possible collinearity among the predictors and with the unbalanced correlation of the predictand with the three predictors makes the calibration of the parameters values particularly delicate because of the possible existence of multiple local minima for the optimization function which in this research is the square sum of errors sse preliminary analysis suggests that eq 8 is particularly sensitive to the value of c 1 which is also expected by looking at the different power models in table 3 whereas the calibrated values of c 2 c 3 and c 4 show a large variability for different initial conditions the efficiency of the proposed regression model can be tested by means of the usual goodness of fit measures such as the coefficient of determination r 2 after feeding it with rain gauge information annual precipitation elevation latitude and comparing estimated r factors with those coming from the rigorous sub hourly approach subsequently the custom empirical model can be applied to the different gridded datasets era5 e obs era5 land scia ispra and resulting r factors compared to those from redes grid remapped at the same resolution in other words for each rainfall dataset the redes grid map is aggregated at the same horizontal resolution so that anomalies can be computed as cell by cell standardized differences between empirical r factor coming from the application of eq 8 to the rainfall dataset and the reference r factor coming from the aggregation of redes grid r factor from its native resolution of 500 m to the target resolution of the rainfall dataset since evaluation of the performances of different gridded rainfall datasets is the main focus of the research a comparison of different mathematical expressions for the empirical model is not shown in the paper however it is worth noticing that eq 8 was found to be the best fit for observed data also outperforming multivariate linear regression finally in order to understand the role of such performances in practical applications custom model results are used to extract average r factor aggregated at the nuts 3 level the nuts classification nomenclature of territorial units for statistics is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of the eu for different purposes eurostat 2021 in this perspective the nuts 3 level corresponds to the smallest territorial unit provinces in italy and it is considered suitable for specific diagnoses of particular interest for local decision makers for the italian country the average extent of nuts 3 is about 3000 kmq results are then compared to the nuts 3 average r factors extracted from the redes grid dataset previously aggregated at the same horizontal resolution of the rainfall grid 5 results and discussion 5 1 homogenisation fig 1 shows the results of the calibration of eq 7 performed irrespective of any seasonal effect results suggest that there is no evidence that this assumption is violated since monthly data points fig 1b gather along the lines calibrated for the annual data fig 1a in other words lower resolutions provide an underestimation of r factors of the same entity independently of the specific month of the year calibration coefficients of eq 7 are α 5 m i n 0 812 α 10 m i n 0 842 and α 15 m i n 0 880 as expected the coarser the resolution the higher the underestimation of r factors 5 2 efficiency of empirical models for the 171 rain gauges included in the shr dataset hereafter referred to as shr rain gauges fig 2 shows the goodness of fit for each of the empirical models in table 3 relying on rainfall data aggregated at the monthly or annual level against the rigorous approach relying on eq 5 which makes direct use of sub hourly data for each model the accordance is expressed by comparing the data regression line to the 1 1 line representing perfect fit results are also shown in table 4 which reports the coefficient of determination r 2 providing information about the amount of observed variance in r factors explained by each model the intercept and slope of the regression line between the two r factor samples providing information about the bias and distortion of the estimates caused by the model and the root mean square error rmse note that a perfect fit implies r 2 1 null intercept unitary slope and rmse 0 table 4 highlights that none of the empirical models is able to efficiently capture the observed variance in r factors since the highest r 2 value is about 0 60 proving that pr and mfi are indeed significant predictors for rainfall erosivity but there exists some underlying process or variability that models do not catch moreover slope values significantly different from unity prove that all models cause a significant distortion in the estimate of r factors in particular i models 1 2 8 15 18 20 21 provide an overall overestimation of r factors due to either a distortion in the estimate or to a systematic bias or a combination of both ii models 3 7 16 17 19 provide an overall underestimation of r factors a comprehensive look at the goodness of fit metrics in table 4 shows that models 1 10 12 15 can be considered among the available ones the best prediction of observed r factors providing the best compromise between the amount of explained variance and the quality of prediction it should be noted for instance that models 17 and 19 provide low values for rmse and high values of r 2 but the intercept and slope values also shown by fig 2 suggest an unacceptable underestimation especially of the largest r factors conversely model 20 is characterized by fair values for both r 2 and slope but it is associated to large prediction biases which also causes a high rmse it is also interesting to note that there is no particular connection between the accordance level and the reference domain of each model for instance model 16 calibrated for sicily and model 19 calibrated for the italian country seem not to perform correctly for the present case proving that calibration of empirical models is extremely sensitive to the quality and amount of input data as well as to the different climate conditions therefore calibration and validation of r factors still constitute a challenging issue and a research opportunity consistently with the consideration that a robust estimate of r factors can be obtained by averaging the results of different empirical models bazzoffi 2007 an ensemble of models providing the best fit hereafter labelled emp 1 is selected made up of models 1 10 12 15 moreover a second ensemble is considered hereafter labelled emp 2 made up of models 1 2 8 10 12 13 this second ensemble is the one suggested by bazzoffi 2007 for the italian country also adopted by the c3s demo case soil erosion commissioned by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf aimed at showing the potential of the copernicus cds in the field of soil loss estimation in terms of datasets and computational capabilities https climate copernicus eu soil erosion it can be noted that four of the six models in the emp 2 ensemble are shared with emp 1 confirming the reliability of the approach performed in bazzoffi 2007 any differences between results for the two ensembles can be ascribed to the higher performance of models 14 and 15 compared to models 2 and 8 fig 2 and table 4 show the performance of the two proposed ensembles in terms of goodness of fit with respect to the rigorous approach provided by eq 5 it can be noted that emp 1 provides better estimates than emp 2 with moderate bias and dispersion whereas emp 2 provides considerable overestimation of the largest r factors however in both cases there still exists a large portion of unexplained variance revealing in r 2 values just slightly higher than 0 60 5 3 performance of gridded precipitation datasets fig 3 shows the averaged results coming from the application of the empirical models in emp 1 and emp 2 basing on the gridded precipitation datasets era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra for the period 2002 2011 results are shown in terms of percentage anomalies evaluated comparing results with redes grid considered as reference for the same decade provided at the native resolution of 500 m and aggregated at the same resolution of each rainfall dataset evident positive anomalies can be observed implying an overestimation of r factors reaching values higher than 200 however the performances of the four datasets are quite different era5 and era5 land provide an overestimation over the entire country except for some small regions within the main islands e obs overestimates r factors over mountainous chains while it underestimates over plains and coastal areas scia ispra has an intermediate behaviour results are similar between the two ensembles consistently with the large overlap of empirical models between emp 1 and emp 2 such anomalies can be ascribed both to the use of the empirical models and to the use of a gridded rainfall dataset although the poor performance of empirical models from fig 2 suggests a major role of the former 5 4 clustering of spatio temporal patterns fig 4 shows for each of the 9 clusters resulting from the application of the som the envelope of all the monthly patterns included in each cluster along with the cluster centroid all the clusters are considered sufficiently populated namely with a size 5 fig 5 shows for the same clusters monthly r factor patterns computed with the rigorous approach despite the small number of rain gauges 171 compared to the orographic variability and latitudinal extent of the italian country fig 6 right panel clustering results confirm with some approximation results of a similar clustering performed for the italian domain but based on era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra gridded datasets padulano et al 2020 comparison between fig 4 and fig 5 highlights different behaviours regulating the transformation of rainfall into erosivity that can be explained with the support of fig 6 showing the spatial distribution of clusters along with the altitudes extracted from the 20 mt digital elevation model for italy mattm 2003 and used as visual reference moving from southern to northern italy fig 6 figs 4 and 5 show that the main differences among clusters are due either to the intra annual rainfall pattern or to its annual cumulated value or to their combination in this perspective it is worth noting that the identified clusters roughly match the bio geographical regions over italy borrelli et al 2016 cervellini et al 2020 clusters 7 8 and 9 consist in similar rainfall patterns with decreasing average annual precipitation they occur over the tyrrhenian coast with low precipitation values during jja months and higher values in djf months however with peaks decreasing from cluster 7 to 9 probably due to elevations for these clusters centroids of erosivity patterns provide higher r factors in sond months and a plateau in the rest of the year with very similar average annual r factor values cluster 6 is the recurring pattern over the adriatic coast characterized by the same behaviour as the tyrrhenian clusters but with less pronounced seasonal rainfall variability and a very small annual cumulative precipitation corresponding r factor pattern is very similar to cluster 9 but with even lower average annual erosivity and less evident increase in autumn early winter cluster 6 also occurs in the lower part of pianura padana clusters 1 2 and 3 occur over the alpine arc from the highest altitudes cluster 1 sloping down towards pianura padana cluster 3 and show a different behaviour with the rainfall season encompassing spring and autumn months but with significant rainfall values also during summer and low values in the coldest season such a pattern captures the typical climatology of mountain areas isotta et al 2014 moreover a poor performance of rainfall sensors in accounting for snowfall amounts could also take place rainfall of wettest seasons and consequently average annual rainfall values decrease from cluster 1 to 3 r factor patterns show a peak around jas again with decreasing average values consistently with average rainfall cluster 4 shows a rainfall pattern very similar to cluster 1 confirming late autumn as the wettest season but with an inverted trend between spring and summer compared to cluster 1 with the last becoming the dry season corresponding r factor pattern shows the highest erosivity moved to son months compared to cluster 1 cluster 5 consists in a transition from cluster 4 to cluster 6 with a decrease in both jja and son rainfall and less pronounced seasonal variability the same behaviour can be observed for the r factor pattern comparison of fig 4 and fig 5 shows that there exists a correspondence between rainfall clusters and rainfall erosivity clusters reinforcing the assumption that cumulative precipitation values can be successfully used as a predictor for annual average rainfall erosivity taking into account territorial peculiarities 5 5 calibration of a custom empirical model fig 6 shows that the assumption of a unique process valid for the whole italy describing the translation of average annual precipitation in rainfall erosivity can be questioned in other words clustering results especially in terms of spatial contiguity and zonation drive further analyses towards the introduction of additional explanatory variables representing location this strategy was considered easier and more effective than searching for different equations or calibrations for each cluster separately a questionable operation because of the scarcely populated clusters with no attempt of understanding or explaining the physical processes at the basis of spatial variability of rainfall erosivity which would need invoking other information such as the seasonality of highly erosive storm events concurrence with high or low temperatures and other physical covariates possibly at higher temporal resolutions calibration of eq 8 by means of shr rain gauges was performed randomly half splitting the shr dataset in a calibration sample sized 86 and a validation sample sized 85 the ordinary least square fitting for the calibration sample provides c 1 1 66 c 2 39 2 c 3 0 89 and c 4 0 63 with r 2 0 89 and rmse 353 8 the validation sample provides r 2 0 71 and rmse 486 5 in both cases the goodness of fit measures are significantly higher than that of any empirical model in table 4 as well as of the proposed ensembles fig 7 a shows for the entire shr dataset that the proposed model is a good compromise in terms of estimated bias and distortion as shown by the regression line that provides an intercept of 188 and a slope equal to 0 85 which are significantly closer to the perfect fit than any proposed empirical model or ensemble of them for comparison purposes the r 2 value of the regression line is also provided equal to 0 81 fig 7b shows that residuals can be considered randomly distributed homoscedastic and uncorrelated with variables in eq 8 demonstrating the suitability of the proposed correlation model overall 54 of data are included in the 20 band 94 in the 50 band and 100 in the 100 band fig 8 shows the outcomes of the application of eq 8 with calibrated coefficients basing on the gridded precipitation datasets era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively in terms of both r factor anomaly with respect to redes grid along the common decade 2002 2011 fig 8 top panel and r factor maps over 1981 2010 fig 8 bottom panel in this case not only precipitation values but also elevations are derived from the gridded products whereas latitude refers to the grid cell centre comparing these r factor anomalies to fig 3 for each rainfall datasets the performance of the custom model is significantly higher with a large portion of the domain characterized by anomalies included in the range 20 era5 and era5 land also provide a balanced overestimation and underestimation in the north and in the main islands respectively suggesting a normal distribution of anomalies consistent with the normal distribution of the calibration residuals shown in fig 7b instead e obs provides a biased behaviour with a larger portion of the domain with underestimated r factors finally the behaviour of the scia ispra dataset is also tested in this case the performance is the best with almost the entire country included in the anomaly range 20 and only a few small areas with high overestimation underestimation the higher performance of scia ispra can be explained by a combination of its improved accuracy as an observational dataset relying on a larger number of time series than for instance e obs and consequently its finer horizontal resolution which is more consistent with the point scale calibration of eq 8 the anomaly patterns are also shown in fig 9 in terms of relative frequency along with the 20 50 and 100 bands in all cases anomalies are consistent with the calibration residuals with percentage of cells included in the 20 band equal to 36 32 36 and 51 for era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively percentage of cells included in the 50 band equal to 75 83 79 and 90 for era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively percentage of cells included in the 100 band equal to 96 100 96 and 99 for era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively for all the datasets the distribution of anomalies is normal like with some differences for era5 and era5 land the normal behaviour is quite platykurtic implying a high variance and slightly biased towards positive anomalies for e obs and scia ispra the behaviour is leptokurtic implying that most of the domain is very close to the average anomaly which is roughly null for scia ispra note that zero anomaly implies perfect fit whereas there is a consistent bias towards negative anomalies for e obs implying larger areas with underestimated r factors as confirmed by visual inspection of fig 8 for all the datasets a slight positive skewness can be observed particularly for era5 summarizing fig 7 highlights that the combined use of the custom model in eq 8 and the cumulative precipitation observations from the rain gauges in table 2 provides a fair representation of the rigorous r factors computed basing on sub hourly rainfall data from the shr dataset similarly fig 9 highlights that the combined use of the custom model in eq 8 and the gridded rainfall map provided by the scia ispra dataset gives the best reproduction of the redes grid dataset comparison between the residuals distribution in fig 7b and anomaly distributions in fig 9 shows that moving from the point scale to the spatial scale does not entail an inflation in the overall error which is in both cases roughly normally distributed with approximately zero mean therefore it can be deduced that the main source of error is the use of the proposed empirical model whereas the use of specific datasets may act on the average prediction error among the cds rainfall datasets era5 land gives the best results although with a larger but still moderate dispersion and bias than scia ispra among the cds datasets era5 land should be preferred to e obs which shows a smaller variance because of the negative bias of the latter providing unacceptable underestimation of r factors finally fig 8 bottom panel shows the spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity over italy for the reference period 1981 2010 coherently with the redes grid map all the datasets provide high r factors over the alps and some mountainous areas over the apennines and low values on the main plains and over particularly arid areas such as the main islands and the southern adriatic coast 5 6 final validation previous sections show advantages and drawbacks for the combined use of empirical models and gridded rainfall datasets especially in terms of anomaly distribution and spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity looking at practical applications addressing potential users like local decision makers or administrators fig 10 shows that at the nuts3 level provinces in italy era5 and era5 land provide approximately undistorted estimates of r factors although with a significant dispersion and bias that decrease with increasing horizontal resolution namely moving from era5 r 2 0 42 to era5 land r 2 0 55 scia ispra provides the best estimate r 2 0 72 with an approximately undistorted and unbiased prediction of r factors and a limited dispersion e obs provides again the worst estimate r 2 0 44 with significant bias and distortion and a significant underestimation in the entire range of r factors and especially for the highest values 6 conclusions the present research is aimed at investigating how empirical models exploiting precipitation values at coarse resolution coming from readily available gridded precipitation datasets can support the assessment of rainfall erosivity over italy in this perspective the main focus is given on one hand to the performance of empirical models for the estimation of r factors and on the other hand to the use of gridded precipitation datasets instead of rain gauge observations concerning the first issue 21 empirical models are tested most of them relying on monthly annual cumulative precipitation against r factors rigorously estimated basing on sub hourly data from 171 rain gauges covering the period 2002 2011 results show that model performances table 4 and fig 2 are very different even for similar structures of model equations table 3 while most of those models fail in reproducing rigorous r factors a limited number of them taken as a single or combined in two relevant ensembles explain about 60 of total variance although with significant distortion and bias in the prediction which become even more relevant when coupled with gridded rainfall datasets fig 3 after demonstrating the drawbacks of relying on literature empirical models for the estimation of annual average r factors a novel customized empirical model eq 8 is proposed that builds on simple climate geographic and topographic variables the choice of the model whose calibration builds on the rigorous r factors estimated at the rain gauge level is supported and justified by the analysis of spatial patterns of rainfall and erosivity by means of a self organizing map the custom model shows highly improved performance compared to both the 21 literature models and the two proposed ensembles explaining about 80 of the total variance building on the custom model and on the redes grid r factor map taken as reference despite the uncertainties coming from the use of spatial interpolation building on a limited number of point scale data the performance of different gridded rainfall datasets very popular in practical and scientifical applications and easily retrievable within the cds is tested as well as the performance of the official italian gridded rainfall product the added value given by the adoption of the gridded rainfall datasets is twofold on one hand it encompasses one significant flaw in currently available sub hourly rainfall datasets that is the limited number of years of observations for instance in italy sub hourly data are usually not available before 2000 as well as the generally poor quality of sub hourly rainfall time series questioning the robustness of the estimate of r factors by the rigorous definition given by eq 5 conversely gridded rainfall datasets usually building on daily observations cover larger time periods on the other hand under the assumption that empirical models such as the one proposed by eq 8 are valuable the use of gridded rainfall datasets bypasses the need of interpolating rain gauge values because they already integrate a reproduction of spatial variability dynamics for rainfall although in different ways reanalysis regression based kriging simple kriging for era5 era5 land e obs and scia ispra respectively the overall performance of gridded datasets in reproducing rainfall erosivity over italy is quantified in terms of percentage anomalies with respected to the redes grid dataset over the common period 2002 2011 fig 8 top panel and fig 9 as well as in terms of r factor aggregation at the nuts3 level fig 10 in all cases e obs provides the worst estimates with an unacceptable underestimation all over the domain in this regard it is worth recalling that the performance of the interpolation required by e obs is among the considered datasets the most affected by the available number and density of rain gauges that are not evenly distributed especially in southern italy era5 and era5 land show a similar behaviour in terms of anomalies with balanced prediction errors and a dispersion that decreases for increasing horizontal resolution although with a higher positive bias for era5 land compared to era5 this is consistent with the fact that era5 land is an interpolation of era5 with an improvement in the resolution but no additional information or data scia ispra provides the best results consistently with the finer horizontal resolution and the improved quality of the interpolation due to the higher number of considered rain gauges for all the datasets comparison between anomaly distributions fig 9 and calibration residuals fig 7 suggests that prediction errors are mainly due to the use of an empirical model than to the use of a gridded rainfall dataset among the cds datasets era5 land can be considered the best performing if coupled with the custom empirical model however scia ispra proves to give even better predictions than era5 land with approximately undistorted and unbiased estimates and narrow dispersion the final outcomes of the research consist in r factor maps over italy covering the period 1981 2010 with diverse but acceptable reliability fig 8 bottom panel this demonstrates how gridded precipitation

8258,the paper considers a methodology to assess rainfall erosivity in italy for the recent decades 1981 2010 building on datasets and materials freely available such as those included within the climate data store cds of the copernicus climate change service c3s twenty one referenced empirical models to assess rainfall erosivity r factor based on coarse rainfall data are tested and compared then a custom model is calibrated with the support of seasonal rainfall pattern clustering by means of the self organizing map moreover a large database of sub hourly rainfall observations covering the period 2002 2011 is collected and used for validation model performances are analysed at the point scale of the rain gauges and at the spatial scale of different relevant gridded rainfall products the fifth generation of ecmwf reanalysis era5 era5 land the gridded european observational dataset e obs all included in the cds and scia ispra the italian standard rainfall gridded dataset new hydrological insights from the region the proposed methodology provides four alternatives of spatially distributed rainfall erosivity datasets covering italy with diverse levels of reliability analysis of results shows that the best performance is achieved by the combined use of the custom model and the scia ispra dataset followed by era5 land with the main source of error lying in the use of an empirical model instead of the rigorous model for r factor estimation and secondly in the use of gridded rainfall data instead of point scale rainfall observations keywords climate reanalysis copernicus climate data store empirical r factor models gridded observations dataset rainfall erosivity italy 1 introduction in the last decades soil erosion and erosion related issues have raised great attention at the european level for instance soil erosion was among the threats on soils listed within the soil thematic strategy of 2006 ec 2006 it was recognized as of interest for the eu common agricultural policy cap ec 2013a and the 7th environment action programme ec 2013b it was included as indicator in the 2012 climate change impacts and vulnerability report of the european environment agency eea eea 2012 and concerning italy in the draft of national climate change adaptation plan mattm 2017 across europe soil loss rates due to water more than twice than those due to wind eea 1995 cause damages to agriculture with costs reaching 1 26 billion 295 million and 155 million in terms of crop production net agricultural production and gross domestic product gdp respectively with the italian country at the top of these costs panagos et al 2018 and of affected area panagos et al 2015b therefore a proper evaluation of soil loss rates represents a pivotal step for zoning the most susceptible areas and identifying effective mitigation measures limiting to rainfall related rill and sheet erosion the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 has been widely adopted rusle is an empirical regression equation that enables identifying the main drivers of the process and calibrating validating the related significance and reciprocal weight it is not able to provide event based assessments but only annual evaluations of spatially and temporally lumped soil loss rusle was developed as an improvement of the usle method wischmeier and smith 1978 and similarly to the main empirical models on soil loss potential due to erosion it is a combination of the erosivity factor detaching particles from their position in the soil rainfall in this case r factor and the soil susceptibility factors i e those characteristics that make a soil more or less prone to erosion including here not only the intrinsic and state soil physical and chemical properties erodibility k factor but also the topographic settings slope length and steepness ls factor as well as land cover and management c factor and support practices to prevent mitigate erosion p factor largely depending on human actions the characterization and proper evaluation of rainfall erosivity is commonly recognized a challenging issue r factors represent an average annual rainfall erosivity due to all the storm events occurred over a significant number of years according to the rusle methodology r factor estimation should rely on long series of sub hourly rainfall observations so that storm events causing erosion usually identified by the maximum intensity over a 30 minute window whose estimation requires rainfall data at least at 30 minute resolution can be correctly assessed renard et al 1997 however poor availability of long and complete time series of high resolution rainfall data ferro et al 1991 verstraeten and poesen 2006 fiener et al 2013 makes this rigorous approach quite difficult to apply requiring the adoption of alternative simplified empirical models relying on rainfall data with coarser temporal resolutions such as the daily monthly and annual scales benavidez et al 2018 empirical models for the estimation of r factors are affected by different degrees of approximation resulting in different performance levels when compared to the rigorous approach bonilla and vidal 2011 ramos and durán 2014 benavidez et al 2018 guesri et al 2020 daily rainfall time series and related aggregations at the monthly or annual scale can be used to detect variables such as cumulative values number of days exceeding a threshold in rainfall volumes or intensities that can be assumed as proxies of either single storm erosivity or of the r factor ramos and durán 2014 however significant deviations from rigorous r factor values considered as the most correct representation of reality can be observed even for models relying on daily data ramos and durán 2014 a large number of models exist that only rely on the average annual precipitation benavidez et al 2018 indeed relating variables representing complex physical processes to simple climate covariates at the annual scale is not an uncommon approach del giudice et al 2014 such models are suitable to assess r factors only over areas where large rainfall erosivity corresponds to large rainfall intensities ferro et al 1999 in this perspective it should be noted that by definition r factors represent average erosivity conditions in time and space so that extremely intense storm events should be treated as outliers and neglected for erosivity assessments yin et al 2017 given the above mentioned considerations regional studies for the assessment of r factors and consequent soil losses are still an open research topic applications of empirical models can be found to assess spatial and temporal trends of rainfall erosivity using daily choukri et al 2016 lai et al 2016 xie

sub hourly data can be found for a few regions of the world nanko et al 2016 schmidt et al 2016 diodato et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2017 auerswald et al 2019 at the european level the redes project by the eu joint research centre jrc provided an r factor map with a horizontal resolution of 500 m building on an extensive database of sub hourly rainfall records as well as on a dataset of climate and physical covariates collected for the italian country at 251 rain gauges covering the period 2002 2011 panagos et al 2015a for italy an r factor map with a horizontal resolution of 300 m is also available that builds on the application of six different empirical models relying on monthly annual rainfall data bazzoffi 2007 it is worth noting that the above mentioned investigations differ not only for the model used for r factor assessment and consequently for the spatial temporal resolution of input rainfall data but also for the temporal coverage and especially for the specific interpolation technique adopted to move from the rain gauge point scale to spatially distributed maps the present research focuses on the assessment of rainfall erosivity represented by the r factor variable over italy where rainfall data sources with different temporal and horizontal resolutions are available and several rainfall erosivity estimations have already been carried out in recent years adopting different standards for datasets methods and assumptions the manuscript is organized as follows first the rationale of the research here briefly introduced is described in detail in order to show the positioning of the paper in the field literature second the exploited materials are described with particular focus on the rainfall products available in climate data store cds of the copernicus climate change service c3s and the additional support rainfall datasets used for validation purposes and the adopted methodology is recalled finally the main results are presented and discussed and significant conclusions are drawn 2 rationale of the research the assessment of spatially distributed r factors describing current rainfall erosivity conditions requires spatialized observational datasets describing rainfall regimes for several decades these datasets should be characterized by i a temporal resolution adequate to apply one or multiple models to compute r factors ii a horizontal resolution adequate to infer about locations where no information is available iii a temporal coverage adequate to efficiently describe erosivity regime as shown in the introduction section previous research may fail to comprehensively address all the issues specifically temporal coverage of historical time series of rainfall observations could be too short compared to suggested lengths of 20 30 years verstraeten and poesen 2006 meusburger et al 2012 this happens in italy because local authorities in charge of rainfall monitoring systems equipped rain gauges with high resolution but often different sensors with sub hourly data acquisition only after 2000 on average for example data used for the redes rainfall erosivity database at european scale project by jrc panagos et al 2015a only cover the period 2002 2011 for italy moreover it is well recognized that sub hourly rainfall data require deeper post processing in terms of missing data and outlier detection padulano and del giudice 2020 compared to hourly daily data with a computational effort that increases with increasing length and native time step of time series instead large long and reliable processed datasets of daily rainfall observations over italy are already available the distribution of rain gauges over the region of interest could be very heterogeneous for example italian rain gauges are managed by distinct local authorities resulting in different sensors spatial density acquisition frequency instrumental accuracy temporal coverage data validation and post processing this can require additional effort to homogenize rainfall data to feed erosivity computations moreover moving from point scale erosivity data to gridded erosivity datasets requires the adoption of one among the great number of existing spatial interpolation techniques from simple geostatistical approaches to numerical models introducing additional uncertainty and leading to possibly divergent results and different horizontal resolutions in the final maps for italy the adoption of empirical models building on a daily rainfall dataset bazzoffi 2007 led to a finer resolution in the r factor map compared to the redes product building on sub hourly data panagos et al 2015a the aim of the present research is to explore and discuss the usefulness of r factor maps describing current rainfall erosivity regime over italy building on consolidated literature approaches on climate data available from the cds datasets also embedding other spatialized geographic and topographic information e g latitude elevation and on other datasets used as benchmark and for evaluation comparison purposes the main features of the research address the above mentioned issues multiple gridded datasets derived from rainfall observations and included in the cds or other national portals are used to feed empirical rainfall erosivity models some datasets provide hourly rainfall values e g era5 and era5 land climate reanalysis datasets although the horizontal resolution and the associated parametrizations can entail noteworthy biases in the reproduction of sub daily rainfall dynamics hindering the straightforward adoption of hourly values other gridded datasets from observations interpolation such as e obs and scia ispra are characterized by a native daily time resolution under such constraints the application of empirical models driven by precipitation data based on coarser time step instead of the rigorous definition of r factor requiring sub hourly values is considered however a support rainfall dataset with sub hourly observations for a significant number of rain gauges across italy is collected for validation purposes the horizontal resolution of the gridded precipitation products drives the resolution of target r factor maps bypassing the choice and application of any spatial interpolation technique in other words the interpolation uncertainty in the r factor map which is the final product of the present research strongly builds on the interpolation uncertainty of the underlying rainfall map an ensemble of multiple empirical models retrieved in literature is used to account for the uncertainty coming from the adoption of methods that were conceived for different regions of the world basing on possibly different rainfall datasets additionally a custom model relying on the same coarse time step climate variables and geographic topographic attributes is calibrated 3 materials table 1 provides a list of the rainfall and r factor datasets used in the present research along with short relevant information the reference period adopted for baseline estimations is 1981 2010 in line with the current historical reference of the world meteorological organization climatological standard normals wmo 2020 and the reference spatial domain is the italian country all the datasets are available to cover such time and space domains unless otherwise specified the datasets included in the cds used for the main computations are the following era5 gridded rainfall reanalysis dataset with about 31 km horizontal resolution wide temporal 1950 present and spatial global coverage native hourly resolution but also directly available as monthly time series era5 land gridded rainfall reanalysis dataset coming from the interpolation of era5 at a finer horizontal resolution about 9 km for the same spatial domain with temporal coverage 1981 present and available at both hourly and monthly temporal resolution e obs v 20 gridded rainfall observational dataset coming from the interpolation of rainfall time series collected at a large number of rain gauges all over europe 1950 present the dataset is available at the daily scale with a horizontal resolution of about 11 km the datasets not included in the cds are the following scia ispra national system for collection and processing of climate data scia gridded observational rainfall dataset provided by the italian environmental protection agency ispra available at a horizontal resolution of 5 km this dataset comes from the interpolation of a large number of rain gauges with daily resolution covering the entire 20th century up to the present date with different reliability due to the different number of interpolated rain gauges available each year and providing data with different temporal aggregations including maximum daily rainfall and cumulative monthly and annual values desiato et al 2011 sub hourly rainfall shr sub hourly observational time series over the period 2002 2011 to ensure consistency at least with the redes product see below the dataset includes 191 rain gauges over 17 italian regions with different time steps in the range 5 30 min table 2 coarser time resolutions were not considered useful for rainfall erosivity computation sub hourly data were subject to a basic quality check in order to remove outliers and 20 rain gauges were rejected because of the anomalous number of outliers and or missing data with a final number of 171 reliable time series table 2 shows a list of the italian regions with available data along with the number of investigated rain gauges their temporal resolution and the local authority in charge of data collection and delivery to users as it will be discussed in detail in the methodology section this dataset is used to obtain point scale values for r factor that will be compared to the gridded results of the proposed models in order to test their accuracy and to quantify uncertainties redes grid r factor gridded dataset provided by the redes rainfall erosivity database at european scale project panagos et al 2015a covering the whole europe with a horizontal resolution of 500 m providing annual and monthly values of the r factor averaged over the period 1950 2013 2002 2011 for italy and building on a highly complex spatial kriging of r factors building on sub hourly rainfall observations from a large number of rain gauges more than for italy borrelli et al 2016 also accounting for correlations with relevant climate and physical covariates as particularly concerns the above mentioned gridded rainfall datasets era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra for increasing horizontal resolution it should be noticed that such datasets stem from the application of different techniques for instance era5 hersbach et al 2020 and era5 land muñoz sabater 2019 are reanalysis products coming from the data assimilation of historical observations provided by different sources satellite in situ multiple variables but not homogeneously distributed around the globe within a single consistent numerical weather prediction model they only differ for the detail level of the land module resulting in two different horizontal resolutions for the final rainfall dataset e obs is an ensemble made up of a large number of interpolation experiments covering europe with different levels of temporal and spatial coverage according to specific data availability and as a consequence with different performances cornes et al 2018 padulano et al 2020 similarly scia ispra comes from the spatial interpolation of a larger number of rain gauges but it is limited to the italian country despite the finer horizontal resolution of scia ispra suggesting a higher accuracy in representing observed rainfall the other rainfall datasets have recently gained a considerable popularity not only for their wider coverage but also because of the continuously improving quality testified by the frequently released updated versions 4 methods in this section the general framework for the estimation of r factor basing on sub hourly data is provided then the proposed methodology for the assessment of r factor basing on gridded precipitation data is described and additional tools and strategies for the analysis of results are mentioned 4 1 r factor definition rainfall erosivity r factor is a multi annual average index that measures rainfall kinetic energy and intensity describing the effect of rainfall on sheet and rill erosion wischmeier and smith 1978 the r factor is usually computed as the cumulative value of rainfall erosivities referred to erosive storm events occurred over a number of years and it is generally provided at the annual or monthly time scale wischmeier and smith 1978 provide a methodology to identify erosive storm events that consists in omitting rain showers of less than 12 7 mm unless 6 4 mm or more rain fell in 15 min a storm period with less than 1 3 mm in over 6 h is used to divide a longer storm period into two storms the rainfall erosivity of a given storm s is equal to the product of the total storm energy e mj ha with its maximum 30 minutes rainfall intensity i 30 mm h eq 1 1 r s e i 30 s as described by renard et al 1997 e is computed by discretizing the event into parts with constant intensity i as the cumulative product of specific rainfall energy e r mj ha mm by rainfall depth δvr mm for the r th increment eq 2 specific rainfall energy e r can be computed as suggested by brown and foster 1987 eq 3 2 e e r δ v r 3 e r 0 29 1 0 72 e x p 0 05 i r by considering all the storm events occurred in a specific month m over a period of n years it is possible to define the monthly averaged factor rm and the properly defined factor r as described in eq 4 and eq 5 4 r m 1 n i 1 n s 1 s m i e i 30 s 5 r 1 n i 1 n s 1 s i e i 30 s the empirical models used in the present research relate by means of simple linear or quadratic empirical equations the average annual monthly r factor r rm to the average annual monthly cumulative precipitation pr pr m or to the so called modified fournier index mfi defined by arnoldus 1977 as 6 m f i 1 p r m 1 12 p r m 2 table 3 shows a list of the empirical models used in the present research 4 2 preliminary assessment of empirical r factors application of empirical models in table 3 requires the extraction of monthly cumulative rainfall values from the four gridded rainfall datasets listed in table 1 era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra then those values are used to obtain spatially distributed annual mean of cumulative rainfall pr and mean annual modified fournier index mfi in eq 6 successively pr and mfi maps are used as input for the 21 empirical models in table 3 to obtain 21 4 84 different r factor maps describing rainfall erosivity over italy for current climate conditions at this stage the considered time period is 2002 2011 to ensure comparison with redes grid according to bazzoffi 2007 for each dataset a reliable estimate of annual r factor is obtained averaging the results of multiple models providing the best representation of actual rainfall erosivity thus the final output is one r factor map for each observational dataset each map has a spatial resolution equal to the resolution of the reference dataset 31km 11km 9km and 5 km for era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively and represents rainfall erosivity conditions averaged over the period 2002 2011 possible discrepancies can be evaluated to investigate the effect of using different spatial resolutions for rainfall erosivity prediction as well as to understand the potentialities or possible drawbacks of the different observational datasets and interpolation methods 4 3 validation in accordance with catari et al 2011 and also accounting for the peculiarities of the present research the main sources of uncertainty in the proposed r factor estimation strategy lie in the adoption of empirical models and in the use of gridded precipitation datasets instead of point scale sub hourly rainfall observations other recognized sources of uncertainty are not in the scope of this research such as the efficiency of the equations used to estimate kinetic energy of rainfall and the possible measurement errors enabled only if raw rainfall data at the rain gauge level are used in order to validate empirical r factors the research builds on an extensive database of sub hourly rainfall observations covering the period 2002 2011 with a resolution ranging between 5 and 30 min collected at 191 rain gauges over 17 italian regions table 2 that can be used to derive point scale r factors according to the rigorous definition in eq 5 the proposed validation strategy is twofold the efficiency of the empirical models in table 3 in predicting rainfall erosivity can be tested comparing for each rain gauge the output of each empirical model or of the ensemble of multiple models obtained using observed cumulative rainfall against the output of the rigorous approach in eq 5 fed by the same sub hourly data for this purpose reference dataset is shr the efficiency of the gridded rainfall products to compute rainfall erosivity can be tested by using them as input of the empirical models and comparing outputs with the redes grid dataset which is the only referenced r factor map for italy so far panagos et al 2015a aggregated at the same resolution of the gridded datasets 4 3 1 conversion factors for rainfall erosivity homogenisation a practical issue that must be faced when estimating rigorous r factors consists in the difference among the time resolutions of the adopted rain gauges that typically range between 1 and 30 min in case of sub hourly acquisition coarser time resolutions provide underestimated r factors with respect to higher resolutions since the i 30 parameter is underestimated when the time step approaches the 30 min window to address the problem a homogenization is performed by calibrating conversion equations relating high resolution r factors namely r factors computed at the native resolution of each rain gauge in shr to low resolution r factors namely r factors computed for each rain gauge in shr using aggregated rainfall data at the coarsest resolution borrelli et al 2016 in the present research the coarsest resolution is 30 min whereas other rain gauges are available at 5 10 and 15 min so that the following relationships can be assumed 7 r 30 m i n α k r k where subscript k identifies available resolutions finer than 30 min from previous considerations calibration parameter αk is expected to be 1 for the region of interest the significance of the dependence should be verified both on a monthly and on an annual basis finally it is worth noting that for the calibration of eq 7 sub hourly data can be aggregated in cascade for instance 5 min data can be used for the calibration of eq 7 with k 5 min and successively aggregated at 10 min resolution for the calibration of eq 7 with k 10 min and at 15 min resolution for the calibration of eq 7 with k 15 min in addition to data at the corresponding native resolution with no distortion in the estimates rain gauges provide sub hourly rainfall observations that can be aggregated at the monthly annual scale to obtain average annual cumulative precipitation pr and average mfi over the period 2002 2011 in turn the use of those observed values of pr and mfi can be used as the input for the empirical models in table 3 resulting point scale empirical r factor values can be statistically compared to homogenized point scale rigorous r factor values to understand the reliability of empirical models 4 4 spatio temporal patterns and calibration of a new model as a novelty element a customized empirical model is proposed and then tested relying on simple geographic topographic and climate variables retrievable in the gridded precipitation datasets adopted to drive the choice of the variables and to provide further insights on the variability of the italian rainfall erosivity regime a pattern detection is also performed to identify possible regions with similar behaviours in the present research pattern detection focuses on observed monthly precipitation data averaged over the period 2002 2011 pattern detection is performed by means of the self organizing map som an unsupervised clustering tool based on neural networks kohonen 1982 the output of som is represented by the output neuron grid where each neuron is populated by input patterns according to some distance measures that should be minimized within each neuron and maximized among the neurons the number of possible output clusters is one of the key settings in case of completely unsupervised clustering as in the present research a small grid size should be preferred at least for preliminary assessments padulano and del giudice 2018 each output neuron can be empty or filled with one or more input patterns each neuron can be regarded to as a separate cluster or additional considerations such as visual inspection of neighbouring distances component planes or data labels verdú et al 2006 laspidou et al 2015 can lead to a merging of the nearest neurons with the consequent refinement and reduction of clusters padulano and del giudice 2018 finally the average pattern of each cluster can be regarded to as the representative or centroid of the cluster basing on the observed precipitation data for the 171 available rain gauges the som is run to identify possible patterns in average monthly precipitation to study the performance of empirical models in predicting rainfall erosivity for large areas such as the italian country using as input the average monthly and annual precipitation values for each rain gauge the som is run with a grid dimension equal to 3 thus the total number of expected clusters is 3 3 9 chosen as sufficiently small to capture regional climate variability as will be shown in the following sections for the present research the main aim of the clustering is demonstrating the existence of relevant rainfall patterns instead of a randomly scattered behaviour and that also rainfall erosivity has recognizable patterns within identified rainfall clusters for this reason the number of clusters is not subject to any in deep analysis and no further cluster refinement is conducted accounting for possible clustering effects calibration of a novel empirical model to compute annual r factor is performed by means of a regression procedure including the potentially relevant variables used as covariates which can be summarized in annual cumulative precipitation pr mm elevation z m a s l and latitude lat north although these variables are characterized by a certain degree of correlation due to the peculiar geographic orographic settings of italy e g with higher precipitation usually at higher either elevation or latitude this choice is consistent both with the aforementioned assumption of only relying on simple climate geographic and topographic covariates and with literature grimm et al 2003 diodato and bellocchi 2007 nearing et al 2015 panagos et al 2015a grimm et al 2003 as expected from the literature review table 3 the major role is expected to be played by cumulative annual precipitation as concerns the mathematical expression for the empirical model a multivariate linear regression should be avoided since there are relevant chances that negative predicted values could result from specific combinations of the predictors in addition a linear model would predict finite rainfall erosivity for zero rainfall in the present paper the proposed empirical model for the estimation of average annual r factors is the following 8 r p r c 1 c 2 z c 3 l a t c 4 where c1 c2 c3 and c4 are the regression coefficients the proposed model whose expression is novel in the framework of rainfall erosivity represents an alternative version of a multivariate power regression the main difference lying in the location of the intercept in this way the model is able to predict r 0 for pr 0 and it also provides finite positive rainfall erosivity for zero elevation if c2 0 the mathematical complexity of eq 8 coupled with the possible collinearity among the predictors and with the unbalanced correlation of the predictand with the three predictors makes the calibration of the parameters values particularly delicate because of the possible existence of multiple local minima for the optimization function which in this research is the square sum of errors sse preliminary analysis suggests that eq 8 is particularly sensitive to the value of c 1 which is also expected by looking at the different power models in table 3 whereas the calibrated values of c 2 c 3 and c 4 show a large variability for different initial conditions the efficiency of the proposed regression model can be tested by means of the usual goodness of fit measures such as the coefficient of determination r 2 after feeding it with rain gauge information annual precipitation elevation latitude and comparing estimated r factors with those coming from the rigorous sub hourly approach subsequently the custom empirical model can be applied to the different gridded datasets era5 e obs era5 land scia ispra and resulting r factors compared to those from redes grid remapped at the same resolution in other words for each rainfall dataset the redes grid map is aggregated at the same horizontal resolution so that anomalies can be computed as cell by cell standardized differences between empirical r factor coming from the application of eq 8 to the rainfall dataset and the reference r factor coming from the aggregation of redes grid r factor from its native resolution of 500 m to the target resolution of the rainfall dataset since evaluation of the performances of different gridded rainfall datasets is the main focus of the research a comparison of different mathematical expressions for the empirical model is not shown in the paper however it is worth noticing that eq 8 was found to be the best fit for observed data also outperforming multivariate linear regression finally in order to understand the role of such performances in practical applications custom model results are used to extract average r factor aggregated at the nuts 3 level the nuts classification nomenclature of territorial units for statistics is a hierarchical system for dividing up the economic territory of the eu for different purposes eurostat 2021 in this perspective the nuts 3 level corresponds to the smallest territorial unit provinces in italy and it is considered suitable for specific diagnoses of particular interest for local decision makers for the italian country the average extent of nuts 3 is about 3000 kmq results are then compared to the nuts 3 average r factors extracted from the redes grid dataset previously aggregated at the same horizontal resolution of the rainfall grid 5 results and discussion 5 1 homogenisation fig 1 shows the results of the calibration of eq 7 performed irrespective of any seasonal effect results suggest that there is no evidence that this assumption is violated since monthly data points fig 1b gather along the lines calibrated for the annual data fig 1a in other words lower resolutions provide an underestimation of r factors of the same entity independently of the specific month of the year calibration coefficients of eq 7 are α 5 m i n 0 812 α 10 m i n 0 842 and α 15 m i n 0 880 as expected the coarser the resolution the higher the underestimation of r factors 5 2 efficiency of empirical models for the 171 rain gauges included in the shr dataset hereafter referred to as shr rain gauges fig 2 shows the goodness of fit for each of the empirical models in table 3 relying on rainfall data aggregated at the monthly or annual level against the rigorous approach relying on eq 5 which makes direct use of sub hourly data for each model the accordance is expressed by comparing the data regression line to the 1 1 line representing perfect fit results are also shown in table 4 which reports the coefficient of determination r 2 providing information about the amount of observed variance in r factors explained by each model the intercept and slope of the regression line between the two r factor samples providing information about the bias and distortion of the estimates caused by the model and the root mean square error rmse note that a perfect fit implies r 2 1 null intercept unitary slope and rmse 0 table 4 highlights that none of the empirical models is able to efficiently capture the observed variance in r factors since the highest r 2 value is about 0 60 proving that pr and mfi are indeed significant predictors for rainfall erosivity but there exists some underlying process or variability that models do not catch moreover slope values significantly different from unity prove that all models cause a significant distortion in the estimate of r factors in particular i models 1 2 8 15 18 20 21 provide an overall overestimation of r factors due to either a distortion in the estimate or to a systematic bias or a combination of both ii models 3 7 16 17 19 provide an overall underestimation of r factors a comprehensive look at the goodness of fit metrics in table 4 shows that models 1 10 12 15 can be considered among the available ones the best prediction of observed r factors providing the best compromise between the amount of explained variance and the quality of prediction it should be noted for instance that models 17 and 19 provide low values for rmse and high values of r 2 but the intercept and slope values also shown by fig 2 suggest an unacceptable underestimation especially of the largest r factors conversely model 20 is characterized by fair values for both r 2 and slope but it is associated to large prediction biases which also causes a high rmse it is also interesting to note that there is no particular connection between the accordance level and the reference domain of each model for instance model 16 calibrated for sicily and model 19 calibrated for the italian country seem not to perform correctly for the present case proving that calibration of empirical models is extremely sensitive to the quality and amount of input data as well as to the different climate conditions therefore calibration and validation of r factors still constitute a challenging issue and a research opportunity consistently with the consideration that a robust estimate of r factors can be obtained by averaging the results of different empirical models bazzoffi 2007 an ensemble of models providing the best fit hereafter labelled emp 1 is selected made up of models 1 10 12 15 moreover a second ensemble is considered hereafter labelled emp 2 made up of models 1 2 8 10 12 13 this second ensemble is the one suggested by bazzoffi 2007 for the italian country also adopted by the c3s demo case soil erosion commissioned by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf aimed at showing the potential of the copernicus cds in the field of soil loss estimation in terms of datasets and computational capabilities https climate copernicus eu soil erosion it can be noted that four of the six models in the emp 2 ensemble are shared with emp 1 confirming the reliability of the approach performed in bazzoffi 2007 any differences between results for the two ensembles can be ascribed to the higher performance of models 14 and 15 compared to models 2 and 8 fig 2 and table 4 show the performance of the two proposed ensembles in terms of goodness of fit with respect to the rigorous approach provided by eq 5 it can be noted that emp 1 provides better estimates than emp 2 with moderate bias and dispersion whereas emp 2 provides considerable overestimation of the largest r factors however in both cases there still exists a large portion of unexplained variance revealing in r 2 values just slightly higher than 0 60 5 3 performance of gridded precipitation datasets fig 3 shows the averaged results coming from the application of the empirical models in emp 1 and emp 2 basing on the gridded precipitation datasets era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra for the period 2002 2011 results are shown in terms of percentage anomalies evaluated comparing results with redes grid considered as reference for the same decade provided at the native resolution of 500 m and aggregated at the same resolution of each rainfall dataset evident positive anomalies can be observed implying an overestimation of r factors reaching values higher than 200 however the performances of the four datasets are quite different era5 and era5 land provide an overestimation over the entire country except for some small regions within the main islands e obs overestimates r factors over mountainous chains while it underestimates over plains and coastal areas scia ispra has an intermediate behaviour results are similar between the two ensembles consistently with the large overlap of empirical models between emp 1 and emp 2 such anomalies can be ascribed both to the use of the empirical models and to the use of a gridded rainfall dataset although the poor performance of empirical models from fig 2 suggests a major role of the former 5 4 clustering of spatio temporal patterns fig 4 shows for each of the 9 clusters resulting from the application of the som the envelope of all the monthly patterns included in each cluster along with the cluster centroid all the clusters are considered sufficiently populated namely with a size 5 fig 5 shows for the same clusters monthly r factor patterns computed with the rigorous approach despite the small number of rain gauges 171 compared to the orographic variability and latitudinal extent of the italian country fig 6 right panel clustering results confirm with some approximation results of a similar clustering performed for the italian domain but based on era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra gridded datasets padulano et al 2020 comparison between fig 4 and fig 5 highlights different behaviours regulating the transformation of rainfall into erosivity that can be explained with the support of fig 6 showing the spatial distribution of clusters along with the altitudes extracted from the 20 mt digital elevation model for italy mattm 2003 and used as visual reference moving from southern to northern italy fig 6 figs 4 and 5 show that the main differences among clusters are due either to the intra annual rainfall pattern or to its annual cumulated value or to their combination in this perspective it is worth noting that the identified clusters roughly match the bio geographical regions over italy borrelli et al 2016 cervellini et al 2020 clusters 7 8 and 9 consist in similar rainfall patterns with decreasing average annual precipitation they occur over the tyrrhenian coast with low precipitation values during jja months and higher values in djf months however with peaks decreasing from cluster 7 to 9 probably due to elevations for these clusters centroids of erosivity patterns provide higher r factors in sond months and a plateau in the rest of the year with very similar average annual r factor values cluster 6 is the recurring pattern over the adriatic coast characterized by the same behaviour as the tyrrhenian clusters but with less pronounced seasonal rainfall variability and a very small annual cumulative precipitation corresponding r factor pattern is very similar to cluster 9 but with even lower average annual erosivity and less evident increase in autumn early winter cluster 6 also occurs in the lower part of pianura padana clusters 1 2 and 3 occur over the alpine arc from the highest altitudes cluster 1 sloping down towards pianura padana cluster 3 and show a different behaviour with the rainfall season encompassing spring and autumn months but with significant rainfall values also during summer and low values in the coldest season such a pattern captures the typical climatology of mountain areas isotta et al 2014 moreover a poor performance of rainfall sensors in accounting for snowfall amounts could also take place rainfall of wettest seasons and consequently average annual rainfall values decrease from cluster 1 to 3 r factor patterns show a peak around jas again with decreasing average values consistently with average rainfall cluster 4 shows a rainfall pattern very similar to cluster 1 confirming late autumn as the wettest season but with an inverted trend between spring and summer compared to cluster 1 with the last becoming the dry season corresponding r factor pattern shows the highest erosivity moved to son months compared to cluster 1 cluster 5 consists in a transition from cluster 4 to cluster 6 with a decrease in both jja and son rainfall and less pronounced seasonal variability the same behaviour can be observed for the r factor pattern comparison of fig 4 and fig 5 shows that there exists a correspondence between rainfall clusters and rainfall erosivity clusters reinforcing the assumption that cumulative precipitation values can be successfully used as a predictor for annual average rainfall erosivity taking into account territorial peculiarities 5 5 calibration of a custom empirical model fig 6 shows that the assumption of a unique process valid for the whole italy describing the translation of average annual precipitation in rainfall erosivity can be questioned in other words clustering results especially in terms of spatial contiguity and zonation drive further analyses towards the introduction of additional explanatory variables representing location this strategy was considered easier and more effective than searching for different equations or calibrations for each cluster separately a questionable operation because of the scarcely populated clusters with no attempt of understanding or explaining the physical processes at the basis of spatial variability of rainfall erosivity which would need invoking other information such as the seasonality of highly erosive storm events concurrence with high or low temperatures and other physical covariates possibly at higher temporal resolutions calibration of eq 8 by means of shr rain gauges was performed randomly half splitting the shr dataset in a calibration sample sized 86 and a validation sample sized 85 the ordinary least square fitting for the calibration sample provides c 1 1 66 c 2 39 2 c 3 0 89 and c 4 0 63 with r 2 0 89 and rmse 353 8 the validation sample provides r 2 0 71 and rmse 486 5 in both cases the goodness of fit measures are significantly higher than that of any empirical model in table 4 as well as of the proposed ensembles fig 7 a shows for the entire shr dataset that the proposed model is a good compromise in terms of estimated bias and distortion as shown by the regression line that provides an intercept of 188 and a slope equal to 0 85 which are significantly closer to the perfect fit than any proposed empirical model or ensemble of them for comparison purposes the r 2 value of the regression line is also provided equal to 0 81 fig 7b shows that residuals can be considered randomly distributed homoscedastic and uncorrelated with variables in eq 8 demonstrating the suitability of the proposed correlation model overall 54 of data are included in the 20 band 94 in the 50 band and 100 in the 100 band fig 8 shows the outcomes of the application of eq 8 with calibrated coefficients basing on the gridded precipitation datasets era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively in terms of both r factor anomaly with respect to redes grid along the common decade 2002 2011 fig 8 top panel and r factor maps over 1981 2010 fig 8 bottom panel in this case not only precipitation values but also elevations are derived from the gridded products whereas latitude refers to the grid cell centre comparing these r factor anomalies to fig 3 for each rainfall datasets the performance of the custom model is significantly higher with a large portion of the domain characterized by anomalies included in the range 20 era5 and era5 land also provide a balanced overestimation and underestimation in the north and in the main islands respectively suggesting a normal distribution of anomalies consistent with the normal distribution of the calibration residuals shown in fig 7b instead e obs provides a biased behaviour with a larger portion of the domain with underestimated r factors finally the behaviour of the scia ispra dataset is also tested in this case the performance is the best with almost the entire country included in the anomaly range 20 and only a few small areas with high overestimation underestimation the higher performance of scia ispra can be explained by a combination of its improved accuracy as an observational dataset relying on a larger number of time series than for instance e obs and consequently its finer horizontal resolution which is more consistent with the point scale calibration of eq 8 the anomaly patterns are also shown in fig 9 in terms of relative frequency along with the 20 50 and 100 bands in all cases anomalies are consistent with the calibration residuals with percentage of cells included in the 20 band equal to 36 32 36 and 51 for era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively percentage of cells included in the 50 band equal to 75 83 79 and 90 for era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively percentage of cells included in the 100 band equal to 96 100 96 and 99 for era5 e obs era5 land and scia ispra respectively for all the datasets the distribution of anomalies is normal like with some differences for era5 and era5 land the normal behaviour is quite platykurtic implying a high variance and slightly biased towards positive anomalies for e obs and scia ispra the behaviour is leptokurtic implying that most of the domain is very close to the average anomaly which is roughly null for scia ispra note that zero anomaly implies perfect fit whereas there is a consistent bias towards negative anomalies for e obs implying larger areas with underestimated r factors as confirmed by visual inspection of fig 8 for all the datasets a slight positive skewness can be observed particularly for era5 summarizing fig 7 highlights that the combined use of the custom model in eq 8 and the cumulative precipitation observations from the rain gauges in table 2 provides a fair representation of the rigorous r factors computed basing on sub hourly rainfall data from the shr dataset similarly fig 9 highlights that the combined use of the custom model in eq 8 and the gridded rainfall map provided by the scia ispra dataset gives the best reproduction of the redes grid dataset comparison between the residuals distribution in fig 7b and anomaly distributions in fig 9 shows that moving from the point scale to the spatial scale does not entail an inflation in the overall error which is in both cases roughly normally distributed with approximately zero mean therefore it can be deduced that the main source of error is the use of the proposed empirical model whereas the use of specific datasets may act on the average prediction error among the cds rainfall datasets era5 land gives the best results although with a larger but still moderate dispersion and bias than scia ispra among the cds datasets era5 land should be preferred to e obs which shows a smaller variance because of the negative bias of the latter providing unacceptable underestimation of r factors finally fig 8 bottom panel shows the spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity over italy for the reference period 1981 2010 coherently with the redes grid map all the datasets provide high r factors over the alps and some mountainous areas over the apennines and low values on the main plains and over particularly arid areas such as the main islands and the southern adriatic coast 5 6 final validation previous sections show advantages and drawbacks for the combined use of empirical models and gridded rainfall datasets especially in terms of anomaly distribution and spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity looking at practical applications addressing potential users like local decision makers or administrators fig 10 shows that at the nuts3 level provinces in italy era5 and era5 land provide approximately undistorted estimates of r factors although with a significant dispersion and bias that decrease with increasing horizontal resolution namely moving from era5 r 2 0 42 to era5 land r 2 0 55 scia ispra provides the best estimate r 2 0 72 with an approximately undistorted and unbiased prediction of r factors and a limited dispersion e obs provides again the worst estimate r 2 0 44 with significant bias and distortion and a significant underestimation in the entire range of r factors and especially for the highest values 6 conclusions the present research is aimed at investigating how empirical models exploiting precipitation values at coarse resolution coming from readily available gridded precipitation datasets can support the assessment of rainfall erosivity over italy in this perspective the main focus is given on one hand to the performance of empirical models for the estimation of r factors and on the other hand to the use of gridded precipitation datasets instead of rain gauge observations concerning the first issue 21 empirical models are tested most of them relying on monthly annual cumulative precipitation against r factors rigorously estimated basing on sub hourly data from 171 rain gauges covering the period 2002 2011 results show that model performances table 4 and fig 2 are very different even for similar structures of model equations table 3 while most of those models fail in reproducing rigorous r factors a limited number of them taken as a single or combined in two relevant ensembles explain about 60 of total variance although with significant distortion and bias in the prediction which become even more relevant when coupled with gridded rainfall datasets fig 3 after demonstrating the drawbacks of relying on literature empirical models for the estimation of annual average r factors a novel customized empirical model eq 8 is proposed that builds on simple climate geographic and topographic variables the choice of the model whose calibration builds on the rigorous r factors estimated at the rain gauge level is supported and justified by the analysis of spatial patterns of rainfall and erosivity by means of a self organizing map the custom model shows highly improved performance compared to both the 21 literature models and the two proposed ensembles explaining about 80 of the total variance building on the custom model and on the redes grid r factor map taken as reference despite the uncertainties coming from the use of spatial interpolation building on a limited number of point scale data the performance of different gridded rainfall datasets very popular in practical and scientifical applications and easily retrievable within the cds is tested as well as the performance of the official italian gridded rainfall product the added value given by the adoption of the gridded rainfall datasets is twofold on one hand it encompasses one significant flaw in currently available sub hourly rainfall datasets that is the limited number of years of observations for instance in italy sub hourly data are usually not available before 2000 as well as the generally poor quality of sub hourly rainfall time series questioning the robustness of the estimate of r factors by the rigorous definition given by eq 5 conversely gridded rainfall datasets usually building on daily observations cover larger time periods on the other hand under the assumption that empirical models such as the one proposed by eq 8 are valuable the use of gridded rainfall datasets bypasses the need of interpolating rain gauge values because they already integrate a reproduction of spatial variability dynamics for rainfall although in different ways reanalysis regression based kriging simple kriging for era5 era5 land e obs and scia ispra respectively the overall performance of gridded datasets in reproducing rainfall erosivity over italy is quantified in terms of percentage anomalies with respected to the redes grid dataset over the common period 2002 2011 fig 8 top panel and fig 9 as well as in terms of r factor aggregation at the nuts3 level fig 10 in all cases e obs provides the worst estimates with an unacceptable underestimation all over the domain in this regard it is worth recalling that the performance of the interpolation required by e obs is among the considered datasets the most affected by the available number and density of rain gauges that are not evenly distributed especially in southern italy era5 and era5 land show a similar behaviour in terms of anomalies with balanced prediction errors and a dispersion that decreases for increasing horizontal resolution although with a higher positive bias for era5 land compared to era5 this is consistent with the fact that era5 land is an interpolation of era5 with an improvement in the resolution but no additional information or data scia ispra provides the best results consistently with the finer horizontal resolution and the improved quality of the interpolation due to the higher number of considered rain gauges for all the datasets comparison between anomaly distributions fig 9 and calibration residuals fig 7 suggests that prediction errors are mainly due to the use of an empirical model than to the use of a gridded rainfall dataset among the cds datasets era5 land can be considered the best performing if coupled with the custom empirical model however scia ispra proves to give even better predictions than era5 land with approximately undistorted and unbiased estimates and narrow dispersion the final outcomes of the research consist in r factor maps over italy covering the period 1981 2010 with diverse but acceptable reliability fig 8 bottom panel this demonstrates how gridded precipitation

8259,study region eight coastal aquifers ca of bakhtegan and tashk lakes btl and salt marsh southern iran study focus btl wetlands of international importance have been shrinking due to reduction in surface discharge groundwater overexploitation and drought we show that this resulted in an increase of btl total dissolved solids tds from 45400 to 256000 mg l to characterize the hydrogeological behavior of the coastal aquifers after shrinkage major ions tds and water level were measured along a transect from inside the bl to one of the aquifers the spatial distribution of electrical conductivity ec discharge and iso potential maps was determined a support vector regression technique was used to forecast ec and water level in ca for the next decade new hydrological insights for the region five zones based on ec changes and hydraulic gradient are recognized namely brine highly saline brackish transition and freshwater the groundwater flow direction is from both the btl and fresh water zone converging towards the intermediately positioned transition zone saltwater intrusion is active based on the hydraulic gradient towards the land and the gradient of water density a schematic flow model of ca was proposed based on active swi groundwater flow direction and chemical signature forecasting reveals a significant further deterioration of water quality and drop in groundwater levels which emphasizes the need for systematic and sustainable water management keywords saltwater intrusion hydrochemistry coastal aquifers bakhtegan and tashk lakes iran 1 introduction coastal aquifers are the primary source of freshwater for up to one billion people worldwide small and nicholls 2003 sea or saltwater intrusion swi is the landward movement of sea or saltwater into coastal aquifers the driving force is usually the density gradient between fresh and saltwater and the hydraulic gradient of the water level between sea and the coastal aquifer bear 1979 swi has been classified into passive where the hydraulic head freshwater decreases in the seaward direction passive active where the gradient decreases in both landward and seaward directions from a groundwater mound and active swi the hydraulic gradient of saline water slopes towards the land due to forces by density differences causing more aggressive salinization and fresh groundwater flow also act in the same direction werner 2017 active swi occurs where the salt fresh interface is unstable this occurs when all the heads within the coastal aquifer are lower than the density corrected head at the base of aquifers then the hydraulic gradient changes landwards and the sea or saltwater intrude into the coastal aquifer replacing freshwater morgan and werner 2015 many studies focused on passive swi because it is common in most coastal aquifers i e telahigue et al 2020 ju et al 2020 in passive swi the position and characteristics of the mixing zone are often well known and its upper part coincides with the coastline intersecting the aquifer bear 1972 glover 1959 werner et al 2013 active swi leads to more aggressive salinization and is observed in many areas i e yakirevich et al 1998 fetter 2001 werner and gallagher 2006 morgan and werner 2015 even though it has received considerably less attention than passive swi badaruddin et al 2017 vázquez suñé et al 2006 studied the llobregat delta spain where groundwater levels fell to more than 25 m below sea level and created active swi conditions which led to rapid and extensive salinization of the coastal aquifers badaruddin et al 2015 applied physical experiments and numerical modeling to study active swi in various nontidal unconfined coastal aquifer laboratory experiments and numerical simulations for non tidal unconfined coastal aquifers show that freshwater hydraulic gradients slope toward the land because freshwater ceased to discharge into the sea in the absence of significant recharge morgan and werner 2015 used a steady state analytic approach to quantify seawater extent in many of australia s unconfined and confined coastal aquifers they indicated that active seawater intrusion conditions occur in many of australia s confined coastal aquifers badaruddin et al 2017 used numerical modeling of various idealized unconfined coastal aquifer settings to determine relationships between interface characteristics such as slope mixing zone thickness and movement rate and mixing zone thickness as a function of freshwater seawater density contrast dispersity hydraulic conductivity porosity and aquifer thickness the interface between freshwater and saline water migrates faster with higher hydraulic conductivity lower effective porosity n steeper hydraulic gradient and greater density difference between freshwater and seawater stoeckl et al 2019 used laboratory scale physical experiments and numerical modeling to study post pumping seawater intrusion pp swi as a result of pumping water entered the model from both sides from the coastal boundary as seawater and from the inland boundary as freshwater to fill up the cone of depression when pumping was discontinued the cone of depression moved inland which caused water to flow from the coast and inland in order to fill the depression cone as a result the saltwater wedge moved landward after the pumping cessation until recovering the depression cone walther and leonard 2020 extended the work of stoeckl et al 2019 by evaluating the sensitivity of the pp swi to pump rate and distance from the coast the results indicate that pp swi does not occur below a minimum pump rate and there is no relation with pump distance from the coast efforts towards recognition of active swi phenomena are limited and mainly rely on numerical modeling and laboratory experiments research on hydrochemistry and hydrogeological characteristics of coastal aquifers based on field data under active swi are limited especially under drought conditions shrinkage of salt lakes and overexploitation iran being in the zone with semi arid and arid conditions is confronted with salinity hazards iran has 250 wetlands with an area of 2 5 million hectares and 24 wetlands with a total area of 1 48 million ha registered in ramsar convention s list of international wetlands among these 6 wetlands including bakhtegan tashk kamjan shadegan anzali shurgol hamun e helmand and hamun e puzak hamun e saberi are in the montreux records the montreux record is a record of the ramsar sites where changes in ecological characters have occurred or are likely to occur the hypersaline bakhtegan and tashk lakes btl located in the southern part of iran are the second largest inland water body in iran the btl was registered as a national park in 1995 a total of 86 mammal 218 bird 30 reptile and 23 fish species have been identified in the btl fotooli 2002 the btl shrunk significantly since 2007 due to overexploitation of groundwater by production wells drought and recently the construction of two dams mollasadra and sivand the drying of a vast area of the bakhtegan wetland in iran resulted in the major mortality of ﬂamingo chicks in 2007 ganjali and ildoromi 2012 however the impact of the shrinking of btl causes additional concerns including 1 transport of salt and dust from the exposed lake bed to adjacent cities and villages 2 reduction of the evaporation and humidity 3 decrease of birds migration 4 decreasing attractiveness for tourists 5 increasing contaminant concentrations of water and lake sediment and 6 enhancement of saltwater intrusion into the adjacent aquifers the average total dissolved solids tds of the btl was 45400 mg l before shrinkage 2007 and it increased to average 256000 mg l after 2007 the btl is surrounded by six aquifers and a salt marsh to the west and the salt marsh is also in direct contact with two aquifers these 8 aquifers are named coastal aquifers ca the water of the coastal aquifers has a tds signature with concentrations up to about 13000 mg l fars regional water authority frwa 2009 near the lakes and it changes to freshwater at a higher elevation the depth to water table is more than 5 m in dry and wet seasons the salinity sources in the vicinity of coastal aquifers are the btl and salt marsh the water of btl and salt marsh has a large enough salinity to cause saltwater intrusion into the coastal aquifers no systematic investigation has yet been done concerning saltwater intrusion of the btl coastal aquifers which might invoke unproperly focused counter measures some evidence has been provided that groundwater close to the btl and salt marsh both the electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids in water tds increase significantly and exceed the concentrations that are compatible with agriculture bastani and rakhshandehroo 2010 afrasiabi and sedghi asl 2015 our aim is to provide evidence of the type of salt water intrusion swi passive or active in the coastal aquifers of btl both the geometry and the transition of properties of the mixing zone in the coastal aquifers are characterized geohydrologically and hydrochemically based on this characterization we infer a general spatiotemporal understanding and conceptual model concerning swi finally we predict the changes of ec and water levels in the btl coastal aquifers for the near future by employing a time series algorithm 2 geology the saline bakhtegan tashk lake btl is located in southern iran 50 to 160 km north east of shiraz based on tectonic magmatic and sedimentary features this region is situated in the high zagros zone the high zagros thrust belt has a width of more than 80 km and is located between the main zagros thrust and the high zagros fault in the southeastern part of the high zagros thrust belt agard et al 2005 alavi and mahdavi 1994 berberian 1995 most of the western northern and southern parts of the study area comprise karst formations khaneh kat neyriz surmeh fahiylan dariyan sarvak tarbur and asmarijahrum and the eastern and central parts comprise of the ophiolitic rocks geological survey of iran 2002 btl and all coastal aquifers are located in quaternary alluvium deposits fig 1 details of the sedimentary sequence and the structural characteristics of this area are discussed by stocklin and setudehnia 1977 3 physiography and hydrogeology the area of the bakhtegan and tashk lake is 850 and 410 km2 respectively the bakhtegan and tashk lakes are separated in dry years but forms a single lake during heavy precipitation about every 12 to 16 years the catchment area of the btl is 27180 km2 with a maximum and minimum elevation of 2930 and 1545 above sea level m a s l respectively the climate of the btl is arid with annual average minimum and maximum precipitation of 232 68 and 441 mm y respectively from 1968 to 2018 the average temperature and mean annual pan evaporation is 19 c and 2749 mm y respectively precipitation mainly occurs from november to april the kor river is the only permanent river that discharges into the btl with an average discharge of 13 58 m3 s from 1997 to 2007 but the average discharge decreased profoundly to 0 88 m3 s since 2007 due to overexploitation drought and construction of two new dams on the btl catchment area fars regional water authority frwa 2016 the main water sources for bakhtegan lake bl are kor river a manmade drainage canal to the south of kor river and numerous natural drainages around the lake sources for tashk lake tl are the gomban spring with a discharge of 0 716 m3 s a manmade drainage canal to the north of kor river an overflow of the kamjan marsh and numerous natural drainages around the lakes the area of kamjan marshes is about 100 km2 with permanent and seasonal marshes along the kor river but the area of this wetland has decreased to 52 km2 by rice farm since 1967 three dams doroudzan 1972 mollasadra 2006 and sivand 2006 have been constructed in the catchment area of the kor river with a total effective capacity of 1285 mcm fars regional water authority frwa 2016 tens of diversion canals transfer the kor river for agricultural purposes throughout its route the lower part of the kor river was diverted for agricultural purposes by six old diversion canal but recently no water is diverted due to overexploitation in the upper parts of the basin the oldest diversion dam is band e amir which was constructed more than 1000 years ago torabi haghighi and kløve 2017 six unconfined aquifers and a salt marsh are located around the btl and two unconfined aquifers are in direct contact with the salt marsh fig 1 these eight aquifers are referred to as coastal aquifers as limestone aquifers are located upstream of the coastal aquifers the characteristics of coastal aquifers are summarized in table 1 the discharge of most coastal aquifers decreased in 2009 due to drought the eight unconfined alluvium aquifers are composed of sand with little clay close to the btl or salt marsh boundary and it changes to young terraces at the highland consisting of gravel sand silt and clay geological survey of iran 2002 the salt marsh is composed of silt and clay with evaporated salt the salt marsh has a water table near the ground surface and there are no exploitation wells and agricultural land due to groundwater salinity the texture of the btl sediment was measured with hygrometry in several sites the texture is mainly clay loam or sandy silty clay the transmissivity ranges from 9 to 436 m2 day and the specific yield varies from 0 021 to 0 1 fars regional water authority frwa 2009 the recharge of coastal aquifers is mainly the result of direct precipitation surface runoff inflows from the upstream karstic aquifers and irrigation and industrial return flow the coastal aquifers are only exploited by 3597 and 3280 wells with a total annual discharge of 441 and 411 mcm in 2004 and 2009 respectively table 1 evaporation from the watertable is negligible because the depth to the water table exceeds 5 m in coastal aquifers the thickness of the unsaturated zone in the coastal aquifers varies from 5 to 112 m mainly less than 50 m gomban karst spring naturally discharges into the thask lake but its water mainly used for agricultural purposes since 30 years ago the water budget of coastal aquifers in tavabe arsanjan abadeh tashk khir and neyriz were 19 53 14 37 12 64 2 69 mcm respectively wet year of 2004 due to over exploitation but khanekat and kharameh are at balance fars regional water authority frwa

depth to the water table depth of well and electrical conductivity ec for 3597 and 3280 exploitation wells of the coastal aquifers in 2004 and 2009 respectively chloride concentration was only measured for all wells in 2004 in the national inventory in addition major cations anions total dissolved solids tds and ec have been measured seasonally in 262 typical wells of the coastal aquifers from 2002 to 2018 the water level has been measured in 112 piezometers in coastal aquifers from 1992 to 2018 in kharameh and tavabe arsanjan from 1994 to 2018 in neyriz form 1996 to 2018 in khir form 2008 to 2018 in abadeh tashk form 2009 to 2018 in pichkan tang hana and khaneh kat the relationship between ec and tds commonly used is 1 t d s m g l k e e c μ s c m where k e ranges mostly 0 55 0 75

btl salinity and hydraulic head along cross section a b after heavy rain in the early spring of 2017 the flood water mainly filled the deep parts of the lake a total of 23 surface water samples of btl were collected to measure tds from may to june 2017 fig 1 and table 2 to determine the flow direction and salinity gradient from lake to a typical coastal aquifer seven piezometers were constructed inside the btl and part of khane kat aquifer cross section a b in fig 1 water samples were collected and depth to water table and elevation of ground surface were measured in 2 piezometers in the khane kat aquifer and 7 piezometers inside the lake in october 2018 fig 5 the samples were analyzed for the major ions and total dissolved solids tds at the hydrochemistry laboratory of the department of earth sciences shiraz university iran calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 were measured by titration with edta ethylene diamine tetra acetic using murexide and erichrom black t as indicators sodium na and potassium k concentrations were determined by the standard f aas method chloride and sulfate so4 2 concentrations were measured by mohr and turbidity methods respectively bicarbonate hco3 was determined by titration with hcl using methyl orange as an indicator tds values were measured by the evaporation method for quality control measures the ionic balance error was calculated as follows 2

the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 where groundwater was plotted in between the two end members rain water represents the main recharge source for groundwater and lake water represents the source for groundwater salinization inference that can be made from this plot includes that groundwater has been affected largely by lake water mixing and partially by the water rock interaction lake water

machine learning algorithm based on statistical learning theory proposed by vapnik 1995 svr is one of the most popular techniques for environmental time series analysis and prediction based on past observations shiri et al 2013 ahmadianfar et al 2020 phan and nguyen 2020 svms can be used for classification or regression problems that are not linearly separable by transforming original data into a new space using kernel functions various types of kernel functions such as the radial basis function rbf the linear sigmoid polynomial poly and exponential radial basis function erbf can be applied in svm the svm regression estimating function can be described as 6 f x w φ x b where w is the weight vector φ is a nonlinear transfer function mapping the input space into a high dimensional feature space b is the bias and x is the input vector in this study a nonlinear svr is used to forecast the water level and ec for the period 2018 2026 based on the water level and ec values measured from 2002 to 2018 in the btl coastal aquifers the poly kernel function and the different lag length was employed by trial and error procedure to give the best simulation result 4 4 1 forecasting accuracy

evaluated the observed and forecasted results were compared to select the best forecasting model 5 results and discussion 5 1 ec of the coastal aquifers the ec of the coastal aquifers in 2004 and 2009 are presented in fig 2 a and b using the national inventory data the isopotential maps of 2004 wet year 2009 dry year and 2017 wet year for dry month october and wet month march presented in fig 2a b and c respectively based on available data the isopotential maps of khane kat abadeh tashk pichakan and tang hana aquifers were not presented in fig 2a because piezometers were constructed after 2004 the ec of the coastal aquifers usually ranges from 160 to 20 000 μs cm fig 2a and b taking into account that the ec of seawater is 45 000 μs cm these values indicate severe salinization of groundwater the cl data are only available in 2004 when chloride varied from 1 to 8 900 mg l in 2004 the discharge ranges from 0 5 to 50 l s the tds of brine sampling points along the cross section a b as shown in fig 1 ranges inside the bl from 162000 to 363000 mg l outside the lake from 600 to 10300 mg l 5 2 salinity sources of lakes and coastal aquifers there are few hydrochemistry data in the btl the results of previous studies indicate the average tds of btl was 45400 mg l before shrinkage in 2007 but it has increased to average 256000 mg l since 2007 table 2 the btl is classified into 5 facies based on surface crust namely pure salt clay salt salty soil soil without salt and sand dune from center of the lake toward its shoreline respectively fig 3 the btl water evaporates and salt is deposited in deeper parts of the btl which receives more water than shallow parts the soil without salt facies is located close to shoreline it was rarely covered by water and has the largest depth of the water table the source of salinity before shrinkage under natural condition is evaporation from the btl water when the lakes get dry the evaporation occurs from saline water below the lakes bed in deeper parts of the btl where depth to the water table is shallow the pure salt facies in the deep parts of btl are exposed during dry periods and redissolved in case of rainfall or floodwater the following reasons cause the btl salinity 1 the average rainfall on the btl area is about 232 mm but annual class pan evaporation is about 2749 mm yr 2 the main resources of the btl water are kor river and the gomban spring with a total annual inflow of 428 and 22 6 mcm with an average ec of 2415 μs cm and 5260 μs cm respectively therefore these two water resources are not the btl salinity sources 3 the salt marsh is a lowland area with a shallow water table the ec of salt marsh was between 100000 to 150000 mg l near the btl and it decreases away from the btl toward the west rezaei 1998 but no more data is available the source of the btl salinity is not salt marsh because the salt is deposited in the deep parts of btl even 50 km far from the salt marsh fig 3 the salt marsh may be partly a source of saltwater in the adjacent lakes area but it merits more research the main reasons for the increasing salinity since 2007 are reduction of the btl inflow due to drought construction of two dams in the btl catchment area that limit inflow in btl and over exploitation in the aquifers of btl catchment area and coastal aquifers after shrinkage of the lake the main sources of btl water are precipitation onto the lakes and natural drainage btl water completely evaporated during dry months after shrinkage dissolution of salt in salty facies during the wet season is another source of salinity salinity sources of the coastal aquifers are btl and salt marsh tavabeh arsanjan and kharameh coastal aquifers are in direct contact with salt marsh and the rest of the coastal aquifers are in direct contact with btl fig 1 the salinity source of the pichakan tang hana khane kat neyriz khir and abadeh tashk aquifers are the btl for the following reasons 1 they are in direct contact with the btl 2 the tds of piezometers inside the btl ranges from 162000 to 363000 mg l in 2017 fig 5 and the average tds after shrinkage significantly increased table 2 3 the ec has the highest value near the btl boundary and it decreases toward the high lands fig 2a and b 4 the depth to the water table in all coastal aquifers was more than 5 m therefore evaporation of groundwater by capillary rise from the water table was not the source of coastal aquifer salinity evaporation from the water table is insignificant if the water table is more than about 3 m below the soil surface van der zee et al 2014 5 in addition the unit hydrographs mean area weighted water level of piezometers of most coastal aquifers have a negative trend since 1992 or 2009 fars regional water authority frwa 2018 fig 4 due to overexploitation increasing the hydraulic gradient toward the coastal aquifer 6 the geological formations in the study area are karstic limestone and low permeability radiolarite and ophiolite rocks without any salt origin 7 the intrusion of saline water into the coastal aquifer is a common process in the saline lakes delsman et al 2014 kazakis et al 2016 argamasilla et al 2017 khadra et al 2017 mahlknecht et al 2017 abu alnaeem et al 2018 the sources of tavabeh arsanjan and kharameh coastal aquifers are most probably the salt marsh because ec decreases from the salt marsh toward the highland fig 2a and b the general flow direction is from the boundary between the salt marsh and tavabeh arsanjan aquifers toward the highland in wet and dry seasons fig 2 there are a few scattered piezometers along the length of kharamah aquifer therefore it is not possible to plot iso potential maps there are no piezometers inside the salt marsh during this study period which merits a closer investigation of salt marsh in addition items 4 to 7 that justify the sources of salinity for the btl are also valid for these two aquifers 5 3 groundwater flow in the coastal aquifers the natural flow direction used to be from karstic formations and coastal alluvium aquifers toward the btl currently however it is directed from the btl toward the coastal alluvium aquifers due to over exploitation as is apparent from the iso potential maps of 2004 2009 and 2017 for march and october fig 2a b and c in addition to the iso potential map presented in fig 2 extra iso potential maps were prepared in 1996 for may march and october in 2004 2009 and 2017 for may and in 2018 for may march and october they are presented in figs s1a s1b s1c s1d and s1e all of these iso potential maps show the flow direction from the bz toward the highland far from the btl and salt marsh it can be concluded that the flow direction is from the btl and salt marsh in wet and dry periods the equivalent freshwater level in piezometers along cross section a b transect indicated in fig 1 is calculated using the density of pore water by eq 3 and 4 fig 5 for seawater ρ s 1 025 g cm3 but for the btl both salinity and density can be larger than that and the density may increase even up to ρ s 1 259 g cm3 accordingly the corrected elevations show an even more pronounced gradient towards the land side due to the higher ρ s also wider mixing zones were found for active swi badaruddin et al 2017 the slope of the water table both corrected and not corrected with eq 4 indicates flow from the lake center towards the coastal alluvium aquifer this indicates active swi in the btl aquifers the observations made in piezometers of cross section a b transect indicated in fig 1 show that the water level is highest in the center of the lake fig 5 at this central position the highest tds 363 000 mg l is found at depth of 5 cm which indicates the effect of intense evaporation fed by a capillary rise from the saltwater level moving from the center of lake towards the coast the water level declines depth to water table 2 5 m and the concentration of tds decreases to 162 000 mg l in part this will be due to insignificant replenishment of evaporated water as capillary rise from the saltwater becomes insignificant if it is more than about 3 meters below soil surface van der zee et al 2014 5 4 classification of the btl coastal aquifers based on previous studies groundwater is classified in five groups a fresh b slightly saline or brackish c moderately saline or brackish highly saline d highly saline heavily saline or very saline e seawater or brine robinove et al 1958 winslow et al 1968 freeze and cherry 1979 rhoades et al 1992 reese 1994 yobbi 1996 bureau of reclamation 2003 national ground water association 2010 meyer et al 2011 stanton et al 2017 in this study the groundwater is classified into five major groups namely fresh transition brackish highly saline and brine the ec limits of each group is determined based on groundwater salinity beneath the btl and coastal aquifers all of the coastal aquifers comprised of brine zone brz highly saline zone hsz brackish zone bz and fresh zone fz and transition zone tz based on ec values and considering other parameters such as cl concentration water type and aquifer saturation thickness in each zone table 3 except pichakan and tang hana aquifers pichakan and tang hana aquifers have a vast brackish zone because they are in direct contact with impermeable radiolarite and ophiolite rocks respectively fig 1 and there are no sources of freshwater to form fz the boundary of each zone is defined using the ec changes instead of the chloride concentration because ec was measured in all wells in 2004 and 2009 but chloride concentration was only measured in typical wells and only in 2004 the ec values of khane kat and neyriz in 2009 and area of each zone are presented in fig 6 the other coastal aquifers have the same trend and behavior the unexploited region from the btl shoreline to the boundary of agricultural land consists of the brz and hsz the tds along the transect ab is 363 000 mg l at the center of the lake and it gradually reduces to 162 000 mg l at the btl shoreline fig 5 the first part of the unexploited region adjacent to the shoreline is brine confirming active salt water intrusion the ec reduces along the unexploited region due to precipitation recharge and reduction of the capillary fringe due to the enhancement of water table depth the salinity of brz and hsz is at such a level that no plants can survive there is no ec data in unexploited region to determine the boundary between the brz and hsz the schematic boundary between these two zones is presented in fig 6 the bz is from the end of hsz to the beginning of tz and the type of water is chloride the bz is located above the interface of this zone with the underlying hsz the ec at the beginning of bz ranges mostly from about 15 000 to 20 000 μs cm at different coastal aquifers table 3 the unexpected high range of ec at beginning of the bz near the boundary of hsz and bz is due to high discharge rate of pumping deepening some of the exploited wells short distance to neighboring wells and type of crops halophytes the high range of ec may result in significant reduction of crops yields the quality of groundwater gradually increases in the bz due to precipitation recharge and agricultural return flow in addition the depth to interface between the hsz and bz increases along the bz and consequently reduces the effect of hsz diffusion on salinity of the bz tz is mixing of brackish and freshwater the source of freshwater is alluvium or karstic aquifers at the high land around the btl which flow toward the tz the boundary between the bz and tz is determined by a sharp and significantly high reduction of ec on both sides of this line the red color line on fig 6 it implies that saltwater intrusion is stopped in the tz in the tz ec ranges from 1 100 to 4 300 μs cm the found boundary is also found by the sharp cl concentration difference on opposite sides the boundary between the tz and the fz is slightly arbitrary but still well defined by the change of ec 1 200 μs cm in the tz to ec 1200 μs cm for the freshwater zone fig 6 average of ec in the beginning and end of each zone of the btl coastal aquifers shows the same trend as khane kat and neyriz aquifers except pichakan aquifer because bz of this aquifer is surrounded by the hsz and there is no fresh aquifer fig 7 as was mentioned earlier based on long term investigation of iso potential map the general flow direction is from both the bz and fz toward the tz except pichakan and tang hena in wet and dry years and months fig 2a and b in addition the tz is usually narrow in most of the coastal aquifers the ec and cl concentrations in the fz are less than 1200 μs cm and 100 mg l respectively the water type in this zone is of the bicarbonate type the general flow direction is from the karstic formation toward the alluvial aquifers these classes imply that the concentration and ec range of the three zones show a region of common overlap because for all 8 aquifers the local conditions are quite complex besides active swi as a process that controls the distribution of salinity also extractions at many places and diverse depths and rates affect the salinity distribution in the vertical direction e g due to upconing spatial distribution of ec in the maps for 2004 and 2009 fig 2a and b indicates that in the parts of aquifers closest to the lake the highest ec values are measured and with increasing distance from the lake the ec values reduce the progression of active swi in the bz is different in the different coastal aquifers the pichakan and tang hana aquifers which are surrounded by impervious ophiolite and radiolarite rocks do not experience a freshwater recharge towards the alluvial aquifers this leads to a larger intrusion and farther extension of the bz by comparison of the spatial distribution of ec maps in 2004 and 2009 it is apparent that the regions with ec values exceeding 10 000 μs cm incased in 2009 which is far more than in 2004 due to btl shrinkage the increase of the density of the lake water and the drop in the water table by over exploitation and dry years lead to increasing ec in the aquifers 5 5 hydrochemical variation using eq 2 lake water fractions range from 0 0 to 5 1 in the all coastal aquifers the low lake water proportion within the fz indicate that these regions are not affected by active swi in contrast the highest lake water proportion is found in the bz indicating that this zone is more vulnerable to lake water intrusion the lake water proportion of groundwater increases towards the lake besides differences in salinity between the three zones bz tz and fz also the chemical signature is different as well as characteristic of these zones the piper 262 typical wells in 2009 plots of major cations and anions in groundwater samples of the study area are shown in fig 8 a the piper diagram shows the presence of various hydrochemical facies that were observed in the groundwater samples such as ca hco3 na hco3 na so4 ca so4 mg cl ca cl and na cl types the dominant chemical facies in water are ca cl and na cl types the water samples of the coastal aquifer are predominantly of the cl type 83 and some of the hco3 type 13 6 and so4 2 type 3 4 respectively the fz samples distributed in the left corner of the piper diagram are mainly represented by ca and mg bicarbonate ca mg hco3 type water this type of water naturally evolves by contact with predominantly limestone and dolomitic strata and cements in the recharge area the tz water samples from places that are located between the two endmembers fresh water and lake are indicative of mixing leading to a water composition with partially bicarbonates of ca and mg and na cl types the water type of the bz samples that are close to btl is of the na cl type and due to intrusion of btl water as far as the coast aquifers are concerned the saline samples occupy the right top section and have been obtained near the boundary of bz and tz their chemical properties are controlled by alkaline earth cations and chloride this process occurs under conditions of saltwater intrusion which leads to the change of water facies from na cl to ca cl type xue et al 1995 appelo and postma 2005 han et al 2014 najib et al 2017 eeman et al 2016 abu alnaeem et al 2018 nogueira et al 2019 telahigue et al 2020 regarded as an important water end member the btl water and brine under the lake are also plotted in the figure and their water type is of the na cl type the piper diagram illustrates the different species that can be found in the water samples of different signatures this is confirmed in the gibbs diagram fig 8 b this diagram shows the tds concentration is a function of the ratio between cl and cl hco3 showing a distinct gradual change from lake water quality towards the freshwater that is dominated by chemical interaction between calcareous rock and groundwater with increasing tds the water quality changes from freshwater to transition due to mixing of freshwater with intruding lake water towards the lake s water composition however it is evident that the so called brackish water bz is significantly less saline than the lake itself 5 6 conceptual model of the btl coastal aquifers the hydrogeological geochemical and hydraulic data were combined to develop a conceptual model for swi into the coastal aquifers of btl fig 9 the model consist of 5 zones brz hsz bz tz and fz using abbreviations introduced in section 5 4 the type of water is na cl in the first three zones but it changes to mixed ca na cl hco3 in tz and ca hco3 in the fresh zone the right and the left sides of this figure are the land boundary and the lake respectively at the lake side h s denotes the level of the lake water and at the land side h f is the freshwater table whereas often in swi studies h s is constant here it appears that h s is not constant tds of pore water under the lake decreases from the center of lakes to the coast not only does the head of lake water or brine under the lake decrease as the distance to the lake center increases but also this level continues to decrease as a function of time the regional head difference between the center of the lake and the transition zone tz is the force driving groundwater flow towards this tz an additional driving force though is the gradient in salinity and therefore in density of the pore water which decreases in the same direction as the decreasing groundwater head as the salinity is quite significant so is the density difference with average density at the lake side of 1 259 g cm3 accordingly we can speak for the coastal aquifers of active swi werner et al 2013 where the driving force due to density gradients enhance that due to the water level differences since under more or less constant water density the land side of the aquifers experience fresh groundwater flow this fresh groundwater flow meets that coming from the lake at the transition zone in part near of the coastal aquifer due to excessive salinity it is already no longer possible to use the water pumped up by wells natural causes as well as human influence especially groundwater pumping from coastal freshwater wells have increased saltwater intrusion in many coastal areas ferguson and gleeson 2012 lu et al 2013a in the present case the conventional circulation of saline water at the interface of saline and freshwater back to lake does not significantly occur the main reason is that the interface is located at the area where wells are pumping up the water the sources of water that replenishes the coastal aquifers are infiltrating rainwater agricultural return flows and inflow from the adjacent karstic formations the source of salinity is the salt that originates from both the lake and underlying brine and salt marsh the ec of exploitation wells is generally less than 20000 μs cm because the farmers usually reduce the well depth to prevent the deteriorating water quality due to upconing this is also apparent from the well depths that generally increase away from the lake coast because the depth to saline brackish interface increases 5 7 temporal variation and forecasting of groundwater salinity and level the time series of measured ec and groundwater level show both for the recent past and the near future a groundwater level decline and ec rise for the period of 2002 to 2026 fig 10 the statistical criteria of accuracy of training datasets are presented in table 4 the water level in piezometers decreases in all the coastal aquifers in the brackish zone but the ec does not follow the gradual decreasing trend of water table and its variation is high in all coastal aquifers in spite of the dropping water table the ec is almost constant or even a slight decreasing trend in some of the coastal aquifers the number of piezometers is limited and their distance with pumping wells is regulated to be out of the depression cone of the pumping wells therefore the decreasing trend of water level in piezometers is due to total overexploitation of coastal aquifers the depth of water inside the wells is shallow and ec of water below the well bottom is high in the pumping wells of the brackish zone as the discharge increases in a well the water level inside that well decreases consequently the ec increases the salinity in a well is sensitive to discharge duration of exploited water use of that pumping well and water demand type of crops the ec of each pumping well also depends on farmer management as the salinity increases in a pumping well the farmer reduces the ec by the management strategy such as reducing the discharge and water demand by changing the type of crop therefore the constant ec or even a narrow decreasing trend is a management strategy and it does not affect the water level in the piezometer discharges that increase have a significant effect on the dropping water table in pumping well but no effect in piezometers far from pumping well the crops with high tolerance to salinity are cultivated in spite of drastically production reduction there is no official systematic management program to reduce the overexploitation therefore the water level decline and ec enhancement will be expected in the future fig 10 the main constraint is the water table must be controlled at a specific level because a the wells may fall dry due to shallow wells depth b the farmers based on their experience reduce the discharge to prevent a further drop in well level in spite of these constraints the active intrusion advances into the brackish zone due to the hydraulic gradient force the predicted results of ec and water level in the bakhtegan tashk catchment area highlighted an environmental crisis of the groundwater and lake of being seriously subject to declining water level and high rates of saline water intrusion it is highly recommended that must stop exploitation of groundwater in the brackish zone to prevent increasing saltwater intrusion and soil salinity management of water resources exploitation is necessary to ensure a balance between recharge and pumping from groundwater future plans i e numerical modeling must be developed to use sustainable consumption of groundwater to avoid groundwater salinization however as america et al 2020 showed such modelling may have an even higher demand of data input in view of the complexities of the fresh salt groundwater system table 4 6 conclusions the original and natural general flow direction was directed from the coastal aquifers towards the btl however we have established that currently the general flow direction has reversed from the btl or salt marsh towards the adjacent aquifers this is demonstrated by the iso potential lines of 2004 2009 2017 and several other years in both wet and dry months the main reason of this reversal is the over exploitation of the adjacent aquifers that cause the decline of the water tables to below the btl water level even though the water levels of btl itself are also dropping in addition the average salinity of the btl has also increased profoundly from a tds of 45400 mg l before 2007 to about 256000 mg l after shrinkage this has increased the salinity and therefore water density gradient which implies stronger buoyancy forces that also induce flow from the btl toward the adjacent aquifers in this study we developed an active saltwater intrusion swi conceptual model for the btl and the coastal aquifers under overexploitation spatial analysis of active swi showed that for most of the coastal aquifers five zones can be distinguished with different hydro chemical signatures namely the brine zone brz highly saline zone hsz brackish zone bz transition zone tz and fresh zone fz brz and hsz are found in the area where production wells are lacking in view of the high salinity with an ec of more than 20000 μs cm bz is an area that is severely affected by active swi and the chemical water is type is 100 cl tz with narrow width has special characteristics namely a it shows mixing of fresh and brackish zones b it has the lowest water levels in the study area c it comprises the farthest inland toe of salt fresh interface movement of active swi and d has a significant salinity gradient at the boundary between the bz and tz fz is entirely recharged by the karstic formation and the water type is 100 hco3 hydro chemical variation piper and gibbs diagrams confirm our classification of coastal aquifer zones based on the conceptual model developed presently the conventional circulation of saline water at the interface of saline and freshwater back to lake is almost absent the svr modelling revealed how the salinity grows while the water level further drops continuously from 2002 to 2026 in the coastal aquifers this robust forecasting of future ec values and water level for short to intermediate periods about equal to the experimental data period is useful approach for developing sustainable and groundwater resource management strategies for the future and may help to prioritize remedial actions for the different aquifers as we have established lake brine gradually intrudes further into the fresh coastal aquifers this is a threat as clearly the aquifer suffers from over exploitation which disagrees with sustainable water management in the region it is apparent that the current situation of active swi is indicative of the need to develop a regional freshwater management plan

8259,study region eight coastal aquifers ca of bakhtegan and tashk lakes btl and salt marsh southern iran study focus btl wetlands of international importance have been shrinking due to reduction in surface discharge groundwater overexploitation and drought we show that this resulted in an increase of btl total dissolved solids tds from 45400 to 256000 mg l to characterize the hydrogeological behavior of the coastal aquifers after shrinkage major ions tds and water level were measured along a transect from inside the bl to one of the aquifers the spatial distribution of electrical conductivity ec discharge and iso potential maps was determined a support vector regression technique was used to forecast ec and water level in ca for the next decade new hydrological insights for the region five zones based on ec changes and hydraulic gradient are recognized namely brine highly saline brackish transition and freshwater the groundwater flow direction is from both the btl and fresh water zone converging towards the intermediately positioned transition zone saltwater intrusion is active based on the hydraulic gradient towards the land and the gradient of water density a schematic flow model of ca was proposed based on active swi groundwater flow direction and chemical signature forecasting reveals a significant further deterioration of water quality and drop in groundwater levels which emphasizes the need for systematic and sustainable water management keywords saltwater intrusion hydrochemistry coastal aquifers bakhtegan and tashk lakes iran 1 introduction coastal aquifers are the primary source of freshwater for up to one billion people worldwide small and nicholls 2003 sea or saltwater intrusion swi is the landward movement of sea or saltwater into coastal aquifers the driving force is usually the density gradient between fresh and saltwater and the hydraulic gradient of the water level between sea and the coastal aquifer bear 1979 swi has been classified into passive where the hydraulic head freshwater decreases in the seaward direction passive active where the gradient decreases in both landward and seaward directions from a groundwater mound and active swi the hydraulic gradient of saline water slopes towards the land due to forces by density differences causing more aggressive salinization and fresh groundwater flow also act in the same direction werner 2017 active swi occurs where the salt fresh interface is unstable this occurs when all the heads within the coastal aquifer are lower than the density corrected head at the base of aquifers then the hydraulic gradient changes landwards and the sea or saltwater intrude into the coastal aquifer replacing freshwater morgan and werner 2015 many studies focused on passive swi because it is common in most coastal aquifers i e telahigue et al 2020 ju et al 2020 in passive swi the position and characteristics of the mixing zone are often well known and its upper part coincides with the coastline intersecting the aquifer bear 1972 glover 1959 werner et al 2013 active swi leads to more aggressive salinization and is observed in many areas i e yakirevich et al 1998 fetter 2001 werner and gallagher 2006 morgan and werner 2015 even though it has received considerably less attention than passive swi badaruddin et al 2017 vázquez suñé et al 2006 studied the llobregat delta spain where groundwater levels fell to more than 25 m below sea level and created active swi conditions which led to rapid and extensive salinization of the coastal aquifers badaruddin et al 2015 applied physical experiments and numerical modeling to study active swi in various nontidal unconfined coastal aquifer laboratory experiments and numerical simulations for non tidal unconfined coastal aquifers show that freshwater hydraulic gradients slope toward the land because freshwater ceased to discharge into the sea in the absence of significant recharge morgan and werner 2015 used a steady state analytic approach to quantify seawater extent in many of australia s unconfined and confined coastal aquifers they indicated that active seawater intrusion conditions occur in many of australia s confined coastal aquifers badaruddin et al 2017 used numerical modeling of various idealized unconfined coastal aquifer settings to determine relationships between interface characteristics such as slope mixing zone thickness and movement rate and mixing zone thickness as a function of freshwater seawater density contrast dispersity hydraulic conductivity porosity and aquifer thickness the interface between freshwater and saline water migrates faster with higher hydraulic conductivity lower effective porosity n steeper hydraulic gradient and greater density difference between freshwater and seawater stoeckl et al 2019 used laboratory scale physical experiments and numerical modeling to study post pumping seawater intrusion pp swi as a result of pumping water entered the model from both sides from the coastal boundary as seawater and from the inland boundary as freshwater to fill up the cone of depression when pumping was discontinued the cone of depression moved inland which caused water to flow from the coast and inland in order to fill the depression cone as a result the saltwater wedge moved landward after the pumping cessation until recovering the depression cone walther and leonard 2020 extended the work of stoeckl et al 2019 by evaluating the sensitivity of the pp swi to pump rate and distance from the coast the results indicate that pp swi does not occur below a minimum pump rate and there is no relation with pump distance from the coast efforts towards recognition of active swi phenomena are limited and mainly rely on numerical modeling and laboratory experiments research on hydrochemistry and hydrogeological characteristics of coastal aquifers based on field data under active swi are limited especially under drought conditions shrinkage of salt lakes and overexploitation iran being in the zone with semi arid and arid conditions is confronted with salinity hazards iran has 250 wetlands with an area of 2 5 million hectares and 24 wetlands with a total area of 1 48 million ha registered in ramsar convention s list of international wetlands among these 6 wetlands including bakhtegan tashk kamjan shadegan anzali shurgol hamun e helmand and hamun e puzak hamun e saberi are in the montreux records the montreux record is a record of the ramsar sites where changes in ecological characters have occurred or are likely to occur the hypersaline bakhtegan and tashk lakes btl located in the southern part of iran are the second largest inland water body in iran the btl was registered as a national park in 1995 a total of 86 mammal 218 bird 30 reptile and 23 fish species have been identified in the btl fotooli 2002 the btl shrunk significantly since 2007 due to overexploitation of groundwater by production wells drought and recently the construction of two dams mollasadra and sivand the drying of a vast area of the bakhtegan wetland in iran resulted in the major mortality of ﬂamingo chicks in 2007 ganjali and ildoromi 2012 however the impact of the shrinking of btl causes additional concerns including 1 transport of salt and dust from the exposed lake bed to adjacent cities and villages 2 reduction of the evaporation and humidity 3 decrease of birds migration 4 decreasing attractiveness for tourists 5 increasing contaminant concentrations of water and lake sediment and 6 enhancement of saltwater intrusion into the adjacent aquifers the average total dissolved solids tds of the btl was 45400 mg l before shrinkage 2007 and it increased to average 256000 mg l after 2007 the btl is surrounded by six aquifers and a salt marsh to the west and the salt marsh is also in direct contact with two aquifers these 8 aquifers are named coastal aquifers ca the water of the coastal aquifers has a tds signature with concentrations up to about 13000 mg l fars regional water authority frwa 2009 near the lakes and it changes to freshwater at a higher elevation the depth to water table is more than 5 m in dry and wet seasons the salinity sources in the vicinity of coastal aquifers are the btl and salt marsh the water of btl and salt marsh has a large enough salinity to cause saltwater intrusion into the coastal aquifers no systematic investigation has yet been done concerning saltwater intrusion of the btl coastal aquifers which might invoke unproperly focused counter measures some evidence has been provided that groundwater close to the btl and salt marsh both the electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids in water tds increase significantly and exceed the concentrations that are compatible with agriculture bastani and rakhshandehroo 2010 afrasiabi and sedghi asl 2015 our aim is to provide evidence of the type of salt water intrusion swi passive or active in the coastal aquifers of btl both the geometry and the transition of properties of the mixing zone in the coastal aquifers are characterized geohydrologically and hydrochemically based on this characterization we infer a general spatiotemporal understanding and conceptual model concerning swi finally we predict the changes of ec and water levels in the btl coastal aquifers for the near future by employing a time series algorithm 2 geology the saline bakhtegan tashk lake btl is located in southern iran 50 to 160 km north east of shiraz based on tectonic magmatic and sedimentary features this region is situated in the high zagros zone the high zagros thrust belt has a width of more than 80 km and is located between the main zagros thrust and the high zagros fault in the southeastern part of the high zagros thrust belt agard et al 2005 alavi and mahdavi 1994 berberian 1995 most of the western northern and southern parts of the study area comprise karst formations

are located in quaternary alluvium deposits fig 1 details of the sedimentary sequence and the structural characteristics of this area are discussed by stocklin and setudehnia 1977 3 physiography and hydrogeology the area of the bakhtegan and tashk lake is 850 and 410 km2 respectively the bakhtegan and tashk lakes are separated in dry years but forms a single lake during heavy precipitation about every 12 to 16 years the catchment area of the btl is 27180 km2 with a maximum and minimum elevation of 2930 and 1545 above sea level m a s l respectively the climate of the btl is arid with annual average minimum and maximum precipitation of 232 68 and 441 mm y respectively from 1968 to 2018 the average temperature and mean annual pan evaporation is 19 c and 2749 mm y respectively precipitation mainly occurs from november to april the kor river is the only permanent river that discharges into the btl with an average discharge of 13 58 m3 s from 1997 to 2007 but the average discharge decreased profoundly to 0 88 m3 s since 2007 due to overexploitation drought and construction of two new dams on the btl catchment area fars regional water authority frwa 2016 the main water sources for bakhtegan lake bl are kor river a manmade drainage canal to the south of kor river and numerous natural drainages around the lake sources for tashk lake tl are the gomban spring with a discharge

permanent and seasonal marshes along the kor river but the area of this wetland has decreased to 52 km2 by rice farm since 1967 three dams doroudzan 1972 mollasadra 2006 and sivand 2006 have been constructed in the catchment area of the kor river with a total effective capacity of 1285 mcm fars regional water authority frwa 2016 tens of diversion canals transfer the kor river for agricultural purposes throughout its route the lower part of the kor river was diverted for agricultural purposes by six old diversion canal but recently no water is diverted due to overexploitation in the upper parts of the basin the oldest diversion dam is band e amir which was constructed more than 1000 years ago torabi haghighi and kløve 2017 six unconfined aquifers and a salt marsh are located around the btl and two unconfined aquifers are in direct contact with the salt marsh fig 1 these eight aquifers are referred to as coastal aquifers as limestone aquifers are located upstream of the coastal aquifers the characteristics of coastal aquifers are summarized in table 1 the discharge of most coastal aquifers decreased in 2009 due to drought the eight unconfined alluvium aquifers are composed of sand with little clay close to the btl or salt marsh boundary and it changes to young terraces at the highland consisting of gravel sand silt and clay geological survey of iran 2002 the salt marsh is composed of silt and clay with evaporated salt the salt marsh has a water table near the ground surface and there are no exploitation wells and agricultural land due to groundwater salinity the texture of the btl sediment was measured with hygrometry in several sites the texture is mainly clay loam or sandy silty clay the transmissivity ranges from 9 to 436 m2 day and the specific yield varies from 0 021 to 0 1 fars regional water authority frwa 2009 the recharge of coastal aquifers is mainly the result of direct precipitation surface runoff inflows from the upstream karstic aquifers and irrigation and industrial return flow the coastal aquifers are only exploited by 3597 and 3280 wells with a total annual discharge of 441 and 411 mcm in 2004 and 2009 respectively table 1 evaporation from the watertable is negligible because the depth to the water table exceeds 5 m in coastal aquifers the thickness of the unsaturated zone in the coastal aquifers varies from 5 to 112 m

btl salinity and hydraulic head along cross section a b after heavy rain in the early spring of 2017 the flood water mainly filled the deep parts of the lake a total of 23 surface water samples of btl were collected to measure tds from may to june 2017 fig 1 and table 2 to determine the flow direction and salinity gradient from lake to a typical coastal aquifer seven piezometers were constructed inside the btl and part of khane kat aquifer cross section a b in fig 1 water samples were collected and depth to water table and elevation of ground surface were measured in 2 piezometers in the khane kat aquifer and 7 piezometers inside the lake in october 2018 fig 5 the samples were analyzed for the major ions and total dissolved solids tds at the hydrochemistry laboratory of the department of earth sciences shiraz university iran calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 were measured by titration with edta ethylene diamine tetra acetic using murexide and erichrom black t as indicators sodium na and potassium k concentrations were determined by the standard f aas method chloride and sulfate so4 2 concentrations were measured by mohr and turbidity methods respectively bicarbonate hco3 was determined by titration with hcl using methyl orange as an indicator tds values were measured by the evaporation method for quality control measures the ionic balance error was calculated as follows 2

machine learning algorithm based on statistical learning theory proposed by vapnik 1995 svr is one of the most popular techniques for environmental time series analysis and prediction based on past observations shiri et al 2013 ahmadianfar et al 2020 phan and nguyen 2020 svms can be used for classification or regression problems that are not linearly separable by transforming original data into a new space using kernel functions various types of kernel functions such as the radial basis function rbf the linear sigmoid polynomial poly and exponential radial basis function erbf can be applied in svm the svm regression estimating function can be described as 6 f x w φ x b where w is the weight vector φ is a nonlinear transfer function mapping the input space into a high dimensional feature space b is the bias and x is the input vector in this study a nonlinear svr is used to forecast the water level and ec for the period 2018 2026 based on the water level and ec values measured from 2002 to 2018 in the btl coastal aquifers the poly kernel function and the different lag length was employed by trial and error procedure to give the best simulation result 4 4 1 forecasting accuracy

evaluated the observed and forecasted results were compared to select the best forecasting model 5 results and discussion 5 1 ec of the coastal aquifers the ec of the coastal aquifers in 2004 and 2009 are presented in fig 2 a and b using the national inventory data the isopotential maps of 2004 wet year 2009 dry year and 2017 wet year for dry month october and wet month march presented in fig 2a b and c respectively based on available data the isopotential maps of khane kat abadeh tashk pichakan and tang hana aquifers were not presented in fig 2a because piezometers were constructed after 2004 the ec of the coastal aquifers usually ranges from 160 to 20 000 μs cm fig 2a and b taking into account that the ec of seawater is 45 000 μs cm these values indicate severe salinization of groundwater the cl data are only available in 2004 when chloride varied from 1 to 8 900 mg l in 2004 the discharge ranges from 0 5 to 50 l s the tds of brine sampling points along the cross section a b as shown in fig 1 ranges inside the bl from 162000 to 363000 mg l outside the lake from 600 to 10300 mg l 5 2 salinity sources of lakes and coastal aquifers there are few hydrochemistry data in the btl the results of previous studies indicate the average tds of btl was 45400 mg l before shrinkage in 2007 but it has increased to average 256000 mg l since 2007 table 2 the btl is classified into 5 facies based on surface crust namely pure salt clay salt salty soil soil without salt and sand dune from center of the lake toward its shoreline respectively fig 3 the btl water evaporates and salt is deposited in deeper parts of the btl which receives more water than shallow parts the soil without salt facies is located close to shoreline it was rarely covered by water and has the largest depth of the water table the source of salinity before shrinkage under natural condition is evaporation from the btl water when the lakes get dry the evaporation occurs from saline water below the lakes bed in deeper parts of the btl where depth to the water table is shallow the pure salt facies in the deep parts of btl are exposed during dry periods and redissolved in case of rainfall or floodwater the following reasons cause the btl salinity 1 the average rainfall on the btl area is about 232 mm but annual class pan evaporation is about 2749 mm yr 2 the main resources of the btl water are kor river and the gomban spring with a total annual inflow of 428 and 22 6 mcm with an average ec of 2415 μs cm and 5260 μs cm respectively therefore these two water resources are not the btl salinity sources 3 the salt marsh is a lowland area with a shallow water table the ec of salt marsh was between 100000 to 150000 mg l near the btl and it decreases away from the btl toward the west rezaei 1998 but no more data is available the source of the btl salinity is not salt marsh because the salt is deposited in the deep parts of btl even 50 km far from the salt marsh fig 3 the salt marsh may be partly a source of saltwater in the adjacent lakes area but it merits more research the main reasons for the increasing salinity since 2007 are reduction of the btl inflow due to drought construction of two dams in the btl catchment area that limit inflow in btl and over exploitation in the aquifers of btl catchment area and coastal aquifers after shrinkage of the lake the main sources of btl water are precipitation onto the lakes and natural drainage btl water completely evaporated during dry months after shrinkage dissolution of salt in salty facies during the wet season is another source of salinity salinity sources of the coastal aquifers are btl and salt marsh tavabeh arsanjan and kharameh coastal aquifers are in direct contact with salt marsh and the rest of the coastal aquifers are in direct contact with btl fig 1 the salinity source of the pichakan tang hana khane kat neyriz khir and abadeh tashk aquifers are the btl for the following reasons 1 they are in direct contact with the btl 2 the tds of piezometers inside the btl ranges from 162000 to 363000 mg l in 2017 fig 5 and the average tds after shrinkage significantly increased table 2 3 the ec has the highest value near the btl boundary and it decreases toward the high lands fig 2a and b 4 the depth to the water table in all coastal aquifers was more than 5 m therefore evaporation of groundwater by capillary rise from the water table was not the source of coastal aquifer salinity evaporation from the water table is insignificant if the water table is more than about 3 m below the soil surface van der zee et al 2014 5 in addition the unit hydrographs mean area weighted water level of piezometers of most coastal aquifers have a negative trend since 1992 or 2009 fars regional water authority frwa 2018 fig 4 due to overexploitation increasing the hydraulic gradient toward the coastal aquifer 6 the geological formations in the study area are karstic limestone and low permeability radiolarite and ophiolite rocks without any salt origin 7 the intrusion of saline water into the coastal aquifer is a common process in the saline lakes delsman et al 2014 kazakis et al 2016 argamasilla et al 2017 khadra et al 2017 mahlknecht et al 2017 abu alnaeem et al 2018 the sources of tavabeh arsanjan and kharameh coastal aquifers are most probably the salt marsh because ec decreases from the salt marsh toward the highland fig 2a and b the general flow direction is from the boundary between the salt marsh and tavabeh arsanjan aquifers toward the highland in wet and dry seasons fig 2 there are a few scattered piezometers along the length of kharamah aquifer therefore it is not possible to plot iso potential maps there are no piezometers inside the salt marsh during this study period which merits a closer investigation of salt marsh in addition items 4 to 7 that justify the sources of salinity for the btl are also valid for these two aquifers 5 3 groundwater flow in the coastal aquifers the natural flow direction used to be from karstic formations and coastal alluvium aquifers toward the btl currently however it is directed from the btl toward the coastal alluvium aquifers due to over exploitation as is apparent from the iso potential maps of 2004 2009 and 2017 for march and october fig 2a b and c in addition to the iso potential map presented in fig 2 extra iso potential maps were prepared in 1996 for may march and october in 2004 2009 and 2017 for may and in 2018 for may march and october they are presented in figs s1a s1b s1c s1d and s1e all of these iso potential maps show the flow direction from the bz toward the highland far from the btl and salt marsh it can be concluded that the flow direction is from the btl and salt marsh in wet and dry periods the equivalent freshwater level in piezometers along cross section a b transect indicated in fig 1 is calculated using the density of pore water by eq 3 and 4 fig 5 for seawater ρ s 1 025 g cm3 but for the btl both salinity and density can be larger than that and the density may increase even up to ρ s 1 259 g cm3 accordingly the corrected elevations show an even more pronounced gradient towards the land side due to the higher ρ s also wider mixing zones were found for active swi badaruddin et al 2017 the slope of the water table both corrected and not corrected with eq 4 indicates flow from the lake center towards the coastal alluvium aquifer this indicates active swi in the btl aquifers the observations made in piezometers of cross section a b transect indicated in fig 1 show that the water level is highest in the center of the lake fig 5 at this central position the highest tds 363 000 mg l is found at depth of 5 cm which indicates the effect of intense evaporation fed by a capillary rise from the saltwater level moving from the center of lake towards the coast the water level declines depth to water table 2 5 m and the concentration of tds decreases to 162 000 mg l in part this will be due to insignificant replenishment of evaporated water as capillary rise from the saltwater becomes insignificant if it is more than about 3 meters below soil surface van der zee et al 2014 5 4 classification of the btl coastal aquifers based on previous studies groundwater is classified in five groups a fresh b slightly saline or brackish c moderately saline or brackish highly saline d highly saline heavily saline or very saline e seawater or brine robinove et al 1958 winslow et al 1968 freeze and cherry 1979 rhoades et al 1992 reese 1994 yobbi 1996 bureau of reclamation 2003 national ground water association 2010 meyer et al 2011 stanton et al 2017 in this study the groundwater is classified into five major groups namely fresh transition brackish highly saline and brine the ec limits of each group is determined based on groundwater salinity beneath the btl and coastal aquifers all of the coastal aquifers comprised of brine zone brz highly saline zone hsz brackish zone bz and fresh zone fz and transition zone tz based on ec values and considering other parameters such as cl concentration water type and aquifer saturation thickness in each zone table 3 except pichakan and tang hana aquifers pichakan and tang hana aquifers have a vast brackish zone because they are in direct contact with impermeable radiolarite and ophiolite rocks respectively fig 1 and there are no sources of freshwater to form fz the boundary of each zone is defined using the ec changes instead of the chloride concentration because ec was measured in all wells in 2004 and 2009 but chloride concentration was only measured in typical wells and only in 2004 the ec values of khane kat and neyriz in 2009 and area of each zone are presented in fig 6 the other coastal aquifers have the same trend and behavior the unexploited region from the btl shoreline to the boundary of agricultural land consists of the brz and hsz the tds along the transect ab is 363 000 mg l at the center of the lake and it gradually reduces to 162 000 mg l at the btl shoreline fig 5 the first part of the unexploited region adjacent to the shoreline is brine confirming active salt water intrusion the ec reduces along the unexploited region due to precipitation recharge and reduction of the capillary fringe due to the enhancement of water table depth the salinity of brz and hsz is at such a level that no plants can survive there is no ec data in unexploited region to determine the boundary between the brz and hsz the schematic boundary between these two zones is presented in fig 6 the bz is from the end of hsz to the beginning of tz and the type of water is chloride the bz is located above the interface of this zone with the underlying hsz the ec at the beginning of bz ranges mostly from about 15 000 to 20 000 μs cm at different coastal aquifers table 3 the unexpected high range of ec at beginning of the bz near the boundary of hsz and bz is due to high discharge rate of pumping deepening some of the exploited wells short distance to neighboring wells and type of crops halophytes the high range of ec may result in significant reduction of crops yields the quality of groundwater gradually increases in the bz due to precipitation recharge and agricultural return flow in addition the depth to interface between the hsz and bz increases along the bz and consequently reduces the effect of hsz diffusion on salinity of the bz tz is mixing of brackish and freshwater the source of freshwater is alluvium or karstic aquifers at the high land around the btl which flow toward the tz the boundary between the bz and tz is determined by a sharp and significantly high reduction of ec on both sides of this line the red color line on fig 6 it implies that saltwater intrusion is stopped in the tz in the tz ec ranges from 1 100 to 4 300 μs cm the found boundary is also found by the sharp cl concentration difference on opposite sides the boundary between the tz and the fz is slightly arbitrary but still well defined by the change of ec 1 200 μs cm in the tz to ec 1200 μs cm for the freshwater zone fig 6 average of ec in the beginning and end of each zone of the btl coastal aquifers shows the same trend as khane kat and neyriz aquifers except pichakan aquifer because bz of this aquifer is surrounded by the hsz and there is no fresh aquifer fig 7 as was mentioned earlier based on long term investigation of iso potential map the general flow direction is from both the bz and fz toward the tz except pichakan and tang hena in wet and dry years and months fig 2a and b in addition the tz is usually narrow in most of the coastal aquifers the ec and cl concentrations in the fz are less than 1200 μs cm and 100 mg l respectively the water type in this zone is of the bicarbonate type the general flow direction is from the karstic formation toward the alluvial aquifers these classes imply that the concentration and ec range of the three zones show a region of common overlap because for all 8 aquifers the local conditions are quite complex besides active swi as a process that controls the distribution of salinity also extractions at many places and diverse depths and rates affect the salinity distribution in the vertical direction e g due to upconing spatial distribution of ec in the maps for 2004 and 2009 fig 2a and b indicates that in the parts of aquifers closest to the lake the highest ec values are measured and with increasing distance from the lake the ec values reduce the progression of active swi in the bz is different in the different coastal aquifers the pichakan and tang hana aquifers which are surrounded by impervious ophiolite and radiolarite rocks do not experience a freshwater recharge towards the alluvial aquifers this leads to a larger intrusion and farther extension of the bz by comparison of the spatial distribution of ec maps in 2004 and 2009 it is apparent that the regions with ec values exceeding 10 000 μs cm incased in 2009 which is far more than in 2004 due to btl shrinkage the increase of the density of the lake water and the drop in the water table by over exploitation and dry years lead to increasing ec in the aquifers 5 5 hydrochemical variation using eq 2 lake water fractions range from 0 0 to 5 1 in the all coastal aquifers the low lake water proportion within the fz indicate that these regions are not affected by active swi in contrast the highest lake water proportion is found in the bz indicating that this zone is more vulnerable to lake water intrusion the lake water proportion of groundwater increases towards the lake besides differences in salinity between the three zones bz tz and fz also the chemical signature is different as well as characteristic of these zones the piper 262 typical wells in 2009 plots of major cations and anions in groundwater samples of the study area are shown in fig 8 a the piper diagram shows the presence of various hydrochemical facies that were observed in the groundwater samples such as ca hco3 na hco3 na so4 ca so4 mg cl ca cl and na cl types the dominant chemical facies in water are ca cl and na cl types the water samples of the coastal aquifer are predominantly of the cl type 83 and some of the hco3 type 13 6 and so4 2 type 3 4 respectively the fz samples distributed in the left corner of the piper diagram are mainly represented by ca and mg bicarbonate ca mg hco3 type water this type of water naturally evolves by contact with predominantly limestone and dolomitic strata and cements in the recharge area the tz water samples from places that are located between the two endmembers fresh water and lake are indicative of mixing leading to a water composition with partially bicarbonates of ca and mg and na cl types the water type of the bz samples that are close to btl is of the na cl type and due to intrusion of btl water as far as the coast aquifers are concerned the saline samples occupy the right top section and have been obtained near the boundary of bz and tz their chemical properties are controlled by alkaline earth cations and chloride this process occurs under conditions of saltwater intrusion which leads to the change of water facies from na cl to ca cl type xue et al 1995 appelo and postma 2005 han et al 2014 najib et al 2017 eeman et al 2016 abu alnaeem et al 2018 nogueira et al 2019 telahigue et al 2020 regarded as an important water end member the btl water and brine under the lake are also plotted in the figure and their water type is of the na cl type the piper diagram illustrates the different species that can be found in the water samples of different signatures this is confirmed in the gibbs diagram fig 8 b this diagram shows the tds concentration is a function of the ratio between cl and cl hco3 showing a distinct gradual change from lake water quality towards the freshwater that is dominated by chemical interaction between calcareous rock and groundwater with increasing tds the water quality changes from freshwater to transition due to mixing of freshwater with intruding lake water towards the lake s water composition however it is evident that the so called brackish water bz is significantly less saline than the lake itself 5 6 conceptual model of the btl coastal aquifers the hydrogeological geochemical and hydraulic data were combined to develop a conceptual model for swi into the coastal aquifers of btl fig 9 the model consist of 5 zones brz hsz bz tz and fz using abbreviations introduced in section 5 4 the type of water is na cl in the first three zones but it changes to mixed ca na cl hco3 in tz and ca hco3 in the fresh zone the right and the left sides of this figure are the land boundary and the lake respectively at the lake side h s denotes the level of the lake water and at the land side h f is the freshwater table whereas often in swi studies h s is constant here it appears that h s is not constant tds of pore water under the lake decreases from the center of lakes to the coast not only does the head of lake water or brine under the lake decrease as the distance to the lake center increases but also this level continues to decrease as a function of time the regional head difference between the center of the lake and the transition zone tz is the force driving groundwater flow towards this tz an additional driving force though is the gradient in salinity and therefore in density of the pore water which decreases in the same direction as the decreasing groundwater head as the salinity is quite significant so is the density difference with average density at the lake side of 1 259 g cm3 accordingly we can speak for the coastal aquifers of active swi werner et al 2013 where the driving force due to density gradients enhance that due to the water level differences since under more or less constant water density the land side of the aquifers experience fresh groundwater flow this fresh groundwater flow meets that coming from the lake at the transition zone in part near of the coastal aquifer due to excessive salinity it is already no longer possible to use the water pumped up by wells natural causes as well as human influence especially groundwater pumping from coastal freshwater wells have increased saltwater intrusion in many coastal areas ferguson and gleeson 2012 lu et al 2013a in the present case the conventional circulation of saline water at the interface of saline and freshwater back to lake does not significantly occur the main reason is that the interface is located at the area where wells are pumping up the water the sources of water that replenishes the coastal aquifers are infiltrating rainwater agricultural return flows and inflow from the adjacent karstic formations the source of salinity is the salt that originates from both the lake and underlying brine and salt marsh the ec of exploitation wells is generally less than 20000 μs cm because the farmers usually reduce the well depth to prevent the deteriorating water quality due to upconing this is also apparent from the well depths that generally increase away from the lake coast because the depth to saline brackish interface increases 5 7 temporal variation and forecasting of groundwater salinity and level the time series of measured ec and groundwater level show both for the recent past and the near future a groundwater level decline and ec rise for the period of 2002 to 2026 fig 10 the statistical criteria of accuracy of training datasets are presented in table 4 the water level in piezometers decreases in all the coastal aquifers in the brackish zone but the ec does not follow the gradual decreasing trend of water table and its variation is high in all coastal aquifers in spite of the dropping water table the ec is almost constant or even a slight decreasing trend in some of the coastal aquifers the number of piezometers is limited and their distance with pumping wells is regulated to be out of the depression cone of the pumping wells therefore the decreasing trend of water level in piezometers is due to total overexploitation of coastal aquifers the depth of water inside the wells is shallow and ec of water below the well bottom is high in the pumping wells of the brackish zone as the discharge increases in a well the water level inside that well decreases consequently the ec increases the salinity in a well is sensitive to discharge duration of exploited water use of that pumping well and water demand type of crops the ec of each pumping well also depends on farmer management as the salinity increases in a pumping well the farmer reduces the ec by the management strategy such as reducing the discharge and water demand by changing the type of crop therefore the constant ec or even a narrow decreasing trend is a management strategy and it does not affect the water level in the piezometer discharges that increase have a significant effect on the dropping water table in pumping well but no effect in piezometers far from pumping well the crops with high tolerance to salinity are cultivated in spite of drastically production reduction there is no official systematic management program to reduce the overexploitation therefore the water level decline and ec enhancement will be expected in the future fig 10 the main constraint is the water table must be controlled at a specific level because a the wells may fall dry due to shallow wells depth b the farmers based on their experience reduce the discharge to prevent a further drop in well level in spite of these constraints the active intrusion advances into the brackish zone due to the hydraulic gradient force the predicted results of ec and water level in the bakhtegan tashk catchment area highlighted an environmental crisis of the groundwater and lake of being seriously subject to declining water level and high rates of saline water intrusion it is highly recommended that must stop exploitation of groundwater in the brackish zone to prevent increasing saltwater intrusion and soil salinity management of water resources exploitation is necessary to ensure a balance between recharge and pumping from groundwater future plans i e numerical modeling must be developed to use sustainable consumption of groundwater to avoid groundwater salinization however as america et al 2020 showed such modelling may have an even higher demand of data input in view of the complexities of the fresh salt groundwater system table 4 6 conclusions the original and natural general flow direction was directed from the coastal aquifers towards the btl however we have established that currently the general flow direction has reversed from the btl or salt marsh towards the adjacent aquifers this is demonstrated by the iso potential lines of 2004 2009 2017 and several other years in both wet and dry months the main reason of this reversal is the over exploitation of the adjacent aquifers that cause the decline of the water tables to below the btl water level even though the water levels of btl itself are also dropping in addition the average salinity of the btl has also increased profoundly from a tds of 45400 mg l before 2007 to about 256000 mg l after shrinkage this has increased the salinity and therefore water density gradient which implies stronger buoyancy forces that also induce flow from the btl toward the adjacent aquifers in this study we developed an active saltwater intrusion swi conceptual model for the btl and the coastal aquifers under overexploitation spatial analysis of active swi showed that for most of the coastal aquifers five zones can be distinguished with different hydro chemical signatures namely the brine zone brz highly saline zone hsz brackish zone bz transition zone tz and fresh zone fz brz and hsz are found in the area where production wells are lacking in view of the high salinity with an ec of more than 20000 μs cm bz is an area that is severely affected by active swi and the chemical water is type is 100 cl tz with narrow width has special characteristics namely a it shows mixing of fresh and brackish zones b it has the lowest water levels in the study area c it comprises the farthest inland toe of salt fresh interface movement of active swi and d has a significant salinity gradient at the boundary between the bz and tz fz is entirely recharged by the karstic formation and the water type is 100 hco3 hydro chemical variation piper and gibbs diagrams confirm our classification of coastal aquifer zones based on the conceptual model developed presently the conventional circulation of saline water at the interface of saline and freshwater back to lake is almost absent the svr modelling revealed how the salinity grows while the water level further drops continuously from 2002 to 2026 in the coastal aquifers this robust forecasting of future ec values and water level for short to intermediate periods about equal to the experimental data period is useful approach for developing sustainable and groundwater resource management strategies for the future and may help to prioritize remedial actions for the different aquifers as we have established lake brine gradually intrudes further into the fresh coastal aquifers this is a threat as clearly the aquifer suffers from over exploitation which disagrees with sustainable water management in the region it is apparent that the current situation of active swi is indicative of the need to develop a regional freshwater management plan
