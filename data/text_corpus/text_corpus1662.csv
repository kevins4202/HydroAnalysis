8310,study region the zambezi river basin one of the most important water resources in sub saharan africa from both a water supply and hydro power generation perspective study focus calibration of two hydrological models pitman and weap that have been established for 76 sub basins covering the total basin area of about 1 350 000 km2 the longer term purpose of establishing the models is to facilitate scenario analyses of future conditions related to changes in water use and management as well as climate change new hydrological insights for the region while there are many inevitable uncertainties in the data used as well as the models and calibrated parameter sets themselves the results suggest that the models are generally fit for purpose in terms of evaluating future changes there are however some parts of the basin where the reduction of identified uncertainties would lead to improved models and greater confidence in their future use one of sources of uncertainty relates to the existence of several large wetland areas that have impacts on downstream flows but are difficult to simulate due to the relatively poor existing understanding of the dynamics of water exchange between the river channels and the wetland storage areas keywords zambezi river basin hydrological models calibration model uncertainties 1 introduction in the preface and introductory chapter to his well known text on rainfall runoff modelling beven 2001 identifies most of the key issues associated with hydrological modelling the first is that natural hydrological systems are very complex and largely unknowable suggesting that modelling them is almost impossible the second is that despite the validity of the first issue we need models because of the limitations of the available measurement systems and the fact that many areas remain ungauged the third key issue is that there is a plethora of available models and it will always be difficult or impossible for any individual to review the full range and make an informed choice of a model for a specific task the fourth is that while some models are developed for research purposes the ultimate aim of prediction using models must be to improve decision making about a practical hydrological problem box 1979 is often credited with the first use of the expression all models are wrong but some are useful which can be construed as both a criticism as well as a compliment of hydrological modelling the concept that hydrological models are less than perfect in their ability to reproduce reality is reflected in many studies over the last two to three decades that have focused on the uncertainties in modelling predictions beven 1993 2005 pappenberger and beven 2006 ivanović and freer 2009 beven and alcock 2012 hughes 2016 a great deal of the impetus for investigating uncertainty in hydrological modelling resulted from the iahs international association of hydrological science scientific decade 2003 2012 on pub predictions in ungauged basins sivapalan et al 2003 hrachowitz et al 2013 while many of the contributions to pub focused on the science of modelling the issues of practical modelling applications were not ignored hughes et al 2014a one of the key issues related to practical modelling is the level of detail included in a model and therefore the size of the parameter space one argument is that fully distributed physics based models are too complex for many practical purposes especially in large basins and relatively data scarce areas largely because the data requirements may not be satisfied beven 2001 at the other end of the scale there have also been arguments for parsimonious models perrin et al 2001 willems 2014 that minimise equifinality in the parameter space beven 2006 the perceived advantage of parsimonious models is they are more likely to produce unique solutions when applied using automatic calibration procedures however there is an alternative argument hughes 2010 that suggests that explicitly simulating the main catchment scale water balance processes can be an advantage in practical hydrological modelling even if this leads to a larger parameter space and greater equifinality savenije 2001 this is particularly true when a model is to be used to evaluate future scenarios associated with development or climate change impacts if the main water balance processes interception surface runoff interflow groundwater recharge and drainage evapotranspiration etc are not simulated explicitly and appropriately kirchner 2006 then it might be unrealistic to expect a model to be sensitive to changes in rainfall temperature evapotranspiration water use e g groundwater abstraction impacts on baseflow and land use warburton et al 2010 ultimately practical modelling becomes a compromise between what might be the best model scientifically and the one that is appropriately structured given certain constraints associated with the available forcing data the information that the user wishes to extract from the model results and the scale of the basin being modelled hughes 2015 these constraints were taken into consideration in selecting the two models that have been used in this study that was designed to establish appropriate hydrological and water resources development modelling tools for the whole of the zambezi river basin approximately 1 350 000 km2 in area this paper briefly presents the models the results of establishing calibration and validation the models to represent historical conditions as well as identifying the key modelling uncertainties related to the models or the data in the different parts of the basin a dedicated paper hughes and farinosi 2020 presents the details of several future scenarios based on likely possible future changes in water resources development and climate how these are incorporated into the models and the simulated consequences of these future scenarios 2 the zambezi river basin the zambezi river is one of the largest rivers in africa with a total catchment area of about 1 350 000 km2 and drains parts of eight countries angola botswana malawi mozambique namibia tanzania zambia and zimbabwe apart from the main river the total basin consists of several major tributary systems including the luangwa kafue chobe and shire rivers fig 1 a fig 1b illustrates that there are several major wetland systems luangwa and barotse floodplains lukanga swamps kafue flats many more localised wetland systems on the chobe and shire rivers as well as one of the largest natural lakes in africa lake malawi niassa mean annual rainfall varies from over 1 200 mm y 1 in some of the headwater areas of the shire and kafue sub basins to less than 700 mm y 1 in the more arid parts of zimbabwe the rainfall is also highly seasonal the main wet season being from november to march mean annual potential evapotranspiration varies from about 1 200 to 1 700 mm y 1 reflecting a similar spatial pattern as the rainfall higher evapotranspiration in the lower rainfall areas the majority of the basin is underlain by hard rocks metamorphic igneous and sedimentary while the western areas of the chobe and upper zambezi are underlain by the deep unconsolidated deposits of the kalahari sands the major water resource development impacts are related to the hydro power dams including evaporation losses on the kafue river itezhi tezhi and kafue gorge as well as on the main river at kariba and cahora bassa dams spalding fecher et al 2017 there are also known but largely unquantified at the sub basin scale localised abstractions for irrigation mining and domestic use sadc 2008 these are not considered to be currently large enough to substantially impact the natural flow regime of the main tributaries and therefore the historical hydrology of the basin upstream of the major dams can be considered to be stationary winsemius et al 2006 for the purposes of this study the total basin area has been divided into 76 sub basins fig 1a and table 1 that reflect the location of either gauging stations see table in the supplementary material key natural features e g wetlands or existing major water resource development infrastructure mostly hydro power reservoirs the average area of the sub basins is about 18 000 km2 the smallest is 586 km2 and the largest 78 252 km2 there are 38 sub basins that have some stream flow or water storage data that are considered potentially useful for model calibration while a further 8 sub basins have observed data that are considered too uncertain to be useful the latter were identified because their data were either inconsistent with other gauged data or internally inconsistent large scale changes within the record or contain too much missing data while the main river and many of the major tributary systems are gauged the basin remains a relatively data scarce region in terms of the length and quality of some of the stream flow records as well as the additional climate and water use data that are required to establish a hydrological model 3 models and calibration methods while other models have been previously applied in some parts of the basin winsemius et al 2006 kling et al 2014 jury 2017 the two models used in this study are the water evaluation and planning weap model https www weap21 org accessed november 2019 and the rhodes university version of the pitman model pitman 1973 hughes 2013 both are semi distributed conceptual type models that operate at a monthly time step and both have been previously applied in parts of the zambezi river basin as well as other areas of sub saharan africa cervigni et al 2015 hughes 2016 spalding fecher et al 2017 hughes and mazibuko 2018 the choice of these models was based on the authors existing calibration experience the frequency of use of the models in sub saharan africa and because both represent compromises between detailed and simple models and either explicitly or implicitly include the key runoff generation processes expected to occur within the zambezi both models can represent a range of development impacts albeit in different ways both are packaged within application systems that include a spatial interface map of sub areas nodes and other information and tools for data management and for reviewing the simulation results more details can be found about the weap model at https www weap21 org while further details on the pitman model can be found by downloading https www ru ac za iwr research spatsim the spatsim spatial and time series information modelling software which is a generic modelling framework within which the iwr version of the pitman model as well as other models is applied hughes and forsyth 2006 the available support material for both models contain extensive lists of model applications documented in published papers scientific reports or postgraduate theses all of the evidence therefore suggests that both of these models are fit for purpose in terms of practical hydrological and water resources simulation modelling in the zambezi river basin in general terms the weap model is simpler with fewer parameters than the pitman model however it is also quite flexible and users can to a certain extent modify the default algorithms to create a different structure previous experience of applying both models to the same basins suggests that it is possible to align the weap algorithms to approximately match the outputs from the pitman model cervigni et al 2015 but also that there are some key differences in some situations the first is that the ground water approach in the pitman model hughes 2004 is more complex than the weap model the total recharge leaving the main moisture storage zone of the pitman model can be subject to evapotranspiration in the riparian channel margins before contributing to stream flow the pitman model can therefore simulate alternating periods of ground water contributions and periods of no contribution hughes 2004 while the weap model can simulate variable volumes of ground water outflow it cannot simulate periods with and without outflows unless the default algorithms are modified to include an upper zone moisture store threshold below which there is no outflow even then the model always simulates some flow even if it is very small there are also differences in the approaches to the simulation of recharge and interflow processes the weap model uses a single upper zone conductivity parameter and a fixed a value of 2 0 power relationship with relative upper zone moisture content the total outflow is then partitioned between interflow and ground water recharge the pitman model uses separate non linear functions for these two processes each with maximum outflow and power parameters a further key difference between the models in the context of the zambezi river basin is that the pitman model includes an explicit sub model to simulate the exchange processes between river channels and large wetlands hughes et al 2014b the approach adopted in the weap model is to create a reservoir with release operating rules to represent the outflows from wetland storage as well as a bypass channel to divert flows from upstream that are assumed to pass through the wetland while this makes it quite difficult to quantify the various components of the reservoir bypass system in the weap model it is also acknowledged that the wetland sub model of the pitman model is not simple to parameterise without detailed wetland information makungu 2019 the pitman model also has a channel routing function that can be used to delay and attenuate upstream flows through large sub basins or basins with large and low gradient channels hughes et al 2006 no such function exists in the weap model with respect to development impacts both models are able to represent direct abstractions as well as reservoir storage abstractions and downstream releases arguably the weap model has more facilities to represent water resources operating rules supply curtailments and priority rules for competing demands than the pitman model the pitman model includes a simple function to represent aggregated farm dam storage and abstractions within a sub basin using a parameter representing the of the area supplying the dams a separate sub basin node would have to be created to achieve the same objective in the weap model 3 1 forcing data both models were forced using the university of east anglia climate research unit data https crudata uea ac uk timm grid cru ts 2 1 html accessed during oct 2019 which is available from 1901 to 2017 at a grid scale of 0 5 harris et al 2014 the potential evaporation data for the pitman model are based on the lisvap calculations alfieri et al 2019 based on the era5 data for 1979 2018 https confluence ecmwf int display ckb era5 data documentation accessed during oct 2019 the reference evapotranspiration inputs to the weap model are based on historical gridded 0 25 degrees time series climate data temperature precipitation and wind speed for 1948 2010 generated by the terrestrial hydrology research group at princeton university department of civil and environmental engineering princeton university 2006 sheffield et al 2006 actual evapotranspiration in weap is calculated using the rainfall runoff soil moisture method https www weap21 org webhelp two bucket method htm which utilises the potential evapotranspiration crop coefficient factor and the upper and lower zone soil moisture states in a two bucket model 3 2 calibration methods both models are traditionally calibrated using manual parameter adjustments to obtain good representations of the available observed data coupled with relatively subjective parameter transfer approaches to un gauged areas based on sub basin physical and climate similarity this can be an effective approach when there are observed data available at several points headwater and downstream in the modelling system the assessment of alternative parameter sets is guided by visual comparison of time series flow duration curves fdcs and seasonal distributions and backed up within the spatsim system with the calculation of several objective functions these include the bias in mean monthly simulated volume and the nash coefficient of efficiency ce using both untransformed and natural log transformed flows the weap model simulations can be exported and imported into spatsim to calculate the same objective function values while automatic calibration approaches are often favoured they are not always very successful in regions where there are potential problems with the rainfall forcing data and when the models being calibrated contain a relatively high level of equifinality which both models do part of the problem is that the automatic calibrations can generate spurious parameter sets as they try to fit the model to parts of the time series where the rainfall data might be inadequate if these can be identified a manual calibration process can ignore these periods however the iwr version of the pitman model also includes an option to use a simple random parameter sampling scheme using a uniform distribution using plausible ranges of some or all parameters to generate ensemble outputs these outputs can be used to more rapidly explore the model domain for groups of parameter values that generate the best results compared with all or parts of the observed data time series they can also be used to identify different parameter combinations that produce broadly similar results equifinality for example in some situations the two surface runoff functions of the pitman model table 2 may produce equally acceptable results while the low flow regime may be equally well simulated with either interflow or ground water outflow as the dominant process without further site specific information about real processes it may not be possible to resolve such equifinalities but it is useful to know that they exist this version of the model has been previously applied in several areas of the basin hughes 2013 hughes and mazibuko 2018 and the results were very useful in guiding the manual calibration process several additional runs were made during the current calibration study to further explore the parameter space for parameter sets that yield satisfactory model performance while a similar facility is not available for the weap model the pitman model results can still be useful to guide the manual calibration of the weap parameters split sampling verification has not been used in this study partly because some of the observed records are quite short meaning that the samples used would be even shorter a further reason is the rainfall inputs are known to be uncertain based on previous experiences of using these data in the region hughes et al 2011a but we do not know which parts of the record might be more uncertain than others and this could bias a split sample testing approach the key component of validation in this study is therefore that good calibration results for upstream sub basins should also result in good calibration results for downstream sub basins hughes et al 2006 the main objectives of the study are not to scientifically prove that the models are applicable this has been done before in this region with both models but to determine where and where not acceptable simulations can be achieved that are useful for future assessments of water resources availability and management this includes identifying the key uncertainties in both the models and the available data and the spatial variability of such uncertainties so that these can be targeted in future studies or data collection programmes 4 calibration results table 2 presents the data periods used for comparison and the four objective function statistics that are used to summarise the model performance for the two models and for all the sub basins with useful observed data the following paragraphs discuss the model performance and key uncertainty issues for each of the major sub systems of the zambezi river basin fig 1a some qualitative assessments of the model results in different parts of the basin are included in the text using words such as reasonable quite poor very bad etc these evaluations are based on several criteria that include the four main objective functions applied to the time series data but also include assessments of the correspondence of the simulated fdc and seasonal distributions to the observed data reasonable or better could be defined as nash sutcliffe efficiency values above 0 5 and bias values of less than 10 coupled with similar fdcs and seasonal distributions to the observed 4 1 luangwa river a key geomorphological feature of the western parts of the luangwa river basin is the presence of dambos which are relatively small but frequent valley bottom wetlands that have the potential to generate saturated surface runoff during the early part of the wet season hughes and mazibuko 2018 the other key feature is the luangwa river floodplain although recent work suggests that the downstream impacts attenuation and delay are quite minimal at the monthly time scale makungu 2019 and no wetland effects were included in the weap model while both models produce acceptable results at lng5 the slightly better results for the pitman model might reflect the inclusion of the wetland sub model the main difference between the results at the downstream gauge lng7 is that the weap model tends to predict a wet season that peaks approximately one month too soon 4 2 kafue river the kafue river is well gauged but it is also quite complex with two major wetlands the lukanga swamps kaf5 mwelwa 2004 and the kafue flats kaf9 the itezhi tezhi dam kaf8 located upstream of the kafue flats is used for controlled releases to the kafue gorge hydro power dam kaf10 the pattern of controlled releases used within the models was based on some observed data for part of the modelling period there are known to be some abstractions along most of the length of the main channel but these are poorly quantified the results for the pitman model down to the gauge at hook bridge kaf7 are encouraging and reasonable results were obtained below kafue gorge dam kaf10 despite the complications of trying to capture the release patterns from the two reservoirs as well as the effects of the kafue flats wetland the weap results for some of the upstream sub basins are relatively poor and the main differences between the two models are that the wet season peaks too soon in the weap simulations while the weap fdcs are sometimes better than the pitman model 4 3 upper zambezi and chobe river this sub system is arguably the most complex of the western half of the zambezi river basin partly because of the kalahari sands in the extreme western parts several major wetlands including the barotse floodplain and partly because of some confusing signals from some of the available observed data the observed records suggest that the main eastern tributary kabompo river at bar3 has a quite steep fdc which is further reflected in the data downstream below ngonye falls bar5 and bar6 however the observed records for the other main gauged tributary bar7 suggest very high baseflow contributions that are incompatible with the flow records further downstream below ngonye falls bar6 and at victoria falls zam1 these gauging data therefore need to be further examined in the future to try and correctly resolve this source of uncertainty table 2 suggests that the simulations for both models are less successful than in the previous two systems but that the results remain reasonably satisfactory given the uncertainties associated with the data and the effects of the barotse floodplain the relatively poorer results for the weap model below ngonye falls bar6 and further downstream fig 2 are partly related to the difficulties of representing non linearities in the channel wetland exchange processes compared to the pitman model neither of the models were able to adequately simulate the patterns of observed flows for the chobe sub system which is relatively flat and underlain by kalahari sands while including wetlands in the pitman model helped to a certain extent the ce values remained below zero however the overall contribution of the chobe river to the zambezi river is very small both of the main zambezi river gauges zam1 and 2 above kariba dam have quite long records with few missing data and are generally consistent with each other however the peak season recorded flows at zam2 occur on average 1 month before those at zam1 fig 2a which clearly points to some data problems the problem seems to lie mostly with the gauge at victoria falls zam1 as the other two gauges bar6 and zam2 have similar seasonal distributions fig 2a the focus of the calibration effort was therefore on bar6 and zam2 at the expense of zam1 4 4 central basin tributaries most of the central basin tributaries drain the semi arid areas of zimbabwe and have either seasonal or ephemeral flow regimes with quite substantial periods of zero flow however the length of zero flow periods in the gauged record compared to natural conditions could be affected by upstream abstractions longer or reservoir releases and return flows shorter these types of catchments are difficult to simulate with coarse spatial and temporal scale models as they are generally not able to fully capture the high degree of variability in both rainfall and runoff response the main focus of the calibration exercise was therefore to simulate the fdc characteristics as well as possible the gwayi river sub system is gauged at four points but the downstream gauge has a short record 1996 to 2014 supplementary table and a very high proportion of missing data the results for the two main headwater sub areas are quite poor while the simulations improve somewhat at the mamatavi gauge downstream gwa2 table 2 and fig 3 a the main parts of the catchment are highly cultivated but there is no evidence of any large dams or extensive irrigation the senyati river map2 3 and 4 manyame river man2 and 3 and mazoe river maz1 and 2 sub systems are quite heavily utilised for agriculture supported by both large reservoirs and many smaller farm dams however the storage and demand information is highly uncertain and the water use could be highly non stationary table 2 and fig 3b map2 umfuli river indicate that the results are similar to site on the gwayi gwa2 with quite poor statistics despite reproducing the upper ends of the observed fdcs very well the downstream mazoe data at luenha maz1 are inconsistent with the upstream data and were not used in the calibration the final tributary in this sub region is the capoche river cap1 joining the zambezi river immediately downstream of cahora bassa dam unfortunately the gauging records are too uncertain to be useful for model calibration in some sub basins the models do not simulate the low flows and periods of zero flow very well to achieve zero flows for the weap model it was necessary to use a conditional expression with a storage threshold to limit interflow and groundwater outflow to replace the fixed conductivity parameter values in the pitman model groundwater outflow can be limited by using the riparian strip evapotranspiration loss parameter part of the difficulty with simulating the low flow regimes of these rivers is also likely to be due to non stationary water uses as well as the possibility of artificial downstream releases from the larger reservoirs e g within map3 map4 and man3 4 5 lake malawi nyasa sub system there are six gauged tributaries flowing into lake malawi nyasa while data for two additional gauges ruk3 and lil1 have been rejected due to excessive runoff coefficients 66 and 69 respectively compared to other catchments in the same area 20 comparisons of the cru rainfall data with an alternative data set from the university of delaware unidel willmott and matsuura 2001 reveals that the unidel data are 18 and 69 higher than the cru data for ruh2 and ruk3 respectively suggesting that the cru data are not suitable for some parts of the lake malawi sub system there are also some inconsistencies within some of the gauged records such that some periods were rejected for calibration purposes the results for the downstream gauge on the ruhuru river ruh1 the songwe ruk1 the south rukuru ruk2 and the bua nam1 rivers are considered acceptable table 2 further evidenced by good reproductions of the observed fdcs and seasonal distributions overall the pitman model performed better than the weap model in these sub basins table 2 for the pitman model the wetland sub model was used to try and simulate the dynamics of lake malawi and to calibrate the outflows against the observed flows at the outlet mal1 in the weap model the lake impacts are simulated using a reservoir with bypass flows however the calibration of both models is severely affected by the uncertainties in the quality of the data at mal1 there are five gauges on the shire river downstream of the lake but they are highly inconsistent with each other not only in terms of the variability of monthly flow volumes but also in terms of the seasonality for example the observed flows for mal1 peak in august for mal3 and mal4 in may and for shr1 and shr3 in march the simulated outflows peak in april may as much as 3 months earlier than the observed outflows not surprisingly the nash coefficients are very poor 0 35 despite the volume bias statistics being relatively low 5 the results further downstream along the shire river are even worse with very low or negative nash coefficients partly related to the lack of reliable observed flow data signals inadequate simulations upstream and the wetland dynamics in parts of the shire river these results clearly point towards the need for much more information about the hydrological dynamics of this part of the zambezi river basin however the simulated lake volumes compare quite favourably to some observed water level data 1973 2017 at mbamba bay in tanzania fig 4 with a regression coefficient of about 0 66 despite a period with poor correlations between 2002 and 2012 for 1973 2001 the regression coefficient increases to 0 92 the observed and simulated water level seasonal distributions are also close both peaking in april may 4 6 main zambezi river including kariba and cahora bassa dams the operation of the two dams has not been very consistent over the period of historical records and they were simulated using the available information on controlled releases and spills gandolfi and salewicz 1990 indicate that kariba dam is partly operated for flood control and that managed releases are made early in some wet seasons to prevent the reservoir from spilling the downstream observed record was used to try and establish a pattern of flood releases dependent upon reservoir storage volume that improved the simulations although there are some gauge data at zam3a just above the confluence with the kafue river the available data appear to be highly suspect gauge data exist at tete zam6 and zam9 below the shire river confluence but the latter is of little value for calibration due to the dominant influence of the poorly simulated shire river sub system the statistical comparisons of kariba zam3 outflow volume are relatively poor but improve downstream at tete table 2 and fig 5 the statistics given in table 2 are based mostly on the longer post dam period fig 5b and are inevitably affected by the uncertainties in the flood control operations of both dams in general terms both models produce quite similar results at tete zam6 with the pitman model being slightly better in terms of fdc and seasonal distribution patterns 5 model validity with respect to simulated hydrological processes a key issue associated with the scientific and practical value of hydrological model results is whether an acceptable calibration has been achieved for the right reason kirchner 2006 if not the model may not be sensitive to at least some future changes in either climate or land use however it is impossible to validate a model in terms of the relative contributions of the components of evaporative losses and runoff generation because we do not and probably never will know what these are at the coarse scale of the sub basins used for the zambezi river basin the alternative is to suggest that if we get results that satisfy a wide variety of fitting criteria then we can assume that we are acceptably close in simulating the results for the right reason these criteria include not only the overall fit statistics based on the time series of monthly flow table 2 but also the shapes of the seasonal distributions and flow duration curves similarly getting appropriate fdc shapes for semi arid catchments including the length of time of zero flows cannot really be achieved without getting the right balance at the catchment scale between surface runoff dominant and intermittent interflow or groundwater inputs to the channel fig 6 shows the total runoff partitioning into surface runoff interflow and groundwater outflow to the channel for selected sub basins using the pitman model results the weap model results are very similar as the parameterisation was guided by the parameter sets used for the pitman model in general terms the partitioning shown is consistent with what we expect in the different parts of the zambezi as well as with previously reported results for similar areas winsemius et al 2006 hughes and mazibuko 2018 kaf4 on the lunga river is quite typical of many of the sub basins of the kafue and luangwa river systems where there is an almost equal split between the three runoff components and the surface runoff is dominated by saturation excess runoff due to the presence of dambos the two major western tributaries of the luangwa river lng8 and lng10 required high saturation excess surface runoff to get the correct seasonal distribution at the downstream gauge lng7 ruh1 represents typical partitioning in the gauged tributaries of lake malawi and is quite similar to the sub humid sub basins of the kafue the results for the luanginga river at bar4 are not very good table 2 but fig 6 illustrates the partitioning that might be expected for some of the areas in the west of the upper zambezi underlain by kalahari sands resulting in a low proportion of surface runoff and either high interflow or groundwater contributions it is quite difficult to resolve whether interflow or groundwater should dominate without more information about the real processes map2 represents a typical partitioning for the semi arid sub basins where the dominant runoff process is assumed to be infiltration excess surface runoff with some intermittent groundwater contributions during more prolonged wet periods 6 discussion and conclusions for a large part of the zambezi river basin the pitman model results and to a somewhat lesser degree the weap model results are considered to be acceptable and fit for purpose given the large number of uncertainties involved in this study table 2 and fig 7 the main focus of this discussion is to summarise these uncertainties and attempt to identify those that might potentially be reduced given realistic expectations about the availability of additional data and or further efforts to improve the model calibrations it is immediately apparent from table 2 and fig 7 that the pitman model has produced better results overall than the weap model part of this conclusion is related to the greater experience of the authors in the application of the pitman model within the southern africa region given that both models were largely calibrated using subjective manual adjustment of the parameter values whether a more experienced weap model user could achieve appreciably better results possibly using the expression builder to modify the default model structure is a moot point however the tools available within spatsim to facilitate the calibration of the pitman play a major role in achieving improved calibration this includes the parameter exploration version of the model that allows ensemble outputs to be generated based on sampling from a priori parameter bounds one of the recommendations of this study is that improved calibration tools could be added to the weap model interface following one of the review suggestions it would also be useful to add the popular kling gupta efficiency criteria gupta et al 2009 to the standard objective functions calculated within the spatsim interface for the pitman model this paper has not presented any uncertainty analyses of the model results partly because the objective was to cover the whole basin and space does not permit a lengthy discussion about uncertainty analysis and partly because uncertainty analyses have not been completed for all the sub basins however it would be a relatively straightforward task to implement a full uncertainty analysis using the pitman model now that we have some initial calibrations and a reasonably acceptable understanding of the runoff characteristics of all the sub basins based on validations using downstream gauging stations the major uncertainties from a practical water resources perspective across most of the basin lie in the projections of future water availability the subject of the follow on to this paper hughes and farinosi 2020 if water resources management decisions need to be taken in the largely ungauged parts of the basin then it will be beneficial in the future to implement a more thorough uncertainty analysis of the historical flow simulations a number of decisions were taken about the quality of the observed data and whether to reject some records and keep others these decisions were largely subjective as we did not have access to the raw data stage records and stage discharge relationships while some of the decisions are considered to be quite robust for example those based on excessive runoff coefficients others need to be further checked to ensure that both useful data have not been unnecessarily rejected and that poor data have not been used for calibration a key recommendation is that a dedicated assessment of all the observed stream flow and reservoir storage data should be initiated this assessment will clearly require the cooperation of the national hydrometric agencies of all the riparian countries but the benefits should be self evident the outcomes will help to remove some of the uncertainties in the model setups as well as provide possible guidelines for future hydrometric observation activities within the basin as a whole the input climate data and specifically the use of the cru rainfall data represent a large source of uncertainty in the model setups and results this appears to be particularly true in the northern parts of the lake malawi sub system as well as over the angolan parts of the basin previous experience with the cru data in the okavango river basin hughes et al 2011b hughes and gray 2017 suggest that the rainfall data inputs to the western parts of the basin in angola and parts of zambia are particularly problematic especially over the last few decades due to a reduction in the number of real rainfall observations fig 8 also illustrates the same problem using the weap data for kafue hook kaf7 where the earlier simulations pre 1990 are better than the later ones post 1990 particularly with respect to the simulations of the main wet season flows a result that is partially attributed to the decreased representativeness of the rainfall data however some limited attempts to use alternative rainfall data that combine different sources of information not relying solely on gauge data did not improve the calibrations and some of these data sets only start in the late 1970 s or later which means that some of the earlier stream flow data table 2 could not be used in the calibration while a comprehensive evaluation of many different data sets beck et al 2017 could be useful it would also be very time consuming given that the models would almost certainly require re calibration for each rainfall data set however from the perspective of simulating future water resources regimes under a changing climate it is essential that the main driver i e rainfall is estimated as well as possible an evaluation of different estimation approaches given the likelihood that the ground based observation network is unlikely to improve could therefore be critical for understanding future flow regimes and therefore water resources availability understanding of the dynamics of water exchange between the rivers and the many wetlands in the system represents a further major source of uncertainty in several parts of the basin the lack of detailed information about the existing water uses groundwater direct channel abstractions storage and demand patterns operating rules of hydro power dams etc in different parts of the basin also impacts on the quality of the simulations while some information is available e g world bank 2010 it is recommended that a database of water uses should be established as a matter of some priority some of these data might need to be inferred from secondary information such as land use patterns but a great deal of the key data might be available from water use licensing information held by the relevant national water resources management authorities access to this information would therefore require a great deal of cooperation between the relevant authorities of the riparian countries and an appropriate study team one of the key items of information that is required for running scenario analyses hughes and farinosi 2020 is realistic operating rules hydro power releases and flood control releases for the major dams in the system while reducing some of the uncertainties referred to above will be beneficial the overall conclusion is that the models have been established with sufficient confidence to suggest that they can be used for assessing future

8310,study region the zambezi river basin one of the most important water resources in sub saharan africa from both a water supply and hydro power generation perspective study focus calibration of two hydrological models pitman and weap that have been established for 76 sub basins covering the total basin area of about 1 350 000 km2 the longer term purpose of establishing the models is to facilitate scenario analyses of future conditions related to changes in water use and management as well as climate change new hydrological insights for the region while there are many inevitable uncertainties in the data used as well as the models and calibrated parameter sets themselves the results suggest that the models are generally fit for purpose in terms of evaluating future changes there are however some parts of the basin where the reduction of identified uncertainties would lead to improved models and greater confidence in their future use one of sources of uncertainty relates to the existence of several large wetland areas that have impacts on downstream flows but are difficult to simulate due to the relatively poor existing understanding of the dynamics of water exchange between the river channels and the wetland storage areas keywords zambezi river basin hydrological models calibration model uncertainties 1 introduction in the preface and introductory chapter to his well known text on rainfall runoff modelling beven 2001 identifies most of the key issues associated with hydrological modelling the first is that natural hydrological systems are very complex and largely unknowable suggesting that modelling them is almost impossible the second is that despite the validity of the first issue we need models because of the limitations of the available measurement systems and the fact that many areas remain ungauged the third key issue is that there is a plethora of available models and it will always be difficult or impossible for any individual to review the full range and make an informed choice of a model for a specific task the fourth is that while some models are developed for research purposes the ultimate aim of prediction using models must be to improve decision making about a practical hydrological problem box 1979 is often credited with the first use of the expression all models are wrong but some are useful which can be construed as both a criticism as well as a compliment of hydrological modelling the concept that hydrological models are less than perfect in their ability to reproduce reality is reflected in many studies over the last two to three decades that have focused on the uncertainties in modelling predictions beven 1993 2005 pappenberger and beven 2006 ivanović and freer 2009 beven and alcock 2012 hughes 2016 a great deal of the impetus for investigating uncertainty in hydrological modelling resulted from the iahs international association of hydrological science scientific decade 2003 2012 on pub predictions in ungauged basins sivapalan et al 2003 hrachowitz et al 2013 while many of the contributions to pub focused on the science of modelling the issues of practical modelling applications were not ignored hughes et al 2014a one of the key issues related to practical modelling is the level of detail included in a model and therefore the size of the parameter space one argument is that fully distributed physics based models are too complex for many practical purposes especially in large basins and relatively data scarce areas largely because the data requirements may not be satisfied beven 2001 at the other end of the scale there have also been arguments for parsimonious models perrin et al 2001 willems 2014 that minimise equifinality in the parameter space beven 2006 the perceived advantage of parsimonious models is they are more likely to produce unique solutions when applied using automatic calibration procedures however there is an alternative argument hughes 2010 that suggests that explicitly simulating the main catchment scale water balance processes can be an advantage in practical hydrological modelling even if this leads to a larger parameter space and greater equifinality savenije 2001 this is particularly true when a model is to be used to evaluate future scenarios associated with development or climate change impacts if the main water balance processes interception surface runoff interflow groundwater recharge and drainage evapotranspiration etc are not simulated explicitly and appropriately kirchner 2006 then it might be unrealistic to expect a model to be sensitive to changes in rainfall temperature evapotranspiration water use e g groundwater abstraction impacts on baseflow and land use warburton et al 2010 ultimately practical modelling becomes a compromise between what might be the best model scientifically and the one that is appropriately structured given certain constraints associated with the available forcing data the information that the user wishes to extract from the model results and the scale of the basin being modelled hughes 2015 these constraints were taken into consideration in selecting the two models that have been used in this study that was designed to establish appropriate hydrological and water resources development modelling tools for the whole of the zambezi river basin approximately 1 350 000 km2 in area this paper briefly presents the models the results of establishing calibration and validation the models to represent historical conditions as well as identifying the key modelling uncertainties related to the models or the data in the different parts of the basin a dedicated paper hughes and farinosi 2020 presents the details of several future scenarios based on likely possible future changes in water resources development and climate how these are incorporated into the models and the simulated consequences of these future scenarios 2 the zambezi river basin the zambezi river is one of the largest rivers in africa with a total catchment area of about 1 350 000 km2 and drains parts of eight countries angola botswana malawi mozambique namibia tanzania zambia and zimbabwe apart from the main river the total basin consists of several major tributary systems including the luangwa kafue chobe and shire rivers fig 1 a fig 1b illustrates that there are several major wetland systems luangwa and barotse floodplains lukanga swamps kafue flats many more localised wetland systems on the chobe and shire rivers as well as one of the largest natural lakes in africa lake malawi niassa mean annual rainfall varies from over 1 200 mm y 1 in some of the headwater areas of the shire and kafue sub basins to less than 700 mm y 1 in the more arid parts of zimbabwe the rainfall is also highly seasonal the main wet season being from november to march mean annual potential evapotranspiration varies from about 1 200 to 1 700 mm y 1 reflecting a similar spatial pattern as the rainfall higher evapotranspiration in the lower rainfall areas the majority of the basin is underlain by hard rocks metamorphic igneous and sedimentary while the western areas of the chobe and upper zambezi are underlain by the deep unconsolidated deposits of the kalahari sands the major water resource development impacts are related to the hydro power dams including evaporation losses on the kafue river itezhi tezhi and kafue gorge as well as on the main river at kariba and cahora bassa dams spalding fecher et al 2017 there are also known but largely unquantified at the sub basin scale localised abstractions for irrigation mining and domestic use sadc 2008 these are not considered to be currently large enough to substantially impact the natural flow regime of the main tributaries and therefore the historical hydrology of the basin upstream of the major dams can be considered to be stationary winsemius et al 2006 for the purposes of this study the total basin area has been divided into 76 sub basins fig 1a and table 1 that reflect the location of either gauging stations see table in the supplementary material key natural features e g wetlands or existing major water resource development infrastructure mostly hydro power reservoirs the average area of the sub basins is about 18 000 km2 the smallest is 586 km2 and the largest 78 252 km2 there are 38 sub basins that have some stream flow or water storage data that are considered potentially useful for model calibration while a further 8 sub basins have observed data that are considered too uncertain to be useful the latter were identified because their data were either inconsistent with other gauged data or internally inconsistent large scale changes within the record or contain too much missing data while the main river and many of the major tributary systems are gauged the basin remains a relatively data scarce region in terms of the length and quality of some of the stream flow records as well as the additional climate and water use data that are required to establish a hydrological model 3 models and calibration methods while other models have been previously applied in some parts of the basin winsemius et al 2006 kling et al 2014 jury 2017 the two models used in this study are the water evaluation and planning weap model https www weap21 org accessed november 2019 and the rhodes university version of the pitman model pitman 1973 hughes 2013 both are semi distributed conceptual type models that operate at a monthly time step and both have been previously applied in parts of the zambezi river basin as well as other areas of sub saharan africa cervigni et al 2015 hughes 2016 spalding fecher et al 2017 hughes and mazibuko 2018 the choice of these models was based on the authors existing calibration experience the frequency of use of the models in sub saharan africa and because both represent compromises between detailed and simple models and either explicitly or implicitly include the key runoff generation processes expected to occur within the zambezi both models can represent a range of development impacts albeit in different ways both are packaged within application systems that include a spatial interface map of sub areas nodes and other information and tools for data management and for reviewing the simulation results more details can be found about the weap model at https www weap21 org while further details on the pitman model can be found by downloading https www ru ac za iwr research spatsim the spatsim spatial and time series information modelling software which is a generic modelling framework within which the iwr version of the pitman model as well as other models is applied hughes and forsyth 2006 the available support material for both models contain extensive lists of model applications documented in published papers scientific reports or postgraduate theses all of the evidence therefore suggests that both of these models are fit for purpose in terms of practical hydrological and water resources simulation modelling in the zambezi river basin in general terms the weap model is simpler with fewer parameters than the pitman model however it is also quite flexible and users can to a certain extent modify the default algorithms to create a different structure previous experience of applying both models to the same basins suggests that it is possible to align the weap algorithms to approximately match the outputs from the pitman model cervigni et al 2015 but also that there are some key differences in some situations the first is that the ground water approach in the pitman model hughes 2004 is more complex than the weap model the total recharge leaving the main moisture storage zone of the pitman model can be subject to evapotranspiration in the riparian channel margins before contributing to stream flow the pitman model can therefore simulate alternating periods of ground water contributions and periods of no contribution hughes 2004 while the weap model can simulate variable volumes of ground water outflow it cannot simulate periods with and without outflows unless the default algorithms are modified to include an upper zone moisture store threshold below which there is no outflow even then the model always simulates some flow even if it is very small there are also differences in the approaches to the simulation of recharge and interflow processes the weap model uses a single upper zone conductivity parameter and a fixed a value of 2 0 power relationship with relative upper zone moisture content the total outflow is then partitioned between interflow and ground water recharge the pitman model uses separate non linear functions for these two processes each with maximum outflow and power parameters a further key difference between the models in the context of the zambezi river basin is that the pitman model includes an explicit sub model to simulate the exchange processes between river channels and large wetlands hughes et al 2014b the approach adopted in the weap model is to create a reservoir with release operating rules to represent the outflows from wetland storage as well as a bypass channel to divert flows from upstream that are assumed to pass through the wetland while this makes it quite difficult to quantify the various components of the reservoir bypass system in the weap model it is also acknowledged that the wetland sub model of the pitman model is not simple to parameterise without detailed wetland information makungu 2019 the pitman model also has a channel routing function that can be used to delay and attenuate upstream flows through large sub basins or basins with large and low gradient channels hughes et al 2006 no such function exists in the weap model with respect to development impacts both models are able to represent direct abstractions as well as reservoir storage abstractions and downstream releases arguably the weap model has more facilities to represent water resources operating rules supply curtailments and priority rules for competing demands than the pitman model the pitman model includes a simple function to represent aggregated farm dam storage and abstractions within a sub basin using a parameter representing the of the area supplying the dams a separate sub basin node would have to be created to achieve the same objective in the weap model 3 1 forcing data both models were forced using the university of east anglia climate research unit data https crudata uea ac uk timm grid cru ts 2 1 html accessed during oct 2019 which is available from 1901 to 2017 at a grid scale of 0 5 harris et al 2014 the potential evaporation data for the pitman model are based on the lisvap calculations alfieri et al 2019 based on the era5 data for 1979 2018 https confluence ecmwf int display ckb era5 data documentation accessed during oct 2019 the reference evapotranspiration inputs to the weap model are based on historical gridded 0 25 degrees time series climate data temperature precipitation and wind speed for 1948 2010 generated by the terrestrial hydrology research group at princeton university department of civil and environmental engineering princeton university 2006 sheffield et al 2006 actual evapotranspiration in weap is calculated using the rainfall runoff soil moisture method https www weap21 org webhelp two bucket method htm which utilises the potential evapotranspiration crop coefficient factor and the upper and lower zone soil moisture states in a two bucket model 3 2 calibration methods both models are traditionally calibrated using manual parameter adjustments to obtain good representations of the available observed data coupled with relatively subjective parameter transfer approaches to un gauged areas based on sub basin physical and climate similarity this can be an effective approach when there are observed data available at several points headwater and downstream in the modelling system the assessment of alternative parameter sets is guided by visual comparison of time series flow duration curves fdcs and seasonal distributions and backed up within the spatsim system with the calculation of several objective functions these include the bias in mean monthly simulated volume and the nash coefficient of efficiency ce using both untransformed and natural log transformed flows the weap model simulations can be exported and imported into spatsim to calculate the same objective function values while automatic calibration approaches are often favoured they are not always very successful in regions where there are potential problems with the rainfall forcing data and when the models being calibrated contain a relatively high level of equifinality which both models do part of the problem is that the automatic calibrations can generate spurious parameter sets as they try to fit the model to parts of the time series where the rainfall data might be inadequate if these can be identified a manual calibration process can ignore these periods however the iwr version of the pitman model also includes an option to use a simple random parameter sampling scheme using a uniform distribution using plausible ranges of some or all parameters to generate ensemble outputs these outputs can be used to more rapidly explore the model domain for groups of parameter values that generate the best results compared with all or parts of the observed data time series they can also be used to identify different parameter combinations that produce broadly similar results equifinality for example in some situations the two surface runoff functions of the pitman model table 2 may produce equally acceptable results while the low flow regime may be equally well simulated with either interflow or ground water outflow as the dominant process without further site specific information about real processes it may not be possible to resolve such equifinalities but it is useful to know that they exist this version of the model has been previously applied in several areas of the basin hughes 2013 hughes and mazibuko 2018 and the results were very useful in guiding the manual calibration process several additional runs were made during the current calibration study to further explore the parameter space for parameter sets that yield satisfactory model performance while a similar facility is not available for the weap model the pitman model results can still be useful to guide the manual calibration of the weap parameters split sampling verification has not been used in this study partly because some of the observed records are quite short meaning that the samples used would be even shorter a further reason is the rainfall inputs are known to be uncertain based on previous experiences of using these data in the region hughes et al 2011a but we do not know which parts of the record might be more uncertain than others and this could bias a split sample testing approach the key component of validation in this study is therefore that good calibration results for upstream sub basins should also result in good calibration results for downstream sub basins hughes et al 2006 the main objectives of the study are not to scientifically prove that the models are applicable this has been done before in this region with both models but to determine where and where not acceptable simulations can be achieved that are useful for future assessments of water resources availability and management this includes identifying the key uncertainties in both the models and the available data and the spatial variability of such uncertainties so that these can be targeted in future studies or data collection programmes 4 calibration results table 2 presents the data periods used for comparison and the four objective function statistics that are used to summarise the model performance for the two models and for all the sub basins with useful observed data the following paragraphs discuss the model performance and key uncertainty issues for each of the major sub systems of the zambezi river basin fig 1a some qualitative assessments of the model results in different parts of the basin are included in the text using words such as reasonable quite poor very bad etc these evaluations are based on several criteria that include the four main objective functions applied to the time series data but also include assessments of the correspondence of the simulated fdc and seasonal distributions to the observed data reasonable or better could be defined as nash sutcliffe efficiency values above 0 5 and bias values of less than 10 coupled with similar fdcs and seasonal distributions to the observed 4 1 luangwa river a key geomorphological feature of the western parts of the luangwa river basin is the presence of dambos which are relatively small but frequent valley bottom wetlands that have the potential to generate saturated surface runoff during the early part of the wet season hughes and mazibuko 2018 the other key feature is the luangwa river floodplain although recent work suggests that the downstream impacts attenuation and delay are quite minimal at the monthly time scale makungu 2019 and no wetland effects were included in the weap model while both models produce acceptable results at lng5 the slightly better results for the pitman model might reflect the inclusion of the wetland sub model the main difference between the results at the downstream gauge lng7 is that the weap model tends to predict a wet season that peaks approximately one month too soon 4 2 kafue river the kafue river is well gauged but it is also quite complex with two major wetlands the lukanga swamps kaf5 mwelwa 2004 and the kafue flats kaf9 the itezhi tezhi dam kaf8 located upstream of the kafue flats is used for controlled releases to the kafue gorge hydro power dam kaf10 the pattern of controlled releases used within the models was based on some observed data for part of the modelling period there are known to be some abstractions along most of the length of the main channel but these are poorly quantified the results for the pitman model down to the gauge at hook bridge kaf7 are encouraging and reasonable results were obtained below kafue gorge dam kaf10 despite the complications of trying to capture the release patterns from the two reservoirs as well as the effects of the kafue flats wetland the weap results for some of the upstream sub basins are relatively poor and the main differences between the two models are that the wet season peaks too soon in the weap simulations while the weap fdcs are sometimes better than the pitman model 4 3 upper zambezi and chobe river this sub system is arguably the most complex of the western half of the zambezi river basin partly because of the kalahari sands in the extreme western parts several major wetlands including the barotse floodplain and partly because of some confusing signals from some of the available observed data the observed records suggest that the main eastern tributary kabompo river at bar3 has a quite steep fdc which is further reflected in the data downstream below ngonye falls bar5 and bar6 however the observed records for the other main gauged tributary bar7 suggest very high baseflow contributions that are incompatible with the flow records further downstream below ngonye falls bar6 and at victoria falls zam1 these gauging data therefore need to be further examined in the future to try and correctly resolve this source of uncertainty table 2 suggests that the simulations for both models are less successful than in the previous two systems but that the results remain reasonably satisfactory given the uncertainties associated with the data and the effects of the barotse floodplain the relatively poorer results for the weap model below ngonye falls bar6 and further downstream fig 2 are partly related to the difficulties of representing non linearities in the channel wetland exchange processes compared to the pitman model neither of the models were able to adequately simulate the patterns of observed flows for the chobe sub system which is relatively flat and underlain by kalahari sands while including wetlands in the pitman model helped to a certain extent the ce values remained below zero however the overall contribution of the chobe river to the zambezi river is very small both of the main zambezi river gauges zam1 and 2 above kariba dam have quite long records with few missing data and are generally consistent with each other however the peak season recorded flows at zam2 occur on average 1 month before those at zam1 fig 2a which clearly points to some data problems the problem seems to lie mostly with the gauge at victoria falls zam1 as the other two gauges bar6 and zam2 have similar seasonal distributions fig 2a the focus of the calibration effort was therefore on bar6 and zam2 at the expense of zam1 4 4 central basin tributaries most of the central basin tributaries drain the semi arid areas of zimbabwe and have either seasonal or ephemeral flow regimes with quite substantial periods of zero flow however the length of zero flow periods in the gauged record compared to natural conditions could be affected by upstream abstractions longer or reservoir releases and return flows shorter these types of catchments are difficult to simulate with coarse spatial and temporal scale models as they are generally not able to fully capture the high degree of variability in both rainfall and runoff response the main focus of the calibration exercise was therefore to simulate the fdc characteristics as well as possible the gwayi river sub system is gauged at four points but the downstream gauge has a short record 1996 to 2014 supplementary table and a very high proportion of missing data the results for the two main headwater sub areas are quite poor while the simulations improve somewhat at the mamatavi gauge downstream gwa2 table 2 and fig 3 a the main parts of the catchment are highly cultivated but there is no evidence of any large dams or extensive irrigation the senyati river map2 3 and 4 manyame river man2 and 3 and mazoe river maz1 and 2 sub systems are quite heavily utilised for agriculture supported by both large reservoirs and many smaller farm dams however the storage and demand information is highly uncertain and the water use could be highly non stationary table 2 and fig 3b map2 umfuli river indicate that the results are similar to site on the gwayi gwa2 with quite poor statistics despite reproducing the upper ends of the observed fdcs very well the downstream mazoe data at luenha maz1 are inconsistent with the upstream data and were not used in the calibration the final tributary in this sub region is the capoche river cap1 joining the zambezi river immediately downstream of cahora bassa dam unfortunately the gauging records are too uncertain to be useful for model calibration in some sub basins the models do not simulate the low flows and periods of zero flow very well to achieve zero flows for the weap model it was necessary to use a conditional expression with a storage threshold to limit interflow and groundwater outflow to replace the fixed conductivity parameter values in the pitman model groundwater outflow can be limited by using the riparian strip evapotranspiration loss parameter part of the difficulty with simulating the low flow regimes of these rivers is also likely to be due to non stationary water uses as well as the possibility of artificial downstream releases from the larger reservoirs e g within map3 map4 and man3 4 5 lake malawi nyasa sub system there are six gauged tributaries flowing into lake malawi nyasa while data for two additional gauges ruk3 and lil1 have been rejected due to excessive runoff coefficients 66 and 69 respectively compared to other catchments in the same area 20 comparisons of the cru rainfall data with an alternative data set from the university of delaware unidel willmott and matsuura 2001 reveals that the unidel data are 18 and 69 higher than the cru data for ruh2 and ruk3 respectively suggesting that the cru data are not suitable for some parts of the lake malawi sub system there are also some inconsistencies within some of the gauged records such that some periods were rejected for calibration purposes the results for the downstream gauge on the ruhuru river ruh1 the songwe ruk1 the south rukuru ruk2 and the bua nam1 rivers are considered acceptable table 2 further evidenced by good reproductions of the observed fdcs and seasonal distributions overall the pitman model performed better than the weap model in these sub basins table 2 for the pitman model the wetland sub model was used to try and simulate the dynamics of lake malawi and to calibrate the outflows against the observed flows at the outlet mal1 in the weap model the lake impacts are simulated using a reservoir with bypass flows however the calibration of both models is severely affected by the uncertainties in the quality of the data at mal1 there are five gauges on the shire river downstream of the lake but they are highly inconsistent with each other not only in terms of the variability of monthly flow volumes but also in terms of the seasonality for example the observed flows for mal1 peak in august for mal3 and mal4 in may and for shr1 and shr3 in march the simulated outflows peak in april may as much as 3 months earlier than the observed outflows not surprisingly the nash coefficients are very poor 0 35 despite the volume bias statistics being relatively low 5 the results further downstream along the shire river are even worse with very low or negative nash coefficients partly related to the lack of reliable observed flow data signals inadequate simulations upstream and the wetland dynamics in parts of the shire river these results clearly point towards the need for much more information about the hydrological dynamics of this part of the zambezi river basin however the simulated lake volumes compare quite favourably to some observed water level data 1973 2017 at mbamba bay in tanzania fig 4 with a regression coefficient of about 0 66 despite a period with poor correlations between 2002 and 2012 for 1973 2001 the regression coefficient increases to 0 92 the observed and simulated water level seasonal distributions are also close both peaking in april may 4 6 main zambezi river including kariba and cahora bassa dams the operation of the two dams has not been very consistent over the period of historical records and they were simulated using the available information on controlled releases and spills gandolfi and salewicz 1990 indicate that kariba dam is partly operated for flood control and that managed releases are made early in some wet seasons to prevent the reservoir from spilling the downstream observed record was used to try and establish a pattern of flood releases dependent upon reservoir storage volume that improved the simulations although there are some gauge data at zam3a just above the confluence with the kafue river the available data appear to be highly suspect gauge data exist at tete zam6 and zam9 below the shire river confluence but the latter is of little value for calibration due to the dominant influence of the poorly simulated shire river sub system the statistical comparisons of kariba zam3 outflow volume are relatively poor but improve downstream at tete table 2 and fig 5 the statistics given in table 2 are based mostly on the longer post dam period fig 5b and are inevitably affected by the uncertainties in the flood control operations of both dams in general terms both models produce quite similar results at tete zam6 with the pitman model being slightly better in terms of fdc and seasonal distribution patterns 5 model validity with respect to simulated hydrological processes a key issue associated with the scientific and practical value of hydrological model results is whether an acceptable calibration has been achieved for the right reason kirchner 2006 if not the model may not be sensitive to at least some future changes in either climate or land use however it is impossible to validate a model in terms of the relative contributions of the components of evaporative losses and runoff generation because we do not and probably never will know what these are at the coarse scale of the sub basins used for the zambezi river basin the alternative is to suggest that if we get results that satisfy a wide variety of fitting criteria then we can assume that we are acceptably close in simulating the results for the right reason these criteria include not only the overall fit statistics based on the time series of monthly flow table 2 but also the shapes of the seasonal distributions and flow duration curves similarly getting appropriate fdc shapes for semi arid catchments including the length of time of zero flows cannot really be achieved without getting the right balance at the catchment scale between surface runoff dominant and intermittent interflow or groundwater inputs to the channel fig 6 shows the total runoff partitioning into surface runoff interflow and groundwater outflow to the channel for selected sub basins using the pitman model results the weap model results are very similar as the parameterisation was guided by the parameter sets used for the pitman model in general terms the partitioning shown is consistent with what we expect in the different parts of the zambezi as well as with previously reported results for similar areas winsemius et al 2006 hughes and mazibuko 2018 kaf4 on the lunga river is quite typical of many of the sub basins of the kafue and luangwa river systems where there is an almost equal split between the three runoff components and the surface runoff is dominated by saturation excess runoff due to the presence of dambos the two major western tributaries of the luangwa river lng8 and lng10 required high saturation excess surface runoff to get the correct seasonal distribution at the downstream gauge lng7 ruh1 represents typical partitioning in the gauged tributaries of lake malawi and is quite similar to the sub humid sub basins of the kafue the results for the luanginga river at bar4 are not very good table 2 but fig 6 illustrates the partitioning that might be expected for some of the areas in the west of the upper zambezi underlain by kalahari sands resulting in a low proportion of surface runoff and either high interflow or groundwater contributions it is quite difficult to resolve whether interflow or groundwater should dominate without more information about the real processes map2 represents a typical partitioning for the semi arid sub basins where the dominant runoff process is assumed to be infiltration excess surface runoff with some intermittent groundwater contributions during more prolonged wet periods 6 discussion and conclusions for a large part of the zambezi river basin the pitman model results and to a somewhat lesser degree the weap model results are considered to be acceptable and fit for purpose given the large number of uncertainties involved in this study table 2 and fig 7 the main focus of this discussion is to summarise these uncertainties and attempt to identify those that might potentially be reduced given realistic expectations about the availability of additional data and or further efforts to improve the model calibrations it is immediately apparent from table 2 and fig 7 that the pitman model has produced better results overall than the weap model part of this conclusion is related to the greater experience of the authors in the application of the pitman model within the southern africa region given that both models were largely calibrated using subjective manual adjustment of the parameter values whether a more experienced weap model user could achieve appreciably better results possibly using the expression builder to modify the default model structure is a moot point however the tools available within spatsim to facilitate the calibration of the pitman play a major role in achieving improved calibration this includes the parameter exploration version of the model that allows ensemble outputs to be generated based on sampling from a priori parameter bounds one of the recommendations of this study is that improved calibration tools could be added to the weap model interface following one of the review suggestions it would also be useful to add the popular kling gupta efficiency criteria gupta et al 2009 to the standard objective functions calculated within the spatsim interface for the pitman model this paper has not presented any uncertainty analyses of the model results partly because the objective was to cover the whole basin and space does not permit a lengthy discussion about uncertainty analysis and partly because uncertainty analyses have not been completed for all the sub basins however it would be a relatively straightforward task to implement a full uncertainty analysis using the pitman model now that we have some initial calibrations and a reasonably acceptable understanding of the runoff characteristics of all the sub basins based on validations using downstream gauging stations the major uncertainties from a practical water resources perspective across most of the basin lie in the projections of future water availability the subject of the follow on to this paper hughes and farinosi 2020 if water resources management decisions need to be taken in the largely ungauged parts of the basin then it will be beneficial in the future to implement a more thorough uncertainty analysis of the historical flow simulations a number of decisions were taken about the quality of the observed data and whether to reject some records and keep others these decisions were largely subjective as we did not have access to the raw data stage records and stage discharge relationships while some of the decisions are considered to be quite robust for example those based on excessive runoff coefficients others need to be further checked to ensure that both useful data have not been unnecessarily rejected and that poor data have not been used for calibration a key recommendation is that a dedicated assessment of all the observed stream flow and reservoir storage data should be initiated this assessment will clearly require the cooperation of the national hydrometric agencies of all the riparian countries but the benefits should be self evident the outcomes will help to remove some of the uncertainties in the model setups as well as provide possible guidelines for future hydrometric observation activities within the basin as a whole the input climate data and specifically the use of the cru rainfall data represent a large source of uncertainty in the model setups and results this appears to be particularly true in the northern parts of the lake malawi sub system as well as over the angolan parts of the basin previous experience with the cru data in the okavango river basin hughes et al 2011b hughes and gray 2017 suggest that the rainfall data inputs to the western parts of the basin in angola and parts of zambia are particularly problematic especially over the last few decades due to a reduction in the number of real rainfall observations fig 8 also illustrates the same problem using the weap data for kafue hook kaf7 where the earlier simulations pre 1990 are better than the later ones post 1990 particularly with respect to the simulations of the main wet season flows a result that is partially attributed to the decreased representativeness of the rainfall data however some limited attempts to use alternative rainfall data that combine different sources of information not relying solely on gauge data did not improve the calibrations and some of these data sets only start in the late 1970 s or later which means that some of the earlier stream flow data table 2 could not be used in the calibration while a comprehensive evaluation of many different data sets beck et al 2017 could be useful it would also be very time consuming given that the models would almost certainly require re calibration for each rainfall data set however from the perspective of simulating future water resources regimes under a changing climate it is essential that the main driver i e rainfall is estimated as well as possible an evaluation of different estimation approaches given the likelihood that the ground based observation network is unlikely to improve could therefore be critical for understanding future flow regimes and therefore water resources availability understanding of the dynamics of water exchange between the rivers and the many wetlands in the system represents a further major source of uncertainty in several parts of the basin the lack of detailed information about the existing water uses groundwater direct channel abstractions storage and demand patterns operating rules of hydro power dams etc in different parts of the basin also impacts on the quality of the simulations while some information is available e g world bank 2010 it is recommended that a database of water uses should be established as a matter of some priority some of these data might need to be inferred from secondary information such as land use patterns but a great deal of the key data might be available from water use licensing information held by the relevant national water resources management authorities access to this information would therefore require a great deal of cooperation between the relevant authorities of the riparian countries and an appropriate study team one of the key items of information that is required for running scenario analyses hughes and farinosi 2020 is realistic operating rules hydro power releases and flood control releases for the major dams in the system while reducing some of the uncertainties referred to above will be beneficial the overall conclusion is that the models have been established with sufficient confidence to suggest that they can be used for assessing future scenarios of both water use and management as well as climate change software and data availability the weap model and documentation is available from https www weap21 org the pitman model is

8311,study region eight main river basins covering the major part of ukraine study focus the main aim of this study was to provide an assessment of climate change impacts on water availability across ukraine using global hydrological models six global hydrological models were evaluated for their performance in the historical period in the basins under study future river discharge was simulated by using the best performing model and all available models driven by bias corrected gcm projections from the isimip project under the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the results show precipitation increase up to 10 under rcp 2 6 and variable changes from 14 to 10 under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century the projections show the decreasing mean annual river discharge in the majority of basins for the middle 2040 2070 and far future 2071 2100 periods under both rcps and the decrease is stronger under rcp 8 5 the seasonal changes are characterised by a decrease in summer and a small to moderate increase in winter months in most of the basins the highest reduction of mean annual discharge was projected for the pripyat southern bug and dniester basins reaching up to 30 to the end of the century under rcp 8 5 keywords ukraine climate change river discharge global hydrological models dnieper dniester siverskyi donets southern bug 1 introduction during the last decades an alteration of climate in europe has been observed and it is expected that changes will be stronger in the future kovats et al 2014 global warming would lead to changes in the water cycle which are likely to affect water availability at different scales and sectors e g energy agriculture forest and more that kind of changes can bring society to the state where climate change is a prime political issue donnelly et al 2017 ipcc 2018 schleussner et al 2016 however even with a strong support of the scientific community on climate change and climate impact issues in europe the uncertainties in projected hydrological impacts for future are large many studies show large spreads in projections provoking a discussion about the robustness of the simulated signals of change and impact results frieler et al 2017 haddeland et al 2014 hattermann et al 2018 2017 focusing on the european studies which also cover ukraine and the 1 5 c and 2 0 c increments the study of jacob et al 2018 displays possible changes in temperature and precipitation across europe based on different gcms rcms driven by rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios changes in total precipitation within ukraine show an increase from 5 to 15 under 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming scenarios the results of vliet et al 2015 based on the bias corrected gcms from cmip5 showed that changes in precipitation would vary from 5 to 5 for the major part of ukraine in the 2050s under rcp 2 6 precipitation would increase in the 2080s in the range from 5 to 20 under rcp 2 6 except for crimean peninsula where changes would be from 5 to 5 under rcp 8 5 precipitation changes would stay in the same ranges as under rcp 2 6 for the 2050s but for the 2080s a decrease up to 20 is projected for the southern and western parts of ukraine the climate change impacts on water resources in europe are presented in studies that used continental and global scale hydrological models donnelly et al 2017 mentaschi et al 2019 van vliet et al 2015 two of them considered ukrainian territory only partly and only the last one covered the whole country also there is a study focused on evaluation of performance of an ensemble of global hydrological models in 57 large river basins worldwide with their further application for climate impact assessment with weighting coefficients krysanova et al 2020 where small parts of ukraine were covered in the study of van vliet et al 2015 the authors assessed changes in river discharge simulated by the vic and e hype models driven by the bias corrected gcms the results for rcp 8 5 show predominantly decreasing change signal varying from 5 to 40 for the 2050s in the major part of ukraine besides there is a number of regional scale studies based on catchment scale hydrological models fischer et al 2014 hesse et al 2015 didovets et al 2017 piniewski et al 2018 didovets et al 2019 and statistical models and tools loboda and bozhok 2016 snizhko et al 2014 they all focus on specific catchments or parts of the country and not consider changes in water resources at the national level the similar decreasing trends as in van vilet et al 2015 have been found also in the regional scale studies by loboda and kozlov 2020 and snizhko et al 2014 the results of study by snizhko et al 2014 which considered 19 river basins across ukraine showed mostly no changes in runoff except a small increase until 2040 but a moderate decrease was projected in the central and southern parts of the country at the end of the century as we see there is practically only one study by van vilet et al 2015 dedicated to studying climate change impacts on water availability in ukraine based on hydrological models and covering the whole country therefore there is a strong need in updating climate impact assessment at the country scale in order to improve understanding of expected changes and adaptation options at the national level the main goal of this study is to assess the impact of climate change on water availability for the main ukrainian river basins by using global hydrological models ghms driven by up to date climate projections under the low end rcp 2 6 and high end rcp 8 5 pathways besides this study also aims to investigate the suitability of the ghms for simulation of climate change impacts in the study area based on their performance in the historical period the intention is to apply only well performing models for the assessment of climate change impacts the structure of the paper is the following i main information about the ukrainian case study river basins ii overview of methods iii evaluation of ghms and their suitability for simulation of impacts iv analysis of expected changes in precipitation and temperature based on gcms v projections of river discharge across study areas using selected tools and vi discussion of the main outcomes 2 study area ukraine is characterised by notable climate differences across the country the major part of the country is situated within the temperate climate zone and only the southern coast of crimea has a subtropical mediterranean climate the average temperature of the coldest month january has negative values on the major part of the territory 2 c 7 5 c except the southern part of the crimean peninsula the average temperature in july varies from 17 5 c to 22 c fao 2015 air humidity is much higher in the western part of the country in comparison to the eastern part also differences in temperature regime in the east west direction are prominent and the vegetation period is longer in the western part due to the softer and wetter climate regular alteration of the atlantic circulation and dry air from the east provoke cyclone and anticyclone movements on the plain part of the country in winter temperate warm air masses are replaced by cold air coming from the north syberia in summer warm air is changed by atlantic wet and temperate warm masses anticyclones that dominate in the southern and central parts of the country usually come from central asia cyclones which are more intensive in the western part come from the atlantic ocean and mediterranean sea zastavniy 1994 precipitation is characterised by high values in the carpathian mountainous region up to 1600 mm a 1 and crimea up to 1150 mm a 1 the mean annual precipitation in other parts of the country varies from 700 750 mm in the north west to 300 350 mm in the south east which can be explained by the dominance of cyclones and anticyclones national communication of ukraine on climate change 2013 zastavniy 1994 in this study we focus on the main river basins of ukraine dnieper and catchments of its two main tributaries desna pripyat siverskyi donets sothern bug dniester tisza a tributary of the danube river and western bug bug the selection of the river basins and their gauging stations was based on the following criteria i the drainage area should be larger than 30 000 km2 and ii observed discharge time series should be available for longer than 10 years majority of considered rivers are transboundary so some parts of other countries were also included in the modelling the modelled areas of the river basins are shown in fig 1 and the main characteristics of the basins are presented in table 1 the drainage areas of the basins vary from 39 000 km2 to 482 000 km2 and observed discharge time series are available for 14 32 years the dnieper river is the 4th longest river in europe it originates in russia and flows through belarus and ukraine to the black sea it is a lowland river its drainage basin covers about 65 of ukraine and divides the country from north to south into the left and right banks parts the major tributaries are the desna left and the pripyat right the dnieper is characterised by high water regulation in terms of a cascade of reservoirs and dams constructed in the twentieth century aquastat fao s information system on water and agriculture 2020 the dniester river is the second largest river in ukraine and its basin covers about 12 of the country area the river originates in ukraine then flows to moldova and returns to ukraine 50 km before entering the black sea further to the northwest the western bug river is flowing it is a tributary of the narew river which belongs to the vistula river basin and it begins in ukraine and flows to poland the danube river originates in germany and flows southeast until entering the black sea on the border between romania and ukraine the prut and tisza originating in the carpathian mountains are the largest tributaries of the danube located partly in ukraine water report 15 fao 2020 the southern bug is an internal river basin of ukraine it originates on the northwest of the country and flows to the southeast the siverskyi donets river is the left tributary of the done river and large part of its basin is situated in the eastern part of the country the river length is 1 053 km from which around 455 km lie within ukraine and the rest in russia mаринич 1993 3 methods for assessment of climate change impacts on water resources of the main ukrainian river basins our study was conducted in three steps a evaluation of performance of the global hydrological models and selection of the most representative ones with better performance for the study area b analysis of climate projections and projected changes in temperature and precipitation for ukraine c analysis of changes in the river discharge in eight ukrainian river basins until the end of the century under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 3 1 climate projections to analyse changes in mean temperature and precipitation until the end of the century four climate projections were taken from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip 2020 phase 2b they are from hadgem2 es miroc5 ipsl cm5a lr and gfdl esm2m models frieler et al 2017 the climate data have been bias corrected to the reanalysis climate dataset ewembi lange 2018 2019 the spatial resolution of the data is 0 5 0 5 and time series can be divided into two parts historical simulations 1861 2005 and projections considering greenhouse gas emissions covering the period 2006 2099 two rcp scenarios were selected for this study rcp 2 6 in line with the paris agreement assuming a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and returning to 2 6 w m2 by 2100 and rcp 8 5 the worst case scenario that does not include any specific climate mitigation goals riahi et al 2011 so in total there were eight climate scenarios considered including four gcms driven by two rcps in order to analyse changes in precipitation and temperature until the end of the century we considered the historical 1971 2000 and two future periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 temperature precipitation and river discharge in both future periods under both rcps were compared with those in the historical one 3 2 global hydrological models and climate data simulations of six global hydrological models were performed previously and uploaded at the isimip server and then downloaded for our case study area evaluated and applied for the assessment of changes in river discharge under climate change the ensemble of models includes lpjml rost et al 2008 matsiro pokhrel et al 2015 h08 hanasaki et al 2008 watergap2 müller schmied et al 2016 dbh tang et al 2007 and pcr globwb wada et al 2014 all models simulate evapotranspiration snow cover surface flow subsurface flow river discharge etc see details in hattermann et al 2017 but only one of them the watergap2 model was calibrated using discharge data from the grdc database müller schmied 2017 müller schmied et al 2014 more detailed information about the models characteristics and components can be found in the references above and in krysanova et al 2020 climate reanalysis data watch weedon et al 2010 were used as a forcing for the model evaluation in historical period further the models were driven by gcm projections listed above for the historical period 1861 2005 and future period 2006 2099 the spatial resolution of the model outputs is 0 5 0 5 human water management influence was considered in all simulations the histsoc historically varying land use and other human influences and the 2005soc fixed at the 2005 year land use and other human influences simulations driven by gcms were chosen for the historical and future periods respectively frieler et al 2017 as stated above watch and ewembi were used as forcing in the historical period for model evaluation and for bias correction of gcms correspondingly to confirm the ability of both watch and ewembi data to reproduce climate in the case study areas and to assess possible uncertainty in the modelling the both reanalysis datasets were additionally analysed in comparison to observations to cover the whole case study region it was decided to choose one climate station per river basin fig 1 with a time span of at least 10 years of daily data the stationary observations were taken from the european assessment datasets e obs www ecad eu the analysis was focused on one of the major components precipitation our results show a high correlation between both reanalysis data and observed precipitation data and low deviations in the long term mean annual precipitation see annex 1 and fig 2 the average r2 and r values for all stations for the annual precipitation are r2 0 83 r 0 91 ewembi e obs and r2 0 81 r 0 90 watch e obs the deviations in the long term mean annual precipitation vary from 1 8 to 4 2 on average over the case study areas and can reach up to 30 36 in some months in some basins 3 3 the global water availability and water use model watergap2 and datasets used for the ukraine as watergap2 was found to be the best performing model for the case study area and the impact assessment was performed mainly with this model sect 4 3 it is briefly described here watergap2 is a global water availability and water use model that is in development since 1996 watergap includes of five water use models irrigation domestic manufacturing livestock cooling of thermal power plants the linking module gwswuse that calculates based on the output of the water use models net water abstractions from groundwater and surface water resources furthermore the watergap global hydrology model calculates the water fluxes and storages for all continents except antarctica at 0 5 0 5 spatial and daily temporal resolution considering the water uses and other processes as such as alterations due to man made dams and reservoirs the main objectives of watergap development is to assess water resources for human and environment and its impact due to anthropogenic alterations as such as water use man made reservoirs and climate change model descriptions can be found in alcamo et al 2003 muller schmied et al 2014 2016 2017 the model versions being used here are watergap 2 2 isimip2a for the evaluation within isimip2a and watergap 2 2c for the impact assessment within isimip2b one particular feature of watergap is its basin specific calibration with the objective to reproduce long term annual observed river discharge at 1319 basins covering 54 of the global drainage area except for antarctica and greenland by modifying one to three model parameters details in hunger and döll 2008 muller schmied 2017 the majority of discharge stations used for evaluation in this study table 1 has been used as well for calibration but for different time spans according to the data availability dnieper 1959 1988 prypyat 1973 2002 desna 1956 1985 dnister 1965 1984 southern bug 1965 1984 western bug 1957 1986 please note that for evaluation other than for calibration on the long term annual mean monthly time series have been used hence the evaluation can be seen as somehow independent the reservoirs along the dniepr are included in watergap and handled for electricity purposes for details to the reservoir scheme the reader is referred to döll et al 2009 3 4 evaluation of the global hydrological models it was decided to use the model evaluation approach from krysanova et al 2020 to analyse the reliability of the global hydrological models for ukrainian basins comparing the simulations for the historical period driven by watch climate forcing data see more in muller schmied et al 2016 weedon et al 2010 with the observed river discharge for each basin the monthly observed river discharge was taken from the grdc database the selected gauges for each basin together with the time periods for model evaluation are presented in table 1 the calculation of metrics was not possible for the siverskyi donets basin due to absence of the observation data some of the basins are highly regulated by dams and reservoirs e g dnieper and this can affect the evaluation results though hydrological models considered reservoirs which are included in different databases as such as global reservoirs and dams database lehner et al 2011 following the modelling protocol isimip the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project 2019 wwf 2020 for model evaluation the next metrics were used nash

satisfactory to weak performance and the score is 0 for the poor performance based on the total scores for each model and basin the well performing models could be selected for the case study area based on their performance in the historical period after model evaluation and selection the changes in mean annual and long term mean seasonal river discharge for future periods in comparison with the reference period driven by four bias corrected gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 were analysed the same time periods were used as for the climate projections analysis the reference period 1971 2000 and two future periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 4 results 4 1 model evaluation the resulting metrics of model evaluation for the monthly and seasonal dynamics in all basins are presented in annex 2 in supplementary and the sums of assigned scores are shown in table 2 as one can see the highest sum of scores among all models has the watergap2 model with 16 of maximum 28 four metrics in seven basins and matsiro and pcr globwb show rather weak performance with 8 and 7 5 correspondingly and the other three models h08 lpjml and dbh demonstrated quite poor performance according to our assessment the comparison of the observed and simulated long term mean monthly discharge in all seven basins simulated by six ghms in the historical period are presented in annex 3 only one model the watergap2 got more than a half of possible scores and other models showed weak or poor results moreover the dbh and pcr globwb models have no simulation runs for some gcms rcps and it is not possible to use them for the climate impact assessment the differences in the model evaluation results can be explained by calibration of the watergap2 model to the long term mean annual streamflow observations for the historical period based on the evaluation results it was decided to use mainly the watergap2 model for further assessment of climate change impacts in all eight river basins to compare results ensemble mean approach including all ghms was also used for all basins under considerations similarly good performance of the watergap2 model and weak or poor performance of other ghms for 40 57 large river basins worldwide was shown in the studies of krysanova et al 2020 and zaherpour et al 2018 4 2 analysis of climate scenarios fig 3 presents projected changes in mean annual temperature based averaged over four bias corrected gcms until the end of the century under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the changes show an increase in both time periods under both rcps across the whole study area rising from the south to the northeast of the study domain under rcp 2 6 the increase varies from 2 1 c on the south of ukraine crimea to 2 8 c on the north of the study area russia for both time periods the temperature is projected to rise up to 2 4 c within southern and southeastern parts of ukraine up to 2 5 2 6 c in the centre north of ukraine and east of belarus and up to 2 7 2 8 c in western belarus and russia under rcp 8 5 the differences in temperature increase between two time periods are much more notable in the period 2041 2070 temperature is projected to rise from 3 1 c to 4 5 c in the study region in ukraine up to 4 2 c in belarus up to 4 4 c and in russia within the study area up to 4 5 c in the period 2071 2100 changes are higher and vary from 4 8 c to 6 6 c in ukraine up to 6 c in belarus up to 6 3 c and in russia within the study area up to 6 6 c it is noteworthy that there is a tendency of temperature increase under rcp 8 5 in the northeastern direction starting from the central part of ukraine the simulated future changes in precipitation are not so pronounced in comparison to changes in temperature precipitation under rcp 2 6 shows small to moderate up to 10 increase across the whole study area for both future periods fig 4 changes under rcp 8 5 vary from a small decrease to a moderate increase 5 to 10 in the period 2041 2070 at the end of the century 2071 2100 annual precipitation is projected to decrease up to 12 14 in the southern and western parts of ukraine especially in crimea carpathians and odeska oblast and to increase up to 15 in belarus and russia 4 3 changes in river discharge the projections of climate change impacts on water availability have similar patterns across basins under study as precipitation figs 5 and 6 resent simulated changes in the mean annual and long term mean monthly river discharge in the eight river basins for two future periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 as simulated by the watergap2 model driven by four bias corrected gcms from isimip2b changes in the mean annual river discharge under rcp 2 6 for two future periods are small to moderate and vary from 10 to 6 in five basins tisza southern bug siverskyi donets desna western bug in the other three basins dnieper dniester and pripyat river discharge decreases up to 20 on average in both future periods changes under rcp 8 5 are generally much stronger in comparison to rcp 2 6 in the majority of basins river discharge strongly decreases to the end of the century the highest decreases are projected for the pripyat southern bug and dniester and can reach up to 30 to the end of the century on the other hand projections for the siverskyi donets and desna basins show very small positive changes or zero changes in general the results show decreasing trends in river discharge in the majority of the basins for the middle century 2040 2070 and far future 2070 2100 periods under both rcps which are more significant under rcp 8 5 the projections of the long term mean monthly river discharge show a general decrease during practically the whole year in the dnieper western bug dniester and pripyat rivers basins in both future periods under both rcps except small increases in february or february march in some cases fig 6 a notable tendency of increasing discharge during winter months have the desna tisza southern bug and siverskyi donets in both time periods under both rcps all projections show a general decrease during summer months in all catchments in both periods and for both rcps except the siverskyi donets basin where an increase in summer months is projected in most cases both decreases and increases are stronger under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 2 6 the far future period under rcp 8 5 is characterised by more significant changes compared to the mid century the river discharge in the western bug basin is projected to decrease in all months except february reaching up to 28 under rcp 2 6 and up to 30 under rcp 8 5 the strongest decrease occurs in the fall months under both rcps the minor increase in february can be a sign of shift in the peak of river discharge similar but a bit stronger patterns of expected changes were obtained for the pripyat river with a general decrease during the year up to 29 under rcp 2 6 and up to 43 under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century except an increase in february in both cases when discharge is projected to rise up to 10 under rcp 2 6 and up to 14 under rcp 8 5 the river discharge in the desna basin is projected to increase from january to march in both periods under both rcps up to 28 under rcp 2 6 and up to 42 under rcp 8 5 during the rest of the months river discharge is projected to decrease from 3 to 16 the projections for the tisza basin show an increase in winter for both future periods from 4 to 42 under rcp 2 6 and from 9 to 42 under rcp 8 5 in june river discharge increases slightly by 5 and in the rest months it decreases from 4 to 17 in both periods under rcp 2 6 the changes under the rcp 8 5 show a decrease from april to november ranging from 7 to 21 in the mid century and from 17 to 35 in the far future in the dniester basin river discharge is projected to decrease during all months in both time periods under both rcps except for february in 2070 2100 under rcp 2 6 zero changes the changes vary from 2 to 20 under rcp 2 6 and from 5 to 35 under rcp 8 5 the river discharge shows a stronger decrease at the end of the century under rcp 8 5 the river discharge in the southern bug is projected to increase in january and february in both periods up to 35 under rcp 2 6 and up to 30 under rcp 8 5 during the rest of the year river discharge declines from 3 to 26 under rcp 2 6 and from 13 to 45 under rcp 8 5 except a slight increase in one summer month under rcp 2 6 it s notable that changes become higher at the end of the century under rcp 8 5 the simulated changes in the dnieper basin are homogeneous for both periods and rcps with a moderate decline of river discharge up to 18 under rcp 2 6 and up to 24 under rcp 8 5 an exception is a period from january to march with a small increase up to 7 in 2070 2100 under rcp 2 6 the highest positive changes among all catchments are projected for the siverskyi donets basin in january march river discharge shows an increase up to 69 under rcp 2 6 and up to 100 under rcp 8 5 and the highest increase always occurs in february in july august river discharge shows an increase up to 22 under rcp 2 6 and up to 10 under rcp 8 5 and in the rest months it is projected to decrease up to 28 under both rcps annex 6 presents the long term mean river discharge for two future periods simulated by the ensemble of four models under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the results show a general decrease during the year with some increase in winter months for the majority of basins under study the general pattern of changes falls in line of conclusions based on the watergap2 but increases during winter are lower and the uncertainty of projected discharge is notably higher 5 discussion the analysis of model performance showed that the watergap2 model had the best results and other models had weak or poor performance where the monthly pbias could reach more than 300 and nse for the long term monthly discharge up to 100 the averaged metrics over seven basins under study show the best monthly nse and seasonal nse for the watergap2 0 4 and 0 2 and the best monthly pbias and δσ for the pcr globwb 3 2 and 19 8 accordingly annex 7 the good results for the watergap2 can be partly explained by the model calibration müller schmied 2017 as nse is to some extent sensitive to the simulated mean which is likely to be close to the observations in watergap2 in the model evaluation study of krysanova et al 2020 the watergap2 was also the best performing model for the set of 57 large river basins based on the obtained model evaluation results and due to the absence of simulation runs for rcp 2 6 or rcp 8 5 for some other models it was decided to use only the watergap2 model for the impact assessment analysis of projected changes in climate variables performed based on four bias corrected gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 shows a gradual temperature increase from the south to the northeast of the study area changes in precipitation have no clear patterns across ukraine under rcp 2 6 but there is a clear decreasing trend in the southern and the southwestern parts under rcp 8 5 it is notable that the differences in precipitation and temperature between 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods under rcp 2 6 are much lower in comparison to those under rcp 8 5 it can be explained by temporal distribution of the greenhouse gas concentration during the 21 st century under different rcps a combination of steadily increasing temperature and slightly to moderately increasing or decreasing depending on the period and rcp precipitation leads to general decreases of the annual river discharge in the majority of the river basins similar to precipitation and temperature the differences in the projected river discharge between two future periods are higher under rcp 8 5 than under rcp 2 6 changes in the long term mean monthly discharge show an increase during winter months and some decrease in april may months in the majority of the basins for both periods and rcps this can be a result of temperature increase that provokes earlier snowmelt and shift in the timing of the spring flood similar results have been found in didovets et al 2017 and hesse et al 2015 also it can lead to a higher amount of liquid precipitation during winter and further decrease of the magnitude of spring peak discharge for the rest of the year overall decreases are projected in 5 out of 8 case study basins under rcp2 6 except for the tisza siverskyi donets and southern bug and in 7 out of 8 basins under rcp 8 5 except the siverskyi donets fig 6 similar results were obtained in the paper of didovets et al 2017 where changes in river discharge in three ukrainian catchments were analysed using the regional eco hydrological model swim driven by bias corrected gcms rcms under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 this study showed an increase of river discharge in winter months and a shift of the spring peak discharge in the samara and teteriv catchments tributaries of the dnieper river on the other hand the results for the upper western bug despite the decreasing precipitation in summer showed some increase of river discharge during the whole year which was explained by a higher level of groundwater the projected decrease of river discharge during the vegetation period combined with an increase of potential evapotranspiration see annex 4 can lead to reduction of water availability for crops across the country similar results on a large scale increase in evapotranspiration in europe were mentioned in van vliet et al 2015 moreover a combination of increase in potential evapotranspiration with decrease in actual evapotranspiration annex 4 and 5 in southern parts of the study area would increase water demand for irrigation which is very important for agriculture production in this area besides the results based on watergap2 show higher discharge increase during winter months compared to the ensemble mean and in summer months changes in some basins are projected to be opposite in two simulations e g for the desna river for example simulations based on watergap2 show the highest discharge increase in winter up to 100 in the siverskyi donets among all basins whereas the ensemble mean results show the increase in this basin by 40 the increase of discharge in winter months simulated by watergap2 for the tisza is also notably higher and longer compared to results based on the whole model set e g 24 43 compared to 5 21 in january february in the case of the southern bug changes in january february are even opposite in two simulations with an increase up to 28 simulated by the watergap2 and decrease up to 6 simulated by the ensemble of models in far future under rcp 8 5 in spite of that the main direction of change patterns in the long term mean monthly discharge based on both approaches is similar with overall decreases during the year except some winter months in the majority of basins a more extensive discussion on importance of model performance model calibration and inclusion of some key processes e g co2 fertilizations in the models intended for climate impact studies can be found in krysanova et al 2020 6 conclusions climate change will affect water availability of europe and ukraine is not an exception future changes will put more stress on water resources and water related sectors of the countries economy in this study we attempted to produce a general pattern of climate change impacts on river discharge at the country level and analyse it our results show that even under the soft rcp 2 6 scenario river discharge is expected to decrease in the majority of ukrainian river basins in the middle and end of the 21st century under the business as usual projections rcp 8 5 river discharge is projected to decrease more strongly at the end of the century and in combination with the rising temperature and declining precipitation this may lead to notably lower water availability for the southern part of ukraine this study also demonstrates that the projected impacts and uncertainty of the projections are influenced by selection of hydrological models to be used in the assessment the model evaluation can help to select only well performing model s for impact assessment for improving credibility of impacts and reducing spreads of projections we would like to emphasize the importance of the analysis of models performance during the historical period using observed data and evaluation of their reliability for climate impact assessment rising temperature provokes changes in hydrological regimes of the rivers in particular a shift of the spring river discharge peak to earlier months is projected for the desna southern bug tisza and western bug in summer months river discharge would decrease in the majority of basins in both periods under both rcps this kind of changes could create an additional challenge for the agriculture sector which is essential for the ukrainian economy in this regard it is vitally important to develop adaptation strategies at the regional and national levels based on up to date scientific knowledge for different sectors credit authorship contribution statement

8311,study region eight main river basins covering the major part of ukraine study focus the main aim of this study was to provide an assessment of climate change impacts on water availability across ukraine using global hydrological models six global hydrological models were evaluated for their performance in the historical period in the basins under study future river discharge was simulated by using the best performing model and all available models driven by bias corrected gcm projections from the isimip project under the rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the results show precipitation increase up to 10 under rcp 2 6 and variable changes from 14 to 10 under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century the projections show the decreasing mean annual river discharge in the majority of basins for the middle 2040 2070 and far future 2071 2100 periods under both rcps and the decrease is stronger under rcp 8 5 the seasonal changes are characterised by a decrease in summer and a small to moderate increase in winter months in most of the basins the highest reduction of mean annual discharge was projected for the pripyat southern bug and dniester basins reaching up to 30 to the end of the century under rcp 8 5 keywords ukraine climate change river discharge global hydrological models dnieper dniester siverskyi donets southern bug 1 introduction during the last decades an alteration of climate in europe has been observed and it is expected that changes will be stronger in the future kovats et al 2014 global warming would lead to changes in the water cycle which are likely to affect water availability at different scales and sectors e g energy agriculture forest and more that kind of changes can bring society to the state where climate change is a prime political issue donnelly et al 2017 ipcc 2018 schleussner et al 2016 however even with a strong support of the scientific community on climate change and climate impact issues in europe the uncertainties in projected hydrological impacts for future are large many studies show large spreads in projections provoking a discussion about the robustness of the simulated signals of change and impact results frieler et al 2017 haddeland et al 2014 hattermann et al 2018 2017 focusing on the european studies which also cover ukraine and the 1 5 c and 2 0 c increments the study of jacob et al 2018 displays possible changes in temperature and precipitation across europe based on different gcms rcms driven by rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios changes in total precipitation within ukraine show an increase from 5 to 15 under 1 5 c and 2 0 c warming scenarios the results of vliet et al 2015 based on the bias corrected gcms from cmip5 showed that changes in precipitation would vary from 5 to 5 for the major part of ukraine in the 2050s under rcp 2 6 precipitation would increase in the 2080s in the range from 5 to 20 under rcp 2 6 except for crimean peninsula where changes would be from 5 to 5 under rcp 8 5 precipitation changes would stay in the same ranges as under rcp 2 6 for the 2050s but for the 2080s a decrease up to 20 is projected for the southern and western parts of ukraine the climate change impacts on water resources in europe are presented in studies that used continental and global scale hydrological models donnelly et al 2017 mentaschi et al 2019 van vliet et al 2015 two of them considered ukrainian territory only partly and only the last one covered the whole country also there is a study focused on evaluation of performance of an ensemble of global hydrological models in 57 large river basins worldwide with their further application for climate impact assessment with weighting coefficients krysanova et al 2020 where small parts of ukraine were covered in the study of van vliet et al 2015 the authors assessed changes in river discharge simulated by the vic and e hype models driven by the bias corrected gcms the results for rcp 8 5 show predominantly decreasing change signal varying from 5 to 40 for the 2050s in the major part of ukraine besides there is a number of regional scale studies based on catchment scale hydrological models fischer et al 2014 hesse et al 2015 didovets et al 2017 piniewski et al 2018 didovets et al 2019 and statistical models and tools loboda and bozhok 2016 snizhko et al 2014 they all focus on specific catchments or parts of the country and not consider changes in water resources at the national level the similar decreasing trends as in van vilet et al 2015 have been found also in the regional scale studies by loboda and kozlov 2020 and snizhko et al 2014 the results of study by snizhko et al 2014 which considered 19 river basins across ukraine showed mostly no changes in runoff except a small increase until 2040 but a moderate decrease was projected in the central and southern parts of the country at the end of the century as we see there is practically only one study by van vilet et al 2015 dedicated to studying climate change impacts on water availability in ukraine based on hydrological models and covering the whole country therefore there is a strong need in updating climate impact assessment at the country scale in order to improve understanding of expected changes and adaptation options at the national level the main goal of this study is to assess the impact of climate change on water availability for the main ukrainian river basins by using global hydrological models ghms driven by up to date climate projections under the low end rcp 2 6 and high end rcp 8 5 pathways besides this study also aims to investigate the suitability of the ghms for simulation of climate change impacts in the study area based on their performance in the historical period the intention is to apply only well performing models for the assessment of climate change impacts the structure of the paper is the following i main information about the ukrainian case study river basins ii overview of methods iii evaluation of ghms and their suitability for simulation of impacts iv analysis of expected changes in precipitation and temperature based on gcms v projections of river discharge across study areas using selected tools and vi discussion of the main outcomes 2 study area ukraine is characterised by notable climate differences across the country the major part of the country is situated within the temperate climate zone and only the southern coast of crimea has a subtropical mediterranean climate the average temperature of the coldest month january has negative values on the major part of the territory 2 c 7 5 c except the southern part of the crimean peninsula the average temperature in july varies from 17 5 c to 22 c fao 2015 air humidity is much higher in the western part of the country in comparison to the eastern part also differences in temperature regime in the east west direction are prominent and the vegetation period is longer in the western part due to the softer and wetter climate regular alteration of the atlantic circulation and dry air from the east provoke cyclone and anticyclone movements on the plain part of the country in winter temperate warm air masses are replaced by cold air coming from the north syberia in summer warm air is changed by atlantic wet and temperate warm masses anticyclones that dominate in the southern and central parts of the country usually come from central asia cyclones which are more intensive in the western part come from the atlantic ocean and mediterranean sea zastavniy 1994 precipitation is characterised by high values in the carpathian mountainous region up to 1600 mm a 1 and crimea up to 1150 mm a 1 the mean annual precipitation in other parts of the country varies from 700 750 mm in the north west to 300 350 mm in the south east which can be explained by the dominance of cyclones and anticyclones national communication of ukraine on climate change 2013 zastavniy 1994 in this study we focus on the main river basins of ukraine dnieper and catchments of its two main tributaries desna pripyat siverskyi donets sothern bug dniester tisza a tributary of the danube river and western bug bug the selection of the river basins and their gauging stations was based on the following criteria i the drainage area should be larger than 30 000 km2 and ii observed discharge time series should be available for longer than 10 years majority of considered rivers are transboundary so some parts of other countries were also included in the modelling the modelled areas of the river basins are shown in fig 1 and the main characteristics of the basins are presented in table 1 the drainage areas of the basins vary from 39 000 km2 to 482 000 km2 and observed discharge time series are available for 14 32 years the dnieper river is the 4th longest river in europe it originates in russia and flows through belarus and ukraine to the black sea it is a lowland river its drainage basin covers about 65 of ukraine and divides the country from north to south into the left and right banks parts the major tributaries are the desna left and the pripyat right the dnieper is characterised by high water regulation in terms of a cascade of reservoirs and dams constructed in the twentieth century aquastat fao s information system on water and agriculture 2020 the dniester river is the second largest river in ukraine and its basin covers about 12 of the country area the river originates in ukraine then flows to moldova and returns to ukraine 50 km before entering the black sea further to the northwest the western bug river is flowing it is a tributary of the narew river which belongs to the vistula river basin and it begins in ukraine and flows to poland the danube river originates in germany and flows southeast until entering the black sea on the border between romania and ukraine the prut and tisza originating in the carpathian mountains are the largest tributaries of the danube located partly in ukraine water report 15 fao 2020 the southern bug is an internal river basin of ukraine it originates on the northwest of the country and flows to the southeast the siverskyi donets river is the left tributary of the done river and large part of its basin is situated in the eastern part of the country the river length is 1 053 km from which around 455 km lie within ukraine and the rest in russia mаринич 1993 3 methods for assessment of climate change impacts on water resources of the main ukrainian river basins our study was conducted in three steps a evaluation of performance of the global hydrological models and selection of the most representative ones with better performance for the study area b analysis of climate projections and projected changes in temperature and precipitation for ukraine c analysis of changes in the river discharge in eight ukrainian river basins until the end of the century under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 3 1 climate projections to analyse changes in mean temperature and precipitation until the end of the century four climate projections were taken from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip 2020 phase 2b they are from hadgem2 es miroc5 ipsl cm5a lr and gfdl esm2m models frieler et al 2017 the climate data have been bias corrected to the reanalysis climate dataset ewembi lange 2018 2019 the spatial resolution of the data is 0 5 0 5 and time series can be divided into two parts historical simulations 1861 2005 and projections considering greenhouse gas emissions covering the period 2006 2099 two rcp scenarios were selected for this study rcp 2 6 in line with the paris agreement assuming a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and returning to 2 6 w m2 by 2100 and rcp 8 5 the worst case scenario that does not include any specific climate mitigation goals riahi et al 2011 so in total there were eight climate scenarios considered including four gcms driven by two rcps in order to analyse changes in precipitation and temperature until the end of the century we considered the historical 1971 2000 and two future periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 temperature precipitation and river discharge in both future periods under both rcps were compared with those in the historical one 3 2 global hydrological models and climate data simulations of six global hydrological models were performed previously and uploaded at the isimip server and then downloaded for our case study area evaluated and applied for the assessment of changes in river discharge under climate change the ensemble of models includes lpjml rost et al 2008 matsiro pokhrel et al 2015 h08 hanasaki et al 2008 watergap2 müller schmied et al 2016 dbh tang et al 2007 and pcr globwb wada et al 2014 all models simulate evapotranspiration snow cover surface flow subsurface flow river discharge etc see details in hattermann et al 2017 but only one of them the watergap2 model was calibrated using discharge data from the grdc database müller schmied 2017 müller schmied et al 2014 more detailed information about the models characteristics and components can be found in the references above and in krysanova et al 2020 climate reanalysis data watch weedon et al 2010 were used as a forcing for the model evaluation in historical period further the models were driven by gcm projections listed above for the historical period 1861 2005 and future period 2006 2099 the spatial resolution of the model outputs is 0 5 0 5 human water management influence was considered in all simulations the histsoc historically varying land use and other human influences and the 2005soc fixed at the 2005 year land use and other human influences simulations driven by gcms were chosen for the historical and future periods respectively frieler et al 2017 as stated above watch and ewembi were used as forcing in the historical period for model evaluation and for bias correction of gcms correspondingly to confirm the ability of both watch and ewembi data to reproduce climate in the case study areas and to assess possible uncertainty in the modelling the both reanalysis datasets were additionally analysed in comparison to observations to cover the whole case study region it was decided to choose one climate station per river basin fig 1 with a time span of at least 10 years of daily data the stationary observations were taken from the european assessment datasets e obs www ecad eu the analysis was focused on one of the major components precipitation our results show a high correlation between both reanalysis data and observed precipitation data and low deviations in the long term mean annual precipitation see annex 1 and fig 2 the average r2 and r values for all stations for the annual precipitation are r2 0 83 r 0 91 ewembi e obs and r2 0 81 r 0 90 watch e obs the deviations in the long term mean annual precipitation vary from 1 8 to 4 2 on average over the case study areas and can reach up to 30 36 in some months in some basins 3 3 the global water availability and water use model watergap2 and datasets used for the ukraine as watergap2 was found to be the best performing model for the case study area and the impact assessment was performed mainly with this model sect 4 3 it is briefly described here watergap2 is a global water availability and water use model that is in development since 1996 watergap includes of five water use models irrigation domestic manufacturing livestock cooling of thermal power plants the linking module gwswuse that calculates based on the output of the water use models net water abstractions from groundwater and surface water resources furthermore the watergap global hydrology model calculates the water fluxes and storages for all continents except antarctica at 0 5 0 5 spatial and daily temporal resolution considering the water uses and other processes as such as alterations due to man made dams and reservoirs the main objectives of watergap development is to assess water resources for human and environment and its impact due to anthropogenic alterations as such as water use man made reservoirs and climate change model descriptions can be found in alcamo et al 2003 muller schmied et al 2014 2016 2017 the model versions being used here are watergap 2 2 isimip2a for the evaluation within isimip2a and watergap 2 2c for the impact assessment within isimip2b one particular feature of watergap is its basin specific calibration with the objective to reproduce long term annual observed river discharge at 1319 basins covering 54 of the global drainage area except for antarctica and greenland by modifying one to three model parameters details in hunger and döll 2008 muller schmied 2017 the majority of discharge stations used for evaluation in this study table 1 has been used as well for calibration but for different time spans according to the data availability dnieper 1959 1988 prypyat 1973 2002 desna 1956 1985 dnister 1965 1984 southern bug 1965 1984 western bug 1957 1986 please note that for evaluation other than for calibration on the long term annual mean monthly time series have been used hence the evaluation can be seen as somehow independent the reservoirs along the dniepr are included in watergap and handled for electricity purposes for details to the reservoir scheme the reader is referred to döll et al 2009 3 4 evaluation of the global hydrological models it was decided to use the model evaluation approach from krysanova et al 2020 to analyse the reliability of the global hydrological models for ukrainian basins comparing the simulations for the historical period driven by watch climate forcing data see more in muller schmied et al 2016 weedon et al 2010 with the observed river discharge for each basin the monthly observed river discharge was taken from the grdc database the selected gauges for each basin together with the time periods for model evaluation are presented in table 1 the calculation of metrics was not possible for the siverskyi donets basin due to absence of the observation data some of the basins are highly regulated by dams and reservoirs e g dnieper and this can affect the evaluation results though hydrological models considered reservoirs which are included in different databases as such as global reservoirs and dams database lehner et al 2011 following the modelling protocol isimip the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project 2019 wwf 2020 for model evaluation the next metrics were used nash

satisfactory to weak performance and the score is 0 for the poor performance based on the total scores for each model and basin the well performing models could be selected for the case study area based on their performance in the historical period after model evaluation and selection the changes in mean annual and long term mean seasonal river discharge for future periods in comparison with the reference period driven by four bias corrected gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 were analysed the same time periods were used as for the climate projections analysis the reference period 1971 2000 and two future periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2099 4 results 4 1 model evaluation the resulting metrics of model evaluation for the monthly and seasonal dynamics in all basins are presented in annex 2 in supplementary and the sums of assigned scores are shown in table 2 as one can see the highest sum of scores among all models has the watergap2 model with 16 of maximum 28 four metrics in seven basins and matsiro and pcr globwb show rather weak performance with 8 and 7 5 correspondingly and the other three models h08 lpjml and dbh demonstrated quite poor performance according to our assessment the comparison of the observed and simulated long term mean monthly discharge in all seven basins simulated by six ghms in the historical period are presented in annex 3 only one model the watergap2 got more than a half of possible scores and other models showed weak or poor results moreover the dbh and pcr globwb models have no simulation runs for some gcms rcps and it is not possible to use them for the climate impact assessment the differences in the model evaluation results can be explained by calibration of the watergap2 model to the long term mean annual streamflow observations for the historical period based on the evaluation results it was decided to use mainly the watergap2 model for further assessment of climate change impacts in all eight river basins to compare results ensemble mean approach including all ghms was also used for all basins under considerations similarly good performance of the watergap2 model and weak or poor performance of other ghms for 40 57 large river basins worldwide was shown in the studies of krysanova et al 2020 and zaherpour et al 2018 4 2 analysis of climate scenarios fig 3 presents projected changes in mean annual temperature based averaged over four bias corrected gcms until the end of the century under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the changes show an increase in both time periods under both rcps across the whole study area rising from the south to the northeast of the study domain under rcp 2 6 the increase varies from 2 1 c on the south of ukraine crimea to 2 8 c on the north of the study area russia for both time periods the temperature is projected to rise up to 2 4 c within southern and southeastern parts of ukraine up to 2 5 2 6 c in the centre north of ukraine and east of belarus and up to 2 7 2 8 c in western belarus and russia under rcp 8 5 the differences in temperature increase between two time periods are much more notable in the period 2041 2070 temperature is projected to rise from 3 1 c to 4 5 c in the study region in ukraine up to 4 2 c in belarus up to 4 4 c and in russia within the study area up to 4 5 c in the period 2071 2100 changes are higher and vary from 4 8 c to 6 6 c in ukraine up to 6 c in belarus up to 6 3 c and in russia within the study area up to 6 6 c it is noteworthy that there is a tendency of temperature increase under rcp 8 5 in the northeastern direction starting from the central part of ukraine the simulated future changes in precipitation are not so pronounced in comparison to changes in temperature precipitation under rcp 2 6 shows small to moderate up to 10 increase across the whole study area for both future periods fig 4 changes under rcp 8 5 vary from a small decrease to a moderate increase 5 to 10 in the period 2041 2070 at the end of the century 2071 2100 annual precipitation is projected to decrease up to 12 14 in the southern and western parts of ukraine especially in crimea carpathians and odeska oblast and to increase up to 15 in belarus and russia 4 3 changes in river discharge the projections of climate change impacts on water availability have similar patterns across basins under study as precipitation figs 5 and 6 resent simulated changes in the mean annual and long term mean monthly river discharge in the eight river basins for two future periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 as simulated by the watergap2 model driven by four bias corrected gcms from isimip2b changes in the mean annual river discharge under rcp 2 6 for two future periods are small to moderate and vary from 10 to 6 in five basins tisza southern bug siverskyi donets desna western bug in the other three basins dnieper dniester and pripyat river discharge decreases up to 20 on average in both future periods changes under rcp 8 5 are generally much stronger in comparison to rcp 2 6 in the majority of basins river discharge strongly decreases to the end of the century the highest decreases are projected for the pripyat southern bug and dniester and can reach up to 30 to the end of the century on the other hand projections for the siverskyi donets and desna basins show very small positive changes or zero changes in general the results show decreasing trends in river discharge in the majority of the basins for the middle century 2040 2070 and far future 2070 2100 periods under both rcps which are more significant under rcp 8 5 the projections of the long term mean monthly river discharge show a general decrease during practically the whole year in the dnieper western bug dniester and pripyat rivers basins in both future periods under both rcps except small increases in february or february march in some cases fig 6 a notable tendency of increasing discharge during winter months have the desna tisza southern bug and siverskyi donets in both time periods under both rcps all projections show a general decrease during summer months in all catchments in both periods and for both rcps except the siverskyi donets basin where an increase in summer months is projected in most cases both decreases and increases are stronger under rcp 8 5 compared to rcp 2 6 the far future period under rcp 8 5 is characterised by more significant changes compared to the mid century the river discharge in the western bug basin is projected to decrease in all months except february reaching up to 28 under rcp 2 6 and up to 30 under rcp 8 5 the strongest decrease occurs in the fall months under both rcps the minor increase in february can be a sign of shift in the peak of river discharge similar but a bit stronger patterns of expected changes were obtained for the pripyat river with a general decrease during the year up to 29 under rcp 2 6 and up to 43 under rcp 8 5 by the end of the century except an increase in february in both cases when discharge is projected to rise up to 10 under rcp 2 6 and up to 14 under rcp 8 5 the river discharge in the desna basin is projected to increase from january to march in both periods under both rcps up to 28 under rcp 2 6 and up to 42 under rcp 8 5 during the rest of the months river discharge is projected to decrease from 3 to 16 the projections for the tisza basin show an increase in winter for both future periods from 4 to 42 under rcp 2 6 and from 9 to 42 under rcp 8 5 in june river discharge increases slightly by 5 and in the rest months it decreases from 4 to 17 in both periods under rcp 2 6 the changes under the rcp 8 5 show a decrease from april to november ranging from 7 to 21 in the mid century and from 17 to 35 in the far future in the dniester basin river discharge is projected to decrease during all months in both time periods under both rcps except for february in 2070 2100 under rcp 2 6 zero changes the changes vary from 2 to 20 under rcp 2 6 and from 5 to 35 under rcp 8 5 the river discharge shows a stronger decrease at the end of the century under rcp 8 5 the river discharge in the southern bug is projected to increase in january and february in both periods up to 35 under rcp 2 6 and up to 30 under rcp 8 5 during the rest of the year river discharge declines from 3 to 26 under rcp 2 6 and from 13 to 45 under rcp 8 5 except a slight increase in one summer month under rcp 2 6 it s notable that changes become higher at the end of the century under rcp 8 5 the simulated changes in the dnieper basin are homogeneous for both periods and rcps with a moderate decline of river discharge up to 18 under rcp 2 6 and up to 24 under rcp 8 5 an exception is a period from january to march with a small increase up to 7 in 2070 2100 under rcp 2 6 the highest positive changes among all catchments are projected for the siverskyi donets basin in january march river discharge shows an increase up to 69 under rcp 2 6 and up to 100 under rcp 8 5 and the highest increase always occurs in february in july august river discharge shows an increase up to 22 under rcp 2 6 and up to 10 under rcp 8 5 and in the rest months it is projected to decrease up to 28 under both rcps annex 6 presents the long term mean river discharge for two future periods simulated by the ensemble of four models under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the results show a general decrease during the year with some increase in winter months for the majority of basins under study the general pattern of changes falls in line of conclusions based on the watergap2 but increases during winter are lower and the uncertainty of projected discharge is notably higher 5 discussion the analysis of model performance showed that the watergap2 model had the best results and other models had weak or poor performance where the monthly pbias could reach more than 300 and nse for the long term monthly discharge up to 100 the averaged metrics over seven basins under study show the best monthly nse and seasonal nse for the watergap2 0 4 and 0 2 and the best monthly pbias and δσ for the pcr globwb 3 2 and 19 8 accordingly annex 7 the good results for the watergap2 can be partly explained by the model calibration müller schmied 2017 as nse is to some extent sensitive to the simulated mean which is likely to be close to the observations in watergap2 in the model evaluation study of krysanova et al 2020 the watergap2 was also the best performing model for the set of 57 large river basins based on the obtained model evaluation results and due to the absence of simulation runs for rcp 2 6 or rcp 8 5 for some other models it was decided to use only the watergap2 model for the impact assessment analysis of projected changes in climate variables performed based on four bias corrected gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 shows a gradual temperature increase from the south to the northeast of the study area changes in precipitation have no clear patterns across ukraine under rcp 2 6 but there is a clear decreasing trend in the southern and the southwestern parts under rcp 8 5 it is notable that the differences in precipitation and temperature between 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods under rcp 2 6 are much lower in comparison to those under rcp 8 5 it can be explained by temporal distribution of the greenhouse gas concentration during the 21 st century under different rcps a combination of steadily increasing temperature and slightly to moderately increasing or decreasing depending on the period and rcp precipitation leads to general decreases of the annual river discharge in the majority of the river basins similar to precipitation and temperature the differences in the projected river discharge between two future periods are higher under rcp 8 5 than under rcp 2 6 changes in the long term mean monthly discharge show an increase during winter months and some decrease in april may months in the majority of the basins for both periods and rcps this can be a result of temperature increase that provokes earlier snowmelt and shift in the timing of the spring flood similar results have been found in didovets et al 2017 and hesse et al 2015 also it can lead to a higher amount of liquid precipitation during winter and further decrease of the magnitude of spring peak discharge for the rest of the year overall decreases are projected in 5 out of 8 case study basins under rcp2 6 except for the tisza siverskyi donets and southern bug and in 7 out of 8 basins under rcp 8 5 except the siverskyi donets fig 6 similar results were obtained in the paper of didovets et al 2017 where changes in river discharge in three ukrainian catchments were analysed using the regional eco hydrological model swim driven by bias corrected gcms rcms under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 this study showed an increase of river discharge in winter months and a shift of the spring peak discharge in the samara and teteriv catchments tributaries of the dnieper river on the other hand the results for the upper western bug despite the decreasing precipitation in summer showed some increase of river discharge during the whole year which was explained by a higher level of groundwater the projected decrease of river discharge during the vegetation period combined with an increase of potential evapotranspiration see annex 4 can lead to reduction of water availability for crops across the country similar results on a large scale increase in evapotranspiration in europe were mentioned in van vliet et al 2015 moreover a combination of increase in potential evapotranspiration with decrease in actual evapotranspiration annex 4 and 5 in southern parts of the study area would increase water demand for irrigation which is very important for agriculture production in this area besides the results based on watergap2 show higher discharge increase during winter months compared to the ensemble mean and in summer months changes in some basins are projected to be opposite in two simulations e g for the desna river for example simulations based on watergap2 show the highest discharge increase in winter up to 100 in the siverskyi donets among all basins whereas the ensemble mean results show the increase in this basin by 40 the increase of discharge in winter months simulated by watergap2 for the tisza is also notably higher and longer compared to results based on the whole model set e g 24 43 compared to 5 21 in january february in the case of the southern bug changes in january february are even opposite in two simulations with an increase up to 28 simulated by the watergap2 and decrease up to 6 simulated by the ensemble of models in far future under rcp 8 5 in spite of that the main direction of change patterns in the long term mean monthly discharge based on both approaches is similar with overall decreases during the year except some winter months in the majority of basins a more extensive discussion on importance of model performance model calibration and inclusion of some key processes e g co2 fertilizations in the models intended for climate impact studies can be found in krysanova et al 2020 6 conclusions climate change will affect water availability of europe and ukraine is not an exception future changes will put more stress on water resources and water related sectors of the countries economy in this study we attempted to produce a general pattern of climate change impacts on river discharge at the country level and analyse it our results show that even under the soft rcp 2 6 scenario river discharge is expected to decrease in the majority of ukrainian river basins in the middle and end of the 21st century under the business as usual projections rcp 8 5 river discharge is projected to decrease more strongly at the end of the century and in combination with the rising temperature and declining precipitation this may lead to notably lower water availability for the southern part of ukraine this study also demonstrates that the projected impacts and uncertainty of the projections are influenced by selection of hydrological models to be used in the assessment the model evaluation can help to select only well performing model s for impact assessment for improving credibility of impacts and reducing spreads of projections we would like to emphasize the importance of the analysis of models performance during the historical period using observed data and evaluation of their reliability for climate impact assessment rising temperature provokes changes in hydrological regimes of the rivers in particular a shift of the spring river discharge peak to earlier months is projected for the desna southern bug tisza and western bug in summer months river discharge would decrease in the majority of basins in both periods under both rcps this kind of changes could create an additional challenge for the agriculture sector which is essential for the ukrainian economy in this regard it is vitally important to develop adaptation strategies at the regional and national levels based on up to date scientific knowledge for different sectors credit authorship contribution statement

8312,study region water samples for isotopic analysis were collected during 2013 2019 at 331 gauging stations across canada in representative watersheds ranging from the atlantic to the pacific to the arctic oceans drainage area coverage of the network included 56 of canada s landmass 9 984 670 km2 and was representative of 91 of canada s annual water yield study focus baseline data including 4603 18o and 2h analyses are described to assess potential for process studies and predictive model calibration new hydrological insights for the region while similar patterns are noted between isotopes in streamflow and precipitation across canada systematic evaporative enrichment in streamflow occurs in lake and wetland rich areas and systematic depletion occurs in some mountainous and or cold regions

diversity of climatic and hydrologic settings due to limited resources the density of hydrometric and climatic monitoring stations in canada has long fallen short of world meteorological organization wmo guidelines particularly in remote northern areas coulibaly et al 2013 prowse 1990 recent network reductions since the 1990s have further exacerbated the situation complicating monitoring of runoff variability and requiring innovative approaches to be explored for prediction in ungauged basins spence et al 2007 while coverage and frequency of monitoring may be significantly augmented in future through technical advances such as satellite radar altimetry coss et al 2020 crétaux et al 2017 other strategies such as incorporation of stable isotope tracers have also been shown to offer added value for hydrologic monitoring and prediction rank et al 1998 kendall and coplen 2001 gibson et al 2002 vitvar et al 2007 halder et al 2015 isotopes potentially offer a sharper focus on the underlying causes of water cycle variability as they permit labelling and tracking of individual streamflow sources and mixing as well as quantification of evaporation water balance and water residence times thus providing indicators useful for climate and land use change attribution gibson et al 2005 birks and gibson 2009 most recently the emergence of isotope capable predictive hydrological models has created additional incentive and opportunity for incorporation of isotope tracers within regional and global river networks as diagnostic or calibration variables to improve process representation fekete et al 2006 stadnyk et al 2013 smith et al 2016 belachew et al 2016 in canada isotopes in streamflow were first surveyed at the national scale by brown et al 1971 during 1967 1969 while 2h alone was measured the study revealed that spatial trends were broadly consistent with known variations in canadian precipitation fritz 1981 also in 1969 a summer survey of 18o but not 2h was conducted along rivers in the mackenzie river basin by hitchon and krouse 1972 who attributed variations to differences in evaporation during precipitation and runoff mook 1982 was the first to report on time series variations in 18o in the mackenzie river a number of subsequent regional studies used both 18o and 2h to examine large river basins in canada including the fraser cameron et al 1995 mackenzie gibson et al 2002 2005 st amour et al 2005 cooper et al 2008 yi et al 2009 2012 st lawrence telmer and veizer 2000 rosa et al 2016 and nelson ferguson and veizer 2007 ferguson et al 2007 smith et al 2015 these studies were mostly supported by the water survey of canada wsc and provincial partners and involved systematic water sampling at established gauging stations several other recent assessments have also been carried out extending beyond the wsc networks but targeting specific regions of interest e g muskoka river james et al 2019 okanagan valley wassenaar et al 2011 surgeon river england 2017 grand river stadnyk et al 2015a red river stadnyk et al 2015b in 2013 the wsc funded operation of an inaugural national water sampling program for 18o and 2h at river flow gauging stations across most of the country results from the first phase of its operation 2013 2019 are presented here along with preliminary analyses of canada wide trends the objectives of this paper are to present a description of the spatial and temporal variations of 18o and 2h measured in river discharge across canada in comparison with existing surveys of precipitation and surface waters we also illustrate variations with flow water yield altitude and mean annual air temperature and provide preliminary analysis of major controlling factors as well as introducing new terminology to describe observed relationships in δ18o δ2h space a companion article in data in brief which contains over 10 000 isotopic measurements is provided to facilitate access by researchers and stakeholders to the entire dataset gibson et al 2020 this study is novel in terms of its scale and comprehensiveness including streamflow gauging stations across most hydrometric regions of canada as selected by water survey of canada leadership based on environmental and stakeholder priorities fig 1 as a baseline national dataset for canada similar to that of kendall and coplen 2001 for the united states we anticipate this will provide regional and national context for local hydroclimate studies hydrograph separation analysis and water balance investigations using isotopic tracers as well as providing the first integrated multi year description of isotope variations in river discharge across northern north america based on review of historical datasets as well as first hand experience with numerous regional surveys and lake monitoring networks across canada gibson et al 2016a 2016b 2017 2018 2019 our hypothesis at the outset was that isotopic variations in streamflow would largely mimic patterns in precipitation in humid coastal areas but would potentially be modified in continental areas due to contributions from evaporated source waters running off from wetlands and lakes by glacial melt sources in mountainous areas and during snowmelt and storm events by storage and lag effects these early assertions are discussed later on in the results and discussion including comparisons with similar surveys in the united states precipitation isotope data and descriptions and discussion of underlying water cycling processes on a region by region basis 2 background stable isotopes naturally occurring stable isotope tracers have been increasingly utilized in hydrological and climatological research owing to their potential to provide insight into underlying processes that control variability in the water cycle gibson et al 2005 stable isotopes of importance include oxygen 18 18o oxygen 17 17o and deuterium 2h which are incorporated within the water molecule to form isotopologues h2 18o h2 17o 1h2h16o they provide embedded signals of sources mixing selection and numerous fractionating processes including condensation sublimation diffusion evaporation in air and freezing fractionation produces a natural isotope labelling effect within the global water cycle that has been applied to quantify the responsible mechanism s note that samples for 17o were archived but not measured in the initial phase of this program but it is anticipated that these will provide similar or complimentary information to 18o see angert et al 2004 li et al 2015 processes controlling stable isotope composition have been described previously by rosa et al 2016 and include the superimposed effects of recharge evaporation ice formation snowmelt and mixing processes in canada strong seasonal fluctuations in isotopic composition are common for rivers yi et al 2009 2012 smith et al 2015 rosa et al 2016 driven by heavy isotope depleted runoff during the snowmelt period and heavy isotope enrichment during the ice free period the latter being related to evaporation both from the river and from inherited sources such as lakes and wetlands st amour et al 2005 gibson et al 2016a long term baseflow signatures are often reflective of basin water balance gibson et al 1993 stadnyk et al 2015a as well as groundwater mixing and water residence time controls and so may be useful for estimating water age kirchner 2016 jasechko et al 2016 or quantifying tributary mixing krouse and mackay 1971 under ice discharge in winter is predominantly of groundwater origin and so often corresponds to the isotopic composition of long term precipitation input sources gibson and prowse 2002 a comprehensive discussion of river isotope controls was provided in reviews by fritz 1981 and gat 2010 the latter including a conceptual isotope framework called the isotope river continuum model 3 method 3 1 study sites eleven geographic regions are monitored by the wsc encompassing a range of hydroclimatic settings fig 1 in consultation with wsc leadership 331 hydrometric stations were selected from the current operational network to establish representative coverage across key areas of these regions fig 2a the temporal frequency of sampling ranged from 1 to 12 times per year with schedules constrained by the frequency of visits by hydrotechnical staff a core network of 161 stations was maintained that had more than 12 samples collected for isotopic analysis during 2013 2019 and that had concurrent discharge data to facilitate flow weighting of the isotopic signatures fig 2b monitoring summaries are provided by hydrometric region and by province tables 1 and 2 areal coverage varied regionally between province territory and hydrometric region due to site accessibility logistical issues and budget constraints a significant portion of region 10 arctic islands and the entirety of region 11 missouri mississippi were not included in the phase 1 isotope sampling network further details on the network as well as individual station summaries are provided in a companion data in brief article gibson et al 2020 network coverage over the country was 56 by terrestrial area representing approximately 91 of the long term discharge by volume as calculated from watershed areas and long term water yields respectively accessed using ecdataexplorer

hdpe bottles during regular visits to wsc streamflow gauging stations and returned to innotech s isotope lab in victoria for analysis of 18o and 2h by isotope ratio mass spectrometry a dual inlet thermofisher scientific isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v interfaced with a gasbench peripheral for oxygen 18 and h device peripheral for deuterium was used for isotopic analysis for oxygen 18 and deuterium samples were run using the methods described in paul and skrzypek 2006 and brand et al 1996 respectively with normalization of results on the v smow scale based on the approach of nelson 2000 analytical uncertainty estimated based on 1 standard deviation of repeats 1 σ was 0 07 for δ18o n 382 and 0 26 for δ2h n 450 additional details on sampling analyses and access to the full dataset are available from gibson et al 2020 3 3 statistical analyses both arithmetic and flow weighted means were calculated for the isotopic dataset arithmetic means or average values represent the quantity obtained by summing two or more isotopic measurements and then dividing by the number of measurements these values were calculated for both 18o and 2h at 331 stations across canada and do not account for variations in flow rates recorded amongst sampling events flow weighted means were calculated as the dot or scalar product of the sequence of isotopic values and daily flow rate pairs measured at each gauging station divided by the average flow flow weighted means were calculated for both δ18o and δ2h at 161 stations that had at least 12 isotope flow pairs flow weighted mean values are representative of the overall volumetric discharge dual isotope relationships were also applied to describe spatial and temporal variations within the dataset we introduce the term time series river line tsrl which we define as the linear regression of δ2h and δ18o collected over time at an individual river station tsrls were calculated and are plotted in δ18o δ2h space for selected stations to illustrate seasonal variability across the network we introduce the term regional river line rrl which we define as the linear regression of all δ2h and δ18o time series data from multiple stations rivers within a defined region similarly we introduce the term rrlam to indicate an rrl using station based arithmetic mean values and rrlfw to indicate an rrl using station based flow weighted mean values note that only significant trends p 0 05 are reported herein deuterium excess d in streamflow was calculated from the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope dataset using the formulation of dansgaard 1964 1 d δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o where d 10 defines the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 and d 8 5 defines the canadian meteoric water line gibson et al 2005 we also estimate line conditioned excess lc excess for river lines landwehr and coplen 2006 2 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b where a is the slope and b is the intercept of the mwl to evaluate distinction of regional river trends from both the canadian meteoric water line cmwl of gibson et al 2005 and local meteoric water lines lmwl estimated for each hydrometric region using the model of delavau et al 2015 for rivers sampled in this study we note measurement uncertainty 1 σ to be 3 σ 0 25 2 a 0 07 2 0 5 where a is the slope of the tsrl or rrl note that 1 σ for both the lmwl and cmwl are estimated to be 1 34 based on presumed historical measurement uncertainty in δ18o 0 1 and δ2h 1 across canadian isotope laboratories over the past 60 years the scaled line conditioned excess lc excess can then be derived to evaluate whether the data are distinct from meteoric water landwehr and coplen 2006 4 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b σ where a and b in our assessment are based on either the cmwl a 8 b 8 5 or regionally variable lmwl parameters note that water yield wy is calculated from 5 w y q w a 1000 mm where q is stream discharge m3 s and wa is watershed area m2 3 4 interpolation and mapping gridded 32 km monthly climate data 1981 2001 including precipitation amount and 2 m air temperature were extracted from the north america regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 isotope composition of monthly precipitation was estimated based on the model of delavau et al 2015 for all narr coordinates falling within the canadian landmass amount weighted annual values were calculated as the dot product of the sequence of monthly isotopic values and precipitation amounts divided by the total precipitation annual air temperature was calculated as the arithmetic mean of monthly air temperatures for calculating basin weighted averages all grid centered narr datapoints falling within the watershed were arithmetically averaged note that annual water yield was calculated from gauging records at flow weighted stations and only these stations were used for mapping the isotopic composition of 18o and 2h in streamflow likewise for plotting deuterium excess d excess and differences between isotopic composition of streamflow and precipitation δ18o δ2h only stations reporting both precipitation isotope data and flow weighted streamflow isotope data were used all mapping was carried out in arcmap using kriging interpolation applying a nearest neighbours n 12 approach for the purpose of continental scale visualization note that stream network interpolation approaches similar to those used by fekete et al 2006 or bowen et al 2011 based on distributed models were not tested at this stage for mapping or comparison of streamflow and precipitation acknowledging that application of a range of such models of intermediate or high complexity might be forthcoming based on open access to the full dataset gibson et al 2020 uncertainty in isotope in precipitation modelling was discussed by delavau et al 2015 who demonstrated confidence bounds for δ18o signatures across canada for stations where canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip data with sufficiently long records were available it should be noted that δ2h was not part of their assessment however we examined uncertainty in the modelled deuterium composition of precipitation relative to the long term cnip stations and found similar uncertainty bands as reported for δ18o with no significant anomalies detected on a monthly long term basis 4 results and discussion 4 1 regional patterns spatial variations in isotopes in streamflow across canada are illustrated from flow weighted values of δ18o and δ2h which show distinct spatial patterns that correspond to known climatic patterns fig 3 a b respectively for example flow weighted streamflow ranges in δ18o δ2h from 8 54 59 3 for the terra nova river in newfoundland maritime to 23 41 182 0 for the root river northwest territories arctic areas draining to the pacific ocean west of the western cordillera display systematic increases in isotope ratios from mountainous regions toward the coast with the highest ratios most enriched measured for the cowichan river on vancouver island 10 44 and 74 39 in δ18o and δ2h respectively and lowest ratios most depleted for the columbia river at donald 19 30 and 146 6 in δ18o and δ2h respectively spatial patterns and organization are broadly consistent with isotope ratios of δ18o and δ2h for annual precipitation for most regions fig 4 a b although streamflow gradients tend to decline more along a southeast northwest trend as compared to precipitation which declines predominantly north to south for example annual amount weighted precipitation ranges from 8 in δ18o 59 in δ2h in the maritime provinces to below 28 in δ18o 221 in δ2h for the high arctic islands precipitation isotope distributions reflect gradients in latitude mean annual temperature rainout history and moisture recycling as noted in previous studies froehlich et al 2002 gibson et al 2005 birks and gibson 2009 maps showing net differences between precipitation isotope ratios δp and streamflow isotope ratios δstr fig 5 a and b highlight the degree of offset between the isotopic ratios of inputs to the hydrologic system versus outflows δ δp δstr mainly reflecting post precipitation modification by catchment processes but also incorporating prediction uncertainty for isotopes in precipitation as shown differentials demark a series of longitudinal corridors across the continent most notably identifying positive differentials orange red colours in mountainous western cordillera watersheds across parts of regions 7 10 and negative differentials blue colours in the central prairies to the southwest and west of hudson bay regions 5 and 6 the maritime provinces region 1 are shown to be close to zero offset whereas watersheds draining to the pacific ocean region 8 the central prairie arctic corridor across parts of regions 5 7 10 and most pre cambrian shield areas of ontario and quebec regions 3 and 4 have slightly negative offsets i e streamflow is somewhat enriched relative to precipitation which is expected where evaporative modification of streamflow is occurring during the precipitation to discharge transition snow sublimation and snow redistribution may also contribute to increase in isotope ratios compared to precipitation input feng et al 2002 ala aho et al 2017 we attribute pronounced positive offsets to poor performance of the delavau model although minor positive offsets observed in some maritime watersheds may arise from evaporation into humid oceanic air masses where isotopic enrichment of surface waters occurs along high slope evaporation lines see gibson et al 2016b poor performance of the delavau model may be attributable to lack of representative precipitation stations in the training dataset in western cordillera watersheds leading to systematic overestimation of isotope ratios in the higher elevation bands of these watersheds while unconfirmed this explanation for positive δ values is supported by previous studies that have shown orographic related errors in isotope climate models to be a cause for systematic underestimation of isotope ratios in proportion to the coarseness of the horizontal resolution of the model sturm et al 2005 one other explanation discussed later is that pre contemporary sources of water such as permafrost thaw or glacial melt are influencing the isotopic ratios in these systems deuterium excess in streamflow was also calculated from eq 1 as it is a commonly used indicator of deviation from the global meteoric water line gmwl note that there is a close similarity between the slope of the canadian meteoric water line cmwl defined by gibson et al 2005 and the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 although canadian precipitation is known to have a slightly lower intercept d 8 5 as compared to the global dataset d 10 positive d excess values are shown to be typical for streamflow on both the east and west coasts of canada indicating reduced offset from the cmwl and gmwl fig 6 a this is consistent with d 7 51 reported for rivers across the united states kendall and coplen 2001 negative d excess values are noted for the central prairies and central northwest territories regions 5 6 and 7 where d excess in streamflow ranged from 1 04 to 5 49 indicating that rivers contained a significant proportion of evaporated water mainly drainage from lakes and wetlands which typically have higher isotope ratios due to prevalence of open water evaporation losses gibson et al 2016a b based on prior assessments of cnip data gibson et al 2005 birks and gibson 2009 and observing the limited range in variability of local meteoric water lines lmwls across canada fig 6b we do not attribute a substantial portion of the large scale d excess signal in streamflow to evaporation from rain droplets or other sub cloud precipitation processes although this effect may be locally important peng et al 2007 dual isotope crossplots provide comparisons between 2h and 18o for all streamflow data fig 7 a arithmetic station means fig 7b and flow weighted station means fig 7c along with various reference lines see also table 3 we include the u s rivers line based on regression of station arithmetic mean values kendall and coplen 2001 but they do not provide a similar flow weighted equivalent we derive the canadian rivers line crl based on flow weighted station means values 6 δ2h 7 89 δ18o 0 45 r2 0 962 n 161 which diverges from the unweighted linear regression of station arithmetic means 7 δ2h 8 12 δ18o 3 81 r2 0 957 n 331 and unweighted linear regression of all streamflow data 8 δ2h 7 88 δ18o 0 200 r2 0 958 n 4603 as noted by kendall and coplen 2001 for streamflow across the u s we find that regression lines through regional streamflow data show an imbricate pattern overlapping the gmwl or cmwl fig 8 however use of the term meteoric water line with reference to these river regressions by kendall and coplen 2001 may potentially be misleading or confusing as this term is more correctly reserved for precipitation given known differences arising as water passes through the catchment along the precipitation to discharge transition gibson et al 2002 instead recognizing that different hydrologic processes influence rrls as compared to mwls we propose to define river regressions as regional river lines rrl and further differentiate rrls based on flow weighted station data rrlfw and those based on simple arithmetic means rrlam it is suggested that specific non redundant terminology is required to enable regional inter comparison of rrls and while unproven for potential use of such metrics in future for monitoring hydrologic impacts from land use or climatic changes at the basin scale a good example of potential hydrological information embedded in the slope and intercepts of rrls is provided for the pan artic rivers by yi et al 2012 who illustrate a strong inverse correlation between wetland area and rrlfw slopes for the six largest basins draining to the arctic ocean which is attributed to the importance of open water evaporation losses as well as rrl gmwl intercepts which ably capture variations in basinal precipitation source regions yi et al 2009 describe variations in rrlfw across the mackenzie basin and similarly identify evaporation mixing conditions in tributary sub basins as the main control on rrlfw slopes and intercepts for canada we illustrate variation of rrls across the hydrometric regions from the current survey documenting that regression slopes range from 4 34 to 9 31 and intercepts range from 54 to 24 table 3 in particulat our results confirm the importance of flow weighting to obtain representative trends in highly seasonal environments as canada is predominantly a nival regime flow weighting increases the slope of the rrl in 6 of 10 regions due to increased weighting of snowmelt induced discharge with high d excess relative to summer discharge the latter of which typically includes convective precipitation sources or surface water from hydrologic storage that is evaporatively enriched with lower d excess in mountainous regions regions 8 and 9 flow weighting appears to reduce the slope of the rrl possibly due to reduced influence of glacier meltwater which may dominate during lower flow summer periods 4 2 seasonal patterns variations in the isotopic composition of streamflow are summarized to highlight basic characteristics across the various hydrometric regions table 4 caution is advised when interpreting relative differences between hydrometric regions due to differences in the number of stations and samples collected at each station as well as the time period and seasonality of samples retrieved from each station and region while typical seasonal amplitude in streamflow composition ranged from 4 to 10 in δ18o 29 70 in δ2h some river stations exhibited variability above 12 in δ18o 90 in δ2h typical seasonal amplitude of δ18o in precipitation across canada as described by birks and gibson 2009 was 6 12 in δ18o 40 to 60 in δ2h for typical maritime stations e g truro nova scotia and saturna british columbia whereas northern stations e g eureka northwest territories and inuvik nunavut often exceeded 20 in δ18o 140 in δ2h damping of the seasonal signal in rivers is attributed to mixing with soil water groundwater and surface water storages allowing blending of temporal variations as well as dominance of indirect runoff pathways of precipitation and recharge see gibson et al 2016a smith et al 2015 stadnyk et al 2013 examples of high amplitude variation in isotopic composition of streamflow can be found in region 5 including river tributaries across the prairies such as the red river which are prone to annual flooding due to factors such as lengthy duration of snow accumulation heavy snowpacks poorly draining soils antecedent soil moisture conditions prevalence of rain on snow and tendency toward late break up and ice jam flooding stadnyk et al 2015b during flood stage the red river often resembles a series of lakes rather than a river and is in fact coined red lake by locals during such periods sources may differ significantly from normal or quiescent periods of flow due to the entrainment of snowmelt event rainfall and wetland lake storage which becomes imprinted with an evaporative enrichment signal another example of a high amplitude river is baker creek near yellowknife northwest territories region 7 which is a boreal shield watershed characterized by a periodically disconnected chain of hundreds of small lakes the contrast between flow derived from freshet driven depleted snowmelt signatures and lower streamflow during summer periods fed by enriched ponded surface waters exposed to evaporation is the main driver of isotopic variability gibson and reid 2010 many of the stations with reduced isotopic variability i e 1 5 in δ18o and 10 in δ2h are located downstream of large lakes or dams examples include the lesser slave river alberta region 7 cowichan river bc region 8 and great bear river northwest territories region 10 these stations display less variable isotopic signals due to the temporal dampening effect of upstream lake storage this effect has also been found to extend into ice on periods in large rivers as preserved in the isotopic composition of congelation ice forming ice cover on the mackenzie river downstream of great slave lake gibson and prowse 1999 and explains the large contrast averaging 4 1 in δ18o reported between the liard and mackenzie rivers near fort simpson krouse and mackay 1971 similar lake effects have been described below lake winnipeg on the nelson river system which is isotopically enriched in clear contrast to the burntwood river tributary fed by the churchill river system smith et al 2015 in dual isotope space seasonal variation in the isotopic signatures of streamflow are shown for selected rivers in each hydrometric region fig 9 these are so named time series river lines tsrls which we define as the regression through water samples collected in a time series at individual river stations tsrl slopes range from 5 54 to 7 61 across the canadian network with intercepts ranging from 42 9 to 2 8 table 3 while river regression lines rrls can be qualitatively useful for illustrating and comparing evaporative imprints and tributary mixing signatures in relation to meteoric sources it is important to recognize that different regression approaches i e figs 7 9 yield different results we suggest caution be used when selecting a regression approach for comparison of spatial or seasonal patterns by graphical inspection it appears that there is satisfactory similarity between rrl regression approaches for the canadian network i e all data rrlam and rrlfw such that any consistent approach may be useful as a first approximation indicator for regional inter comparison fig 10 although use of rrlfw are certainly better justified for quantification as we conclude from the analysis of lc excess later on in discussion in general for rrls the offset from meteoric sources along such lines can be progressive from headwaters to mouth or can be punctuated by periodic reversals as tributary inputs along a main river stem can have higher or lower isotope ratios depending on tributary sub basin characteristics and water balance informative descriptions of synoptic evolution of river water for the nelson and mackenzie rivers are provided by smith et al 2015 and yi et al 2009 respectively conceptually the isotope river continuum model of gat 2010 postulates that d excess rather than isotope ratios record the amount of evaporated water progressing downstream along a river reach and so should be employed for cumulative quantification of evaporation we emphasize that tsrls are distinct from rrls in that they capture temporal seasonal variation at single stations we did not evaluate the effect of sampling frequency or duration in determining tsrls although these factors are likely influential particularly for seasonal cold regions systems such as canada 4 3 deuterium excess lc excess and lc excess additional approaches for quantifying differences between meteoric waters were also evaluated including d excess lc excess and lc excess table 3 the d excess d for the entire unweighted streamflow dataset was found to average close to 2 01 as compared to 8 5 for the cmwl and 7 51 for a like sized streamflow dataset 4800 from across the united states kendall and coplen 2001 we note that a clear imprint of evaporation losses is present in streamflow across canada as compared to precipitation and evaporation losses appear to be systematically higher than across the united states presumably due to greater abundance of surface water including lakes wetlands rivers and shallow permafrost which promotes near surface moisture storage in over 50 of the country we also note that d excess in streamflow of the southern canadian prairies region matches well with the northern us states of montana north dakota and minnesota from examining geographical variations in d excess at flow weighted stations across canada fig 6a we confirm that most areas with low d excess occur in seasonally arid regions of the continental interior consistent with areas of high evaporation losses denhartog and ferguson 1978 in fact only the maritimes region 1 and st lawrence region 2 were found to have d excess values in excess of 8 5 which defines the cmwl the lc excess and lc excess were also calculated for the crl as well as various rrls and tsrls in order to establish differences from the cmwl and the lmwl based on the model of delavau et al 2015 table 3 the comparisons suggest that the crl is distinct from the cmwl by more than three times the analytical uncertainty except for regions 2 st lawrence and 3 northern quebec and labrador lc excess of all rrls and tsrls were found to be distinct from the cmwl based on lc excess from our most reliable flow weighted fw station dataset we find that rrls in regions 1 3 and 9 are apparently not distinct from their respective lmwls similar results are found using all data although ability to detect differences between rrls and the lmwls appear less reliable if based on arithmetic means am comparison between tsrls and lmwls yielded significant differences in regions 1 3 and 4 but we caution that this does not yield equivalent results in all regions compared to flow weighted rrls and so these descriptions are not interchangeable 4 4 flow water yield elevation and temperature regional variations are observed in river isotopic compositions in relation to mean daily river discharge annual water yield station elevation and mean annual air temperature fig 11 in general low flows are potentially highly variable while high flows in individual regions converge on the isotopic composition of specific sources typically rain or snowmelt dominated events fig 11a similar responses have been reported for the mackenzie basin rivers yi et al 2012 isotopic variations with long term water yield calculated from eq 5 are also systematic and regionally clustered and most regions with stronger snowmelt influence display negative correlations with water yield fig 11b isotopic separation between river water and precipitation δ18o is found to vary systematically with both elevation and mean annual air temperature maat fig 11c d in most cases river water was found to be enriched relative to precipitation i e δ18o 0 which is consistent with water balance processes modifying initial precipitation isotope signatures gibson et al 2002 as noted previously streamflow with lower isotope ratios than modelled precipitation resulting in positive anomalies in fig 5 i e δ18o 0 is predicted for about 20 of watersheds which is attributed mainly to precipitation prediction uncertainty but we postulate may also reflect augmentation of runoff by pre modern water sources such as permafrost thaw or glacial melt such waters may have originated from precipitation falling under cooler climate conditions and therefore may account for lower isotope ratios than modern precipitation a recent vulnerability assessment confirms widespread influence of permafrost thaw across 50 of canada spence et al 2019 and the influence of glacial melt is also well established castellazzi et al 2019 reflux of glaciogenic groundwaters in springs and seeps is also known to be occurring along some river courses such as the lower athabasca river grasby and chen 2005 gibson et al 2013 we postulate that these sources may be locally or regionally influential but cannot confirm this without further investigation we suggest that the national isotope dataset presented here may serve as a useful baseline for assessing climate change impacts in future studies as a baseline dataset the current study demonstrates potential for establishing an operational semi permanent network of streamflow measurements that that include both hydrometric gauging and isotopic measurements 1 to detect early evidence of climate change i e prior to changes in flow volume 2 to diagnose climate hydrologic response functions on a regional basis and 3 to protect canada s water resources through improved understanding of water sources vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies 4 5 limitations and challenges overall the water sampling and analysis program operated by water survey of canada was effective for compiling an initial canada wide dataset of 18o and 2h allowing visualization and comparison of spatial and temporal patterns in streamflow revealing high potential for applications such as source apportionment water balance assessment tributary mixing studies and residence time estimation from a descriptive standpoint terminology such as regional river lines rrls and time series river lines tsrls are introduced to distinguish river isotope trends from meteoric water lines mwls which is expected to assist in comparing cumulative isotopic signatures of evaporation loss that develop along river courses while useful for describing patterns in small to meso scale basins with uniform hydrologic regimes such indicators remain to be tested for tracking complex interactions arising from sub basin interaction within large river basins influences such as spatial density of sampling stations and temporal frequency of sampling on rrls remain to be tested also responsiveness of rrls to changes in interannual water balance conditions and sensitivity to climate changes and land use impacts remains to be verified although we demonstrate and visualize first order continental scale variations our mapping analysis based on simple kriging techniques remains to be rigorously tested and validated for individual basins and watersheds and future work is required to compare these outputs with predictions based on a range of hydrological models of greater complexity e g fekete et al 2006 bowen et al 2011 we anticipate that the national dataset will be especially useful as diagnostic variables for isotope capable distributed hydrological models stadnyk and holmes 2020 and can be readily integrated with the kendall and coplen 2001 dataset to allow a north american wide perspective gaps in the initial sampling program include lack of significant sampling or low frequency sampling in some regions in particular region 11 i e milk river watershed feeding the missouri and mississippi river system region 3 i e northern quebec and labrador and parts of region 10 i e the arctic islands we suggest there remains a clear need for establishing or increasing monitoring coverage in these areas further development or improvement of supporting networks that allow spatial and temporal characterization of streamflow sources such as precipitation snowpack groundwater wetlands and lakes is also warranted to provide additional isotopic constraints on the water cycle including capability for early climate change detection while basic spatial patterns of isotopes in precipitation are generally known from monitoring under cnip birks and gibson 2009 and usnip welker 2012 understanding of temporal variations is complicated by lack of real time continuous monitoring concurrent operation of precipitation and streamflow networks is a suggested future priority especially for better labelling of snowmelt events and large rainfall events including hurricanes and atmospheric rivers that tend to produce river flooding 5 conclusions and recommendations a multi year program to measure 18o and 2h from 4603 streamflow samples was performed at gauging stations across canada accounting for 56 of canada s drainage area and approximately 91 of long term discharge by volume isotope signatures in streamflow mimicked spatial patterns of precipitation with important differences attributed to water loss by evaporation but with possible influences of permafrost thaw glacial melt and glaciogenic groundwater input streamflow characteristically plotted on or below the canadian meteoric water line cmwl in bundles of regional river lines rrl along a range of regression slopes 4 34 9 31 and intercepts 54 to 24 we have defined a canadian rivers line crl based on the linear regression of flow weighted mean values of station data and we provide new terminology to describe the various approaches used in constructing rrls and tsrls recommendations include long term support from the water survey of canada to integrate isotope sampling within the canadian hydrometric program on an ongoing basis gap areas and in particular the arctic region 10 should be re considered as they represent a critical climate sensitive region and possibly a missed opportunity for early detection of climate change impacts the application of δ18o and δ2h would be useful for quantification of key water balance indicators including evaporation inflow e i and transpiration evapotranspiration t et and tracing of mean baseflow ages or young water fractions which are near term objective of ongoing research such isotope based indicators derived at the national scale will also provide important context for detailed numerical modelling studies in small to mesoscale basins using isotope enabled water balance models such studies have demonstrated that hydrologic calibration in data sparse areas such as canada can significantly benefit from the addition of isotopes as a compliment to traditional streamflow based metrics stadnyk and holmes 2020 one significant limitation on the use of isotope based methods in canada including interpretation of this dataset is the lack of concurrent operation of a canadian precipitation isotope network which needs to be pursued as a national scientific priority the canadian hydrologic community may benefit considerably from the additional mass balance constraints offered through isotopic characterization but this will also require a concerted effort towards improved monitoring efforts as well as education and training within and among the hydrology community support for isotope hydrology courses accessible to professionals and students across

diversity of climatic and hydrologic settings due to limited resources the density of hydrometric and climatic monitoring stations in canada has long fallen short of world meteorological organization wmo guidelines particularly in remote northern areas coulibaly et al 2013 prowse 1990 recent network reductions since the 1990s have further exacerbated the situation complicating monitoring of runoff variability and requiring innovative approaches to be explored for prediction in ungauged basins spence et al 2007 while coverage and frequency of monitoring may be significantly augmented in future through technical advances such as satellite radar altimetry coss et al 2020 crétaux et al 2017 other strategies such as incorporation of stable isotope tracers have also been shown to offer added value for hydrologic monitoring and prediction rank et al 1998 kendall and coplen 2001 gibson et al 2002 vitvar et al 2007 halder et al 2015 isotopes potentially offer a sharper focus on the underlying causes of water cycle variability as they permit labelling and tracking of individual streamflow sources and mixing as well as quantification of evaporation water balance and water residence times thus providing indicators useful for climate and land use change attribution gibson et al 2005 birks and gibson 2009 most recently the emergence of isotope capable predictive hydrological models has created additional incentive and opportunity for incorporation of isotope tracers within regional and global river networks as diagnostic or calibration variables to improve process representation fekete et al 2006 stadnyk et al 2013 smith et al 2016 belachew et al 2016 in canada isotopes in streamflow were first surveyed at the national scale by brown et al 1971 during 1967 1969 while 2h alone was measured the study revealed that spatial trends were broadly consistent with known variations in canadian precipitation fritz 1981 also in 1969 a summer survey of 18o but not 2h was conducted along rivers in the mackenzie river basin by hitchon and krouse 1972 who attributed variations to differences in evaporation during precipitation and runoff mook 1982 was the first to report on time series variations in 18o in the mackenzie river a number of subsequent regional studies used both 18o and 2h to examine large river basins in canada including the fraser cameron et al 1995 mackenzie gibson et al 2002 2005 st amour et al 2005 cooper et al 2008 yi et al 2009 2012 st lawrence telmer and veizer 2000 rosa et al 2016 and nelson ferguson and veizer 2007 ferguson et al 2007 smith et al 2015 these studies were mostly supported by the water survey of canada wsc and provincial partners and involved systematic water sampling at established gauging stations several other recent assessments have also been carried out extending beyond the wsc networks but targeting specific regions of interest e g muskoka river james et al 2019 okanagan valley wassenaar et al 2011 surgeon river england 2017 grand river stadnyk et al 2015a red river stadnyk et al 2015b in 2013 the wsc funded operation of an inaugural national water sampling program for 18o and 2h at river flow gauging stations across most of the country results from the first phase of its operation 2013 2019 are presented here along with preliminary analyses of canada wide trends the objectives of this paper are to present a description of the spatial and temporal variations of 18o and 2h measured in river discharge across canada in comparison with existing surveys of precipitation and surface waters we also illustrate variations with flow water yield altitude and mean annual air temperature and provide preliminary analysis of major controlling factors as well as introducing new terminology to describe observed relationships in δ18o δ2h space a companion article in data in brief which contains over 10 000 isotopic measurements is provided to facilitate access by researchers and stakeholders to the entire dataset gibson et al 2020 this study is novel in terms of its scale and comprehensiveness including streamflow gauging stations across most hydrometric regions of canada as selected by water survey of canada leadership based on environmental and stakeholder priorities fig 1 as a baseline national dataset for canada similar to that of kendall and coplen 2001 for the united states we anticipate this will provide regional and national context for local hydroclimate studies hydrograph separation analysis and water balance investigations using isotopic tracers as well as providing the first integrated multi year description of isotope variations in river discharge across northern north america based on review of historical datasets as well as first hand experience with numerous regional surveys and lake monitoring networks across canada gibson et al 2016a 2016b 2017 2018 2019 our hypothesis at the outset was that isotopic variations in streamflow would largely mimic patterns in precipitation in humid coastal areas but would potentially be modified in continental areas due to contributions from evaporated source waters running off from wetlands and lakes by glacial melt sources in mountainous areas and during snowmelt and storm events by storage and lag effects these early assertions are discussed later on in the results and discussion including comparisons with similar surveys in the united states precipitation isotope data and descriptions and discussion of underlying water cycling processes on a region by region basis 2 background stable isotopes naturally occurring stable isotope tracers have been increasingly utilized in hydrological and climatological research owing to their potential to provide insight into underlying processes that control variability in the water cycle gibson et al 2005 stable isotopes of importance include oxygen 18 18o oxygen 17 17o and deuterium 2h which are incorporated within the water molecule to form isotopologues h2 18o h2 17o 1h2h16o they provide embedded signals of sources mixing selection and numerous fractionating processes including condensation sublimation diffusion evaporation in air and freezing fractionation produces a natural isotope labelling effect within the global water cycle that has been applied to quantify the responsible mechanism s note that samples for 17o were archived but not measured in the initial phase of this program but it is anticipated that these will provide similar or complimentary information to 18o see angert et al 2004 li et al 2015 processes controlling stable isotope composition have been described previously by rosa et al 2016 and include the superimposed effects of recharge evaporation ice formation snowmelt and mixing processes in canada strong seasonal fluctuations in isotopic composition are common for rivers yi et al 2009 2012 smith et al 2015 rosa et al 2016 driven by heavy isotope depleted runoff during the snowmelt period and heavy isotope enrichment during the ice free period the latter being related to evaporation both from the river and from inherited sources such as lakes and wetlands st amour et al 2005 gibson et al 2016a long term baseflow signatures are often reflective of basin water balance gibson et al 1993 stadnyk et al 2015a as well as groundwater mixing and water residence time controls and so may be useful for estimating water age kirchner 2016 jasechko et al 2016 or quantifying tributary mixing krouse and mackay 1971 under ice discharge in winter is predominantly of groundwater origin and so often corresponds to the isotopic composition of long term precipitation input sources gibson and prowse 2002 a comprehensive discussion of river isotope controls was provided in reviews by fritz 1981 and gat 2010 the latter including a conceptual isotope framework called the isotope river continuum model 3 method 3 1 study sites eleven geographic regions are monitored by the wsc encompassing a range of hydroclimatic settings fig 1 in consultation with wsc leadership 331 hydrometric stations were selected from the current operational network to establish representative coverage across key areas of these regions fig 2a the temporal frequency of sampling ranged from 1 to 12 times per year with schedules constrained by the frequency of visits by hydrotechnical staff a core network of 161 stations was maintained that had more than 12 samples collected for isotopic analysis during 2013 2019 and that had concurrent discharge data to facilitate flow weighting of the isotopic signatures fig 2b monitoring summaries are provided by hydrometric region and by province tables 1 and 2 areal coverage varied regionally between province territory and hydrometric region due to site accessibility logistical issues and budget constraints a significant portion of region 10 arctic islands and the entirety of region 11 missouri mississippi were not included in the phase 1

hdpe bottles during regular visits to wsc streamflow gauging stations and returned to innotech s isotope lab in victoria for analysis of 18o and 2h by isotope ratio mass spectrometry a dual inlet thermofisher scientific isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v interfaced with a gasbench peripheral for oxygen 18 and h device peripheral for deuterium was used for isotopic analysis for oxygen 18 and deuterium samples were run using the methods described in paul and skrzypek 2006 and brand et al 1996 respectively with normalization of results on the v smow scale based on the approach of nelson 2000 analytical uncertainty estimated based on 1 standard deviation of repeats 1 σ was 0 07 for δ18o n 382 and 0 26 for δ2h n 450 additional details on sampling analyses and access to the full dataset are available from gibson et al 2020 3 3 statistical analyses both arithmetic and flow weighted means were calculated for the isotopic dataset arithmetic means or average values represent the quantity obtained by summing two or more isotopic measurements and then dividing by the number of measurements these values were calculated for both 18o and 2h at 331 stations across canada and do not account for variations in flow rates recorded amongst sampling events flow weighted means were calculated as the dot or scalar product of the sequence of isotopic values and daily flow rate pairs measured at each gauging station divided by the average flow flow weighted means were calculated for both δ18o and δ2h at 161 stations that had at least 12 isotope flow pairs flow weighted mean values are representative of the overall volumetric discharge dual isotope relationships were also applied to describe spatial and temporal variations within the dataset we introduce the term time series river line tsrl which we define as the linear regression of δ2h and δ18o collected over time at an individual river station tsrls were calculated and are plotted in δ18o δ2h space for selected stations to illustrate seasonal variability across the network we introduce the term regional river line rrl which we define as the linear regression of all δ2h and δ18o time series data from multiple stations rivers within a defined region similarly we introduce the term rrlam to indicate an rrl using station based arithmetic mean values and rrlfw to indicate an rrl using station based flow weighted mean values note that only significant trends p 0 05 are reported herein deuterium excess d in streamflow was calculated from the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope dataset using the formulation of dansgaard 1964 1 d δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o where d 10 defines the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 and d 8 5 defines the canadian meteoric water line gibson et al 2005 we also estimate line conditioned excess lc excess for river lines landwehr and coplen 2006 2 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b where a is the slope and b is the intercept of the mwl to evaluate distinction of regional river trends from both the canadian meteoric water line cmwl of gibson et al 2005 and local meteoric water lines lmwl estimated for each hydrometric region using the model of delavau et al 2015 for rivers sampled in this study we note measurement uncertainty 1 σ to be 3 σ 0 25 2 a 0 07 2 0 5 where a is the slope of the tsrl or rrl note that 1 σ for both the lmwl and cmwl are estimated to be 1 34 based on presumed historical measurement uncertainty in δ18o 0 1 and δ2h 1 across canadian isotope laboratories over the past 60 years the scaled line conditioned excess lc excess can then be derived to evaluate whether the data are distinct from meteoric water landwehr and coplen 2006 4 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b σ where a and b in our assessment are based on either the cmwl a 8 b 8 5 or regionally variable lmwl parameters note that water yield wy is calculated from 5 w y q w a 1000 mm where q is stream discharge m3 s and wa is watershed area m2 3 4 interpolation and mapping gridded 32 km monthly climate data 1981 2001 including precipitation amount and 2 m air temperature were extracted from the north america regional reanalysis mesinger et al 2006 isotope composition of monthly precipitation was estimated based on the model of delavau et al 2015 for all narr coordinates falling within the canadian landmass amount weighted annual values were calculated as the dot product of the sequence of monthly isotopic values and precipitation amounts divided by the total precipitation annual air temperature was calculated as the arithmetic mean of monthly air temperatures for calculating basin weighted averages all grid centered narr datapoints falling within the watershed were arithmetically averaged note that annual water yield was calculated from gauging records at flow weighted stations and only these stations were used for mapping the isotopic composition of 18o and 2h in streamflow likewise for plotting deuterium excess d excess and differences between isotopic composition of streamflow and precipitation δ18o δ2h only stations reporting both precipitation isotope data and flow weighted streamflow isotope data were used all mapping was carried out in arcmap using kriging interpolation applying a nearest neighbours n 12 approach for the purpose of continental scale visualization note that stream network interpolation approaches similar to those used by fekete et al 2006 or bowen et al 2011 based on distributed models were not tested at this stage for mapping or comparison of streamflow and precipitation acknowledging that application of a range of such models of intermediate or high complexity might be forthcoming based on open access to the full dataset gibson et al 2020 uncertainty in isotope in precipitation modelling was discussed by delavau et al 2015 who demonstrated confidence bounds for δ18o signatures across canada for stations where canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip data with sufficiently long records were available it should be noted that δ2h was not part of their assessment however we examined uncertainty in the modelled deuterium composition of precipitation relative to the long term cnip stations and found similar uncertainty bands as reported for δ18o with no significant anomalies detected on a monthly long term basis 4 results and discussion 4 1 regional patterns spatial variations in isotopes in streamflow across canada are illustrated from flow weighted values of δ18o and δ2h which show distinct spatial patterns that correspond to known climatic patterns fig 3 a b respectively for example flow weighted streamflow ranges in δ18o δ2h from 8 54 59 3 for the terra nova river in newfoundland maritime to 23 41 182 0 for the root river northwest territories arctic areas draining to the pacific ocean west of the western cordillera display systematic increases in isotope ratios from mountainous regions toward the coast with the highest ratios most enriched measured for the cowichan river on vancouver island 10 44 and 74 39 in δ18o and δ2h respectively and lowest ratios most depleted for the columbia river at donald 19 30 and 146 6 in δ18o and δ2h respectively spatial patterns and organization are broadly consistent with isotope ratios of δ18o and δ2h for annual precipitation for most regions fig 4 a b although streamflow gradients tend to decline more along a southeast northwest trend as compared to precipitation which declines predominantly north to south for example annual amount weighted precipitation ranges from 8 in δ18o 59 in δ2h in the maritime provinces to below 28 in δ18o 221 in δ2h for the high arctic islands precipitation isotope distributions reflect gradients in latitude mean annual temperature rainout history and moisture recycling as noted in previous studies froehlich et al 2002 gibson et al 2005 birks and gibson 2009 maps showing net differences between precipitation isotope ratios δp and streamflow isotope ratios δstr fig 5 a and b highlight the degree of offset between the isotopic ratios of inputs to the hydrologic system versus outflows δ δp δstr mainly reflecting post precipitation modification by catchment processes but also incorporating prediction uncertainty for isotopes in precipitation as shown differentials demark a series of longitudinal corridors across the continent most notably identifying positive differentials orange red colours in mountainous western cordillera watersheds across parts of regions 7 10 and negative differentials blue colours in the central prairies to the southwest and west of hudson bay regions 5 and 6 the maritime provinces region 1 are shown to be close to zero offset whereas watersheds draining to the pacific ocean region 8 the central prairie arctic corridor across parts of regions 5 7 10 and most pre cambrian shield areas of ontario and quebec regions 3 and 4 have slightly negative offsets i e streamflow is somewhat enriched relative to precipitation which is expected where evaporative modification of streamflow is occurring during the precipitation to discharge transition snow sublimation and snow redistribution may also contribute to increase in isotope ratios compared to precipitation input feng et al 2002 ala aho et al 2017 we attribute pronounced positive offsets to poor performance of the delavau model although minor positive offsets observed in some maritime watersheds may arise from evaporation into humid oceanic air masses where isotopic enrichment of surface waters occurs along high slope evaporation lines see gibson et al 2016b poor performance of the delavau model may be attributable to lack of representative precipitation stations in the training dataset in western cordillera watersheds leading to systematic overestimation of isotope ratios in the higher elevation bands of these watersheds while unconfirmed this explanation for positive δ values is supported by previous studies that have shown orographic related errors in isotope climate models to be a cause for systematic underestimation of isotope ratios in proportion to the coarseness of the horizontal resolution of the model sturm et al 2005 one other explanation discussed later is that pre contemporary sources of water such as permafrost thaw or glacial melt are influencing the isotopic ratios in these systems deuterium excess in streamflow was also calculated from eq 1 as it is a commonly used indicator of deviation from the global meteoric water line gmwl note that there is a close similarity between the slope of the canadian meteoric water line cmwl defined by gibson et al 2005 and the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 although canadian precipitation is known to have a slightly lower intercept d 8 5 as compared to the global dataset d 10 positive d excess values are shown to be typical for streamflow on both the east and west coasts of canada indicating reduced offset from the cmwl and gmwl fig 6 a this is consistent with d 7 51 reported for rivers across the united states kendall and coplen 2001 negative d excess values are noted for the central prairies and central northwest territories regions 5 6 and 7 where d excess in streamflow ranged from 1 04 to 5 49 indicating that rivers contained a significant proportion of evaporated water mainly drainage from lakes and wetlands which typically have higher isotope ratios due to prevalence of open water evaporation losses gibson et al 2016a b based on prior assessments of cnip data gibson et al 2005 birks and gibson 2009 and observing the limited range in variability of local meteoric water lines lmwls across canada fig 6b we do not attribute a substantial portion of the large scale d excess signal in streamflow to evaporation from rain droplets or other sub cloud precipitation processes although this effect may be locally important peng et al 2007 dual isotope crossplots provide comparisons between 2h and 18o for all streamflow data fig 7 a arithmetic station means fig 7b and flow weighted station means fig 7c along with various reference lines see also table 3 we include the u s rivers line based on regression of station arithmetic mean values kendall and coplen 2001 but they do not provide a similar flow weighted equivalent we derive the canadian rivers line crl based on flow weighted station means values 6 δ2h 7 89 δ18o 0 45 r2 0 962 n 161 which diverges from the unweighted linear regression of station arithmetic means 7 δ2h 8 12 δ18o 3 81 r2 0 957 n 331 and unweighted linear regression of all streamflow data 8 δ2h 7 88 δ18o 0 200 r2 0 958 n 4603 as noted by kendall and coplen 2001 for streamflow across the u s we find that regression lines through regional streamflow data show an imbricate pattern overlapping the gmwl or cmwl fig 8 however use of the term meteoric water line with reference to these river regressions by kendall and coplen 2001 may potentially be misleading or confusing as this term is more correctly reserved for precipitation given known differences arising as water passes through the catchment along the precipitation to discharge transition gibson et al 2002 instead recognizing that different hydrologic processes influence rrls as compared to mwls we propose to define river regressions as regional river lines rrl and further differentiate rrls based on flow weighted station data rrlfw and those based on simple arithmetic means rrlam it is suggested that specific non redundant terminology is required to enable regional inter comparison of rrls and while unproven for potential use of such metrics in future for monitoring hydrologic impacts from land use or climatic changes at the basin scale a good example of potential hydrological information embedded in the slope and intercepts of rrls is provided for the pan artic rivers by yi et al 2012 who illustrate a strong inverse correlation between wetland area and rrlfw slopes for the six largest basins draining to the arctic ocean which is attributed to the importance of open water evaporation losses as well as rrl gmwl intercepts which ably capture variations in basinal precipitation source regions yi et al 2009 describe variations in rrlfw across the mackenzie basin and similarly identify evaporation mixing conditions in tributary sub basins as the main control on rrlfw slopes and intercepts for canada we illustrate variation of rrls across the hydrometric regions from the current survey documenting that regression slopes range from 4 34 to 9 31 and intercepts range from 54 to 24 table 3 in particulat our results confirm the importance of flow weighting to obtain representative trends in highly seasonal environments as canada is predominantly a nival regime flow weighting increases the slope of the rrl in 6 of 10 regions due to increased weighting of snowmelt induced discharge with high d excess relative to summer discharge the latter of which typically includes convective precipitation sources or surface water from hydrologic storage that is evaporatively enriched with lower d excess in mountainous regions regions 8 and 9 flow weighting appears to reduce the slope of the rrl possibly due to reduced influence of glacier meltwater which may dominate during lower flow summer periods 4 2 seasonal patterns variations in the isotopic composition of streamflow are summarized to highlight basic characteristics across the various hydrometric regions table 4 caution is advised when interpreting relative differences between hydrometric regions due to differences in the number of stations and samples collected at each station as well as the time period and seasonality of samples retrieved from each station and region while typical seasonal amplitude in streamflow composition ranged from 4 to 10 in δ18o 29 70 in δ2h some river stations exhibited variability above 12 in δ18o 90 in δ2h typical seasonal amplitude of δ18o in precipitation across canada as described by birks and gibson 2009 was 6 12 in δ18o 40 to 60 in δ2h for typical maritime stations e g truro nova scotia and saturna british columbia whereas northern stations e g eureka northwest territories and inuvik nunavut often exceeded 20 in δ18o 140 in δ2h damping of the seasonal signal in rivers is attributed to mixing with soil water groundwater and surface water storages allowing blending of temporal variations as well as dominance of indirect runoff pathways of precipitation and recharge see gibson et al 2016a smith et al 2015 stadnyk et al 2013 examples of high amplitude variation in isotopic composition of streamflow can be found in region 5 including river tributaries across the prairies such as the red river which are prone to annual flooding due to factors such as lengthy duration of snow accumulation heavy snowpacks poorly draining soils antecedent soil moisture conditions prevalence of rain on snow and tendency toward late break up and ice jam flooding stadnyk et al 2015b during flood stage the red river often resembles a series of lakes rather than a river and is in fact coined red lake by locals during such periods sources may differ significantly from normal or quiescent periods of flow due to the entrainment of snowmelt event rainfall and wetland lake storage which becomes imprinted with an evaporative enrichment signal another example of a high amplitude river is baker creek near yellowknife northwest territories region 7 which is a boreal shield watershed characterized by a periodically disconnected chain of hundreds of small lakes the contrast between flow derived from freshet driven depleted snowmelt signatures and lower streamflow during summer periods fed by enriched ponded surface waters exposed to evaporation is the main driver of isotopic variability gibson and reid 2010 many of the stations with reduced isotopic variability i e 1 5 in δ18o and 10 in δ2h are located downstream of large lakes or dams examples include the lesser slave river alberta region 7 cowichan river bc region 8 and great bear river northwest territories region 10 these stations display less variable isotopic signals due to the temporal dampening effect of upstream lake storage this effect has also been found to extend into ice on periods in large rivers as preserved in the isotopic composition of congelation ice forming ice cover on the mackenzie river downstream of great slave lake gibson and prowse 1999 and explains the large contrast averaging 4 1 in δ18o reported between the liard and mackenzie rivers near fort simpson krouse and mackay 1971 similar lake effects have been described below lake winnipeg on the nelson river system which is isotopically enriched in clear contrast to the burntwood river tributary fed by the churchill river system smith et al 2015 in dual isotope space seasonal variation in the isotopic signatures of streamflow are shown for selected rivers in each hydrometric region fig 9 these are so named time series river lines tsrls which we define as the regression through water samples collected in a time series at individual river stations tsrl slopes range from 5 54 to 7 61 across the canadian network with intercepts ranging from 42 9 to 2 8 table 3 while river regression lines rrls can be qualitatively useful for illustrating and comparing evaporative imprints and tributary mixing signatures in relation to meteoric sources it is important to recognize that different regression approaches i e figs 7 9 yield different results we suggest caution be used when selecting a regression approach for comparison of spatial or seasonal patterns by graphical inspection it appears that there is satisfactory similarity between rrl regression approaches for the canadian network i e all data rrlam and rrlfw such that any consistent approach may be useful as a first approximation indicator for regional inter comparison fig 10 although use of rrlfw are certainly better justified for quantification as we conclude from the analysis of lc excess later on in discussion in general for rrls the offset from meteoric sources along such lines can be progressive from headwaters to mouth or can be punctuated by periodic reversals as tributary inputs along a main river stem can have higher or lower isotope ratios depending on tributary sub basin characteristics and water balance informative descriptions of synoptic evolution of river water for the nelson and mackenzie rivers are provided by smith et al 2015 and yi et al 2009 respectively conceptually the isotope river continuum model of gat 2010 postulates that d excess rather than isotope ratios record the amount of evaporated water progressing downstream along a river reach and so should be employed for cumulative quantification of evaporation we emphasize that tsrls are distinct from rrls in that they capture temporal seasonal variation at single stations we did not evaluate the effect of sampling frequency or duration in determining tsrls although these factors are likely influential particularly for seasonal cold regions systems such as canada 4 3 deuterium excess lc excess and lc excess additional approaches for quantifying differences between meteoric waters were also evaluated including d excess lc excess and lc excess table 3 the d excess d for the entire unweighted streamflow dataset was found to average close to 2 01 as compared to 8 5 for the cmwl and 7 51 for a like sized streamflow dataset 4800 from across the united states kendall and coplen 2001 we note that a clear imprint of evaporation losses is present in streamflow across canada as compared to precipitation and evaporation losses appear to be systematically higher than across the united states presumably due to greater abundance of surface water including lakes wetlands rivers and shallow permafrost which promotes near surface moisture storage in over 50 of the country we also note that d excess in streamflow of the southern canadian prairies region matches well with the northern us states of montana north dakota and minnesota from examining geographical variations in d excess at flow weighted stations across canada fig 6a we confirm that most areas with low d excess occur in seasonally arid regions of the continental interior consistent with areas of high evaporation losses denhartog and ferguson 1978 in fact only the maritimes region 1 and st lawrence region 2 were found to have d excess values in excess of 8 5 which defines the cmwl the lc excess and lc excess were also calculated for the crl as well as various rrls and tsrls in order to establish differences from the cmwl and the lmwl based on the model of delavau et al 2015 table 3 the comparisons suggest that the crl is distinct from the cmwl by more than three times the analytical uncertainty except for regions 2 st lawrence and 3 northern quebec and labrador lc excess of all rrls and tsrls were found to be distinct from the cmwl based on lc excess from our most reliable flow weighted fw station dataset we find that rrls in regions 1 3 and 9 are apparently not distinct from their respective lmwls similar results are found using all data although ability to detect differences between rrls and the lmwls appear less reliable if based on arithmetic means am comparison between tsrls and lmwls yielded significant differences in regions 1 3 and 4 but we caution that this does not yield equivalent results in all regions compared to flow weighted rrls and so these descriptions are not interchangeable 4 4 flow water yield elevation and temperature regional variations are observed in river isotopic compositions in relation to mean daily river discharge annual water yield station elevation and mean annual air temperature fig 11 in general low flows are potentially highly variable while high flows in individual regions converge on the isotopic composition of specific sources typically rain or snowmelt dominated events fig 11a similar responses have been reported for the mackenzie basin rivers yi et al 2012 isotopic variations with long term water yield calculated from eq 5 are also systematic and regionally clustered and most regions with stronger snowmelt influence display negative correlations with water yield fig 11b isotopic separation between river water and precipitation δ18o is found to vary systematically with both elevation and mean annual air temperature maat fig 11c d in most cases river water was found to be enriched relative to precipitation i e δ18o 0 which is consistent with water balance processes modifying initial precipitation isotope signatures gibson et al 2002 as noted previously streamflow with lower isotope ratios than modelled precipitation resulting in positive anomalies in fig 5 i e δ18o 0 is predicted for about 20 of watersheds which is attributed mainly to precipitation prediction uncertainty but we postulate may also reflect augmentation of runoff by pre modern water sources such as permafrost thaw or glacial melt such waters may have originated from precipitation falling under cooler climate conditions and therefore may account for lower isotope ratios than modern precipitation a recent vulnerability assessment confirms widespread influence of permafrost thaw across 50 of canada spence et al 2019 and the influence of glacial melt is also well established castellazzi et al 2019 reflux of glaciogenic groundwaters in springs and seeps is also known to be occurring along some river courses such as the lower athabasca river grasby and chen 2005 gibson et al 2013 we postulate that these sources may be locally or regionally influential but cannot confirm this without further investigation we suggest that the national isotope dataset presented here may serve as a useful baseline for assessing climate change impacts in future studies as a baseline dataset the current study demonstrates potential for establishing an operational semi permanent network of streamflow measurements that that include both hydrometric gauging and isotopic measurements 1 to detect early evidence of climate change i e prior to changes in flow volume 2 to diagnose climate hydrologic response functions on a regional basis and 3 to protect canada s water resources through improved understanding of water sources vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies 4 5 limitations and challenges overall the water sampling and analysis program operated by water survey of canada was effective for compiling an initial canada wide dataset of 18o and 2h allowing visualization and comparison of spatial and temporal patterns in streamflow revealing high potential for applications such as source apportionment water balance assessment tributary mixing studies and residence time estimation from a descriptive standpoint terminology such as regional river lines rrls and time series river lines tsrls are introduced to distinguish river isotope trends from meteoric water lines mwls which is expected to assist in comparing cumulative isotopic signatures of evaporation loss that develop along river courses while useful for describing patterns in small to meso scale basins with uniform hydrologic regimes such indicators remain to be tested for tracking complex interactions arising from sub basin interaction within large river basins influences such as spatial density of sampling stations and temporal frequency of sampling on rrls remain to be tested also responsiveness of rrls to changes in interannual water balance conditions and sensitivity to climate changes and land use impacts remains to be verified although we demonstrate and visualize first order continental scale variations our mapping analysis based on simple kriging techniques remains to be rigorously tested and validated for individual basins and watersheds and future work is required to compare these outputs with predictions based on a range of hydrological models of greater complexity e g fekete et al 2006 bowen et al 2011 we anticipate that the national dataset will be especially useful as diagnostic variables for isotope capable distributed hydrological models stadnyk and holmes 2020 and can be readily integrated with the kendall and coplen 2001 dataset to allow a north american wide perspective gaps in the initial sampling program include lack of significant sampling or low frequency sampling in some regions in particular region 11 i e milk river watershed feeding the missouri and mississippi river system region 3 i e northern quebec and labrador and parts of region 10 i e the arctic islands we suggest there remains a clear need for establishing or increasing monitoring coverage in these areas further development or improvement of supporting networks that allow spatial and temporal characterization of streamflow sources such as precipitation snowpack groundwater wetlands and lakes is also warranted to provide additional isotopic constraints on the water cycle including capability for early climate change detection while basic spatial patterns of isotopes in precipitation are generally known from monitoring under cnip birks and gibson 2009 and usnip welker 2012 understanding of temporal variations is complicated by lack of real time continuous monitoring concurrent operation of precipitation and streamflow networks is a suggested future priority especially for better labelling of snowmelt events and large rainfall events including hurricanes and atmospheric rivers that tend to produce river flooding 5 conclusions and recommendations a multi year program to measure 18o and 2h from 4603 streamflow samples was performed at gauging stations across canada accounting for 56 of canada s drainage area and approximately 91 of long term discharge by volume isotope signatures in streamflow mimicked spatial patterns of precipitation with important differences attributed to water loss by evaporation but with possible influences of permafrost thaw glacial melt and glaciogenic groundwater input streamflow characteristically plotted on or below the canadian meteoric water line cmwl in bundles of regional river lines rrl along a range of regression slopes 4 34 9 31 and intercepts 54 to 24 we have defined a canadian rivers line crl based on the linear regression of flow weighted mean values of station data and we provide new terminology to describe the various approaches used in constructing rrls and tsrls recommendations include long term support from the water survey of canada to integrate isotope sampling within the canadian hydrometric program on an ongoing basis gap areas and in particular the arctic region 10 should be re considered as they represent a critical climate sensitive region and possibly a missed opportunity for early detection of climate change impacts the application of δ18o and δ2h would be useful for quantification of key water balance indicators including evaporation inflow e i and transpiration evapotranspiration t et and tracing of mean baseflow ages or young water fractions which are near term objective of ongoing research such isotope based indicators derived at the national scale will also provide important context for detailed numerical modelling studies in small to mesoscale basins using isotope enabled water balance models such studies have demonstrated that hydrologic calibration in data sparse areas such as canada can significantly benefit from the addition of isotopes as a compliment to traditional streamflow based metrics stadnyk and holmes 2020 one significant limitation on the use of isotope based methods in canada including interpretation of this dataset is the lack of concurrent operation of a canadian precipitation isotope network which needs to be pursued as a national scientific priority the canadian hydrologic community may benefit considerably from the additional mass balance constraints offered through isotopic characterization but this will also require a concerted effort towards improved monitoring efforts as well as education and training within and among the hydrology community support for isotope hydrology courses accessible to professionals and students across

8313,study region the wami river basin in east central tanzania features the eastern arc mountains and dichotomous climate regimes study focus drought characteristics are vital in planning and managing water resources in river basins however the estimation of drought characteristics from the evapotranspiration deficit index etdi is susceptible to the uncertainty associated with alternative datasets from hydrological models and remote sensing images thus this study investigated scenario uncertainty in etdi based drought characteristics in the river basin using evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration data from a classical soil and water assessment tool swat and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images between the years 2000 and 2010 new hydrological insights the findings showed a substantial scenario uncertainty in drought duration severity and intensity at various locations in the river basin localized severe modis based overall drought intensity modis odi in the middle of the basin was attributed to prolonged low rainfall amounts in the downstream localized severe swat based overall drought intensity swat odi was attributed to an imperfection of the swat model in simulating the true hydrologic cycle of the river basin however at the basin level both swat odi and modis odi between the years 2000 and 2010 were moderate these findings can be used as the baseline information in improving drought estimation in the river basin moreover this study also demonstrates the importance of assessing scenario uncertainty in

anomaly keywords drought evapotranspiration deficit index modis scenario uncertainty swat wami river basin 1 introduction drought is a disaster caused by a significant decrease in water availability for a prolonged period currently many parts of the world face harsh drought conditions liu et al 2018 sheffield et al 2012 there are increasing frequency and severity of droughts in different geographical regions of the globe hassan et al 2014 khatiwada and pandey 2019 peter et al 2018 trambauer et al 2014 viste et al 2013 drought has been affecting human lives economic activities and various elements of the environment bayissa et al 2015 gebrehiwot et al 2011 as a result drought management initiatives are increasing and becoming globally important these initiatives intend to reduce the effects of drought through prevention and mitigation measures as well as preparedness bayissa et al 2015 however drought management initiatives have been affected by a lack of enough information about drought characteristics due to data scarcity this is because many drought indices use measured data from hydrological and meteorological monitoring networks in many parts of the world monitoring stations or gauges are not evenly distributed and in most cases few available records are too short have large missing gaps corrupt etc ndomba 2014 wambura et al 2017 thus some drought indices have been using simulated data and remote sensing data one of these indices is the evapotranspiration deficit index etdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 etdi uses actual evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet data from a distributed hydrological model or remote sensing images to obtained spatially distributed drought information in a river basin bayissa et al 2018 wambura and dietrich 2020 etdi estimates agricultural drought as a result of water availability for et simulated et and pet data from hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 pandey et al 2020 have been widely used in the computation of etdi bayissa et al 2018 esfahanian et al 2017 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 however hydrological models are known to have imperfect representations of reality despite their advantage in simulating continuous spatial distributed parameters knoche et al 2014 pandey et al 2019 sellami et al 2014 yen et al 2015 the imperfections normally originate from input data model structure and model parameter limitations teshager et al 2016 tumbo and hughes 2015 for example in large river systems 40 000 km2 the resolution of topography data and the demand for high computing faculties can limit the number of sub basins and hydrological response units in a swat model wambura et al 2018a b this usually leads to less dense spatially distributed information from a hydrological model recently readily available remotely sensed et and pet data have also been used to compute etdi wambura and dietrich 2020 this is because remotely sensed data captures spatial seasonal changes and long term trends globally consistent and in an economically feasible manner eswar et al 2013 kiptala et al 2013 one of the widely applied remotely sensed et products is from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis imagery program alemu et al 2014 deus and gloaguen 2013 ramoelo et al 2014 wambura et al 2017 however like simulated outputs from a swat model remotely sensing data especially from the modis program also suffers from errors associated with the whiskbroom design and the observation geometry of the modis satellites as well as registration of images duveiller et al 2015 thus causing wrong data values because different neighbouring physical areas can be mapped onto the same pixels moreover cloud cover can also lead to wrong data acquisition or missing data values mu et al 2011 yang et al 2015 although et and pet datasets from hydrological models and remote sensing images have errors from their productions this study focused on the uncertainty caused by their applications as alternative datasets in characterizing drought this is because in the absence of observed data drought information from any dataset cannot be validated thus drought uncertainty due to all available datasets should be considered in natural sciences including hydrology uncertainty has three dimensions namely source nature and type walker et al 2003 out of the three dimensions types of uncertainty are closely related to uncertainty assessment approaches the main types of uncertainty are recognized ignorance uncertainty qualitative uncertainty statistical uncertainty and scenario uncertainty refsgaard et al 2007 recognized ignorance uncertainty is the uncertainty that occurs where outcomes are not known because of accepted imperfect knowledge brown 2004 qualitative uncertainty is the uncertainty that occurs where all or some possible outcomes are known but only some of their probabilities are known refsgaard et al 2007 statistical uncertainty is any uncertainty that can be described adequately in statistical terms because all possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities are known or assumed known walker et al 2003 normally statistical uncertainty manifests in random inputs and parameters of hydrological models sellami et al 2014 yen et al 2015 scenario uncertainty occurs where possible outcomes do not have their corresponding probabilities in hydrological studies scenario uncertainty manifests itself where alternative datasets model structures parameterization approaches emissions scenarios etc are used to assess impacts hamel and bryant 2017 scenario uncertainty occurs because in most cases decisions leading to several alternatives are not related or are made by analysts project stakeholders organizations etc therefore it is not possible to formulate the probability of any one particular alternative occurring walker et al 2003 contrary to statistical uncertainty that has many quantification techniques quantification of scenario uncertainty is difficult because of a lack of probabilities it is worth noting that with only two alternatives available a comparison of the alternatives is the simplest and suitable approach for assessing scenario uncertainty in this study two pairs of et and pet data from the swat model and modis images were used to estimate etdis and eventually characterize swat based and modis based droughts in the wami river basin in tanzania since there were only two datasets available namely swat and modis datasets the manifested scenario uncertainty was assessed by comparing alternatives therefore this study demonstrated the assessment of scenario uncertainty that results from the use of more than one dataset in drought characterization in a river basin 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the wami river basin has an area of about 41 170 km2 the river basin is located between 5 00 7 27 s and 36 00 39 00 e in east central tanzania fig 1 the topography of the river basin ranges from 0 to 2360 m above sea level fig 1 the river basin is divided into two major parts by the eastern arc mountains eams which comprise the rubeho ukaguru nguru and nguu mountain ranges the predominant soils in the river basin are loam and sand clay loam soils fao isric 2003 the land use classes are predominantly bushland woodland and grassland fao 1997 the average rainfall in the river basin ranges between 692 and 1388 mm per annum wambura et al 2017 the basin has two major rainfall zones a unimodal rainfall zone with one heavy rainfall season from october to april in the upstream part and a bimodal rainfall zone in the downstream part the bimodal rainfall zone has two rainfall seasons a light rainfall season between october and december ond and a heavy rainfall season between march and may mam the average daily temperature in the river basin ranges between 24 and 31 c wambura et al 2018b the average et in the river basin ranges between 368 and 1614 mm per year wambura et al 2017 2 2 evapotranspiration datasets 2 2 1 swat based evapotranspiration dataset in this study a classical hydrological model used to obtain simulated et and pet data was the swat model for the wami river basin similar to the one developed by wambura et al 2018b this model was set up using a digital elevation model of 90 m resolution jarvis et al 2008 soil texture data at a scale of 1 2 000 000 fao isric 2003 and land cover types at a scale of 1 250 000 fao 1997 the model had 45 sub basins the climate data used were hybrids of temperature and precipitation data made up of observed data from the tanzania meteorological agency and wfdei reanalysis data wambura 2020 weedon et al 2014 water use abstractions from the wami ruvu basin water office were also included in the model wambura et al 2018b observed streamflow for model calibration and validation between the years 2000 and 2010 was obtained from the wami ruvu basin water office despite having missing records in the streamflow data the model was calibrated using about 60 of monthly streamflow at the 1g2 mandera gauging station and the remaining 40 was used for validation fig 1 before the model calibration 1000 parameter combinations were sampled from ranges estimated from the best simulation of the swat model in the study by wambura et al 2018b in this study model calibration and validation were evaluated using the coefficient of determination r² nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and half standard deviation hsd of observed flow the performances were considered satisfactory when r² nse and rmse were 0 50 0 65 and hsd respectively moriasi et al 2007 singh et al 2004 wambura et al 2018b from the model calibration the best simulation was satisfactory r² 0 81 nse 0 81 rmse 42 fig 2 a the r² nse and rmse of the validation hydrograph were also satisfactory fig 2a since the swat model had 45 sub basins therefore simulated et and pet data from the model s best simulation namely swat et and swat pet respectively constituted two sets each with 45 time series representing centroids of sub basins in the wami river basin the 45 centroids of sub basins are hereafter referred to as the 45 points 2 2 2 modis based evapotranspiration dataset the et and pet data from modis images modis et and modis pet respectively were obtained from the modis global et product known as mod16a2 version 5 product available at the spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 1 month mu et al 2011 the modis global et algorithm is based on the penman monteith equation fig 2b shows that the input data for the modis global et calculation were other modis products and meteorological reanalysis data the modis products were leaf area index land cover albedo and the fraction of photosynthetic absorbed radiation whereas meteorological reanalysis data included air pressure air temperature humidity and radiation mu et al 2011 fig 2b summarizes the modis global et generation process from the inputs to intermediate algorithm calculations and finally to the output et more details about this algorithm are found in the study by mu et al 2011 in this study 132 images of mod16a2 product spanning between the years 2000 and 2010 were downloaded from the modis repositories http files ntsg umt edu data accessed on 10 july 2019 then two sets namely modis et and modis pet each with 45 time series were extracted from modis images using the 45 points in the wami river basin 2 3 evapotranspiration deficit index the computations of the swat model based etdi swat etdi used swat et and swat pet dataset whereas modis images based etdi modis etdi used modis et and modis pet dataset to obtain consecutive monthly dry and wet conditions for the 45 points in the wami river basin the computation of etdi was a three step approach the first step involved the computation of water stress ws the second step involved the computation of water stress anomaly wsa and the final step the computation of etdi itself monthly swat based ws swat ws and modis based ws modis ws for each year at the 45 points in the river basin were computed using eq 1 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 ws ranged from 1 no et to 0 et equals pet where the subscript i represented a month in year j the subscript j spanned betweeen the years 2000 and 2010 1 w s i j 1 e t i j p e t i j then swat wsa and modis wsa for each month in a year at the 45 points in the river basin were computed using eq 2 bayissa et al 2018 2 w s a i j m e d w s i w s i j m e d w s i m i n w s i i f w s i j m e d w s i m e d w s i w s i j m a x w s i m e d w s i i f w s i j m e d w s i where med ws min ws and max ws were the monthly median minimum and maximum water stresses respectively calculated from all similar months between the years 2000 and 2010 note that med ws removes seasonality inherent in ws so that the deficit can be compared irrespective of seasons wambura and dietrich 2020 wsa ranged from 1 0 to 1 0 indicating very dry to very wet conditions respectively narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 etdi was computed using eq 3 where the current etdi is the sum of half of the previous etdi and the current wsa narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 as a continuous timestep the subscript t in eq 3 ranged from 1 to 132 the total number of months between the years 2000 and 2010 with a timestep of 1 month it was also assumed that when t equalled one the initial etdi was zero 3 e t d i t 0 5 e t d i t 1 w s a t etdi ranged between 2 very dry condition and 2 very wet condition based on the standard precipitation index mckee et al 1993 the range of etdis between 0 and 2 was arbitrarily divided into four categories namely no drought etdi 0 00 mild drought 0 01 etdi 0 99 moderate drought 1 00 etdi 1 49 severe drought 1 50 etdi 1 99 and extreme drought etdi 2 00 wambura and dietrich 2020 these three equations were used in the computation of both swat etdi and modis etdi in the python programming environment source code is freely available upon request finally the time series of etdi at the 45 points in the river basin were then used in drought characterization 2 4 drought characterization in this study drought characterization involved the estimation of drought frequency duration severity intensity the total drought duration tdd total drought severity tds and the overall drought intensity odi a drought event was considered to start when etdi was less or equal to 1 0 and negative values continued for at least two months brito et al 2018 the etdi value of 1 0 is mostly used as the starting point because it indicates a deficit equivalent to unit standard deviation below normal condition dayal et al 2018 mckee et al 1993 the drought event was considered to end when etdi returned to zero spinoni et al 2014 2015 zero is normally used as the end point because after the start of a drought event any subsequent negative etdi contributes to the cumulative drought condition after identification of starts and ends of all drought events at the 45 points in the river basin drought duration drought severity and drought intensity of single drought events were estimated drought duration was considered as the number of months in a drought event brito et al 2018 drought severity was the sum of etdis in a drought event drought intensity was the ratio of drought severity to drought duration of a drought event thus the unit of drought intensity is per month like negative values of etdis drought intensity also ranged between 0 and 2 per month therefore it was similarly divided into no mild moderate severe and extreme categories the tdd tds and odi of all drought events in the record 2000 2010 at each of the 45 points in the river basin were also calculated odi was computed as the ratio of tds to tdd all drought characteristics in this study were estimated using algorithms implemented in the python programming environment source code is freely available upon request 3 results and discussion out of the 45 points findings from three points of interest namely p3 p32 and p45 are presented and discussed in detail the three points were selected because of their spatial and strategic locations in the wami river basin they represent upstream midstream and downstream information respectively fig 1 additionally findings from all 45 points were used to summarize information at the basin level the following sections present and discuss findings in terms of et etdi and drought uncertainties 3 1 evapotranspiration uncertainty the time series of swat et and modis et at p3 in the upstream of the wami river basin had similar patterns r² 0 5 fig 3 a both time series showed that peaks of et were mainly between december and may whereas low et values were mainly found in the remaining months peaks of modis et were higher than those of swat et and during the june october periods the former also showed higher low et values than the latter fig 3a unlike the upstream part et in the midstream p32 and downstream p45 areas were differently depicted by swat and modis fig 3 and table 1 in these areas modis et had far greater magnitude than swat et except between october 2005 and february 2006 the patterns of low and high et did not properly match r² 0 5 because of large differences between swat et and modis et values in general across the river basin the average swat et and modis et were 29 and 74 mm per month respectively table 2 recently studies have found that the presence of the eams in the middle of the wami river basin partly modifies rainfall distribution causing lower rainfall and consequently lower et in the upstream part than in the downstream part glows fiu 2014 iucn 2010 mapande and reason 2005 skarbek 2008 wambura et al 2017 the eams prevent the influence of indian ocean cyclonic rains from reaching the upstream area skarbek 2008 this spatial distribution of et was depicted by both swat et and modis et their season patterns seemed to agree especially in the upstream area of the river basin however there were disparities in et magnitudes across the river basin fig 3 tables 1 and 2 since there were no sufficient et measurements to verify both swat et and modis et data it could not be ascertained which of the two datasets represented true et values in the river basin however the computation of etdi does not depend on absolute et values rather its relative values see eq 1 3 2 evapotranspiration deficit index uncertainty the time series of swat ws were somewhat similar to those of modis ws at the three points fig 4 however the patterns of swat ws and modis ws were more similar in the upstream r² 0 5 p3 than in the midstream r² 0 5 p32 and downstream r² 0 5 p45 parts in comparison to swat et and modis et at the three points the time series of swat ws and modis ws had slightly higher correlations r² cf figs 3 and 4 moreover swat et values were relatively lower than modis et values but swat ws values were relatively greater than modis ws values table 1 this means that ws values are heavily influenced by the magnitudes of et values see eq 1 fig 5 shows that the time series of swat wsa and modis wsa did not properly match at almost all three points r² 0 5 at point p3 swat wsa and modis wsa showed an intermittent disparity between their time series in the years 2000 2008 and 2010 and the continuous disparity between the years 2003 and 2005 fig 5a the continuous disparity between the time series of swat wsa and modis wsa at p32 was between the years 2000 and 2005 whereas at p45 was between the years 2007 and 2010 fig 5b and c despite some agreement between swat ws and modis ws especially in the upstream area the time series of swat wsa and modis wsa had substantial differences this is because small differences in ws values were magnified by the instability of absolute maximum and minimum values of ws used in the computation of wsa values eq 2 table 2 the absolute maximum and minimum are usually affected by outliers in data the time series of swat etdi and modis etdi were also very different at all three points r² 0 5 fig 6 however there was a considerable similarity of patterns between swat etdi and modis etdi in the upstream from the year 2000 2002 p3 fig 6a in the years 2003 2004 and 2008 swat etdi indicated dry conditions whereas modis etdi indicated wet conditions and the vice versa in the year 2010 the disparity between the time series of swat etdi and modis etdi in the midstream areas was mainly in the 2000 2005 period p32 fig 6b in that period the former indicated dry conditions whereas the latter indicated wet conditions in the downstream areas the disparity between swat etdi and modis etdi was mainly in the years 2003 2006 and 2008 p45 fig 6c in these years both swat etdi and modis etdi indicated wet and dry conditions in a nearly antagonistic manner these substantial uncertainties in etdis in the river basin were caused by differences in wsa values tables 1 and 2 thus etdi eq 3 only smoothened peaks of wsa by computing their cumulative effects fig 7 shows the spatial distributions of the average etdis from the 45 points in the river basin the average swat etdis in the river basin was below 0 0 throughout the year dry conditions fig 7a the dry months were march april and may whereas the driest month was october and the remaining months were drier this pattern of dry and the driest periods in april and october respectively corresponded to the mam rainfall and the end of the dry period in the river basin twisa and buchroithner 2019 wambura et al 2017 on the other hand fig 7b shows that the average modis etdis across the river basin was less than 0 0 only in november and december thus only these two months had dry conditions but the remaining months were wet this implies that the pattern of modis etdi disagreed with the light ond rainfall and the june september dry season in the river basin kijazi and reason 2009 in general scenario uncertainty between the spatial distributions of swat etdi and modis etdi was attributed to imperfections of the swat model and modis images in mimicking true et and pet values since seasonality was removed from wsa and eventually etdi eq 2 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 wambura and dietrich 2020 different seasonal patterns indicated by swat etdi and modis etdi were just coincidences however the identification of a drought event does not depend on the occurrences of seasons rather prolonged negative values of etdis adhyani et al 2017 3 3 drought uncertainty 3 3 1 drought event uncertainty despite differences in etdis both swat etdi and modis etdi showed several drought events some of which did coincide figs 8 9 and 10 at p3 swat etdi and modis etdi showed four and three drought events respectively fig 8 table 3 the first and last swat drought events slightly coincided with their corresponding modis drought events especially in the years 2000 and 2009 respectively but drought events between the years 2001 and 2008 did not coincide cf fig 8a and b this is because swat etdi had two large consecutive drought events between the years 2003 and 2006 whereas modis etdi had only one drought episode in the year 2006 at p32 both swat etdi and modis etdi showed six and three drought events respectively fig 9 table 3 at this point a slight coincidence between swat and modis drought events was during the last drought event in the year 2010 cf fig 9a b small overlaps between patterns of swat and modis drought events were also found in the years 2003 and 2005 in these two years swat drought events occurred almost half a year earlier than modis drought events these disparities might be attributed to wet conditions during mam rains that were captured by modis images but underestimated by the swat model the number of swat drought events at p45 was two but modis drought events were six fig 10 table 3 the two swat drought events corresponded to the other two modis drought events cf fig 10a and b however four modis drought events between 2001 and 2007 were missed by swat because the length of dry conditions did not reach two months across the river basin swat drought events were more than modis drought events table 4 however the average number of both swat and modis drought events in the river basin between the years 2000 and 2010 was four this implies that both swat outputs and modis data could be used to estimate average drought frequency in the river basin 3 3 2 drought duration uncertainty at p3 swat etdi had one drought event more than modis etdi during the 2000 2010 period cf fig 8a and b table 3 consequently swat based tdd swat tdd was 23 months longer than modis based tdd modis tdd tdd difference of 23 months was mainly contributed by the single drought event that modis missed cf fig 8a and b at p32 the first two swat and modis drought events had the same drought duration cf fig 9a and b table 3 the third modis drought event had ten months longer than the corresponding swat drought event however swat tdd had 21 months longer than modis tdd because the latter missed three drought events between the years 2000 and 2002 and in the year 2009 cf fig 9a and b at p45 swat etdi showed four drought events less than modis etdi but unexpectedly modis tdd was eight months shorter than swat tdd cf fig 10a and b table 3 this lack of correspondence between the number of drought events and tdd was caused by longer swat drought duration during the second drought event between the years 2008 and 2010 this also means that the four extra modis drought events had small drought durations in the entire basin both swat tdd and modis tdd showed similar deviation from mean tdds table 4 however the mean tdd of the former was far greater than that of the latter the difference between swat and modis drought events was differently reflected in tdds because drought duration does not depend on the number of drought events rather on the length of an event 3 3 3 drought severity uncertainty at p3 the findings show that swat drought severity was higher than modis drought severity during the first drought events and vice versa during the second and third drought events table 3 during the first drought events the swat drought severity of 10 was estimated from eight months whereas modis drought severity of 7 was estimated from nine months table 3 during the third drought events swat and modis drought durations were the same but their drought severity was different for the entire record length swat based tds swat tds was higher than modis based tds modis tds table 3 at p32 swat drought severity was lower than modis drought severity during the first and second drought events despite having similar drought durations table 3 however during the 2000 2010 period swat tds was higher than modis tds this is because the former had three drought events more than the latter at p45 swat tds and modis tds were more or less similar despite having very different tdds table 3 this is because during the second event swat drought severity was very high thus compensated for missed drought events in general drought severity and tds at the three points of interest were independent of drought duration despite being estimated from it across the river basin the mean and standard deviation of swat tds and modis tds were quite different table 4 3 3 4 drought intensity uncertainty at p3 swat and modis drought intensity ranged between mild and moderate table 3 modis and swat drought intensity were both mild during the first and second drought events respectively the remaining two modis drought events and three swat drought events had moderate drought intensity this implies that in this area modis based odi modis odi and swat based odi swat odi were moderate table 3 this agreement between swat odi and modis odi in this area was caused by stable weather conditions and unimodal rainfall in the upstream of the river basin which could be easily captured by models mapande and reason 2005 wambura 2020 the range of swat and modis drought intensity at point p32 was between mild and moderate except during the second drought event when modis drought intensity was occasionally severe table 3 although this area is on the windward side of the eams it is very far from the indian ocean approx 200 km cf fig 1 thus occasional severe modis drought intensity in this area between august 2005 and march 2006 might be attributed to low rainfall amounts due to weak humid easterlies from the indian ocean skarbek 2008 because of an imperfection of the swat model in simulating the true hydrologic cycle of the river basin this rare event could not be captured by swat drought intensity however both modis odi and swat odi in this area were moderate table 3 at p45 the range of swat and modis drought intensity was also between mild and moderate table 3 here swat drought intensity was mild and moderate during the first and second drought events respectively on the other hand modis drought intensity was mild during the first second and fifth drought events the remaining three modis drought events had moderate intensity in this area swat odi and modis odi were moderate and mild respectively table 3 this scenario uncertainty was partly attributed to the imperfect representation of complex weather conditions namely bimodal rainfall indian ocean dipole and el niño southern oscillation effects in either the swat model or modis images in the downstream of the river basin nicholson 2015 both swat odis and modis odis in most areas in the river basin were moderate in few areas were mild and in only two areas were severe fig 11 a table 4 the two areas that had localized severe modis odi and swat odi were p33 and p38 respectively figs 1 and 11a localized severe modis odi estimated at point p33 might be attributed to meteorological effects this is because point p33 is within the transition rainfall zone which is between unimodal rainfall in the upstream and bimodal rainfall in the downstream of the river basin thus it received low rainfall amounts because of weak low level humid westerlies from the southern congo basin and less humid easterlies from the indian ocean due to the lee effect of the eams fig 1 mapande and reason 2005 wambura et al 2017 in that case the failure of data from the swat model to mimic severe swat odi at p33 was attributed to an imperfection of the model in simulating the true hydrologic cycle of the river basin localized severe swat odi estimated at point p38 was also attributed to the imperfection in the swat model this is because this area is in the heavy rainfall zone and on the windward side of the eams thus does not receive low rainfall amounts this implies that the swat model failed to mimic the actual amount of et and pet at p38 the imperfection in the swat model led to a misrepresentation of swat et and eventually swat odi at p33 and p38 partly because the model was calibrated using only streamflow data thus the best simulation in the hydrograph was not the best in the spatial distribution of et this implies that the best simulation might have been caused by a cancellation of errors leading to the high performance of the simulated hydrograph fig 2a wambura et al 2018b apart from that terrain soil land cover temperature and rainfall data limitations might also have played a role this is because hydrological models like swat represent simplified versions of reality thus some localized hydrological processes like et flux at p33 and p38 might have been misrepresented in the models bahremand 2016 farmer and vogel 2016 in general the imperfection in the swat model accounted for all sources of imprecisions and or uncertainties abbaspour et al 2018 fig 11b shows that it was 99 certain that swat odi across the wami river basin ranged between 1 20 and 1 09 per month on the other hand fig 11c also showed 99 confidence that modis odi across the river basin ranged between 1 21 and 1 12 per month these two ranges are more or less similar thus both swat and modis indicated that odi in the basin was moderate 4 conclusions reliable drought information is fundamental to decisions aiming to combat drought impacts the estimation of reliable etdi based drought information requires the use of more than one set of data this is because data from classical hydrological models and remote sensing products which have been widely used in the estimation of etdi based drought characteristics in different parts of the world have substantial errors by using et and pet data from the swat model and modis images this study revealed substantial scenario uncertainty in etdi based drought events duration severity and intensity at different locations in the wami river basin this scenario uncertainty propagated from the swat model and modis images due to their imperfections in mimicking true et and pet values for instance localized severe modis odi in midstream of the river basin which was attributed to less humid winds from the southern congo basin and the indian ocean was not captured by the swat model due to its imperfection in simulating the true hydrologic cycle of the river basin additionally localized severe swat odi in the downstream was also linked to the imperfection in the swat model because this area is on the windward side of the eams thus receives heavy rainfalls in the absence of observed data it could also not be validated that mild and moderate drought intensities from swat and modis datasets at various locations in the river basin are true however at the basin level between the years 2000 and 2010 both swat odi and modis odi were moderate these findings can be used as the baseline information in reducing uncertainty in estimating drought in the wami river basin moreover future drought studies in river basins are encouraged to focus on the use of datasets from high resolution remote sensing products as they become available and from improved hydrological models to increase the

8313,study region the wami river basin in east central tanzania features the eastern arc mountains and dichotomous climate regimes study focus drought characteristics are vital in planning and managing water resources in river basins however the estimation of drought characteristics from the evapotranspiration deficit index etdi is susceptible to the uncertainty associated with alternative datasets from hydrological models and remote sensing images thus this study investigated scenario uncertainty in etdi based drought characteristics in the river basin using evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration data from a classical soil and water assessment tool swat and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images between the years 2000 and 2010 new hydrological insights the findings showed a substantial scenario uncertainty in drought duration severity and intensity at various locations in the river basin localized severe modis based overall drought intensity modis odi in the middle of the basin was attributed to prolonged low rainfall amounts in the downstream localized severe swat based overall drought intensity swat odi was attributed to an imperfection of the swat model in simulating the true hydrologic cycle of the river basin however at the basin level both swat odi and modis odi between the years 2000 and 2010 were moderate

for a prolonged period currently many parts of the world face harsh drought conditions liu et al 2018 sheffield et al 2012 there are increasing frequency and severity of droughts in different geographical regions of the globe hassan et al 2014 khatiwada and pandey 2019 peter et al 2018 trambauer et al 2014 viste et al 2013 drought has been affecting human lives economic activities and various elements of the environment bayissa et al 2015 gebrehiwot et al 2011 as a result drought management initiatives are increasing and becoming globally important these initiatives intend to reduce the effects of drought through prevention and mitigation measures as well as preparedness bayissa et al 2015 however drought management initiatives have been affected by a lack of enough information about drought characteristics due to data scarcity this is because many drought indices use measured data from hydrological and meteorological monitoring networks in many parts of the world monitoring stations or gauges are not evenly distributed and in most cases few available records are too short have large missing gaps corrupt etc ndomba 2014 wambura et al 2017 thus some drought indices have been using simulated data and remote sensing data one of these indices is the evapotranspiration deficit index etdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 etdi uses actual evapotranspiration et and potential evapotranspiration pet data from a distributed hydrological model or remote sensing images to obtained spatially distributed drought information in a river basin bayissa et al 2018 wambura and dietrich 2020 etdi estimates agricultural drought as a result of water availability for et simulated et and pet data from hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 pandey et al 2020 have been widely used in the computation of etdi bayissa et al 2018 esfahanian et al 2017 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 however hydrological models are known to have imperfect representations of reality despite their advantage in simulating continuous spatial distributed parameters knoche et al 2014 pandey et al 2019 sellami et al 2014 yen et al 2015 the imperfections normally originate from input data model structure and model parameter limitations teshager et al 2016 tumbo and hughes 2015 for example in large river systems 40 000 km2 the resolution of topography data and the demand for high computing faculties can limit the number of sub basins and hydrological response units in a swat model wambura et al 2018a b this usually leads to less dense spatially distributed information from a hydrological model recently readily available remotely sensed et and pet data have also been used to compute etdi wambura and dietrich 2020 this is because remotely sensed data captures spatial seasonal changes and long term trends globally consistent and in an economically feasible manner eswar et al 2013 kiptala et al 2013 one of the widely applied remotely sensed et products is from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis imagery program alemu et al 2014 deus and gloaguen 2013 ramoelo et al 2014 wambura et al 2017 however like simulated outputs from a swat model remotely sensing data especially from the modis program also suffers from errors associated with the whiskbroom design and the observation geometry of the modis satellites as well as registration of images duveiller et al 2015 thus causing wrong data values because different neighbouring physical areas can be mapped onto the same pixels moreover cloud cover can also lead to wrong data acquisition or missing data values mu et al 2011 yang et al 2015 although et and pet datasets from hydrological models and remote sensing images have errors from their productions this study focused on the uncertainty caused by their applications as alternative datasets in characterizing drought this is because in the absence of observed data drought information from any dataset cannot be validated thus drought uncertainty due to all available datasets should be considered in natural sciences including hydrology uncertainty has three dimensions namely source nature and type walker et al 2003 out of the three dimensions types of uncertainty are closely related to uncertainty assessment approaches the main types of uncertainty are recognized ignorance uncertainty qualitative uncertainty statistical uncertainty and scenario uncertainty refsgaard et al 2007 recognized ignorance uncertainty is the uncertainty that occurs where outcomes are not known because of accepted imperfect knowledge brown 2004 qualitative uncertainty is the uncertainty that occurs where all or some possible outcomes are known but only some of their probabilities are known refsgaard et al 2007 statistical uncertainty is any uncertainty that can be described adequately in statistical terms because all possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities are known or assumed known walker et al 2003 normally statistical uncertainty manifests in random inputs and parameters of hydrological models sellami et al 2014 yen et al 2015 scenario uncertainty occurs where possible outcomes do not have their corresponding probabilities in hydrological studies scenario uncertainty manifests itself where alternative datasets model structures parameterization approaches emissions scenarios etc are used to assess impacts hamel and bryant 2017 scenario uncertainty occurs because in most cases decisions leading to several alternatives are not related or are made by analysts project stakeholders organizations etc therefore it is not possible to formulate the probability of any one particular alternative occurring walker et al 2003 contrary to statistical uncertainty that has many quantification techniques quantification of scenario uncertainty is difficult because of a lack of probabilities it is worth noting that with only two alternatives available a comparison of the alternatives is the simplest and suitable approach for assessing scenario uncertainty in this study two pairs of et and pet data from the swat model and modis images were used to estimate etdis and eventually characterize swat based and modis based droughts in the wami river basin in tanzania since there were only two datasets available namely swat and modis datasets the manifested scenario uncertainty was assessed by comparing alternatives therefore this study demonstrated the assessment of scenario uncertainty that results from the use of more than one dataset in drought characterization in a river basin 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the wami river basin has an area of about 41 170 km2 the river basin is located between 5 00 7 27 s and 36 00 39 00 e in east central tanzania fig 1 the topography of the river basin ranges from 0 to 2360 m above sea level fig 1 the river basin is divided into two major parts by the eastern arc mountains eams which comprise the rubeho ukaguru nguru and nguu mountain ranges the predominant soils in the river basin are loam and sand clay loam soils fao isric 2003 the land use classes are predominantly bushland woodland and grassland fao 1997 the average rainfall in the river basin ranges between 692 and 1388 mm per annum wambura et al 2017 the basin has two major rainfall zones a unimodal rainfall zone with one heavy rainfall season from october to april in the upstream part and a bimodal rainfall zone in the downstream part the bimodal rainfall zone has two rainfall seasons a light rainfall season between october and december ond and a heavy rainfall season between march and may mam the average daily temperature in the river basin ranges between 24 and 31 c wambura et al 2018b the average et in the river basin ranges between 368 and 1614 mm per year wambura et al 2017 2 2 evapotranspiration datasets 2 2 1 swat based evapotranspiration dataset in this study a classical hydrological model used to obtain simulated et and pet data was the swat model for the wami river basin similar to the one developed by wambura et al 2018b this model was set up using a digital elevation model of 90 m resolution jarvis et al 2008 soil texture data at a scale of 1 2 000 000 fao isric 2003 and land cover types at a scale of 1 250 000 fao 1997 the model had 45 sub basins the climate data used were hybrids of temperature and precipitation data made up of observed data from the tanzania meteorological agency and wfdei reanalysis data wambura 2020 weedon et al 2014 water use abstractions from the wami ruvu basin water office were also included in the model wambura et al 2018b observed streamflow for model calibration and validation between the years 2000 and 2010 was obtained from the wami ruvu basin water office despite having missing records in the streamflow data the model was calibrated using about 60 of monthly streamflow at the 1g2 mandera gauging station and the remaining 40 was used for validation fig 1 before the model calibration 1000 parameter combinations were sampled from ranges estimated from the best simulation of the swat model in the study by wambura et al 2018b in this study model calibration and validation were evaluated using the coefficient of determination r² nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and half standard deviation hsd of observed flow the performances were considered satisfactory when r² nse and rmse were 0 50 0 65 and hsd respectively moriasi et al 2007 singh et al 2004 wambura et al 2018b from the model calibration the best simulation was satisfactory r² 0 81 nse 0 81 rmse 42 fig 2 a the r² nse and rmse of the validation hydrograph were also satisfactory fig 2a since the swat model had 45 sub basins therefore simulated et and pet data from the model s best simulation namely swat et and swat pet respectively constituted two sets each with 45 time series representing centroids of sub basins in the wami river basin the 45 centroids of sub basins are hereafter referred to as the 45 points 2 2 2 modis based evapotranspiration dataset the et and pet data from modis images modis et and modis pet respectively were obtained from the modis global et product known as mod16a2 version 5 product available at the spatial resolution of 1 km and temporal resolution of 1 month mu et al 2011 the modis global et algorithm is based on the penman monteith equation fig 2b shows that the input data for the modis global et calculation were other modis products and meteorological reanalysis data the modis products were leaf area index land cover albedo and the fraction of photosynthetic absorbed radiation whereas meteorological reanalysis data included air pressure air temperature humidity and radiation mu et al 2011 fig 2b summarizes the modis global et generation process from the inputs to intermediate algorithm calculations and finally to the output et more details about this algorithm are found in the study by mu et al 2011 in this study 132 images of mod16a2 product spanning between the years 2000 and 2010 were downloaded from the modis repositories http files ntsg umt edu data accessed on 10 july 2019 then two sets namely modis et and modis pet each with 45 time series were extracted from modis images using the 45 points in the wami river basin 2 3 evapotranspiration deficit index the computations of the swat model based etdi swat etdi used swat et and swat pet dataset whereas modis images based etdi modis etdi used modis et and modis pet dataset to obtain consecutive monthly dry and wet conditions for the 45 points in the wami river basin the computation of etdi was a three step approach the first step involved the computation of water stress ws the second step involved the computation of water stress anomaly wsa and the final step the computation of etdi itself monthly swat based ws swat ws and modis based ws modis ws for each year at the 45 points in the river basin were computed using eq 1 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 ws ranged from 1 no et to 0 et equals pet where the subscript i represented a month in year j the subscript j spanned betweeen the years 2000 and 2010 1 w s i j 1 e t i j p e t i j then swat wsa and modis wsa for each month in a year at the 45 points in the river basin were computed using eq 2 bayissa et al 2018 2 w s a i j m e d w s i w s i j m e d w s i m i n w s i i f w s i j m e d w s i m e d w s i w s i j m a x w s i m e d w s i i f w s i j m e d w s i where med ws min ws and max ws were the monthly median minimum and maximum water stresses respectively calculated from all similar months between the years 2000 and 2010 note that med ws removes seasonality inherent in ws so that the deficit can be compared irrespective of seasons wambura and dietrich 2020 wsa ranged from 1 0 to 1 0 indicating very dry to very wet conditions respectively narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 etdi was computed using eq 3 where the current etdi is the sum of half of the previous etdi and the current wsa narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 as a continuous timestep the subscript t in eq 3 ranged from 1 to 132 the total number of months between the years 2000 and 2010 with a timestep of 1 month it was also assumed that when t equalled one the initial etdi was zero 3 e t d i t 0 5 e t d i t 1 w s a t etdi ranged between 2 very dry condition and 2 very wet condition based on the standard precipitation index mckee et al 1993 the range of etdis between 0 and 2 was arbitrarily divided into four categories namely no drought etdi 0 00 mild drought 0 01 etdi 0 99 moderate drought 1 00 etdi 1 49 severe drought 1 50 etdi 1 99 and extreme drought etdi 2 00 wambura and dietrich 2020 these three equations were used in the computation of both swat etdi and modis etdi in the python programming environment source code is freely available upon request finally the time series of etdi at the 45 points in the river basin were then used in drought characterization 2 4 drought characterization in this study drought characterization involved the estimation of drought frequency duration severity intensity the total drought duration tdd total drought severity tds and the overall drought intensity odi a drought event was considered to start when etdi was less or equal to 1 0 and negative values continued for at least two months brito et al 2018 the etdi value of 1 0 is mostly used as the starting point because it indicates a deficit equivalent to unit standard deviation below normal condition dayal et al 2018 mckee et al 1993 the drought event was considered to end when etdi returned to zero spinoni et al 2014 2015 zero is normally used as the end point because after the start of a drought event any subsequent negative etdi contributes to the cumulative drought condition after identification of starts and ends of all drought events at the 45 points in the river basin drought duration drought severity and drought intensity of single drought events were estimated drought duration was considered as the number of months in a drought event brito et al 2018 drought severity was the sum of etdis in a drought event drought intensity was the ratio of drought severity to drought duration of a drought event thus the unit of drought intensity is per month like negative values of etdis drought intensity also ranged between 0 and 2 per month therefore it was similarly divided into no mild moderate severe and extreme categories the tdd tds and odi of all drought events in the record 2000 2010 at each of the 45 points in the river basin were also calculated odi was computed as the ratio of tds to tdd all drought characteristics in this study were estimated using algorithms implemented in the python programming environment source code is freely available upon request 3 results and discussion out of the 45 points findings from three points of interest namely p3 p32 and p45 are presented and discussed in detail the three points were selected because of their spatial and strategic locations in the wami river basin they represent upstream midstream and downstream information respectively fig 1 additionally findings from all 45 points were used to summarize information at the basin level the following sections present and discuss findings in terms of et etdi and drought uncertainties 3 1 evapotranspiration uncertainty the time series of swat et and modis et at p3 in the upstream of the wami river basin had similar patterns r² 0 5 fig 3 a both time series showed that peaks of et were mainly between december and may whereas low et values were mainly found in the remaining months peaks of modis et were higher than those of swat et and during the june october periods the former also showed higher low et values than the latter fig 3a unlike the upstream part et in the midstream p32 and downstream p45 areas were differently depicted by swat and modis fig 3 and table 1 in these areas modis et had far greater magnitude than swat et except between october 2005 and february 2006 the patterns of low and high et did not properly match r² 0 5 because of large differences between swat et and modis et values in general across the river basin the average swat et and modis et were 29 and 74 mm per month respectively table 2 recently studies have found that the presence of the eams in the middle of the wami river basin partly modifies rainfall distribution causing lower rainfall and consequently lower et in the upstream part than in the downstream part glows fiu 2014 iucn 2010 mapande and reason 2005 skarbek 2008 wambura et al 2017 the eams prevent the influence of indian ocean cyclonic rains from reaching the upstream area skarbek 2008 this spatial distribution of et was depicted by both swat et and modis et their season patterns seemed to agree especially in the upstream area of the river basin however there were disparities in et magnitudes across the river basin fig 3 tables 1 and 2 since there were no sufficient et measurements to verify both swat et and modis et data it could not be ascertained which of the two datasets represented true et values in the river basin however the computation of etdi does not depend on absolute et values rather its relative values see eq 1 3 2 evapotranspiration deficit index uncertainty the time series of swat ws were somewhat similar to those of modis ws at the three points fig 4 however the patterns of swat ws and modis ws were more similar in the upstream r² 0 5 p3 than in the midstream r² 0 5 p32 and downstream r² 0 5 p45 parts in comparison to swat et and modis et at the three points the time series of swat ws and modis ws had slightly higher correlations r² cf figs 3 and 4 moreover swat et values were relatively lower than modis et values but swat ws values were relatively greater than modis ws values table 1 this means that ws values are heavily influenced by the magnitudes of et values see eq 1 fig 5 shows that the time series of swat wsa and modis wsa did not properly match at almost all three points r² 0 5 at point p3 swat wsa and modis wsa showed an intermittent disparity between their time series in the years 2000 2008 and 2010 and the continuous disparity between the years 2003 and 2005 fig 5a the continuous disparity between the time series of swat wsa and modis wsa at p32 was between the years 2000 and 2005 whereas at p45 was between the years 2007 and 2010 fig 5b and c despite some agreement between swat ws and modis ws especially in the upstream area the time series of swat wsa and modis wsa had substantial differences this is because small differences in ws values were magnified by the instability of absolute maximum and minimum values of ws used in the computation of wsa values eq 2 table 2 the absolute maximum and minimum are usually affected by outliers in data the time series of swat etdi and modis etdi were also very different at all three points r² 0 5 fig 6 however there was a considerable similarity of patterns between swat etdi and modis etdi in the upstream from the year 2000 2002 p3 fig 6a in the years 2003 2004 and 2008 swat etdi indicated dry conditions whereas modis etdi indicated wet conditions and the vice versa in the year 2010 the disparity between the time series of swat etdi and modis etdi in the midstream areas was mainly in the 2000 2005 period p32 fig 6b in that period the former indicated dry conditions whereas the latter indicated wet conditions in the downstream areas the disparity between swat etdi and modis etdi was mainly in the years 2003 2006 and 2008 p45 fig 6c in these years both swat etdi and modis etdi indicated wet and dry conditions in a nearly antagonistic manner these substantial uncertainties in etdis in the river basin were caused by differences in wsa values tables 1 and 2 thus etdi eq 3 only smoothened peaks of wsa by computing their cumulative effects fig 7 shows the spatial distributions of the average etdis from the 45 points in the river basin the average swat etdis in the river basin was below 0 0 throughout the year dry conditions fig 7a the dry months were march april and may whereas the driest month was october and the remaining months were drier this pattern of dry and the driest periods in april and october respectively corresponded to the mam rainfall and the end of the dry period in the river basin twisa and buchroithner 2019 wambura et al 2017 on the other hand fig 7b shows that the average modis etdis across the river basin was less than 0 0 only in november and december thus only these two months had dry conditions but the remaining months were wet this implies that the pattern of modis etdi disagreed with the light ond rainfall and the june september dry season in the river basin kijazi and reason 2009 in general scenario uncertainty between the spatial distributions of swat etdi and modis etdi was attributed to imperfections of the swat model and modis images in mimicking true et and pet values since seasonality was removed from wsa and eventually etdi eq 2 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 wambura and dietrich 2020 different seasonal patterns indicated by swat etdi and modis etdi were just coincidences however the identification of a drought event does not depend on the occurrences of seasons rather prolonged negative values of etdis adhyani et al 2017 3 3 drought uncertainty 3 3 1 drought event uncertainty despite differences in etdis both swat etdi and modis etdi showed several drought events some of which did coincide figs 8 9 and 10 at p3 swat etdi and modis etdi showed four and three drought events respectively fig 8 table 3 the first and last swat drought events slightly coincided with their corresponding modis drought events especially in the years 2000 and 2009 respectively but drought events between the years 2001 and 2008 did not coincide cf fig 8a and b this is because swat etdi had two large consecutive drought events between the years 2003 and 2006 whereas modis etdi had only one drought episode in the year 2006 at p32 both swat etdi and modis etdi showed six and three drought events respectively fig 9 table 3 at this point a slight coincidence between swat and modis drought events was during the last drought event in the year 2010 cf fig 9a b small overlaps between patterns of swat and modis drought events were also found in the years 2003 and 2005 in these two years swat drought events occurred almost half a year earlier than modis drought events these disparities might be attributed to wet conditions during mam rains that were captured by modis images but underestimated by the swat model the number of swat drought events at p45 was two but modis drought events were six fig 10 table 3 the two swat drought events corresponded to the other two modis drought events cf fig 10a and b however four modis drought events between 2001 and 2007 were missed by swat because the length of dry conditions did not reach two months across the river basin swat drought events were more than modis drought events table 4 however the average number of both swat and modis drought events in the river basin between the years 2000 and 2010 was four this implies that both swat outputs and modis data could be used to estimate average drought frequency in the river basin 3 3 2 drought duration uncertainty at p3 swat etdi had one drought event more than modis etdi during the 2000 2010 period cf fig 8a and b table 3 consequently swat based tdd swat tdd was 23 months longer than modis based tdd modis tdd tdd difference of 23 months was mainly contributed by the single drought event that modis missed cf fig 8a and b at p32 the first two swat and modis drought events had the same drought duration cf fig 9a and b table 3 the third modis drought event had ten months longer than the corresponding swat drought event however swat tdd had 21 months longer than modis tdd because the latter missed three drought events between the years 2000 and 2002 and in the year 2009 cf fig 9a and b at p45 swat etdi showed four drought events less than modis etdi but unexpectedly modis tdd was eight months shorter than swat tdd cf fig 10a and b table 3 this lack of correspondence between the number of drought events and tdd was caused by longer swat drought duration during the second drought event between the years 2008 and 2010 this also means that the four extra modis drought events had small drought durations in the entire basin both swat tdd and modis tdd showed similar deviation from mean tdds table 4 however the mean tdd of the former was far greater than that of the latter the difference between swat and modis drought events was differently reflected in tdds because drought duration does not depend on the number of drought events rather on the length of an event 3 3 3 drought severity uncertainty at p3 the findings show that swat drought severity was higher than modis drought severity during the first drought events and vice versa during the second and third drought events table 3 during the first drought events the swat drought severity of 10 was estimated from eight months whereas modis drought severity of 7 was estimated from nine months table 3 during the third drought events swat and modis drought durations were the same but their drought severity was different for the entire record length swat based tds swat tds was higher than modis based tds modis tds table 3 at p32 swat drought severity was lower than modis drought severity during the first and second drought events despite having similar drought durations table 3 however during the 2000 2010 period swat tds was higher than modis tds this is because the former had three drought events more than the latter at p45 swat tds and modis tds were more or less similar despite having very different tdds table 3 this is because during the second event swat drought severity was very high thus compensated for missed drought events in general drought severity and tds at the three points of interest were independent of drought duration despite being estimated from it across the river basin the mean and standard deviation of swat tds and modis tds were quite different table 4 3 3 4 drought intensity uncertainty at p3 swat and modis drought intensity ranged between mild and moderate table 3 modis and swat drought intensity were both mild during the first and second drought events respectively the remaining two modis drought events and three swat drought events had moderate drought intensity this implies that in this area modis based odi modis odi and swat based odi swat odi were moderate table 3 this agreement between swat odi and modis odi in this area was caused by stable weather conditions and unimodal rainfall in the upstream of the river basin which could be easily captured by models mapande and reason 2005 wambura 2020 the range of swat and modis drought intensity at point p32 was between mild and moderate except during the second drought event when modis drought intensity was occasionally severe table 3 although this area is on the windward side of the eams it is very far from the indian ocean approx 200 km cf fig 1 thus occasional severe modis drought intensity in this area between august 2005 and march 2006 might be attributed to low rainfall amounts due to weak humid easterlies from the indian ocean skarbek 2008 because of an imperfection of the swat model in simulating the true hydrologic cycle of the river basin this rare event could not be captured by swat drought intensity however both modis odi and swat odi in this area were moderate table 3 at p45 the range of swat and modis drought intensity was also between mild and moderate table 3 here swat drought intensity was mild and moderate during the first and second drought events respectively on the other hand modis drought intensity was mild during the first second and fifth drought events the remaining three modis drought events had moderate intensity in this area swat odi and modis odi were moderate and mild respectively table 3 this scenario uncertainty was partly attributed to the imperfect representation of complex weather conditions namely bimodal rainfall indian ocean dipole and el niño southern oscillation effects in either the swat model or modis images in the downstream of the river basin nicholson 2015 both swat odis and modis odis in most areas in the river basin were moderate in few areas were mild and in only two areas were severe fig 11 a table 4 the two areas that had localized severe modis odi and swat odi were p33 and p38 respectively figs 1 and 11a localized severe modis odi estimated at point p33 might be attributed to meteorological effects this is because point p33 is within the transition rainfall zone which is between unimodal rainfall in the upstream and bimodal rainfall in the downstream of the river basin thus it received low rainfall amounts because of weak low level humid westerlies from the southern congo basin and less humid easterlies from the indian ocean due to the lee effect of the eams fig 1 mapande and reason 2005 wambura et al 2017 in that case the failure of data from the swat model to mimic severe swat odi at p33 was attributed to an imperfection of the model in simulating the true hydrologic cycle of the river basin localized severe swat odi estimated at point p38 was also attributed to the imperfection in the swat model this is because this area is in the heavy rainfall zone and on the windward side of the eams thus does not receive low rainfall amounts this implies that the swat model failed to mimic the actual amount of et and pet at p38 the imperfection in the swat model led to a misrepresentation of swat et and eventually swat odi at p33 and p38 partly because the model was calibrated using only streamflow data thus the best simulation in the hydrograph was not the best in the spatial distribution of et this implies that the best simulation might have been caused by a cancellation of errors leading to the high performance of the simulated hydrograph fig 2a wambura et al 2018b apart from that terrain soil land cover temperature and rainfall data limitations might also have played a role this is because hydrological models like swat represent simplified versions of reality thus some localized hydrological processes like et flux at p33 and p38 might have been misrepresented in the models bahremand 2016 farmer and vogel 2016 in general the imperfection in the swat model accounted for all sources of imprecisions and or uncertainties abbaspour et al 2018 fig 11b shows that it was 99 certain that swat odi across the wami river basin ranged between 1 20 and 1 09 per month on the other hand fig 11c also showed 99 confidence that modis odi across the river basin ranged between 1 21 and 1 12 per month these two ranges are more or less similar thus both swat and modis indicated that odi in the basin was moderate 4 conclusions reliable drought information is fundamental to decisions aiming to combat drought impacts the estimation of reliable etdi based drought information requires the use of more than one set of data this is because data from classical hydrological models and remote sensing products which have been widely used in the estimation of etdi based drought characteristics in different parts of the world have substantial errors by using et and pet data from the swat model and modis images this study revealed substantial scenario uncertainty in etdi based drought events duration severity and intensity at different locations in the wami river basin this scenario uncertainty propagated from the swat model and modis images due to their imperfections in mimicking true et and pet values for instance localized severe modis odi in midstream of the river basin which was attributed to less humid winds from the southern congo basin and the indian ocean was not captured by the swat model due to its imperfection in simulating the true hydrologic cycle of the river basin additionally localized severe swat odi in the downstream was also linked to the imperfection in the swat model because this area is on the windward side of the eams thus receives heavy rainfalls in the absence of observed data it could also not be validated that mild and moderate drought intensities from swat and modis datasets at various locations in the river basin are true however at the basin level between the years 2000 and 2010 both swat odi and modis odi were moderate these findings can be used as the baseline information in reducing uncertainty in estimating drought in the wami river basin moreover future drought studies in river basins are encouraged to focus on the use of datasets from high resolution remote sensing products as they become available and from improved hydrological models to increase the

8314,study region vietnam study focus in recent years vietnam has experienced historical drought events possibly affected by climate change but the analysis is challenging due to lack of necessary observations for monitoring drought conditions the goal of this study is to analyze the characteristics of droughts over a 30 year period using three spatial resolution merra 2 datasets in vietnam the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was used as an index for drought based on precipitation and temperature we also estimated the impacts of drought on agriculture using annual land cover datasets new hydrological insights for the regions our results identified significant increasing trends in precipitation in northern vietnam and decreasing trends in southern vietnam the increasing trends in temperature occurred mainly in southern vietnam these trends in rainfall and temperature resulted in an increasing trend in drought frequency and severity in southern vietnam especially in the south central region and the mekong delta the comparison between the observed drought records and modeled drought index demonstrated that the simulated drought conditions are better at higher spatial resolution the area under drought in agricultural lands calculated using dynamic land cover data sets resulted in a better agreement with observed records our findings reveal the feasibility of using a model based drought index in data sparse areas for long term trend drought analysis and for practical applications of advanced re analysis products in water resource management keywords hydrology drought merra 2 trend analysis land cover 1 introduction the slowly evolving nature of drought and its multiple drivers contribute to the various definitions adopted for different purposes and diverse conclusions in identifying the trends under changing climate dai 2011 van loon et al 2016 while a global trend of drought over the last century remains debatable greve et al 2014 orlowsky and seneviratne 2013 sheffield et al 2012 some regions of the world have observed robust tendencies that droughts are becoming more frequent and severe drying trends were found in equatorial africa diem et al 2014 kawase et al 2010 south asia krishnan et al 2016 and the mediterranean hoerling et al 2012 valdes abellan et al 2017 in contrast to wetting trends in high latitude regions sheffield and wood 2008 zhang et al 2013 notably in recent years several extreme droughts have been observed california ganguli and ganguly 2016 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 australia herold et al 2016 china yuan et al 2019 europe miralles et al 2019 and india sharma and mujumdar 2017 these droughts occurred concurrently with extreme heatwaves causing severe socioeconomic and ecological damages and are likely to occur with increased frequency such possibly intensified impacts of drought compounded by its intricate characteristics demands a substantially improved quality of observations for proper monitoring and management in many regions of the world while impacts of varying temporal scales on the efficiency of drought indices are well documented raziei et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 zuo et al 2018 only a few studies have investigated the performances of drought indices at different spatial scales golian et al 2019 found that the values of critical success index csi derived from products of multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep at coarser resolution 0 5 and 1 as significantly lower skill in drought detection for severe drought events compared to the csi computed from the mswep data at 0 1 additionally raziei et al 2013 demonstrated that the dependence of the spatial patterns of droughts on time scales increased when using higher spatial resolution data in light of this it seems that the drought indices computed from the high resolution data have greater potential to accurately describe the spatial characteristics of drought conditions than those derived from coarser resolution data previous studies have focused on drought indices based on the data sets with relatively coarser resolution e g larger than 10 km while the analyses that assess the performance of the drought indices at finer spatial resolutions e g less than 10 km have seldom been studied drought risk in agricultural regions is essential information however this information is currently limited by using static datasets for example when rojas et al 2011 and winkler et al 2017 investigated agricultural areas affected by drought they only used a typical year to represent land cover for the entire study period however land cover especially for agricultural land is subjected to change over time due to international trade climate adaptation urbanization industrialization food security and economic policies rutten et al 2014 therefore in order to accurately evaluate drought conditions in agricultural locations it is required to use a dynamic land cover database to reflect spatial changes in land cover over time to the best of our knowledge previous studies have not used dynamic land cover for drought assessment in this study we aim to examine three hypotheses viz 1 does high spatial resolution data detect drought trends better than low spatial resolution data 2 does high spatial resolution data have advantages of capturing drought events better than low spatial resolution data 3 does dynamic land cover provide better information on agricultural lands affected by drought over the years we selected the country of vietnam as a case study to test our hypotheses firstly drought investigation is of paramount importance for vietnam as this disaster ranked third among economic losses amongst natural hazards in the country nguyen and shaw 2011 secondly most of the studies which assessed droughts in vietnam are either based on sparsely distributed in situ observations le et al 2019b vu thanh et al 2014 or relatively coarse spatial resolution data vu and mishra 2016 vu et al 2018 therefore high spatial resolution drought datasets are unexplored in vietnam moreover we can obtain annual land cover information for vietnam for the past 30 years from servir mekong land use land cover portal this land cover database could enable us to examine our third hypotheses mentioned above this study selected the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 to estimate drought conditions in vietnam this index is an appropriate drought index in examining changes in droughts under global warming le et al 2019a lópez moreno et al 2013 wang et al 2018 and in representing different drought types such as meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts chen and sun 2015 we estimated the spei at three spatial resolutions 1 9 and 36 km using precipitation and air temperature from the second modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 one of the main reasons that we chose merra 2 is that the data has been widely validated showing good performance globally readers will find representative research at https gmao gsfc nasa gov reanalysis merra 2 pubs furthermore as merra 2 is open to the public and allows the downloading of near real time data it has great potential for practical application in drought analysis to investigate agricultural drought areas we extracted agricultural land cover in each year from servir mekong land use land cover database and re sampled the data to 1 9 and 36 km to explore the possible trends in a time series we applied the mann kendall test which is commonly used to detect trends in hydro meteorological time series joshi et al 2019 mondal et al 2015 velpuri and senay 2013 this study is organized as follows section 2

vietnam has a total area of 331 212 km2 extending from 8 2 n 23 5 n 101 1 e 110 3 e and a home of more than 95 million people in 2018 ranked 15th in global population in order to assess drought condition in vietnam previous studies often divided it into seven subregions that are based on differences in climatic conditions le et al 2019b vu et al 2018 this study however divided vietnam into eight sub regions based on a sub national administrative level this allows for easy comparison with existing agricultural drought statistics these eight sub regions are northwestern region r1 northeastern region r2 red river delta r3 north central region r4 south central region r5 central highlands r6 southeastern region r7 and the mekong delta r8 fig 1 3 data sets 3 1 ground observations this study collected monthly data from 215 precipitation stations and 74 temperature stations from multiple sources including vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration vmha mekong river commission mrc and japan international cooperation agency jica fig 1 all data has passed quality checks we used these in situ observations to compare with precipitation and air temperature from merra 2 datasets data availability at each station varied between 40 and 360 months fig 1 descriptive statistics of observed precipitation and air temperature in each sub region can be found at table 1 also mean elevation and gini simpson index are presented in table 2 for eight sub regions we obtained 1989 2014 data on agricultural land affected by drought for the r4 and r5 regions from the vietnamese ministry of agriculture and rural development mard the decree no 01 2008 nd cp on responsibilities tasks authorities and organization structure of mard ministry of agriculture and rural development is a state agency carrying out tasks of state management on such fields as agriculture forestry salt industry aquaculture water resource and rural development in the country of state management on public services and fields under the management of the ministry the mard has its department located in each province through vietnam officials from these departments conduct annual surveys on agricultural activities lands within their provinces to obtain statistical records on natural disasters and the development of these activities 3 2 the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 is the latest atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao the goals of merra 2 are to provide a regularly gridded homogeneous record of the global atmosphere and to incorporate additional aspects of the climate system gelaro et al 2017 the superior feature of merra 2 over its predecessor merra is that it assimilates several observation types and includes updates to the goddard earth observing system geos model and analysis scheme this allows it to provide a feasible ongoing climate analysis merra 2 includes ground based remotely sensed data and numerous satellite observations both before and after the introduction of noaa 18 satellite in 2005 the complete set of input observations assimilated in merra 2 is summarized in gelaro et al 2017 and detailed description of these data uses shown in mccarty et al 2016 in this study the bilinear transform was used to produce 0 01 0 01 1 km 0 09 0 09 9 km and 0 36 0 36 36 km spatial resolutions of merra 2 derived precipitation and air temperature forcing

dataset high resolution 30 m land cover data for vietnam during 1989 2018 were obtained from the land cover portal website maintained by servir mekong https rlcms servir adpc net en landcover this system provides consistent land cover products at regular intervals with quality control from multiple sources based on these yearly land cover data we determined agricultural land areas sum of croplands and rice paddies from servir mekong s classification and calculated the area percentage of drought on a monthly basis this work enables us to precisely estimate drought areas for agricultural regions only and not for other land covers since we used merra 2 datasets with three different spatial resolutions 1 9 and 36 km the land cover datasets were also re sampled from 30 m to these corresponding resolutions the temporal percentage change of agricultural land in vietnam at three spatial resolutions is given in fig 2 the r3 and r8 are two deltas corresponding to the two largest river basins in vietnam red thai binh river and mekong river respectively therefore agricultural lands in these regions account for a large proportion of the total land over the years for 30 years agricultural land in r7 experienced a significant reduction while that land in r6 exhibited a considerable increase comparing agricultural land estimated from three spatial resolutions 1 9 and 36 km higher spatial resolution land cover datasets seem to have smoother inter annual changes over 1989 2018 and to be closer with these figures of original land cover dataset fig 2 different agricultural land resolution datasets can result in a significant difference in percentage of total agricultural land for example in r8 the agricultural land was around 90 of the total land with a 36 km land cover dataset but 73 with the 1 km land cover dataset the large inhomogeneous distribution of land cover is probably a result of the different agricultural land estimations given when we used different spatial resolutions an example of agricultural land in r3 in different spatial resolutions is given in supplementary 1 in short the agricultural land in vietnam exhibited a great variation in both temporal and spatial scales therefore drought evaluation in agricultural land in vietnam requires a rigorous information for a better estimate 4 methodology 4 1 temporal trend analysis the mann kendall mk test was performed to analyze the trends of precipitation temperature and drought conditions the mk test is a non parametric test that statistically assesses the monotonic trends in data over time hirsch and slack 1984 kendall 1938 mann 1945 we selected this non parametric test because our data sets are not normally distributed and this test is distribution free gocic and trajkovic 2014 for purpose of robustness in the presence of autocorrelation time series which could affect trend interpretation results yue et al 2002 we removed the serial correlation effect using the pre whitening method before applying the mk test gocic and trajkovic 2014 then the sen s slope sen 1968 was used to examine the magnitude of trends 4 2 characteristics of drought dynamics from merra 2 s precipitation and air temperature for each grid cell we calculated the spei throughout vietnam at three spatial resolutions 1 9 and 36 km we employed three parameter log logistic distribution for fitting spei a negative value of spei indicates that a particular value of the water related variable is lower than the median of the total distribution a drought event occurs when the spei value reaches 1 or lower the water related time series spei requires a deficit between precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet we calculated pet from air temperature data based on the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 in the present study we used a 3 month timescale which was estimated by accumulating three consecutive months of p et this 3 month timescale often reflects a shortage of water availability for agricultural uses svoboda et al 2012 temporal drought characteristics were analyzed using drought frequency f and drought severity s le et al 2019b the details regarding these drought characteristics are the following eqs 1 and 2 1 f i 1 m d u i n 100 where d u i is i t h drought duration which is the number of consecutive months in which the spei is below 1 m is the number of drought duration n is the total months 2 s i 1 d u d i i d i i 1 where d i i is spei at month i for assessing drought in space we used a binary approach to represent drought state d s t at time step t for each grid cell as follows 3 d s t 1 i f d i t 1 0 i f d i t 1 where d i t is the value of drought index at time step t for a given region the percentage drought area at time step t p d a t is a ratio between total number cells in drought and the total number of cells in the region n t o t a l 4 p d a t i 1 n t o t a l d s t d i t 1 n t o t a l 100 we estimated three monthly percentage drought area pda datasets the first dataset is the percentage drought area for the entire region hereafter referred to as pda e which is equivalent to the total land area of a region the second dataset is the percentage of drought area for agricultural land using static land cover hereafter pda as n t o t a l in the second case is equivalent to total agricultural land of 2005 which represents for the period 1989 and 2018 the cells in drought are counted for the agricultural land in the year of 2005 the third dataset is the percentage of drought area for agricultural land using dynamic land cover hereafter pda ad n t o t a l in the third case is equivalent to total agricultural land of the year i i 1989 1990 2018 the cells in drought are counted for the agricultural land each year we compared these three estimated pdas with record pdas in r4 and r5 regions since the record pdas datasets are only available annually we averaged monthly pdas from our estimations to an annual basis to have the same temporal time step as the actual data 5 results and discussion 5 1 assessment on merra 2 s precipitation and air temperature in vietnam over our region of interest there is no prior research of validating merra 2 using in situ measurement therefore we conducted a validation study before applying merra 2 data for drought analysis to do that we extract grid values of merra 2 to ground observation points using the nearest neighbor method we used this method to preserve the values at different spatial resolutions in total for each precipitation and air temperature dataset three comparisons were made between merra 2 datasets 1 9 and 36 km and in situ measurements since the results were found similar in each spatial resolution of merra 2 product this section only presents evaluation results of 1 km merra 2 in terms of correlation coefficient r value and mean absolute error mae fig 3 the results of 9 and 36 km merra 2 can be found in supplementary 2 generally precipitation from merra 2 exhibited a good agreement with the precipitation from in situ data with median r value of 0 809 fig 3 a the merra 2 precipitation exhibited relatively poor correlation with in situ dataset in central highlands r6 specifically in its northern part this can probably be attributed to a combination of a typical bimodal south asian summer monsoon interacting with complex topography phan and ngo duc 2009 tuan 2019 van der linden et al 2016 the merra 2 precipitation product itself observed many outlier values in the r6 region see supplementary 3 note that the r1 r2 and r5 regions also have high gini simpson indices table 2 but their monsoon circulation is not as complex as that of the r6 region nguyen and nguyen 2004 with respect to air temperature a very good relationship between merra 2 and in situ data was found with a median r value of 0 977 among sub regions only the north mekong delta north r8 exhibited a moderate relationship median r value of 0 75 the mae values between precipitation and air temperature from merra 2 and these from in situ data is given in fig 3 b the median mae value of precipitation was 57 5 mm high precipitation mae values 150 mm were found at several stations in north r5 and in northwest r2 fig 3 b 1 these high values can probably be attributed to the typical local rainfall problem the stations in these areas are located at the base of mountains i e truong son mountains and tay con linh mountains meaning they receive the highest rainfall amounts in vietnam 3 500 4 300 mm annually due to orographic rainfall with such typical very high rainfall observed merra 2 often underestimates the rainfall during the rainy season previous studies also revealed large underestimation of satellite based and re analysis rainfall datasets in central vietnam where observed rainfall is extremely high 3000 mm le et al 2020 the median mae values of merra 2 s air temperature was 1 14 c fig 3 b 2 except for r6 merra 2 dataset generally underestimated air temperature over vietnam table 1 this underestimation is similar to the results from re analysis era 4 0 data phan and ngo duc 2009 it may be attributed to the lapse rate due to complex topography we further assessed merra 2 datasets in terms of trend estimation at 31 stations that have both precipitation and air temperature datasets longer than 15 years a comparison between merra 2 and observed precipitation trend is given in fig 4 a the estimated annual precipitation trend from merra 2 exhibited a reasonable agreement with observed values with a correlation coefficient of 0 540 p 0 01 the estimated annual air temperature from merra 2 demonstrated a slightly better relationship with observed air temperature r value 0 600 p 0 001 fig 4 b the spei which were calculated from precipitation and air temperature at the same location also exhibited a reasonable relationship between modelled and observed data r value 0 577 p 0 001 fig 4 c in short the above results demonstrate that merra 2 is adequate to investigate climate change and drought characteristics in vietnam therefore in the next sections we will utilize the advantages of the merra 2 dataset in characterizing precipitation air temperature and drought trends over 30 years in vietnam 5 2 spatial temporal assessment on precipitation and air temperature characteristics in vietnam based on merra 2 dataset thirty year trends in annual precipitation and air temperature are given in figs 5 and 6 most of the northern parts of vietnam r1 r2 and r3 exhibited an increasing trend in precipitation on the contrary annual precipitation trends in the south of r6 r7 and r8 declined during the study period the most significant decreasing trend of annual precipitation can be observed partially in r6 and the northern portion of r5 and a similar decreasing trend over these regions have also been observed during the winter season vu and mishra 2016 overall the total areas with significant increasing trends in precipitation were 25 7 25 7 and 26 5 in 1 9 and 36 km resolutions respectively significant decreasing trends in precipitation were also found in 11 4 11 8 and 11 8 of the total area in 1 9 and 36 km resolutions respectively although different spatial resolutions of precipitation and air temperature merra 2 products showed similar spatial patterns the 1 km product provided more detailed spatial variation in trends compared to the other two in the past thirty years the temperature in vietnam went through a significant increase throughout the country especially in the southern part figs 5 b and 6 b the highest increase rate was found in r6 the rapid increase of the temperature in southern vietnam was also found in nguyen et al 2014 our data show that 40 3 40 5 and 40 2 of the total land area in vietnam exhibited significant increasing trends based on 1 9 and 36 km products respectively again the 1 km product could provide more variation details in temperature trends than the other two 5 3 spatial temporal assessment on drought characteristics in vietnam based on merra 2 datasets in this section we assess drought characteristics and trends for the entire land in each sub region of vietnam figs 7 and 8 shows regionally averaged drought frequency and severity for spei generally regions with a higher frequency of drought show higher drought severity in absolute values inferring a possibly positive correlation between the two metrics of drought the drought prone areas were found in the r5 r6 r7 and r8 regions the drought problems in r5 r6 and r8 were in line with observed records hoc 2002 ngo et al 2020 nguyen and shaw 2011 interestingly we detected high values in drought frequency and drought severity in r7 however not many records of droughts were observed in this region by comparison with other regions the reason that drought is less noticeable in r7 may be that this region primarily cultivates cash crops e g pepper coffee rubber and cashew which require less water supply and perform good drought resilience therefore unfavorable climate conditions may not significantly affect the productivity of these crops note that r4 only ranked sixth of eight regions in terms of drought frequency and severity it exhibited many outliers possibly caused by large variations in rainfall and air temperature in this region see appendix 3 overall the three spatial resolutions provided similar drought characteristics information however higher resolution datasets exhibited more spatial details in the variation of drought characteristics demonstrating a higher number of outliers trends of severity and frequency of droughts are presented in figs 9 and 10 spatial patterns of these trends can roughly be characterized as having a north south contrast similar to the patterns found in the trends of precipitation and air temperature figs 5 and 6 both wetting in the northern region and drying in the southern region were found to be most significant based on spei the increasing trend in drought frequency and severity in the southern part is more widespread with the most significant areas p 0 05 found in the northern and central part of r8 which might reflect the prevalent decreasing trend of precipitation and the increasing trend of air temperature in the same region table 3 presents descriptive statistics of significant decreasing increasing trends in terms of drought frequency in different spatial resolutions during 1989 2018 the drought frequency exhibited a significant reduction in r3 in 62 8 66 0 and 60 0 of total land based on 1 9 and 36 km respectively on the contrary significant increasing trends in drought frequency were found in the r5 and r8 regions according to 1 9 and 36 km products drought frequency significantly increased to 9 59 9 19 and 10 69 of the total land in r5 respectively these magnitudes for r8 regions were 13 40 13 55 and 17 39 of total land respectively regarding drought severity absolute values during 1989 2018 descriptive statistics of significant decreasing increasing trends are given in table 4 a similar observation in drought severity compared to drought frequency r3 exhibited the most decreasing trends in drought severity while r5 and r8 experienced the most increasing trends the proportion of land in decreasing increasing trends in drought severity were largely similar to these figures in drought frequency but averaged a difference of around 2 5 4 comparison between pda estimated from spei and actual agricultural record pda fig 11 presents scatterplots between three different pda estimated from spei and that from record data at r4 and r5 regions during 1989 2014 overall the distribution patterns of scattered points of all three different resolution products are similar for both sub regions however the 1 km dataset has a better agreement with the pdas based on the observed records compared to the coarse resolution products 9 km and 36 km the average correlation coefficient r value between the 1 km pda product and pda from record data was 0 807 these figures for 9 km and 36 km products were 0 792 and 0 779 respectively for each spatial resolution when we compared pda estimated from different land cover pda e pda as and pda ad there was evidence that the pda ad exhibited better agreement with pda from the data records first the slopes from pda ad products were closer to the 1 1 line than these slopes from pda e and pda as second r values between pda ad and pda observation were generally higher than r values from others overall a better estimation of percentage drought areas in agricultural lands based on spei was found at the higher resolution dataset and in using dynamic land cover note that using a constant land cover to estimate pda also provided comparable results with using dynamic land cover this validation has a limitation we only examined pda ad in r4 and r5 which had no significant changes in agricultural land over the study period however they still provide the first identification of potential usefulness of using dynamic land cover 5 5 assessing spatio temporal dynamics drought from high resolution data sets it is important to understand total agricultural land in drought in each month for the past 30 years 1989 2018 in the previous section 1 km pda ad exhibited the best overall among others in terms of estimation of pda in agricultural land in the r4 and r5 region therefore we used this product to explore the historical agricultural lands in drought conditions over vietnam during 1989 2018 figs 12 and 13 generally droughts in agricultural land throughout sub regions occurred every 1 2 years which is in agreement with the conclusions of hoc 2002 after 2010 the pda was found less severe in north vietnam r1 3 but more severe in south vietnam r7 8 during extreme el niño conditions 1998 2002 2005 2010 and 2014 16 drought nearly occurred in all sub regions with pda up to 100 in many months it was also found that extreme drought conditions high pda in consecutive months during el niño years were more pronounced in sub regions from r5 toward the south reflecting the fact that these sub regions are more sensitive to el niño conditions this finding is in agreement with previous studies le et al 2019b during 1989 2018 agricultural land in northern vietnam went through the long lasting drought in 1989 1991 in r2 and r3 regions nearly 100 of agricultural lands were in drought condition during may to december 1989 and may to december 1990 note that the drought of 1989 1992 may not be directly linked to the el niño event since the most recent el niño condition during that time was 1987 1988 and was followed by a la niña event from 1988 1989 generally el niño conditions cause less rainfall and increased temperatures for vietnam while la niña conditions bring more rainfall nguyen and shaw 2011 also reported droughts in r2 r3 and r5 over the course of 1989 1991 in southern vietnam during the 30 year study period the 2014 16 drought caused the worst conditions in agricultural regions in r6 r7 and r8 during summer autumn winter period may november of 2014 and 2015 the pda ad were estimated at around 80 100 in r6 this situation is even worse for r7 and r8 extreme drought conditions pda 80 were found in july august 2013 for these both regions agricultural lands in drought conditions were continuously found from may to december 2014 may december 2015 and january april 2016 from 1 km pda ad the end of 2014 16 historical drought seems to be at the end of april 2016 lower pda observed after that month this is similar to the actual record as the reports in the losses due to drought for r6 and r8 were also estimated up to april 2016 ngo et al 2020 up to that month total land losses due to 2014 16 drought and saline intrusion in r5 r6 and r8 were 242 215 ha paddy rice 55 651 ha fruit trees 104 106 ha perennial cash crops and 4 641 ha aquaculture more than 400 000 households equivalent to 1 5 million people were limited access to drinking water ngo et al 2020 5 6 limitations and further studies although the merra 2 dataset exhibited an overall reasonable relationship with ground observation it somehow overestimates or underestimates dryness and wetness as well as often underestimates precipitation and air temperature in vietnam therefore trend analysis in high error areas should be judged carefully for example northern r6 and northern r5 regarding the validation of pda from agricultural land this study could only obtain drought records data in r4 and r5 thus limiting a comprehensive assessment of pda estimated from spei and actual agricultural record pda for the entire study region this study mainly explores drought conditions from a meteorological perspective which is a combination between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration i e calculated from air temperature future study could work on a combination of multi drought impact factors actual evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture and soil temperature for such poorly gauged conditions land surface models could be a potential approach to obtain these hydrological variables listed above in this study we focused on investigating the applicability of finer resolution disaggregated reanalysis data in drought analysis it is worth noting that the original spatial resolution of merra 2 data is about 50 km but we intentionally included only 36 km spei results in this study because we plan a future comparison of the present research with satellite based drought indices drought indices employing soil moisture data obtained from soil moisture active passive smap data will be 36 km because smap s original spatial resolution is 36 km entekhabi et al 2010 in the planned future study the results shown here will be compared with drought indices from satellite based soil moisture data 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the ability of a high resolution re analysis dataset and dynamic land cover to capture drought conditions over data sparse areas in vietnam the 3 month spei was calculated to assess drought trends and its spatio temporal characteristics using three different spatial resolution datasets from the merra 2 datasets on a monthly time scale from 1989 to 2018 by comparing with in situ measurements merra 2 exhibited an overall good relationship with these measurements median r value and mae for precipitation 0 809 and 57 5 mm respectively median r value and mae for air temperature 0 977 and 1 14 c respectively it suggests the adequacy of merra 2 for studies in vietnam for drought analysis regarding trend analysis along with the observed significant trends in precipitation and air temperature spei showed increasing decreasing trends in drought severity and frequency in the southern northern part of vietnam the significant increasing trends of these drought characteristics were found mostly in r5 and r8 the high spatial resolutions of merra 2 used in this study allowed us to identify the contrast in drought trends between the northern wetting decreasing and southern drying increasing parts of vietnam which are generally shown in coarser climate model simulations we designed an experiment which compared the percentage drought area pda estimated based on different land use data sets with pda from observed records overall the results support the hypothesis that 1 higher spatial resolution of drought indices help to accurately characterize and monitor drought events and 2 pda using dynamic land cover scenarios results in better agreement with the observed records over the 30 year study period southern vietnam underwent unfavorable climate conditions exhibiting a reduction in rainfall and an increase in temperature which consequently increased the risk of drought frequency and severity in this region of vietnam the 2014 16 drought seems to have produced the worst conditions in terms of temporal duration and spatial extent with the advent of higher spatial resolution data sets specifically for soil moisture fang et al 2018 kim and lakshmi 2018 narayan and lakshmi 2008 add information to ecohydrology billah et al 2015 hong et al 2007 lakshmi et al 2011 and help to understand the connectivity between hydrology meteorology and ecology in conclusion this study emphasizes the feasibility of drought analysis using re analysis datasets in areas where observations are scarce as we currently have a wide range of re analysis datasets produced by different institutions we expect more accurate global scale drought monitoring with high resolution model datasets to become possible in future studies

8314,study region vietnam study focus in recent years vietnam has experienced historical drought events possibly affected by climate change but the analysis is challenging due to lack of necessary observations for monitoring drought conditions the goal of this study is to analyze the characteristics of droughts over a 30 year period using three spatial resolution merra 2 datasets in vietnam the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was used as an index for drought based on precipitation and temperature we also estimated the impacts of drought on agriculture using annual land cover datasets new hydrological insights for the regions our results identified significant increasing trends in precipitation in northern vietnam and decreasing trends in southern vietnam the increasing trends in temperature occurred mainly in southern vietnam these trends in rainfall and temperature resulted in an increasing trend in drought frequency and severity in southern vietnam especially in the south central region and the mekong delta the comparison between the observed drought records and modeled drought index demonstrated that the simulated drought conditions are better at higher spatial resolution the area under drought in agricultural lands calculated using dynamic land cover data sets resulted in a better agreement with observed records our findings reveal the feasibility of using a model based drought index in data sparse areas for long term trend drought analysis and for practical applications of advanced re analysis products in water resource management keywords hydrology drought merra 2 trend analysis land cover 1 introduction the slowly evolving nature of drought and its multiple drivers contribute to the various definitions adopted for different purposes and diverse conclusions in identifying the trends under changing climate dai 2011 van loon et al 2016 while a global trend of drought over the last century remains debatable greve et al 2014 orlowsky and seneviratne 2013 sheffield et al 2012 some regions of the world have observed robust tendencies that droughts are becoming more frequent and severe drying trends were found in equatorial africa diem et al 2014 kawase et al 2010 south asia krishnan et al 2016 and the mediterranean hoerling et al 2012 valdes abellan et al 2017 in contrast to wetting trends in high latitude regions sheffield and wood 2008 zhang et al 2013 notably in recent years several extreme droughts have been observed california ganguli and ganguly 2016 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 australia herold et al 2016 china yuan et al 2019 europe miralles et al 2019 and india sharma and mujumdar 2017 these droughts occurred concurrently with extreme heatwaves causing severe socioeconomic and ecological damages and are likely to occur with increased frequency such possibly intensified impacts of drought compounded by its intricate characteristics demands a substantially improved quality of observations for proper monitoring and management in many regions of the world while impacts of varying temporal scales on the efficiency of drought indices are well documented raziei et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 zuo et al 2018 only a few studies have investigated the performances of drought indices at different spatial scales golian et al 2019 found that the values of critical success index csi derived from products of multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep at coarser resolution 0 5 and 1 as significantly lower skill in drought detection for severe drought events compared to the csi computed from the mswep data at 0 1 additionally raziei et al 2013 demonstrated that the dependence of the spatial patterns of droughts on time scales increased when using higher spatial resolution data in light of this it seems that the drought indices computed from the high resolution data have greater potential to accurately describe the spatial characteristics of drought conditions than those derived from coarser resolution data previous studies have focused on drought indices based on the data sets with relatively coarser resolution e g larger than 10 km while the analyses that assess the performance of the drought indices at finer spatial resolutions e g less than 10 km have seldom been studied drought risk in agricultural regions is essential information however this information is currently limited by using static datasets for example when rojas et al 2011 and winkler et al 2017 investigated agricultural areas affected by drought they only used a typical year to represent land cover for the entire study period however land cover especially for agricultural land is subjected to change over time due to international trade climate adaptation urbanization industrialization food security and economic policies rutten et al 2014 therefore in order to accurately evaluate drought conditions in agricultural locations it is required to use a dynamic land cover database to reflect spatial changes in land cover over time to the best of our knowledge previous studies have not used dynamic land cover for drought assessment in this study we aim to examine three hypotheses viz 1 does high spatial resolution data detect drought trends better than low spatial resolution data 2 does high spatial resolution data have advantages of capturing drought events better than low spatial resolution data 3 does dynamic land cover provide better information on agricultural lands affected by drought over the years we selected the country of vietnam as a case study to test our hypotheses firstly drought investigation is of paramount importance for vietnam as this disaster ranked third among economic losses amongst natural hazards in the country nguyen and shaw 2011 secondly most of the studies which assessed droughts in vietnam are either based on sparsely distributed in situ observations le et al 2019b vu thanh et al 2014 or relatively coarse spatial resolution data vu and mishra 2016 vu et al 2018 therefore high spatial resolution drought datasets are unexplored in vietnam moreover we can obtain annual land cover information for vietnam for the past 30 years from servir mekong land use land cover portal this land cover database could enable us to examine our third hypotheses mentioned above this study selected the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 to estimate drought conditions in vietnam this index is an appropriate drought index in examining changes in droughts under global warming le et al 2019a lópez moreno et al 2013 wang et al 2018 and in representing different drought types such as meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts chen and sun 2015 we estimated the spei at three spatial resolutions 1 9 and 36 km using precipitation and air temperature from the second modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra 2 one of the main reasons that we chose merra 2 is that the data has been widely validated showing good performance globally readers will find representative research at https gmao gsfc nasa gov reanalysis merra 2 pubs furthermore as merra 2 is open to the public and allows the downloading of near real time data it has great potential for practical application in drought analysis to investigate agricultural drought areas we extracted agricultural land cover in each year from servir mekong land use land cover database and re sampled the data to 1 9 and 36 km to explore the possible trends in a time series we applied the mann kendall test which is commonly used to detect trends in hydro meteorological time series joshi et al 2019 mondal et al 2015 velpuri and senay 2013 this study is organized as follows section 2

vietnam has a total area of 331 212 km2 extending from 8 2 n 23 5 n 101 1 e 110 3 e and a home of more than 95 million people in 2018 ranked 15th in global population in order to assess drought condition in vietnam previous studies often divided it into seven subregions that are based on differences in climatic conditions le et al 2019b vu et al 2018 this study however divided vietnam into eight sub regions based on a sub national administrative level this allows for easy comparison with existing agricultural drought statistics these eight sub regions are northwestern region r1 northeastern region r2 red river delta r3 north central region r4 south central region r5 central highlands r6 southeastern region r7 and the mekong delta r8 fig 1 3 data sets 3 1 ground observations this study collected monthly data from 215 precipitation stations and 74 temperature stations from multiple sources including vietnam meteorological and hydrological administration vmha mekong river commission mrc and japan international cooperation agency jica fig 1 all data has passed quality checks we used these in situ observations to compare with precipitation and air temperature from merra 2 datasets data availability at each station varied between 40 and 360 months fig 1 descriptive statistics of observed precipitation and air temperature in each sub region can be found at table 1 also mean elevation and gini simpson index are presented in table 2 for eight sub regions we obtained 1989 2014 data on agricultural land affected by drought for the r4 and r5 regions from the vietnamese ministry of agriculture and rural development mard the decree no 01 2008 nd cp on responsibilities tasks authorities and organization structure of mard ministry of agriculture and rural development is a state agency carrying out tasks of state management on such fields as agriculture forestry salt industry aquaculture water resource and rural development in the country of state management on public services and fields under the management of the ministry the mard has its department located in each province through vietnam officials from these departments conduct annual surveys on agricultural activities lands within their provinces to obtain statistical records on natural disasters and the development of these activities 3 2 the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 is the latest atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by nasa s global modeling and assimilation office gmao the goals of merra 2 are to provide a regularly gridded homogeneous record of the global atmosphere and to incorporate additional aspects of the climate system gelaro et al 2017 the superior feature of merra 2 over its predecessor merra is that it assimilates several observation types and includes updates to the goddard earth observing system geos model and analysis scheme this allows it to provide a feasible ongoing climate analysis merra 2 includes ground based remotely sensed data and numerous satellite observations both before and after the introduction of noaa 18 satellite in 2005 the complete set of input observations assimilated in merra 2 is summarized in gelaro et al 2017 and detailed description of these data uses shown in mccarty et al 2016 in this study the bilinear transform was used to produce 0 01 0 01 1 km 0 09 0 09 9 km and 0 36 0 36 36 km spatial resolutions of merra 2 derived precipitation and air temperature forcing

dataset high resolution 30 m land cover data for vietnam during 1989 2018 were obtained from the land cover portal website maintained by servir mekong https rlcms servir adpc net en landcover this system provides consistent land cover products at regular intervals with quality control from multiple sources based on these yearly land cover data we determined agricultural land areas sum of croplands and rice paddies from servir mekong s classification and calculated the area percentage of drought on a monthly basis this work enables us to precisely estimate drought areas for agricultural regions only and not for other land covers since we used merra 2 datasets with three different spatial resolutions 1 9 and 36 km the land cover datasets were also re sampled from 30 m to these corresponding resolutions the temporal percentage change of agricultural land in vietnam at three spatial resolutions is given in fig 2 the r3 and r8 are two deltas corresponding to the two largest river basins in vietnam red thai binh river and mekong river respectively therefore agricultural lands in these regions account for a large proportion of the total land over the years for 30 years agricultural land in r7 experienced a significant reduction while that land in r6 exhibited a considerable increase comparing agricultural land estimated from three spatial resolutions 1 9 and 36 km higher spatial resolution land cover datasets seem to have smoother inter annual changes over 1989 2018 and to be closer with these figures of original land cover dataset fig 2 different agricultural land resolution datasets can result in a significant difference in percentage of total agricultural land for example in r8 the agricultural land was around 90 of the total land with a 36 km land cover dataset but 73 with the 1 km land cover dataset the large inhomogeneous distribution of land cover is probably a result of the different agricultural land estimations given when we used different spatial resolutions an example of agricultural land in r3 in different spatial resolutions is given in supplementary 1 in short the agricultural land in vietnam exhibited a great variation in both temporal and spatial scales therefore drought evaluation in agricultural land in vietnam requires a rigorous information for a better estimate 4 methodology 4 1 temporal trend analysis the mann kendall mk test was performed to analyze the trends of precipitation temperature and drought conditions the mk test is a non parametric test that statistically assesses the monotonic trends in data over time hirsch and slack 1984 kendall 1938 mann 1945 we selected this non parametric test because our data sets are not normally distributed and this test is distribution free gocic and trajkovic 2014 for purpose of robustness in the presence of autocorrelation time series which could affect trend interpretation results yue et al 2002 we removed the serial correlation effect using the pre whitening method before applying the mk test gocic and trajkovic 2014 then the sen s slope sen 1968 was used to examine the magnitude of trends 4 2 characteristics of drought dynamics from merra 2 s precipitation and air temperature for each grid cell we calculated the spei throughout vietnam at three spatial resolutions 1 9 and 36 km we employed three parameter log logistic distribution for fitting spei a negative value of spei indicates that a particular value of the water related variable is lower than the median of the total distribution a drought event occurs when the spei value reaches 1 or lower the water related time series spei requires a deficit between precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet we calculated pet from air temperature data based on the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 in the present study we used a 3 month timescale which was estimated by accumulating three consecutive months of p et this 3 month timescale often reflects a shortage of water availability for agricultural uses svoboda et al 2012 temporal drought characteristics were analyzed using drought frequency f and drought severity s le et al 2019b the details regarding these drought characteristics are the following eqs 1 and 2 1 f i 1 m d u i n 100 where d u i is i t h drought duration which is the number of consecutive months in which the spei is below 1 m is the number of drought duration n is the total months 2 s i 1 d u d i i d i i 1 where d i i is spei at month i for assessing drought in space we used a binary approach to represent drought state d s t at time step t for each grid cell as follows 3 d s t 1 i f d i t 1 0 i f d i t 1 where d i t is the value of drought index at time step t for a given region the percentage drought area at time step t p d a t is a ratio between total number cells in drought and the total number of cells in the region n t o t a l 4 p d a t i 1 n t o t a l d s t d i t 1 n t o t a l 100 we estimated three monthly percentage drought area pda datasets the first dataset is the percentage drought area for the entire region hereafter referred to as pda e which is equivalent to the total land area of a region the second dataset is the percentage of drought area for agricultural land using static land cover hereafter pda as n t o t a l in the second case is equivalent to total agricultural land of 2005 which represents for the period 1989 and 2018 the cells in drought are counted for the agricultural land in the year of 2005 the third dataset is the percentage of drought area for agricultural land using dynamic land cover hereafter pda ad n t o t a l in the third case is equivalent to total agricultural land of the year i i 1989 1990 2018 the cells in drought are counted for the agricultural land each year we compared these three estimated pdas with record pdas in r4 and r5 regions since the record pdas datasets are only available annually we averaged monthly pdas from our estimations to an annual basis to have the same temporal time step as the actual data 5 results and discussion 5 1 assessment on merra 2 s precipitation and air temperature in vietnam over our region of interest there is no prior research of validating merra 2 using in situ measurement therefore we conducted a validation study before applying merra 2 data for drought analysis to do that we extract grid values of merra 2 to ground observation points using the nearest neighbor method we used this method to preserve the values at different spatial resolutions in total for each precipitation and air temperature dataset three comparisons were made between merra 2 datasets 1 9 and 36 km and in situ measurements since the results were found similar in each spatial resolution of merra 2 product this section only presents evaluation results of 1 km merra 2 in terms of correlation coefficient r value and mean absolute error mae fig 3 the results of 9 and 36 km merra 2 can be found in supplementary 2 generally precipitation from merra 2 exhibited a good agreement with the precipitation from in situ data with median r value of 0 809 fig 3 a the merra 2 precipitation exhibited relatively poor correlation with in situ dataset in central highlands r6 specifically in its northern part this can probably be attributed to a combination of a typical bimodal south asian summer monsoon interacting with complex topography phan and ngo duc 2009 tuan 2019 van der linden et al 2016 the merra 2 precipitation product itself observed many outlier values in the r6 region see supplementary 3 note that the r1 r2 and r5 regions also have high gini simpson indices table 2 but their monsoon circulation is not as complex as that of the r6 region nguyen and nguyen 2004 with respect to air temperature a very good relationship between merra 2 and in situ data was found with a median r value of 0 977 among sub regions only the north mekong delta north r8 exhibited a moderate relationship median r value of 0 75 the mae values between precipitation and air temperature from merra 2 and these from in situ data is given in fig 3 b the median mae value of precipitation was 57 5 mm high precipitation mae values 150 mm were found at several stations in north r5 and in northwest r2 fig 3 b 1 these high values can probably be attributed to the typical local rainfall problem the stations in these areas are located at the base of mountains i e truong son mountains and tay con linh mountains meaning they receive the highest rainfall amounts in vietnam 3 500 4 300 mm annually due to orographic rainfall with such typical very high rainfall observed merra 2 often underestimates the rainfall during the rainy season previous studies also revealed large underestimation of satellite based and re analysis rainfall datasets in central vietnam where observed rainfall is extremely high 3000 mm le et al 2020 the median mae values of merra 2 s air temperature was 1 14 c fig 3 b 2 except for r6 merra 2 dataset generally underestimated air temperature over vietnam table 1 this underestimation is similar to the results from re analysis era 4 0 data phan and ngo duc 2009 it may be attributed to the lapse rate due to complex topography we further assessed merra 2 datasets in terms of trend estimation at 31 stations that have both precipitation and air temperature datasets longer than 15 years a comparison between merra 2 and observed precipitation trend is given in fig 4 a the estimated annual precipitation trend from merra 2 exhibited a reasonable agreement with observed values with a correlation coefficient of 0 540 p 0 01 the estimated annual air temperature from merra 2 demonstrated a slightly better relationship with observed air temperature r value 0 600 p 0 001 fig 4 b the spei which were calculated from precipitation and air temperature at the same location also exhibited a reasonable relationship between modelled and observed data r value 0 577 p 0 001 fig 4 c in short the above results demonstrate that merra 2 is adequate to investigate climate change and drought characteristics in vietnam therefore in the next sections we will utilize the advantages of the merra 2 dataset in characterizing precipitation air temperature and drought trends over 30 years in vietnam 5 2 spatial temporal assessment on precipitation and air temperature characteristics in vietnam based on merra 2 dataset thirty year trends in annual precipitation and air temperature are given in figs 5 and 6 most of the northern parts of vietnam r1 r2 and r3 exhibited an increasing trend in precipitation on the contrary annual precipitation trends in the south of r6 r7 and r8 declined during the study period the most significant decreasing trend of annual precipitation can be observed partially in r6 and the northern portion of r5 and a similar decreasing trend over these regions have also been observed during the winter season vu and mishra 2016 overall the total areas with significant increasing trends in precipitation were 25 7 25 7 and 26 5 in 1 9 and 36 km resolutions respectively significant decreasing trends in precipitation were also found in 11 4 11 8 and 11 8 of the total area in 1 9 and 36 km resolutions respectively although different spatial resolutions of precipitation and air temperature merra 2 products showed similar spatial patterns the 1 km product provided more detailed spatial variation in trends compared to the other two in the past thirty years the temperature in vietnam went through a significant increase throughout the country especially in the southern part figs 5 b and 6 b the highest increase rate was found in r6 the rapid increase of the temperature in southern vietnam was also found in nguyen et al 2014 our data show that 40 3 40 5 and 40 2 of the total land area in vietnam exhibited significant increasing trends based on 1 9 and 36 km products respectively again the 1 km product could provide more variation details in temperature trends than the other two 5 3 spatial temporal assessment on drought characteristics in vietnam based on merra 2 datasets in this section we assess drought characteristics and trends for the entire land in each sub region of vietnam figs 7 and 8 shows regionally averaged drought frequency and severity for spei generally regions with a higher frequency of drought show higher drought severity in absolute values inferring a possibly positive correlation between the two metrics of drought the drought prone areas were found in the r5 r6 r7 and r8 regions the drought problems in r5 r6 and r8 were in line with observed records hoc 2002 ngo et al 2020 nguyen and shaw 2011 interestingly we detected high values in drought frequency and drought severity in r7 however not many records of droughts were observed in this region by comparison with other regions the reason that drought is less noticeable in r7 may be that this region primarily cultivates cash crops e g pepper coffee rubber and cashew which require less water supply and perform good drought resilience therefore unfavorable climate conditions may not significantly affect the productivity of these crops note that r4 only ranked sixth of eight regions in terms of drought frequency and severity it exhibited many outliers possibly caused by large variations in rainfall and air temperature in this region see appendix 3 overall the three spatial resolutions provided similar drought characteristics information however higher resolution datasets exhibited more spatial details in the variation of drought characteristics demonstrating a higher number of outliers trends of severity and frequency of droughts are presented in figs 9 and 10 spatial patterns of these trends can roughly be characterized as having a north south contrast similar to the patterns found in the trends of precipitation and air temperature figs 5 and 6 both wetting in the northern region and drying in the southern region were found to be most significant based on spei the increasing trend in drought frequency and severity in the southern part is more widespread with the most significant areas p 0 05 found in the northern and central part of r8 which might reflect the prevalent decreasing trend of precipitation and the increasing trend of air temperature in the same region table 3 presents descriptive statistics of significant decreasing increasing trends in terms of drought frequency in different spatial resolutions during 1989 2018 the drought frequency exhibited a significant reduction in r3 in 62 8 66 0 and 60 0 of total land based on 1 9 and 36 km respectively on the contrary significant increasing trends in drought frequency were found in the r5 and r8 regions according to 1 9 and 36 km products drought frequency significantly increased to 9 59 9 19 and 10 69 of the total land in r5 respectively these magnitudes for r8 regions were 13 40 13 55 and 17 39 of total land respectively regarding drought severity absolute values during 1989 2018 descriptive statistics of significant decreasing increasing trends are given in table 4 a similar observation in drought severity compared to drought frequency r3 exhibited the most decreasing trends in drought severity while r5 and r8 experienced the most increasing trends the proportion of land in decreasing increasing trends in drought severity were largely similar to these figures in drought frequency but averaged a difference of around 2 5 4 comparison between pda estimated from spei and actual agricultural record pda fig 11 presents scatterplots between three different pda estimated from spei and that from record data at r4 and r5 regions during 1989 2014 overall the distribution patterns of scattered points of all three different resolution products are similar for both sub regions however the 1 km dataset has a better agreement with the pdas based on the observed records compared to the coarse resolution products 9 km and 36 km the average correlation coefficient r value between the 1 km pda product and pda from record data was 0 807 these figures for 9 km and 36 km products were 0 792 and 0 779 respectively for each spatial resolution when we compared pda estimated from different land cover pda e pda as and pda ad there was evidence that the pda ad exhibited better agreement with pda from the data records first the slopes from pda ad products were closer to the 1 1 line than these slopes from pda e and pda as second r values between pda ad and pda observation were generally higher than r values from others overall a better estimation of percentage drought areas in agricultural lands based on spei was found at the higher resolution dataset and in using dynamic land cover note that using a constant land cover to estimate pda also provided comparable results with using dynamic land cover this validation has a limitation we only examined pda ad in r4 and r5 which had no significant changes in agricultural land over the study period however they still provide the first identification of potential usefulness of using dynamic land cover 5 5 assessing spatio temporal dynamics drought from high resolution data sets it is important to understand total agricultural land in drought in each month for the past 30 years 1989 2018 in the previous section 1 km pda ad exhibited the best overall among others in terms of estimation of pda in agricultural land in the r4 and r5 region therefore we used this product to explore the historical agricultural lands in drought conditions over vietnam during 1989 2018 figs 12 and 13 generally droughts in agricultural land throughout sub regions occurred every 1 2 years which is in agreement with the conclusions of hoc 2002 after 2010 the pda was found less severe in north vietnam r1 3 but more severe in south vietnam r7 8 during extreme el niño conditions 1998 2002 2005 2010 and 2014 16 drought nearly occurred in all sub regions with pda up to 100 in many months it was also found that extreme drought conditions high pda in consecutive months during el niño years were more pronounced in sub regions from r5 toward the south reflecting the fact that these sub regions are more sensitive to el niño conditions this finding is in agreement with previous studies le et al 2019b during 1989 2018 agricultural land in northern vietnam went through the long lasting drought in 1989 1991 in r2 and r3 regions nearly 100 of agricultural lands were in drought condition during may to december 1989 and may to december 1990 note that the drought of 1989 1992 may not be directly linked to the el niño event since the most recent el niño condition during that time was 1987 1988 and was followed by a la niña event from 1988 1989 generally el niño conditions cause less rainfall and increased temperatures for vietnam while la niña conditions bring more rainfall nguyen and shaw 2011 also reported droughts in r2 r3 and r5 over the course of 1989 1991 in southern vietnam during the 30 year study period the 2014 16 drought caused the worst conditions in agricultural regions in r6 r7 and r8 during summer autumn winter period may november of 2014 and 2015 the pda ad were estimated at around 80 100 in r6 this situation is even worse for r7 and r8 extreme drought conditions pda 80 were found in july august 2013 for these both regions agricultural lands in drought conditions were continuously found from may to december 2014 may december 2015 and january april 2016 from 1 km pda ad the end of 2014 16 historical drought seems to be at the end of april 2016 lower pda observed after that month this is similar to the actual record as the reports in the losses due to drought for r6 and r8 were also estimated up to april 2016 ngo et al 2020 up to that month total land losses due to 2014 16 drought and saline intrusion in r5 r6 and r8 were 242 215 ha paddy rice 55 651 ha fruit trees 104 106 ha perennial cash crops and 4 641 ha aquaculture more than 400 000 households equivalent to 1 5 million people were limited access to drinking water ngo et al 2020 5 6 limitations and further studies although the merra 2 dataset exhibited an overall reasonable relationship with ground observation it somehow overestimates or underestimates dryness and wetness as well as often underestimates precipitation and air temperature in vietnam therefore trend analysis in high error areas should be judged carefully for example northern r6 and northern r5 regarding the validation of pda from agricultural land this study could only obtain drought records data in r4 and r5 thus limiting a comprehensive assessment of pda estimated from spei and actual agricultural record pda for the entire study region this study mainly explores drought conditions from a meteorological perspective which is a combination between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration i e calculated from air temperature future study could work on a combination of multi drought impact factors actual evapotranspiration runoff soil moisture and soil temperature for such poorly gauged conditions land surface models could be a potential approach to obtain these hydrological variables listed above in this study we focused on investigating the applicability of finer resolution disaggregated reanalysis data in drought analysis it is worth noting that the original spatial resolution of merra 2 data is about 50 km but we intentionally included only 36 km spei results in this study because we plan a future comparison of the present research with satellite based drought indices drought indices employing soil moisture data obtained from soil moisture active passive smap data will be 36 km because smap s original spatial resolution is 36 km entekhabi et al 2010 in the planned future study the results shown here will be compared with drought indices from satellite based soil moisture data 6 conclusions in this study we investigated the ability of a high resolution re analysis dataset and dynamic land cover to capture drought conditions over data sparse areas in vietnam the 3 month spei was calculated to assess drought trends and its spatio temporal characteristics using three different spatial resolution datasets from the merra 2 datasets on a monthly time scale from 1989 to 2018 by comparing with in situ measurements merra 2 exhibited an overall good relationship with these measurements median r value and mae for precipitation 0 809 and 57 5 mm respectively median r value and mae for air temperature 0 977 and 1 14 c respectively it suggests the adequacy of merra 2 for studies in vietnam for drought analysis regarding trend analysis along with the observed significant trends in precipitation and air temperature spei showed increasing decreasing trends in drought severity and frequency in the southern northern part of vietnam the significant increasing trends of these drought characteristics were found mostly in r5 and r8 the high spatial resolutions of merra 2 used in this study allowed us to identify the contrast in drought trends between the northern wetting decreasing and southern drying increasing parts of vietnam which are generally shown in coarser climate model simulations we designed an experiment which compared the percentage drought area pda estimated based on different land use data sets with pda from observed records overall the results support the hypothesis that 1 higher spatial resolution of drought indices help to accurately characterize and monitor drought events and 2 pda using dynamic land cover scenarios results in better agreement with the observed records over the 30 year study period southern vietnam underwent unfavorable climate conditions exhibiting a reduction in rainfall and an increase in temperature which consequently increased the risk of drought frequency and severity in this region of vietnam the 2014 16 drought seems to have produced the worst conditions in terms of temporal duration and spatial extent with the advent of higher spatial resolution data sets specifically for soil moisture fang et al 2018 kim and lakshmi 2018 narayan and lakshmi 2008 add information to ecohydrology billah et al 2015 hong et al 2007 lakshmi et al 2011 and help to understand the connectivity between hydrology meteorology and ecology in conclusion this study emphasizes the feasibility of drought analysis using re analysis datasets in areas where observations are scarce as we currently have a wide range of re analysis datasets produced by different institutions we expect more accurate global scale drought monitoring with high resolution model datasets to become possible in future studies
