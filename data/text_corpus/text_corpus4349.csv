21745,in recent years under the advocacy of ittc large scale model test technology has garnered significant attention from researchers all over the world increasingly sophisticated test equipment and a large amount of experimental experience have promoted the development and improvement of test technology here a 25 m long bulk carrier model was built as the research object the self propulsion test about propulsion performance in real sea environment was conducted in the coastal waters of northern china the manoeuvrability test proved that the designed ship model integrated system was reliable the effects of complex wake field environments on the propulsion performance were studied using the equal thrust and equal torque methods the results indicated that the complex wake field environment causes the torque to increase by 2 11 and the thrust loss ranges from 3 to 15 when the propeller was operated at a high rotating speed the torque and thrust in the oblique wave tended to decrease by 1 3 compared to the propulsion performance in the head wave in addition the more severe sea state caused the propeller torque to decrease and the thrust to increase keywords large scale model self propulsion test manoeuvrability test propulsion performance 1 introduction in the design stage of a ship rapidity dong et al 2008 manoeuvrability perez and clemente 2007 and seakeeping ability szelangiewicz and cepowski 2002 are essential aspects that require research a scale model test watson 2002 is one of the main research methods classical experimental studies have mostly been conducted in towing tanks however due to the presence of blockage effects zhao et al 2016 the geometric dimensions of the model such as length width and draft should not exceed a threshold value and thus the scale effects are amplified dubrovsky and matveev 2006 moreover the towing basin test usually uses a wave generator to generate two dimensional tango waves or three dimensional pseudo random waves therefore the behaviour of the ship cannot be truly simulated in a sea wave environment numerical simulation technology song et al 2018 is also an important means to study ship performance with the development of modern computer technology the size of the research model is becoming increasingly large and large scale or full scale self propulsion simulation has received significant interest in recent years tezdogan et al 2015 haase et al 2016 niklas and pruszko 2019 jasak et al 2019 however these numerical simulations often lack the validation of physical tests therefore reliable and effective large scale or full scale model tests become especially important to overcome the limitations of existing model tests ittc 2005 stipulated that offshore model tests are feasible and necessary the self similarity of the wind made waves signifies that their dimensionless spectrum forms are the same thus in the model sea state the dynamic characteristics of the ship model are very close to the actual ones furthermore the experiment is carried out in open seas and the scale effect will be greatly reduced using large scale models relevant experimental techniques have been highlighted in the ittc 2008 2011 report therefore large scale model test technology in the natural environment has received sufficient attention and being significantly developed the large scale model test mainly includes three aspects structural load and response motions under waves and propulsion performance of the propeller serter 1993 reported a high speed military model test of radio control in a lake grigoropoulos and katsaounis 2004 conducted a large scale model wave resistance test in sheltered waters using a self developed portable six dof motion measurement system grigoropoulos and politis 1999 and a flange device for measuring shaft torque the advantages and disadvantages of test design specifications instruments and preparation were discussed quintana et al 2007 reported multiple scale model tests of the us destroyer ddg 1000 during the design phase and built a 1 4 scale model test to conduct ocean tests regarding the impact of human factors on naval warfare im and seo 2010 conducted a manoeuvrability test in open waters with a 3 m long free running remote control model coraddu et al 2013 conducted a manoeuvrability test on a 7 2 m long twin propeller model in a flat lake the shaft was equipped with a dynamometer to measure the thrust and torque of the propeller and the asymmetry of propulsion performance was studied fossati et al 2015 measured the wind and wave loads and movements of a 9 9 m long full size yacht while sailing on the sea sun et al 2015 from harbin engineering university conducted several near coastal large scale model wave resistance tests to study the structural load response and motion during 2006 2016 in recent years the model test technology for structural load response and motion has become more sophisticated while the test technology for propeller propulsion performance has not developed further researchers are attempting to overcome the technical difficulties in improvement of high precision instruments for measuring propeller propulsion performance however in past large scale model test research work most of the models used as research objects were shorter than 13 m and the researchers did not exceed this model size unlike these previous studies a 25 m ship model was analyzed in this study this larger size signifies the need to develop a wider range of measuring instruments further the control and measurement systems of the ship become more complex based on the previous studies we overcame the size limitation built a model of a bulk carrier with a length of 25 m and conducted a free running test in coastal waters the independent research and development of large scale high precision broken shaft self propulsion instruments is an important technological breakthrough in measuring propeller propulsion performance this paper presents a detailed introduction to the design and test process of a ship model test integrated system the manoeuvrability tests conducted here proved that the self designed control system has good practicability and stability using the equal thrust and equal torque methods the influence of waves on propeller performance is studied 2 model design 2 1 model construction taking a 23wt bulk carrier as the research object a glass fibre reinforced plastic frp model with a scale of 1 13 was established the hull is large in size and has a low speed it has a bulbous bow and a transom stern the parallel middle body accounts for about 4 5 of the total length and the tail profile shrinks sharply the hull and propeller are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively the main scale parameters of the ship model are shown in tables 1 and 2 the construction of the model refers to the construction specifications of chinese frp ships the ship model adopts a hybrid skeleton type and the hull is subdivided into 6 cabins the transverse bulkhead is provided with watertight doors the upper deck of each compartment has hatches and all opening positions are strengthened driving and data measurement work is done in a cab on the main deck 2 2 test system designing the ship model test system is a complex process and critical to guarantee the success of the test the large scale model test system can be divided into three parts control system data measurement and acquisition system and gps ins integrated navigation system the arrangement of the equipment is shown in fig 3 the framework relationship of the test system is shown in fig 4 the various subsystems are described below 2 2 1 control system the model control system was the core of the ship model driving which mainly includes the host computer the slave computer two servo motors for the propeller and rudder the host computer issued control commands using the windows 7 operating system and the control software was written using visual basic the user control interface displayed various parameters such as the rudder angle and the number of revolutions and could also change the motion of the ship model by inputting parameters through the control interface the slave computer received the command from the host computer and translated it into a real time signal to directly control the propeller control motor and the rudder control motor the lower computer read the status data of the servo motor and converted it into a digital signal for feedback to the host computer the propeller motor was rated at 15 kw and had a reduction ratio of 1 4 the rudder motor had a power of 3 kw and a reduction ratio of 1 10 2 2 2 gps ins integrated navigation system the commercial gps ins integrated navigation system consisted of gps antennas an ins core and a gnss receiver the integration receiver connected to the gps antennas and inertial sensor received real time motion information including speed track heading roll pitch and yaw rate four gps assisted receivers occupied the four vertices of the rectangle and were placed on top of the deck cab the inertial sensor was fixed at the deck and the triaxial sensor s axes were parallel to the ship s cartesian coordinate system the receiver was connected with the host computer and the user control interface could display the ship model motion data in real time the historical data were recorded in the hard disk of the upper computer the navigation system data were acquired at a frequency of 20 hz the speed error was less than 0 1 knots and the direction and roll tilt error was less than 0 1 2 2 3 data measurement and acquisition system the model used non remote sensing control at least two people were required on board to conduct the test work one person was responsible for driving and the other was responsible for data collection the data measurement and acquisition system consisted of three acceleration sensors a self developed instrument a data collector and a notebook computer the vertical acceleration of the hull and the thrust and torque of the propeller were the parameters measured the vertical motion of the hull was measured using an acceleration sensor the position of the acceleration sensor is shown in fig 2 the heave motion curve of the hull could be obtained by double integrating the acceleration curve in this test a self developed instrument see section 2 2 5 was independently developed to accurately measure the thrust and torque generated by the propeller a 32 channel commercial data collector was used to convert the measured electrical signals into digital signals for transmission to a laptop the data were recorded and analyzed in real time using dynamic signal analysis software 2 2 4 electricity supply the nonlinear complex vibration of the internal combustion engine affects the measurement of the propulsion performance and it requires a large amount of flowing air during operation with respect to safety servo motors are more suitable as ship model drives than internal combustion engines in the past model tests typically used batteries as the power source however the capacity of these batteries which could be used for approximately 2 h was significantly lesser that the capacity required for the 25 m model this test used a 30 kw fuel generator which allowed for a sailing time of 6 8 h this was sufficient time for one day of testing the fuel oil generator mainly provides an ac voltage of 380 v for the measuring instruments and other low power electric equipment for the lower level machine the power is supplied by a 12 v lead acid battery through a voltage transformer or voltage stabilization 2 2 5 self developed self propulsion instrument the thrust and torque of the propeller are the two most important indicators of the propulsion performance one of the core technologies of this test is the development of measuring instruments harbin engineering university independently developed a large scale high precision self propulsion instrument for a large scale model test a patent has already been filed for this invention fig 5 shows the basic structure of the self propulsion instrument including the thrust measuring unit and the torque measuring unit these two sets of independent measuring units were used to analyse the thrust and torque of the propeller allowing different strain units to undergo either axial or circumferential deformation which perfectly solves the crosstalk problem between the thrust and torque measurement instruments the non contact torque sensor combines the flexibility of digital signal conditioning with carrier frequency amplifier technology resulting in a significant increase in measurement accuracy 3 wave analysis the test site was in the coastal waters of qingdao china 120 22 e 35 91 n which is located in the northern part of the yellow sea in china the location is shown in fig 6 the wave information was sampled and analyzed by a buoy wave height gauge the gauge was placed at the central position of the test sea area about 3 nautical miles from the shore the sampling period of the wave height meter was 1 time h and the sampling time was 15 min the sampling data were transmitted to the computer with a fixed ip address through gprs communication the wave monitoring software analyzed the data and output the wave height period and wave direction in real time the wave instrument monitoring indicators are shown in table 3 jiao et al 2018 conducted several coastal wave measurements on several locations in the bohai sea and the yellow sea in china and determined that the main features of the coastal spectrum are in good agreement with the ocean spectrum further it was also determined that it is acceptable to conduct model tests in the sea 5 km from the coastline instead of deep ocean in order to verify the rationality of this view the measured wave spectrum is compared with the two parameter ocean spectrum recommended by ittc and issc the measured wave spectrum is obtained by analysis of the measured wave height data using spectral analysis method yue qin and shang xian 2000 the two parameter spectrum is not only suitable for fully developed ocean waves but also for growing ocean waves its general expression is as shown in eq 1 1 s ω 173 ξ w 3 2 t 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 4 ω 4 where ω is the natural circular frequency of the wave s ω is the spectral density ξ w 3 represents significant wave height t represents mean period the comparison between the measured wave spectrum and the two parameter spectrum is shown in fig 7 it is evident that the near shore wave spectrum has two spectral peaks this is because the wind direction in the coastal sea area is opposite to the direction of waves leading to the occurrence of different main peak frequencies however the main frequency range and trend of waves in the test sea area are basically consistent with the two parameter spectrum 4 test conditions and procedures 4 1 test conditions a manoeuvrability test of a large scale model and a self propulsion test in waves were conducted the manoeuvrability tests were conducted first to not only measure the manoeuvrability of the ship model but to also debug and improve the system and verify the feasibility of the ship model control system then the self propulsion test was conducted for different sea conditions and wave angles the test conditions are shown in tables 4 and 5 the sea wave environment is complex and the wave flow and wind directions are often inconsistent even diametrically opposite in fact estimation of the sea state mainly depends on the evaluation of the wave height sea states in table 5 following the international standard wave classification issued by the world meteorological organization represent the actual sea conditions of the full scale ship the significant wave heights corresponding to the sea conditions of grade 5 and 8 are 2 5 4 m 9 14 m respectively the encounter wave height of large scale model can be obtained with a scale of 1 13 the wave direction is judged by the eye of the experimenter according to the actual sea surface during the test the ship model has a large inertia and there is obvious hysteresis in the acceleration and braking process it is difficult to make the ship model sail at a constant speed during the test therefore the test was performed with a constant rotating speed and the speed tends towards a stable value within a certain range four motor speeds were voyaged under each condition 4 2 test procedure the ship model was launched at the shipyard near the test area and was usually parked in a safe haven the adjustment of the model system included gps equipment shafting influence rudder response and fluency of the control software system even though the weather and waves are uncontrollable they have a certain periodicity estimates of sea conditions were mainly derived from local weather forecasts and the wave trends were predicted using the wave height gauge each test process is presented below before the start of the test the equipment on the model was switched on and checked data acquisition channel is calibrated while the ship is in the haven then the auxiliary ship was sent to the sea area where the wave height gauge was located which was about 3 nautical miles offshore in the seakeeping test according to the test content the ship model travelled along the preset route for a fixed number of revolutions during the test the main wave direction of the surrounding waves was observed at all times and the video data of the sea state and the model movement were recorded after completing a certain speed scheme another speed was immediately tested in the same sea state when the sea conditions changed if the other sea conditions were met testing under the corresponding sea conditions was conducted immediately otherwise testing on that day was terminated after the test was completed the auxiliary ship assisted in returning to the haven the test data were recorded on the laptop and the host computer and the valid data were copied to the mobile hard disk the scenario during the test is shown in fig 8 5 test results 5 1 manoeuvring test results ship manoeuvrability is an important performance of ships it is closely related to the safety and economy of merchant ships and to the combat and vitality of warships therefore manoeuvrability model tests are indispensable this section shows results of the turning test and the zig zag test the trajectory circle is shown in fig 9 as can be seen from the figure the trajectory data recorded by gps are very clear the diameter of the stabilized turning circle is about 29 m fig 10 depicts the relationship between the heading angle and the rudder angle in the 20 zig zag test during the test the transition time interval of the rudder angle from 20 to 20 is short approximately 1 2 s the difference between the course angle while turning rudder and the maximum course angle is 14 2 12 7 12 5 12 9 and 10 4 in turn the difference between the time while turning rudder and the time while reaching the maximum course angle is 12s 13s 13s 12 9s and 12s in turn the results show that the large scale model has good maneuverability and the control system are stable and reliable 5 2 self propulsion test results 5 2 1 considering the results of a voyage as an example the tests were carried out for two sea conditions that were equivalent to the sea state 5 and 8 of the full scale ship the sea state is derived from the wave height of the test sea area predicted by the local meteorological bureau and the measured data by the buoy wave height meter on the day of the test the model advances in a preset direction at a constant number of revolutions when the speed is stable the test is initialized the test time is approximately 2 3 min and the time curves of the thrust and torque roll pitch and vertical acceleration are recorded it is difficult to express the time curve of each parameter using an exact analytical expression due to the irregularities in the curves hence the numerical integration method is used for an approximate calculation based on the collected data the simpson method is a commonly used integral method chu and wang 2002 that can meet the requirements of engineering accuracy the specific calculation method is as follows the time curve of the physical quantity a is measured for a period of time t and the time t is divided into n equal parts to obtain n 1 ordinates the curve is formed by replacing the curve between three adjacent ordinates with a quadratic parabola the area s can be expressed as eq 2 2 s t 3 n y 0 4 y 1 2 y 2 4 y 3 2 y 4 2 y n 2 4 y n 1 y n where n is related to the time t and frequency f at which the data is collected and n f t the average value of the physical quantity a can be obtained using eq 3 3 a s t the physical quantity a can be replaced by the measured physical quantities such as thrust torque and speed of the ship model the following is an example of a self propulsion test at a constant speed of 300 r min fig 11 presents the trajectory of the model the origin 0 0 indicates the starting point for the recording of the motion data it can be clearly seen from the figure that the ship model moves in a serpentine pattern during the movement the ship model is affected by the currents and waves which causes a lateral drift hence it is necessary to constantly change the rudder angle the automatic rudder control system has automatic and manual modes however previous experiments have shown that the efficiency of manual control for straight line navigation is often higher for large scale ship models having high inertia fig 12 shows the time profile of several major motion parameters of the ship model as shown in fig 12 a the speed of the ship model is distributed in the range of 1 6 2 0 m s which is relatively stable additionally there are 4 5 peaks at every 20 s and the peak to peak time can be considered to be consistent with the wave cycle time furthermore the irregular periodic variation in the speed of the ship is significantly affected by the wave period fig 12 b shows that the floating range of the roll is higher and the period is more pronounced than the pitch fig 12 c d and e present the acceleration signal recorded by the sensor placed at the head middle and tail positions of the ship model respectively the curve recorded by the sensors at the head and middle positions is smooth whereas the curve of the recorded tail acceleration exhibits significant burr structures this is because the power system and control system of the model are arranged at the stern and the electromagnetic field generated by these systems exerts a certain interference effect on the signal fig 12 f g and h present the torque and thrusts measured by the self propulsion instrument respectively to better analyse the trend of the curve the red trend curve in each graph is obtained after a certain degree of fitting it can be seen that the torque and thrust generated by the propeller exhibit a consistent trend 5 2 2 influence of complex wake field environment on propulsion performance in actual marine environments the underwater environment is complex and the flow surrounding the propeller is significantly uneven and unpredictable the non uniformity of the wake field affects the thrust and torque of the propeller the conventional methods for studying the effects of non uniform wake fields are the equal torque method and equal thrust method these two methods can individually determine the influence on the thrust and torque these two analysis methods are presented below for each self propulsion test at a constant rotating speed the average thrust t and average torque q were obtained based on the measured propeller performance data using the simpson method assume that the propeller in open water produces a torque q 0 that is equal to q the corresponding torque coefficient of the propeller in open water at this speed is 4 k q 0 q 0 ρ n 2 d 5 q ρ n 2 d 5 where n and d represent the rotational speed and diameter of the propeller respectively ρ is the density of seawater and it is equal to 1025 kg m3 the corresponding advance coefficient j 0 and thrust coefficient k t 0 can be determined using the open water efficiency curve thus the thrust generated by the propeller under open water condition is 5 t 0 k t 0 ρ n 2 d 4 γ is defined as the influence coefficient of the non uniformity of the flow field on the thrust and the physical meaning of γ is the ratio of the actual thrust generated by the propeller and the predicted thrust by the open water propeller at the same coefficient of advance velocity the physical equation is 6 γ t t 0 γ 1 indicates that the complex wake field does not affect the propeller thrust compared with that in open water γ 1 indicates that the thrust of the propeller is lower than in open water and the propulsion performance decreases otherwise the propeller thrust is greater than in open water and the propulsion performance is improved the equal thrust method is similar to the equal torque method assuming that the torque generated by the propeller behind the ship is the same as that of the open water propeller η is defined as the coefficient of the influence of the non uniformity of the flow field on the torque the physical meaning of η is the ratio of the predicted torque generated by the open water propeller to the actual torque generated by the propeller behind the ship under the same advance coefficient it is the familiar relative rotation efficiency whose physical equation is 7 η q 0 q η 1 indicates that the complex wake field does not affect the torque of the propeller η 1 indicates that the torque of the propeller behind the ship is higher than in open water and the propulsion performance is reduced hence a higher powered engine is required otherwise the thrust of the propeller behind the ship is less than in open water and the propulsion performance is improved considering multiple voyages in a day the effects of complex flow fields on the propulsion performance are analyzed using the above two methods in order to better analyse this effect the analysis results are compared with small scale model tests in the towing basin the scale of the model in the basin test is 53 2 full scale ship power forecasting is calculated by using 1978 ittc method based on the open water characteristic curves as shown in fig 13 the thrust influence coefficient and torque influence coefficient of large scale model test small scale model test and power forecast results at their self propulsion points are obtained fig 14 depicts the relationship between the thrust influence coefficient and the propeller advance coefficient based on the large scale model test results the advance coefficient at self propulsion points distributed between 0 14 and 0 31 and the value of thrust influence coefficient is between 0 85 and 0 97 which is lower than the results of small scale model test and full scale ship prediction this indicates that because the propeller behind the ship in real sea environment is affected by the oblique flow and the unevenness in the inflow its hydrodynamic performance is significantly reduced compared with the towing basin test and prediction which the thrust loss is in the range of 3 15 fig 15 shows the relationship between the thrust torque influence coefficient and the advance coefficient the advance coefficient of large scale model test is distributed between 0 19 and 0 34 which produces a rightward offset compared to the equal torque method the value of torque influence coefficient in large scale model tests between 0 89 and 0 98 is lower than the results of small scale model test and full scale ship prediction in general trend in comparison with propeller in open water the propulsion performance predicted by 1978 ittc method seems to be overestimated in fact complex marine environments increase the torque by 2 11 at the self propulsion points of large scale model test from the analysis results of figs 14 and 15 it is obvious that there is a remarkable scale effect on propeller propulsion performance between the results of small scale model test the prediction by 1978 ittc method and the results of large scale model test in addition the advance coefficient of the propeller of the ship model is lower than that of the full scale ship which is related to the ship machine propeller matching problem the hull and propeller of the ship model are scaled proportionally the propeller exhibits the best matching for the full scale ship and not for the ship model as the advance coefficient j of each voyage was obtained in the previous calculation the wake fraction during each voyage can be obtained using eq 8 8 ω 1 j nd v where v represents the average sailing speed with respect to time fig 16 presents the relationship between the wake fraction and the advance coefficient for multiple free running tests conducted over a certain day and the test data for the same day shown in fig 14 generally the wake fraction of a large transport vessel is in the range of 0 3 0 4 as shown in the figure the distribution interval is significantly larger than this range which indicates that the propeller is more significantly affected by the non uniform incoming flow in the real sea test there is a certain difference between the two types of companion flow scores obtained by using the two different calculation strategies the wake fraction obtained by the equal torque method is significantly larger than the equal thrust method 5 2 3 influence of wave on propulsion performance fig 17 shows propeller performance data for different sea states and wave conditions the propeller speeds are 150 r min low rotating speed 200 r min medium rotating speed 270 r min high rotating speed and 340 r min higher rotating speed as seen from the figure as the rotating speed increases the thrust and torque of the propeller also exhibit a good linear upward trend in sea state 5 the torque and thrust of the propeller in oblique waves are generally less than those in head wave however in sea state 8 this phenomenon is reversed under the same wave direction the effect of higher grade sea state on propeller performance is represented by a decrease in torque and an increase in thrust to better quantify the above mentioned phenomenon the influence of wave direction and sea state on propulsion performance is calculated under the condition of control variables fig 18 shows comparison of propulsion performance in oblique sea and head sea the ordinate is the percentage of the difference between the thrust torque in oblique sea and head sea the measured data of head sea is regarded as 100 as shown in the figure in sea state 5 the impact of the wave direction is highly significant at low rotating speeds and the oblique wave increases the thrust and torque of the propeller by 4 6 and 11 8 respectively however at other rotating speeds this phenomenon is reversed the torque and thrust tend to decrease by 1 3 in sea state 8 the thrust and torque are increased in the range of 0 3 3 2 and 0 3 2 8 respectively which is the opposite of that in sea state 5 fig 19 shows comparison of propulsion performance in sea state 5 and 8 the ordinate is the percentage of the difference between the thrust torque in sea state 5 and 8 the measured data of sea state 5 is regarded as 100 as shown in the figure at low rotating speeds whether in oblique or head sea the torque reduction of sea state 8 is approximately 27 and the thrust in head sea remains almost unchanged and the thrust in oblique sea is reduced by approximately 10 regardless of low rotating speed sea state 8 result in an increase in the thrust and a decrease in the torque compared to sea state 5 in head sea the thrust is increased by about 3 6 2 and the torque is reduced by about 5 8 12 7 in oblique sea the thrust is increased by about 6 5 12 and the torque is reduced by about 3 7 6 3 it was found that the influence curves of thrust and torque exhibited a good linear change as the rotational speed increases 6 conclusion in this study a large scale model of a bulk carrier with a scale of 1 13 was built the model had a length of 25 m the integrated test system of the model consisted of a control system an integrated navigation system and a data measurement and acquisition system the test conducted in the coastal waters of the northern part of the yellow sea in china this study was aimed at analyzing the propulsion performance in real sea environment the conclusions of this study is as follows 1 the manoeuvrability test verifies that the integrated ship model system designed in this test is stable and reliable 2 by analyzing the test results of multiple voyages in a day it is confirmed that the propeller propulsion performance is significantly reduced by the complex wake field the thrust loss is in the range of 3 15 and the torque increase by 2 11 at the self propulsion points of large scale model test there is a remarkable scale effect on propeller propulsion performance between the large scale model test the small scale model test and the full scale ship power forecasting by 1978 ittc method compared with the prediction results of full scale ships the large scale model has lower advance coefficient and higher wake fraction at the self propulsion points 3 in sea state 5 the impact of the wave direction is highly significant at low rotating speeds and the oblique wave increases the thrust and torque of the propeller by 4 6 and 11 8 respectively however at other rotating speeds this phenomenon is reversed the torque and thrust tend to decrease by 1 3 in sea state 8 the thrust and torque are increased in the range of 0 3 3 2 and 0 3 2 8 respectively which is the opposite of that in sea state 5 5 at low rotating speeds whether in oblique or head sea the torque reduction of sea state 8 is approximately 27 and the thrust in head sea remains almost unchanged and the thrust in oblique sea is reduced by approximately 10 regardless of low rotating speed sea state 8 result in an increase in the thrust and a decrease in the torque compared to sea state 5 in head sea the thrust is increased by about 3 6 2 and the torque is reduced by about 5 8 12 7 in oblique sea the thrust is increased by about 6 5 12 and the torque is reduced by about 3 7 6 3 it was found that the influence curves of thrust and torque exhibited a good linear change as the rotational speed increases in various countries the current research on propulsion performance only focuses on the results of tests on large scale model these results have not been applied to full scale ships the ultimate purpose of collected data is to explore the scale effect and conversion relationship on propulsion performance between the large scale model and full scale ship and then guide the performance design of full scale ship however because of the lack of full scale ship s measured data our research work is limited to the propulsion performance of large scale model we are pushing ahead with the measurement of full scale ship in future work we will further analyse the scale effect and conversion relationship between

21745,in recent years under the advocacy of ittc large scale model test technology has garnered significant attention from researchers all over the world increasingly sophisticated test equipment and a large amount of experimental experience have promoted the development and improvement of test technology here a 25 m long bulk carrier model was built as the research object the self propulsion test about propulsion performance in real sea environment was conducted in the coastal waters of northern china the manoeuvrability test proved that the designed ship model integrated system was reliable the effects of complex wake field environments on the propulsion performance were studied using the equal thrust and equal torque methods the results indicated that the complex wake field environment causes the torque to increase by 2 11 and the thrust loss ranges from 3 to 15 when the propeller was operated at a high rotating speed the torque and thrust in the oblique wave tended to decrease by 1 3 compared to the propulsion performance in the head wave in addition the more severe sea state caused the propeller torque to decrease and the thrust to increase keywords large scale model self propulsion test manoeuvrability test propulsion performance 1 introduction in the design stage of a ship rapidity dong et al 2008 manoeuvrability perez and clemente 2007 and seakeeping ability szelangiewicz and cepowski 2002 are essential aspects that require research a scale model test watson 2002 is one of the main research methods classical experimental studies have mostly been conducted in towing tanks however due to the presence of blockage effects zhao et al 2016 the geometric dimensions of the model such as length width and draft should not exceed a threshold value and thus the scale effects are amplified dubrovsky and matveev 2006 moreover the towing basin test usually uses a wave generator to generate two dimensional tango waves or three dimensional pseudo random waves therefore the behaviour of the ship cannot be truly simulated in a sea wave environment numerical simulation technology song et al 2018 is also an important means to study ship performance with the development of modern computer technology the size of the research model is becoming increasingly large and large scale or full scale self propulsion simulation has received significant interest in recent years tezdogan et al 2015 haase et al 2016 niklas and pruszko 2019 jasak et al 2019 however these numerical simulations often lack the validation of physical tests therefore reliable and effective large scale or full scale model tests become especially important to overcome the limitations of existing model tests ittc 2005 stipulated that offshore model tests are feasible and necessary the self similarity of the wind made waves signifies that their dimensionless spectrum forms are the same thus in the model sea state the dynamic characteristics of the ship model are very close to the actual ones furthermore the experiment is carried out in open seas and the scale effect will be greatly reduced using large scale models relevant experimental techniques have been highlighted in the ittc 2008 2011 report therefore large scale model test technology in the natural environment has received sufficient attention and being significantly developed the large scale model test mainly includes three aspects structural load and response motions under waves and propulsion performance of the propeller serter 1993 reported a high speed military model test of radio

propeller model in a flat lake the shaft was equipped with a dynamometer to measure the thrust and torque of the propeller and the asymmetry of propulsion performance was studied fossati et al 2015 measured the wind and wave loads and movements of a 9 9 m long full size yacht while sailing on the sea sun et al 2015 from harbin engineering university conducted several near coastal large scale model wave resistance tests to study the structural load response and motion during 2006 2016 in recent years the model test technology for structural load response and motion has become more sophisticated while the test technology for propeller propulsion performance has not developed further researchers are attempting to overcome the technical difficulties in improvement of high precision instruments for measuring propeller propulsion performance however in past large scale model test research work most of the models used as research objects were shorter than 13 m and the researchers did not exceed this model size unlike these previous studies a 25 m ship model was analyzed in this study this larger size signifies the need to develop a wider range of measuring instruments further the control and measurement systems of the ship become more complex based on the previous studies we overcame the size limitation built a model of a bulk carrier with a length of 25 m and conducted a free running test in coastal waters the independent research and development of large scale high precision broken shaft self propulsion instruments is an important technological breakthrough in measuring propeller propulsion performance this paper presents a detailed introduction to the design and test process of a ship model test integrated system the manoeuvrability tests conducted here proved that the self designed control system has good practicability and stability using the equal thrust and equal torque methods the influence of waves on propeller performance is studied 2 model design 2 1 model construction taking a 23wt bulk carrier as the research object a glass fibre reinforced plastic frp model with a scale of 1 13 was established the hull is large in size and has a low speed it has a bulbous bow and a transom stern the parallel middle body accounts for about 4 5 of the total length and the tail profile shrinks sharply the hull and propeller are shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively the main scale parameters of the ship model are shown in tables 1 and 2 the construction of the model refers to the construction specifications of chinese frp ships the ship model adopts a hybrid skeleton type and the hull is subdivided into 6 cabins the transverse bulkhead is provided with watertight doors the upper deck of each compartment has hatches and all opening positions are strengthened driving and data measurement work is done in a cab on the main deck 2 2 test system designing the ship model test system is a complex process and critical to guarantee the success of the test the large scale model test system can be divided into three parts control system data measurement and acquisition system and gps ins integrated navigation system the arrangement of the equipment is shown in fig 3 the framework relationship of the test system is shown in fig 4 the various subsystems are described below 2 2 1 control system the model control system was the core of the ship model driving which mainly includes the host computer the slave computer two servo motors for the propeller and rudder the host computer issued control commands using the windows 7 operating system and the control software was written using visual basic the user control interface displayed various parameters such as the rudder angle and the number of revolutions and could also change the motion of the ship model by inputting parameters through the control interface the slave computer received the command from the host computer and translated it into a real time signal to directly control the propeller control motor and the rudder control motor the lower computer read the status data of the servo motor and converted it into a digital signal for feedback to the host computer the propeller motor was rated at 15 kw and had a reduction ratio of 1 4 the rudder motor had a power of 3 kw and a reduction ratio of 1 10 2 2 2 gps ins integrated navigation system the commercial gps ins integrated navigation system consisted of gps antennas an ins core and a gnss receiver the integration receiver connected to the gps antennas and inertial sensor received real time motion information including speed track heading roll pitch and yaw rate four gps assisted receivers occupied the four vertices of the rectangle and were placed on top of the deck cab the inertial sensor was fixed at the deck and the triaxial sensor s axes were parallel to the ship s cartesian coordinate system the receiver was connected with the host computer and the user control interface could display the ship model motion data in real time the historical data were recorded in the hard disk of the upper computer the navigation system data were acquired at a frequency of 20 hz the speed error was less than 0 1 knots and the direction and roll tilt error was less than 0 1 2 2 3 data measurement and acquisition system the model used non remote sensing control at least two people were required on board to conduct the test work one person was responsible for driving and the other was responsible for data collection the data measurement and acquisition system consisted of three acceleration sensors a self developed instrument a data collector and a notebook computer the vertical acceleration of the hull and the thrust and torque of the propeller were the parameters measured the vertical motion of the hull was measured using an acceleration sensor the position of the acceleration sensor is shown in fig 2 the heave motion curve of the hull could be obtained by double integrating the acceleration curve in this test a self developed instrument see section 2 2 5 was independently developed to accurately measure the thrust and torque generated by the propeller a 32 channel commercial data collector was used to convert the measured electrical signals into digital signals for transmission to a laptop the data were recorded and analyzed in real time using dynamic signal analysis software 2 2 4 electricity supply the nonlinear complex vibration of the internal combustion engine affects the measurement of the propulsion performance and it requires a large amount of flowing air during operation with respect to safety servo motors are more suitable as ship model drives than internal combustion engines in the past model tests typically used batteries as the power source however the capacity of these batteries which could be used for approximately 2 h was significantly lesser that the capacity required for the 25 m model this test used a 30 kw fuel generator which allowed for a sailing time of 6 8 h this was sufficient time for one day of testing the fuel oil generator mainly provides an ac voltage of 380 v for the measuring instruments and other low power electric equipment for the lower level machine the power is supplied by a 12 v lead acid battery through a voltage transformer or voltage stabilization 2 2 5 self developed self propulsion instrument the thrust and torque of the propeller are the two most important indicators of the propulsion performance one of the core technologies of this test is the development of measuring instruments harbin engineering university independently developed a large scale high precision self propulsion instrument for a large scale model test a patent has already been filed for this invention fig 5 shows the basic structure of the self propulsion instrument including the thrust measuring unit and the torque measuring unit these two sets of independent measuring units were used to analyse the thrust and torque of the propeller allowing different strain units to undergo either axial or circumferential deformation which perfectly solves the crosstalk problem between the thrust and torque measurement instruments the non contact torque sensor combines the flexibility of digital signal conditioning with carrier frequency amplifier technology resulting in a significant increase in measurement accuracy 3 wave analysis the test site was in the coastal waters of qingdao china 120 22 e 35 91 n which is located in the northern part of the yellow sea in china the location is shown in fig 6 the wave information was sampled and analyzed by a buoy wave height gauge the gauge was placed at the central position of the test sea area about 3 nautical miles from the shore the sampling period of the wave height meter was 1 time h and the sampling time was 15 min the sampling data were transmitted to the computer with a fixed ip address through gprs communication the wave monitoring software analyzed the data and output the wave height period and wave direction in real time the wave instrument monitoring indicators are shown in table 3 jiao et al 2018 conducted several coastal wave measurements on several locations in the bohai sea and the yellow sea in china and determined that the main features of the coastal spectrum are in good agreement with the ocean spectrum further it was also determined that it is acceptable to conduct model tests in the sea 5 km from the coastline instead of deep ocean in order to verify the rationality of this view the measured wave spectrum is compared with the two parameter ocean spectrum recommended by ittc and issc the measured wave spectrum is obtained by analysis of the measured wave height data using spectral analysis method yue qin and shang xian 2000 the two parameter spectrum is not only suitable for fully developed ocean waves but also for growing ocean waves its general expression is as shown in eq 1 1 s ω 173 ξ w 3 2 t 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 4 ω 4 where ω is the natural circular frequency of the wave s ω is the spectral density ξ w 3 represents significant wave height t represents mean period the comparison between the measured wave spectrum and the two parameter spectrum is shown in fig 7 it is evident that the near shore wave spectrum has two spectral peaks this is because the wind direction in the coastal sea area is opposite to the direction of waves leading to the occurrence of different main peak frequencies however the main frequency range and trend of waves in the test sea area are basically consistent with the two parameter spectrum 4 test conditions and procedures 4 1 test conditions a manoeuvrability test of a large scale model and a self propulsion test in waves were conducted the manoeuvrability tests were conducted first to not only measure the manoeuvrability of the ship model but to also debug and improve the system and verify the feasibility of the ship model control system then the self propulsion test was conducted for different sea conditions and wave angles the test conditions are shown in tables 4 and 5 the sea wave environment is complex and the wave flow and wind directions are often inconsistent even diametrically opposite in fact estimation of the sea state mainly depends on the evaluation of the wave height sea states in table 5 following the international standard wave classification issued by the world meteorological organization represent the actual sea conditions of the full scale ship the significant wave heights corresponding to the sea conditions of grade 5 and 8 are 2 5 4 m 9 14 m respectively the encounter wave height of large scale model can be obtained with a scale of 1 13 the wave direction is judged by the eye of the experimenter according to the actual sea surface during the test the ship model has a large inertia and there is obvious hysteresis in the acceleration and braking process it is difficult to make the ship model sail at a constant speed during the test therefore the test was performed with a constant rotating speed and the speed tends towards a stable value within a certain range four motor speeds were voyaged under each condition 4 2 test procedure the ship model was launched at the shipyard near the test area and was usually parked in a safe haven the adjustment of the model system included gps equipment shafting influence rudder response and fluency of the control software system even though the weather and waves are uncontrollable they have a certain periodicity estimates of sea conditions were mainly derived from local weather forecasts and the wave trends were predicted using the wave height gauge each test process is presented below before the start of the test the equipment on the model was switched on and checked data acquisition channel is calibrated while the ship is in the haven then the auxiliary ship was sent to the sea area where the wave height gauge was located which was about 3 nautical miles offshore in the seakeeping test according to the test content the ship model travelled along the preset route for a fixed number of revolutions during the test the main wave direction of the surrounding waves was observed at all times and the video data of the sea state and the model movement were recorded after completing a certain speed scheme another speed was immediately tested in the same sea state when the sea conditions changed if the other sea conditions were met testing under the corresponding sea conditions was conducted immediately otherwise testing on that day was terminated after the test was completed the auxiliary ship assisted in returning to the haven the test data were recorded on the laptop and the host computer and the valid data were copied to the mobile hard disk the scenario during the test is shown in fig 8 5 test results 5 1 manoeuvring test results ship manoeuvrability is an important performance of ships it is closely related to the safety and economy of merchant ships and to the combat and vitality of warships therefore manoeuvrability model tests are indispensable this section shows results of the turning test and the zig zag test the trajectory circle is shown in fig 9 as can be seen from the figure the trajectory data recorded by gps are very clear the diameter of the stabilized turning circle is about 29 m fig 10 depicts the relationship between the heading angle and the rudder angle in the 20 zig zag test during the test the transition time interval of the rudder angle from 20 to 20 is short approximately 1 2 s the difference between the course angle while turning rudder and the maximum course angle is 14 2 12 7 12 5 12 9 and 10 4 in turn the difference between the time while turning rudder and the time while reaching the maximum course angle is 12s 13s 13s 12 9s and 12s in turn the results show that the large scale model has good maneuverability and the control system are stable and reliable 5 2 self propulsion test results 5 2 1 considering the results of a voyage as an example the tests were carried out for two sea conditions that were equivalent to the sea state 5 and 8 of the full scale ship the sea state is derived from the wave height of the test sea area predicted by the local meteorological bureau and the measured data by the buoy wave height meter on the day of the test the model advances in a preset direction at a constant number of revolutions when the speed is stable the test is initialized the test time is approximately 2 3 min and the time curves of the thrust and torque roll pitch and vertical acceleration are recorded it is difficult to express the time curve of each parameter using an exact analytical expression due to the irregularities in the curves hence the numerical integration method is used for an approximate calculation based on the collected data the simpson method is a commonly used integral method chu and wang 2002 that can meet the requirements of engineering accuracy the specific calculation method is as follows the time curve of the physical quantity a is measured for a period of time t and the time t is divided into n equal parts to obtain n 1 ordinates the curve is formed by replacing the curve between three adjacent ordinates with a quadratic parabola the area s can be expressed as eq 2 2 s t 3 n y 0 4 y 1 2 y 2 4 y 3 2 y 4 2 y n 2 4 y n 1 y n where n is related to the time t and frequency f at which the data is collected and n f t the average value of the physical quantity a can be obtained using eq 3 3 a s t the physical quantity a can be replaced by the measured physical quantities such as thrust torque and speed of the ship model the following is an example of a self propulsion test at a constant speed of 300 r min fig 11 presents the trajectory of the model the origin 0 0 indicates the starting point for the recording of the motion data it can be clearly seen from the figure that the ship model moves in a serpentine pattern during the movement the ship model is affected by the currents and waves which causes a lateral drift hence it is necessary to constantly change the rudder angle the automatic rudder control system has automatic and manual modes however previous experiments have shown that the efficiency of manual control for straight line navigation is often higher for large scale ship models having high inertia fig 12 shows the time profile of several major motion parameters of the ship model as shown in fig 12 a the speed of the ship model is distributed in the range of 1 6 2 0 m s which is relatively stable additionally there are 4 5 peaks at every 20 s and the peak to peak time can be considered to be consistent with the wave cycle time furthermore the irregular periodic variation in the speed of the ship is significantly affected by the wave period fig 12 b shows that the floating range of the roll is higher and the period is more pronounced than the pitch fig 12 c d and e present the acceleration signal recorded by the sensor placed at the head middle and tail positions of the ship model respectively the curve recorded by the sensors at the head and middle positions is smooth whereas the curve of the recorded tail acceleration exhibits significant burr structures this is because the power system and control system of the model are arranged at the stern and the electromagnetic field generated by these systems exerts a certain interference effect on the signal fig 12 f g and h present the torque and thrusts measured by the self propulsion instrument respectively to better analyse the trend of the curve the red trend curve in each graph is obtained after a certain degree of fitting it can be seen that the torque and thrust generated by the propeller exhibit a consistent trend 5 2 2 influence of complex wake field environment on propulsion performance in actual marine environments the underwater environment is complex and the flow surrounding the propeller is significantly uneven and unpredictable the non uniformity of the wake field affects the thrust and torque of the propeller the conventional methods for studying the effects of non uniform wake fields are the equal torque method and equal thrust method these two methods can individually determine the influence on the thrust and torque these two analysis methods are presented below for each self propulsion test at a constant rotating speed the average thrust t and average torque q were obtained based on the measured propeller performance data using the simpson method assume that the propeller in open water produces a torque q 0 that is equal to q the corresponding torque coefficient of the propeller in open water at this speed is 4 k q 0 q 0 ρ n 2 d 5 q ρ n 2 d 5 where n and d represent the rotational speed and diameter of the propeller respectively ρ is the density of seawater and it is equal to 1025 kg m3 the corresponding advance coefficient j 0 and thrust coefficient k t 0 can be determined using the open water efficiency curve thus the thrust generated by the propeller under open water condition is 5 t 0 k t 0 ρ n 2 d 4 γ is defined as the influence coefficient of the non uniformity of the flow field on the thrust and the physical meaning of γ is the ratio of the actual thrust generated by the propeller and the predicted thrust by the open water propeller at the same coefficient of advance velocity the physical equation is 6 γ t t 0 γ 1 indicates that the complex wake field does not affect the propeller thrust compared with that in open water γ 1 indicates that the thrust of the propeller is lower than in open water and the propulsion performance decreases otherwise the propeller thrust is greater than in open water and the propulsion performance is improved the equal thrust method is similar to the equal torque method assuming that the torque generated by the propeller behind the ship is the same as that of the open water propeller η is defined as the coefficient of the influence of the non uniformity of the flow field on the torque the physical meaning of η is the ratio of the predicted torque generated by the open water propeller to the actual torque generated by the propeller behind the ship under the same advance coefficient it is the familiar relative rotation efficiency whose physical equation is 7 η q 0 q η 1 indicates that the complex wake field does not affect the torque of the propeller η 1 indicates that the torque of the propeller behind the ship is higher than in open water and the propulsion performance is reduced hence a higher powered engine is required otherwise the thrust of the propeller behind the ship is less than in open water and the propulsion performance is improved considering multiple voyages in a day the effects of complex flow fields on the propulsion performance are analyzed using the above two methods in order to better analyse this effect the analysis results are compared with small scale model tests in the towing basin the scale of the model in the basin test is 53 2 full scale ship power forecasting is calculated by using 1978 ittc method based on the open water characteristic curves as shown in fig 13 the thrust influence coefficient and torque influence coefficient of large scale model test small scale model test and power forecast results at their self propulsion points are obtained fig 14 depicts the relationship between the thrust influence coefficient and the propeller advance coefficient based on the large scale model test results the advance coefficient at self propulsion points distributed between 0 14 and 0 31 and the value of thrust influence coefficient is between 0 85 and 0 97 which is lower than the results of small scale model test and full scale ship prediction this indicates that because the propeller behind the ship in real sea environment is affected by the oblique flow and the unevenness in the inflow its hydrodynamic performance is significantly reduced compared with the towing basin test and prediction which the thrust loss is in the range of 3 15 fig 15 shows the relationship between the thrust torque influence coefficient and the advance coefficient the advance coefficient of large scale model test is distributed between 0 19 and 0 34 which produces a rightward offset compared to the equal torque method the value of torque influence coefficient in large scale model tests between 0 89 and 0 98 is lower than the results of small scale model test and full scale ship prediction in general trend in comparison with propeller in open water the propulsion performance predicted by 1978 ittc method seems to be overestimated in fact complex marine environments increase the torque by 2 11 at the self propulsion points of large scale model test from the analysis results of figs 14 and 15 it is obvious that there is a remarkable scale effect on propeller propulsion performance between the results of small scale model test the prediction by 1978 ittc method and the results of large scale model test in addition the advance coefficient of the propeller of the ship model is lower than that of the full scale ship which is related to the ship machine propeller matching problem the hull and propeller of the ship model are scaled proportionally the propeller exhibits the best matching for the full scale ship and not for the ship model as the advance coefficient j of each voyage was obtained in the previous calculation the wake fraction during each voyage can be obtained using eq 8 8 ω 1 j nd v where v represents the average sailing speed with respect to time fig 16 presents the relationship between the wake fraction and the advance coefficient for multiple free running tests conducted over a certain day and the test data for the same day shown in fig 14 generally the wake fraction of a large transport vessel is in the range of 0 3 0 4 as shown in the figure the distribution interval is significantly larger than this range which indicates that the propeller is more significantly affected by the non uniform incoming flow in the real sea test there is a certain difference between the two types of companion flow scores obtained by using the two different calculation strategies the wake fraction obtained by the equal torque method is significantly larger than the equal thrust method 5 2 3 influence of wave on propulsion performance fig 17 shows propeller performance data for different sea states and wave conditions the propeller speeds are 150 r min low rotating speed 200 r min medium rotating speed 270 r min high rotating speed and 340 r min higher rotating speed as seen from the figure as the rotating speed increases the thrust and torque of the propeller also exhibit a good linear upward trend in sea state 5 the torque and thrust of the propeller in oblique waves are generally less than those in head wave however in sea state 8 this phenomenon is reversed under the same wave direction the effect of higher grade sea state on propeller performance is represented by a decrease in torque and an increase in thrust to better quantify the above mentioned phenomenon the influence of wave direction and sea state on propulsion performance is calculated under the condition of control variables fig 18 shows comparison of propulsion performance in oblique sea and head sea the ordinate is the percentage of the difference between the thrust torque in oblique sea and head sea the measured data of head sea is regarded as 100 as shown in the figure in sea state 5 the impact of the wave direction is highly significant at low rotating speeds and the oblique wave increases the thrust and torque of the propeller by 4 6 and 11 8 respectively however at other rotating speeds this phenomenon is reversed the torque and thrust tend to decrease by 1 3 in sea state 8 the thrust and torque are increased in the range of 0 3 3 2 and 0 3 2 8 respectively which is the opposite of that in sea state 5 fig 19 shows comparison of propulsion performance in sea state 5 and 8 the ordinate is the percentage of the difference between the thrust torque in sea state 5 and 8 the measured data of sea state 5 is regarded as 100 as shown in the figure at low rotating speeds whether in oblique or head sea the torque reduction of sea state 8 is approximately 27 and the thrust in head sea remains almost unchanged and the thrust in oblique sea is reduced by approximately 10 regardless of low rotating speed sea state 8 result in an increase in the thrust and a decrease in the torque compared to sea state 5 in head sea the thrust is increased by about 3 6 2 and the torque is reduced by about 5 8 12 7 in oblique sea the thrust is increased by about 6 5 12 and the torque is reduced by about 3 7 6 3 it was found that the influence curves of thrust and torque exhibited a good linear change as the rotational speed increases 6 conclusion in this study a large scale model of a bulk carrier with a scale of 1 13 was built the model had a length of 25 m the integrated test system of the model consisted of a control system an integrated navigation system and a data measurement and acquisition system the test conducted in the coastal waters of the northern part of the yellow sea in china this study was aimed at analyzing the propulsion performance in real sea environment the conclusions of this study is as follows 1 the manoeuvrability test verifies that the integrated ship model system designed in this test is stable and reliable 2 by analyzing the test results of multiple voyages in a day it is confirmed that the propeller propulsion performance is significantly reduced by the complex wake field the thrust loss is in the range of 3 15 and the torque increase by 2 11 at the self propulsion points of large scale model test there is a remarkable scale effect on propeller propulsion performance between the large scale model test the small scale model test and the full scale ship power forecasting by 1978 ittc method compared with the prediction results of full scale ships the large scale model has lower advance coefficient and higher wake fraction at the self propulsion points 3 in sea state 5 the impact of the wave direction is highly significant at low rotating speeds and the oblique wave increases the thrust and torque of the propeller by 4 6 and 11 8 respectively however at other rotating speeds this phenomenon is reversed the torque and thrust tend to decrease by 1 3 in sea state 8 the thrust and torque are increased in the range of 0 3 3 2 and 0 3 2 8 respectively which is the opposite of that in sea state 5 5 at low rotating speeds whether in oblique or head sea the torque reduction of sea state 8 is approximately 27 and the thrust in head sea remains almost unchanged and the thrust in oblique sea is reduced by approximately 10 regardless of low rotating speed sea state 8 result in an increase in the thrust and a decrease in the torque compared to sea state 5 in head sea the thrust is increased by about 3 6 2 and the torque is reduced by about 5 8 12 7 in oblique sea the thrust is increased by about 6 5 12 and the torque is reduced by about 3 7 6 3 it was found that the influence curves of thrust and torque exhibited a good linear change as the rotational speed increases in various countries the current research on propulsion performance only focuses on the results of tests on large scale model these results have not been applied to full scale ships the ultimate purpose of collected data is to explore the scale effect and conversion relationship on propulsion performance between the large scale model and full scale ship and then guide the performance design of full scale ship however because of the lack of full scale ship s measured data our research work is limited to the propulsion performance of large scale model we are pushing ahead with the measurement of full scale ship in future work we will further analyse the scale effect and conversion relationship between

21746,this paper analyses the transit performance of state of the art underwater vehicles and presents an intermediate fidelity steady state flight mechanics model for qualitative performance assessment of underwater vehicles focusing on the comparison of underwater gliders and propeller driven auvs a simple glide metric is presented and the transit performance of the legacy underwater gliders slocum spray and seaglider as well as propeller modified versions thereof is evaluated the evaluation is based on various data sets from wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd studies and shows that for the respective hull shapes gliding locomotion proves more efficient in ideal conditions however biofouling conditions inflict a double penalty on glider performance rendering gliders inferior to propeller driven vehicles the slocum data set is used to validate a steady state flight mechanics model for qualitative performance prediction it is shown that even simplistic models based on semi empirical and analytical expressions can be successfully used for design optimization through parametrization being computationally efficient the model can be a useful tool for design engineers in early design phases the model is used to evaluate the effects of wing span on gliding efficiency indicating that the current design of the slocum glider is near optimal keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv underwater glider performance hydrodynamic modelling 1 introduction in times of global climate change there is a significantly increasing interest among the oceanographic community in pushing boundaries and shedding light into the great vastness of yet unexplored regions in our oceans which play a vital role in the planet s climate physics especially the polar waters under and around the antarctic ice shelf and the arctic ice sheet have been receiving attention in recent years king et al 2019 mcphail et al 2019 yamagata et al 2019 imposing great challenges on engineers to improve the current generation of state of the art autonomous underwater vehicles auvs long term ocean observation and monitoring helps climate scientists understand and predict physical processes in the atmosphere better typical missions can extend over hundreds or even thousands of kilometres in range and last for several months this spatial and temporal extent inevitably increases requirements towards autonomy navigation and endurance of auvs the endurance of auvs depends on two factors energy consumption and energy capacity yuh et al 2011 energy capacity mainly depends on battery technology and allocated size whereas energy consumption is a function of vehicle shape operational speed propulsive power and hotel load increasing both the temporal and spatial range of underwater vehicles enables scientists to gather more and better data at less financial expense for many years there has been consensus among auv designers and operators that underwater gliders generally are superior in terms of range and endurance in comparison to common propeller driven auvs gafurov and klochkov 2015 dhanak and xiros 2016 analysed the efficiency of propeller blades and wings based on hydromechanic principles concluding that wings are intrinsically more efficient due to their vortex shedding characteristics however this analysis did not consider the differences in locomotion of propeller driven level flight and sawtooth like glide cycles already in 2010 steinberg et al 2010 performed a study on the transit performance of both types of propulsion systems concluding that they are equally efficient in terms of transit energy consumption and that the choice of propulsion system ultimately should depend on the application only in recent years several auvs with outstanding long range capabilities have been presented furlong et al 2007 mcphail 2009 furlong et al 2012 hobson et al 2012 roper et al 2017 offering a potentially interesting alternative to underwater gliders in the domain of long range underwater missions the research question however which of the propulsion systems provides the better performance for long range horizontal travel has not been attended to enough in this paper the transit performance of the legacy underwater gliders slocum spray and seaglider as well as propeller modified versions thereof is assessed in ideal and biofouling conditions the evaluation is based on published computational and experimental data a simple yet generic intermediate fidelity steady state flight mechanics model for underwater vehicles is presented and validated against the published data it is shown how the model can be applied in vehicle design optimization in order to help engineers understand how design configurations affect vehicle performance it is most important for the model to be able to predict the hydrodynamic behaviour qualitatively correct with acceptable quantitative accuracy 2 performance of underwater vehicles performance is a human defined concept and as such it is dynamic its meaning can vary between different users and operators depending on their ultimate goals or application here performance is evaluated in terms of range endurance and speed other definitions of performance can include manoeuvrability autonomy or be more sensor specific in the following the theoretical background of underwater locomotion is elaborated on briefly since underwater gliding poses a special case in terms of locomotion the most important flight mechanics of gliders are presented after that the transit performance of both underwater gliders and propeller driven auvs is defined this section is concluded with a short review on the effects of marine biofouling on the hydrodynamic properties of lifting bodies an important aspect when evaluating flight performance in real world conditions throughout the paper the hydrodynamic forces drag d and lift l are expressed in terms of the dimensionless drag coefficient c d and lift coefficient c l respectively 1 d 1 2 ρ u 2 c d α r e a 2 l 1 2 ρ u 2 c l α r e a here ρ is the density of the surrounding fluid i e seawater u is the inflow velocity and a the reference area that the hydrodynamic coefficients are referenced to both hydrodynamic coefficients can be functions of the angle of attack α and the reynolds number r e 2 1 gliding locomotion underwater gliders glide along an inclined trajectory by alternating between positive and negative net buoyancy b n e t as schematically shown in fig 1 the lifting surfaces generate a lift force that is responsible for horizontal travel of the vehicle the angle of attack α and the inflow velocity determine hydrodynamic drag and lift acting on the vehicle the instantaneous angle of attack on the vehicle can be controlled by moving an internal mass and hence changing the vehicle s attitude the ratio of the hydrodynamic forces also determines the glide path angle γ as 3 γ tan 1 c d c l from conservation of mechanical energy the following expressions for vertical velocity w also known as sink rate and horizontal velocity u can be derived as wagner 2003 dhanak and xiros 2016 4

the energy required per metre horizontal travel and denoted by e t in joule per metre for the propeller driven auv superscript p the energy required per metre is equal to the drag force d 6 e t p d s s d for the glider superscript g it can be seen from fig 1 that the travelled transit distance s h is inversely proportional to the tangent of the glide path angle and directly proportional to the apogee depth d yielding 7 s h 2 d tan γ the effective pump energy e p expended at apogee depth d is 8 e p b n e t d assuming negligible pump energy consumption to initiate a dive cycle 7 and 8 can now be combined to obtain the glider s energy consumption per metre travelled horizontally per dive cycle as 9 e t g 1 2 b n e t tan γ 1 2 b n e t c d c l here it also is assumed that the time required to reach terminal velocity steady state is much smaller than the total time of a dive cycle i e the acceleration phase does not affect the transit efficiency when estimating the achievable range for a given vehicle configuration energy consumption from propulsion as well as all other on board systems e g scientific instrumentation needs to be included it therefore is more practical to study propulsive power rather than energy consumption for the propeller driven auv the propulsive power p p is the effective power needed to overcome drag and is expressed as 10 p p p 1 2 ρ u 3 c d a 1 η p p where the propulsive efficiency η p p for the propeller based powertrain is introduced for the underwater glider the equivalent propulsive power p p g averaged over one dive cycle for the transit case is given as 11 p p g 1 2 ρ u 3 c g l a 1 η p g where η p g is the efficiency of the buoyancy system and c g l denotes the glide coefficient its dependency on c d and c l is derived from 4 and 9 by substituting the net buoyancy term as 12 c g l c d c d 2 c l 2 3 2 2 c l 3 in cases where c d and c l are r e independent and only a function of α the optimum angle of attack that enables maximum range can be identified by finding the simple zero of the derivative of the glide coefficient with respect to α by taking the ratio of p p g p p p a simple design metric referred to as the glide metric for the determination of a favourable propulsion system is derived the underwater glider thus is considered more efficient in transit when the following inequality is satisfied 13 c d c d 2 c l 2 3 2 2 c d 0 c l 3 η p g η p p where c d 0 represents the reference drag coefficient at zero angle of attack ideally the reference drag coefficient is taken as the bare hull drag coefficient enabling comparison between underwater glider and propeller driven auv however for small wings the drag contribution can be argued to be negligible since the wing surface area is significantly smaller than the wetted surface area of the body from an engineering perspective the propulsive efficiency of the buoyancy engine is hard to evaluate the efficiency of buoyancy engines can vary significantly from 8 to 70 depending on operating pressure and the actual technology used rudnick et al 2004 kobayashi et al 2010 worall et al 2007 whereas the propulsive efficiency of propeller based powertrains averages at about 50 furlong et al 2007 phillips et al 2012 therefore the ratio η p p η p g is neglected in the performance evaluation in section 4 i e assumed to be equal to 1 due to the glider s complex dynamics physical interpretation of metrics such as 13 often is rather cumbersome despite their conceptually simple derivation chen et al 2015 and fu et al 2018 have applied a similar metric based on a power conversion principle power consumption in the horizontal direction compared to net buoyancy potential output the benefit of using 13 is its sole dependency on hydrodynamic coefficients and therefore simple integration in the design process 2 3 effects of marine biofouling hydrodynamic coefficients are often computed only for ideal conditions assuming smooth surfaces for the vehicle and all appendices however especially on long endurance missions this assumption is likely to be violated by the formation of marine biofouling marine biofouling is caused by the adhesion and growth of marine animals plants and slime on the surface of a submerged body and can significantly decrease the operational efficiency of underwater vehicles the type and intensity of biofouling strongly depends on environmental variables such as water quality temperature currents and sunlight conditions lobe et al 2010 orme et al 2001 first traces of biofouling can be seen after just a few weeks of operation and in the worst case render the vehicle inoperative within three months of operation haldeman et al 2016 even though the negative effects of marine biofouling are well known to the maritime community its effects on vehicle performance in particular with respect to different propulsion systems are yet to be studied while propeller driven vehicles mostly suffer from increased drag underwater gliders suffer from increased drag and simultaneously decreased lift results from experimental orme et al 2001 and numerical khor and xiao 2011 studies on lifting bodies are in fairly good agreement with the results published by walker et al 2014 suggesting a decrease in lift coefficient by up to 40 and an increase in drag coefficient by up to 90 for medium to severe levels of biofouling in accordance the hydrodynamic coefficients are corrected for biofouling by applying penalty factors the equations for biofouling corrected drag and lift coefficients c d b f and c l b f respectively then read 14 c d b f 1 9 c d 15 c l b f 0 6 c l 3 numerical modelling a simple yet generic steady state model for flight mechanics of underwater vehicles is derived from force balance using analytical as well as semi empirical expressions for hydrodynamic estimates the model is valid for both propeller driven auvs and underwater gliders the applicability and usefulness of similar simple models has been proven in the past nahon 1996 furlong et al 2007 when using such models it is of uttermost importance to understand the limitations imposed by the model itself in order to interpret output thereof fig 2 shows forces angles and coordinate systems in a free body diagram the model is constrained to the xz plane dive plane hence only 3 degrees of freedom dof are considered surge heave and pitch the auv is modelled in a body fixed coordinate system and an earth fixed coordinate system using cartesian coordinates all forces and their positions are expressed in the body fixed coordinate system the origin of the body fixed coordinate system is chosen as the stern of the hull exemplarily the auv is divided into three sections body wings and tail fins these sections are referred to by subscripts b w and t respectively however the model is easily modifiable and can be adjusted to other subdivisions the centre of pressure of each section is described by its longitudinal and if applicable vertical positions i e x b w t and z b w t and is considered to be constant for all flight conditions this is one of the major simplifications and yet a necessary sacrifice of solution accuracy in order to achieve reasonably fast computation the same assumption is applied to the centre of buoyancy c b and the centre of gravity c g their locations are defined by their vertical z and longitudinal x coordinates with subscripts b and g respectively the chord lengths of the control surfaces wing and tail are denoted by c and their deflection by δ with corresponding subscripts the thrust force t is applied at the respective x and z location x t and z t optionally vectored thrust can be implemented into the model by considering the thrust vector angle δ t interference effects between thrusters and hull or control surfaces are neglected e g increased elevator lift due to locally increased pressure in the propeller slipstream the angle between the coordinate systems is the pitch angle ϕ see fig 2 the slope angle or glide path angle see 3 γ is defined as the direction of travel relative to the horizontal axis and the vehicle speed along γ is the absolute velocity u pitch angle and slope angle are coupled through the angle of attack α as 16 ϕ α γ the angle of attack is assumed to be constant over the entire vehicle the hydrodynamic force along the axis of motion is drag d the hydrodynamic force perpendicular to that is lift l lift and drag are calculated separately for each vehicle section the buoyancy force b is acting positively upwards through c b and the gravity force g is acting positively downward through c g the difference between b and g is the net buoyancy for static equilibrium in the body fixed coordinate system around origin the following three equations must be satisfied 17 f x b g t t sin ϕ cos δ t 1 1 1 t l b d b l w d w l t d t sin α cos α 0 18 f z b g t t cos ϕ sin δ t 1 1 1 t l b d b l w d w l t d t

forces for which z i 0 as well as moments caused by vectored thrust when it is applied elsewhere than in the origin the off centreline moments m o c are given by 20 m o c z b z w z t t l b d b l w d w l t d t sin α cos α and the thrust vectoring moment m t is given by 21 m t x t z t t t sin δ t cos δ t the hydrodynamic forces that appear in 17 20 are calculated separately for each source of origin this model considers frictional drag lift and lift induced drag for simplification the dynamic pressure q is defined beforehand as 22 q 1 2 ρ u 2 3 1 forces on the body the buoyancy force b is defined as 23 b ρ g v where g is the gravitational constant and v is the volume displaced by the vehicle the gravity force g is the product of vehicle dry mass m and the gravitational constant g 24 g m g it is assumed that the auv is a streamlined body thus neglecting form drag and only considering friction drag and lift induced drag furthermore wave drag is neglected assuming operation at sufficiently large water depths the body friction drag d b f is calculated as 25 d b f q c f a w e t here a w e t is the reference area which in case of friction drag is the wetted surface area c f is the frictional drag coefficient which has to be determined depending on the governing flow regime the flow regime generally is characterized by the reynolds number r e schlichting et al 2016 which is a function of the specific length l the inflow velocity u and the kinematic viscosity ν of the surrounding fluid here ν 1 10 6 m2 s 1 26 r e l u ν the reynolds number determines whether the flow is laminar turbulent or in the transition region in between turbulent flow develops at higher reynolds numbers but can also be caused by e g by surface roughness and vortex shedding edges a simple but common approach is to identify a critical reynolds number at which the flow switches from laminar to turbulent this critical reynolds number often is assumed to be 550 000 schlichting et al 2016 transition effects are difficult to model and the interested reader is referred to lidtke et al 2019 for a deeper analysis of transition effects on underwater gliders the frictional drag coefficient in the turbulent case r e 550000 is estimated from prandtl s one seventh power law prandtl 1925 27 c f turbulent 0 027 r e 1 7 and for the laminar case from blasius skin friction line phillips et al 2017 28 c f laminar 1 327 r e 1 2 additionally it is recommended to increase the frictional drag coefficient by the form factor k joung et al 2012 phillips et al 2017 for spheroids hoerner 1965 suggests multiplication with the following expression 29 1 k 1 1 5 2 r l 3 2 7 2 r l 3 where l as previously is the vehicle length and 2 r is the nominal vehicle diameter when the auv is moving with a non zero α the vehicle body generates hydrodynamic lift l b and lift induced drag d b i the angle of attack is assumed constant over the hull length these forces are estimated as hoerner 1965 30 l b q c l a w e t π 31 d b i q c d i a w e t π here c l and c d i are the coefficients of lift and lift induced drag respectively the reference area in 31 and 30 still is the wetted surface area scaling with 1 π is necessary in order to stay consistent with hoerner 1965 the coefficients for lift and lift induced drag are also estimated from hoerner 1965 32 c d i c d sin 3 α 33 c l c d sin 2 α cos α in 32 and 33 c d is the two dimensional drag coefficient here assumed to be 1 1 for bodies of revolution which is the drag coefficient for a 2d cylinder the total body drag is 34 d b d b f d b i 3 2 forces on control surfaces the forces on the control surfaces i e wings and tail fins rudders are modelled similarly to the body forces all control surfaces are approximated as rectangular not swept and not twisted surfaces with constant cross section over the whole wing span the lift and drag forces are calculated as 35 l t w q c l a p 36 d t w q c d a p it shall be noted that the reference area changes in comparison to 31 and 30 in 35 and 36 the reference area is the wing planform area a p hoerner 1965 and due to the assumptions made it is the product of wing span and chord length the three dimensional lift coefficient is given as torenbeek and wittenberg 2009 37 c l c l 1 2 e a r here a r is the aspect ratio of the control surface and e is the span efficiency also known as oswald efficiency number in practice this value often is taken as 0 9 although its true value is strictly design dependent and can be significantly lower sadraey 2017 c l is the two dimensional lift coefficient for the control surface computed as 38 c l c l α α δ here c l α is the lift curve slope and assumed to be equal to 2 π which can be derived from vortex theory for thin aerofoils of infinite span in incompressible flow torenbeek and wittenberg 2009 the surface deflection δ needs to be added to the angle of attack in order to consider the local angle of attack body wing interference usually is negligible for large wing span to body diameter ratios b d unfortunately most underwater gliders have relatively small b d ratios e g typically 3 for underwater gliders 13 for aerial gliders and hence body wing interference has to be accounted for in order to do so the aspect ratio a r is artificially increased by multiplication factor k w b which typically is chosen as 1 3 hoak and finck 1978 graham and mcdowell 2008 the aspect ratio is calculated as follows for the semi span one free end and full span two free ends 39 ar b k w b 2 2 a one free end 40 ar b k w b 2 a two free ends the total drag of the control surfaces is the sum of profile drag and lift induced drag it again is assumed that skin friction dominates the profile drag hence form drag is dismissed the coefficient of total drag for control surfaces is 41 c d 2 c f c d i the skin friction coefficient is the same as in 28 with reynolds number from 26 only the characteristic length changes to chord length of the control surface scaling by factor 2 is necessary since the reference area in 36 is the planform area not the total wetted surface area the induced drag coefficient is calculated as anderson jr 1985 42 c d i c l 2 π e ar with 22 42 it is now possible to solve the governing set of eqs 17 19 in computer algebra software e g matlab and determine the resulting steady state vehicle flight mechanics the modular structure of this system of equations allows for simple implementation of external higher fidelity data in the form of look up tables e g from experimental data from wind tunnel testing or numerical data from more sophisticated methods such as vortex lattice method vlm or computational fluid dynamics cfd software 4 transit efficiency of legacy gliders case studies on the hull shapes of the legacy gliders slocum spray and seaglider are performed with the goal of evaluating the transit efficiency of these vehicles in glider configuration and propeller configuration when operating in both ideal and biofouling conditions the transit efficiency is evaluated by means of the glide metric 13 with the efficiency ratio set to one several simplifications and assumptions are made in order to perform this case study most commercial propeller driven auvs are designed to have positive buoyancy and maintain submerged level flight through hydrodynamic lift see e g mcphail 2009 some large scale auvs tangirala and dzielski 2007 tiwari and sharma 2020 and highly specialized auvs such as hovering and hydrobatic auvs bhat et al 2019 use buoyancy systems to achieve neutral buoyancy and few use a combination of both methods bi et al 2020 in this study it is assumed that the propeller driven auv can maintain level flight at no additional energy cost i e the power component from actuation of either control surfaces additional induced drag has to be overcome or buoyancy system is neglected it further is assumed that the size of the propeller powertrain equals the size of the buoyancy engine powertrain in general compressibility effects as well as buoyancy variations ocean stratification are neglected in this study this assumption is required in order to keep the model at a reasonably complex level whether this assumption holds depends on the actual design of the underwater glider seaglider is designed to compress at the same rate as seawater leading to constant buoyancy eriksen et al 2001 the feasibility of buoyancy engine be sizing is not assessed even though the forward velocity of underwater gliders is directly proportional to the magnitude of net buoyancy and hence size of the be open seawater based systems provide significantly larger buoyancy changes than closed oil based systems the ratio of propeller train efficiency to vbs efficiency is assumed to be 1 as mentioned in section 2 2 there is a large variation of vbs efficiency depending on operating conditions and technology the introduced uncertainty is too large to be considered in this study 4 1 slocum and spray the slocum underwater glider is based on a idea of heat exchange powered buoyancy driven underwater vehicles by henry stommel from 1989 stommel 1989 it was developed in collaboration with webb et al 2001 and named after joshua slocum the first human to solo circumnavigate the earth as of today the glider is commercially available in thermally and electrically powered vehicle configurations slocum s hull is of typical torpedo like myring shape scripps institution of oceanography has developed a similar underwater glider only electrical which is named after spray joshua slocum s sloop in the typical range of operating reynolds number 1 105 to 1 106 the hydrodynamic coefficients can be considered constant with respect to reynolds number sherman et al 2001 rudnick et al 2004 lift and drag coefficients have been determined numerically by vehicle control technologies inc vct here the reader should be cautious and note that the reference area is the hull length squared a convention taken over from vct the published coefficients α in radians read as follows for slocum humphreys et al 2003 humphreys 2003c 43 c d 0 0015587 α 2 0 058202 44 c l 0 13058 α 2 0 051143 α α and for spray humphreys et al 2003 humphreys 2003a 45 c d 0 0020406 α 2 0 044463 46 c l 0 11878 α 2 0 038418 α α coefficients for slocum for a wide range of angles of attack have also been determined experimentally in wind tunnel tests in the past berman 2003 the data confirms the computed lift coefficient but shows significant deviations in drag coefficient which are reported to likely be due to uncertainties in the processing of drag force measurements however the experimental data qualitatively supports the numerical data increasing confidence levels therein since bare hull coefficients are not available an empirical estimate for the wing drag is subtracted from the vehicle drag at zero angle of attack assuming that wing drag is governed by skin friction drag 27 and 41 with the approximate wing dimensions from rudnick et al 2004 and jenkins et al 2003 are used for the drag reduction 4 2 seaglider the commercial underwater glider seaglider has been thoroughly investigated in the past by several researchers the vehicle s design and main particulars are presented in eriksen et al 2001 and rudnick et al 2004 seaglider s laminar flow shape hull experiences significant re effects as previously reported e g by sherman et al 2001 and rudnick et al 2004 the coefficients published by vct humphreys 2003b humphreys et al 2003 do not take into account reynolds number effects and hence cannot be used in this study fortunately an extensive data set of lift drag and moment coefficients from full scale wind tunnel tests with different vehicle configurations has been published in techy et al 2010 the reader should note that here volumetric hydrodynamic coefficients are used i e the reference area is the square of the cube root of the body volume i e v 2 3 for this study the data has partly been digitized and post processed the data confirms the r e effects and therefore physically sound solutions need to be determined numerically through regression in two dimensions i e angle of attack and inflow velocity in this study the matlab curve fitting tool is used to interpolate and extrapolate the drag and lift coefficients for different values of u and α the drag coefficients and lift coefficients have been curve fitted with a 2nd order 2nd order polynomial r 2 95 81 and a 2nd order 1st order polynomial r 2 98 05 respectively the coefficients are shown in table 1 47 c d p 00 p 10 u p 01 α p 20 u 2 p 11 u α p 02 α 2 48 c l p 00 p 10 u p 01 α p 20 u 2 p 11 u α curve fitting enables evaluation of c d and c l at any given input value and application of a numerical nonlinear system solver for computation of the re corrected flight states the bare hull drag coefficient at zero angle of attack can be approximated by a simple power function r 2 0 9839 as also see fig 3 49 c d 0 034 u 0 55 due to the reynolds number effects the optimum glide path angle also becomes dependent on r e making the evaluation of 9 significantly more difficult while for slocum and spray the transit performance can be evaluated by considering only a constant optimum angle of attack a wider range of angles of attack must be considered for seaglider the minimum energy consumption lowest glide coefficient 12 is then found numerically as the lower envelope for of the different levels of energy consumption in all possible flight states due to extrapolation uncertainties the presented results for seaglider are only be considered reliable for the velocity range up to 0 862ms 1 the highest velocity studied by techy et al 2010 4 3 transit performance the transit performance of the legacy underwater gliders is evaluated in terms of the glide metric 13 for each configuration i e underwater glider and propeller modified vehicle biofouling conditions are considered by penalizing the hydrodynamic coefficients artificially as in 14 and 15 according to section 2 3 in order to correctly interpret the results the reader is reminded that a glide metric lower than 1 indicates more energy efficient horizontal travel of the underwater glider compared to a propeller driven auv of the same shape vice versa a glide metric greater than 1 means more energy efficient horizontal travel of the propeller driven auv a metric of value 1 means equally energy efficient travel these relations come from the division of the equivalent propulsive power of the glider by the propulsive power of the propeller driven auv leading to the glide metric 13 fig 4 shows the glide metric for all three vehicles in ideal conditions and in the presence of biofouling for the slocum and spray bodies with r e independent hydrodynamic coefficients advantages for gliding locomotion in ideal conditions can be observed 25 to 30 lower power consumption whereas in the presence of biofouling the propeller configurations proves significantly more efficient 45 to 50 seaglider s transit performance is significantly influenced by r e effects and tends to decrease with increasing velocity for the ideal case the glider configuration proves more efficient up to a horizontal velocity of 0 95ms 1 where transit efficiency of both vehicle configurations is equal this point already lies above the highest velocity studied by techy et al 2010 yet a trend of rapidly decreasing glider performance can clearly be seen for the biofouling case as for the other two gliders the propeller driven version of the vehicle is more efficient throughout the considered velocity range from 15 to 300 higher efficiency furthermore the transit performance of seaglider is subject to significant oscillations these can be explained as follows both optimum angle of attack and glide coefficient c g l can be approximated as functions of velocity squared within the velocity range of interest with a minimum at 0 7ms 1 as shown in fig 3 the bare hull drag coefficient can be approximated by a power function the observed oscillations in the results are caused by division of the glide coefficient parabolic shape by the bare hull drag coefficient power function the hydrodynamic reasons for this behaviour go beyond the scope of this paper the effect of biofouling amplifies the observed oscillations the drastic decrease in glider transit performance when the vehicle is subject to biofouling is due to a double penalty in drag and lift rendering propeller driven auvs more efficient than underwater gliders biofouling can be prevented or reduced by avoiding tropical and subtropical water masses as well as by operating in deep water and minimizing surfacing time if long endurance missions are to be conducted in biofouling prone areas sufficient antifouling measures have to be taken and a propeller driven auv can be the vehicle type of choice a further risk related to biofouling is the associated change in buoyancy and mass an issue that has to be addressed in the future 5 model validation and application it can be shown that the model presented in section 3 predicts the hydrodynamic behaviour of underwater vehicles qualitatively correct within acceptable errors bounds the model has been validated against the published slocum data humphreys 2003c humphreys et al 2003 in the velocity range 0 1ms 1 to 1ms 1 uniform increments of 0 1ms 1 for angles of attack from 0 to 15 uniform increments of 0 05 the model input data is given in table 2 and is based on the data published by rudnick et al 2004 fig 5a shows the glide polar for the slocum hull using the published cfd data continuous lines and the presented model dashed lines the glide polar itself serves as a fairly good means of visualization of the related error since it contains information about both lift and drag at various angles of attack figs 5b and 5c show the percentage error distribution for drag and lift forces it can be seen that lift is modelled with satisfying accuracy throughout the model range with errors typically not exceeding 15 the empirical estimates for drag forces deviate from the published cfd data by up to 25 the presented model proves to be better at predicting lower velocities 0 25ms 1 and higher velocities 0 75ms 1 where the associated error mostly remains under 15 for medium velocities the associated area tends to be slightly higher mostly around 10 to 20 the steady state flight mechanics model is now applied to the slocum underwater vehicle in order to study the effects of wing size on vehicle performance while the wing positioning only affects the requirements towards moving masses ignoring changing interference effects related to wing positioning the actual wing span can be modified to optimize a glider s transit performance using the model input data from table 2 the glide metric 13 with reference drag coefficient c d 0 being the body only drag coefficient at zero angle of attack is calculated for different wing configurations aspect ratios different net buoyancies ranging from 1n to 8n are used and the wing span is varied from 0 to 250 of the standard wing size the results are shown in fig 6 the blue area shows the glide metric as computed band for each wing configuration at the resulting optimal flight state the width of that band represents the range of achievable glide velocities the results suggest that slocum s actual wing span represents a near optimum design with the glide metric being close to a minimum at 100 wing span both increasing and decreasing wing spans have adverse effects on transit performance 6 discussion evaluating the transit performance of underwater vehicles is an ambitious task and in order to keep model complexity at a reasonable level several assumptions had to be made it is of great importance to bear in mind these assumptions when analysing or interpreting results a known issue is the underestimation of skin friction drag which likely originates from a violated smooth body assumption phillips et al 2008 commonly made when applying both empirical or computational methods in fact the discrepancy between modelling approaches and experimental data can easily be accounted for by changing the respective expressions in the model i e improving modelling of the frictional drag coefficient in this study the model is validated against the much higher fidelity results from cfd computations when validating against experimental data empirical estimates for the frictional drag coefficients as presented in gudmundsson 2014 essentially based on schlichting et al 2016 or in phillips et al 2017 can yield better results the decision to validate against cfd data was necessary due to the lack of reliable high quality experimental data data on the effects of biofouling or in a broader sense the effects of surface roughness on lift and drag properties at varying angles of attack are scarce and require further attention consideration of such effects has been proven to be important offering potential for future research furthermore due to the operational portfolio of underwater gliders the transition between laminar and turbulent flow can play an important role as mentioned in section 3 1 the transition zone is difficult to capture using simple models and more work is required on this topic the interested reader is referred to literature e g lidtke et al 2019 the study shows that for certain applications the less expensive lower fidelity models can be very useful e g for performance evaluation at the early design stage for the design of controllers and manoeuvring simulations higher fidelity models are required which are also capable of considering nonlinearities introduced by e g waves and currents such models can be found e g in thomasson and woolsey 2013 for controller design for underwater gliders subject to environmental disturbances the reader is referred to ullah et al 2019 the effects of a moving atmosphere on soaring of birds have also been studied both analytically and empirically by taylor et al 2016 who are suggesting that birds increase their airspeed in unfavourable headwinds and decrease their airspeed in favourable winds in order to minimize cost of transport further research on the applicability of such results to underwater robots is expected to yield interesting results improving the performance of underwater vehicles is a popular topic among maritime and robotic researchers there are many different approaches to solve this problem including bio inspired and biomimetic robots recent research on body and or caudal fin bcf and median and paired fins mpf swimmers lead to the conclusion that bio inspired auv design can further improve the overall performance of auvs scaradozzi et al 2017 for future research it will be interesting to extend the evaluation of auv propulsion systems to include new means of locomotion such as bcf and mpf one difficulty that also arises with other propulsion systems are uncertainties in the powertrain efficiencies as mentioned in section 2 2 the powertrain efficiency for propellers are well known potentially due to maturity of technology whereas the efficiency of buoyancy systems can vary significantly this may be understood as a call for further research on buoyancy systems and their implementation in underwater vehicles 7 conclusions this paper contributes to answering the often disputed transit performance of underwater gliders in comparison to common propeller driven auvs by extending previous studies e g steinberg et al 2010 and dhanak and xiros 2016 in terms of operating conditions and speed a simple but practical glide metric based on hydrodynamic coefficients is introduced and consequently used to compare the transit performance of the existing state of the art legacy underwater gliders to propeller driven versions thereof mathematical evaluation of the left hand side of the glide metric 13 shows that in the best possible case assume c l c d c d 0 the glider can be twice as efficient as the propeller driven vehicle in reality however the reference drag coefficient of the unwinged vehicle at zero angle of attack can be significantly lower than the glider s drag coefficient yielding higher glide metrics for the legacy gliders slocum and spray this glide metric is about 0 75 indicating a 25 higher efficiency for gliding locomotion for the seaglider hull this glide metric fluctuates around the same value for velocities up to 0 8ms 1 but experiences significantly adverse r e effects for velocities 0 8ms 1 while these results are true for ideal operating conditions it is also found that the presence of biofouling inflicts a double penalty on underwater gliders by increasing drag and decreasing lift when biofouling is taken into account propeller driven vehicles generally show superior transit performance as a result the choice of propulsion method becomes not only a question of design but also operating conditions the most significant demerits are the associated modelling uncertainties in particular in the estimation of frictional drag modelling of transitional flows and consideration of powertrain efficiencies furthermore a tool for the prediction of vehicle performance is provided in form of an intermediate fidelity flight mechanics model the model is validated against the published slocum data humphreys 2003c and it is shown that the vehicle performance is predicted qualitatively correct within acceptable error bounds strictly 30 as an example the model is demonstrated finding an optimum wing span that provides best transit performance unsurprisingly this optimal wing span is found to be the already existing one the strengths of the intermediate fidelity model lie in its simplicity and modularity allowing not only for quick computation time but also implementation of external data sets from cfd studies or wind tunnel tests in the form of look up tables also if more specific design parameters are known more design specific approximations for estimations of hull forces can be used e g jorgensen 1973b a and hopkins 1951 for a detailed analysis of more complex flow phenomena such as interference between wings and hull as well as the flow

gliders slocum spray and seaglider as well as propeller modified versions thereof is evaluated the evaluation is based on various data sets from wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd studies and shows that for the respective hull shapes gliding locomotion proves more efficient in ideal conditions however biofouling conditions inflict a double penalty on glider performance rendering gliders inferior to propeller driven vehicles the slocum data set is used to validate a steady state flight mechanics model for qualitative performance prediction it is shown that even simplistic models based on semi empirical and analytical expressions can be successfully used for design optimization through parametrization being computationally efficient the model can be a useful tool for design engineers in early design phases the model is used to evaluate the effects of wing span on gliding efficiency indicating that the current design of the slocum glider is near optimal keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv underwater glider performance hydrodynamic modelling 1 introduction in times of global climate change there is a significantly increasing interest among the oceanographic community in pushing boundaries and shedding light into the great vastness of yet unexplored regions in our oceans which play a vital role in the planet s climate physics especially the polar waters under and around the antarctic ice shelf and the arctic ice sheet have been receiving attention in recent years king et al 2019 mcphail et al 2019 yamagata et al 2019 imposing great challenges on engineers to improve the current generation of state of the art autonomous underwater vehicles auvs long term ocean observation and monitoring helps climate scientists understand and predict physical processes in the atmosphere better typical missions can extend over hundreds or even thousands of kilometres in range and last for several months this spatial and temporal extent inevitably increases requirements towards autonomy navigation and endurance of auvs the endurance of auvs depends on two factors energy consumption and energy capacity yuh et al 2011 energy capacity mainly depends on battery technology and allocated size whereas energy consumption is a function of vehicle shape operational speed propulsive power and hotel load increasing both the temporal and spatial range of underwater vehicles enables scientists to gather more and better data at less financial expense for many years there has been consensus among auv designers and operators that underwater gliders generally are superior in terms of range and endurance in comparison to common propeller driven auvs gafurov and klochkov 2015 dhanak and xiros 2016 analysed the efficiency of propeller blades and wings based on hydromechanic principles concluding that wings are intrinsically more efficient due to their vortex shedding characteristics however this analysis did not consider the differences in locomotion of propeller driven level flight and sawtooth like glide cycles already in 2010 steinberg et al 2010 performed a study on the transit performance of both types of propulsion systems concluding that they are equally efficient in terms of transit energy consumption and that the choice of propulsion system ultimately should depend on the application only in recent years several auvs with outstanding long range capabilities have been presented furlong et al 2007 mcphail 2009 furlong et al 2012 hobson et al 2012 roper et al 2017 offering a potentially interesting alternative to underwater gliders in the domain of long range underwater missions the research question however which of the propulsion systems provides the better performance for long range horizontal travel has not been attended to enough in this paper the transit performance of the legacy underwater gliders slocum spray and seaglider as well as propeller modified versions thereof is assessed in ideal and biofouling conditions the evaluation is based on published computational and experimental data a simple yet generic intermediate fidelity steady state flight mechanics model for underwater vehicles is presented and validated against the published data it is shown how the model can be applied in vehicle design optimization in order to help engineers understand how design configurations affect vehicle performance it is most important for the model to be able to predict the hydrodynamic behaviour qualitatively correct with acceptable quantitative accuracy 2 performance of underwater vehicles performance is a human defined concept and as such it is dynamic its meaning can vary between different users and operators depending on their ultimate goals or application here performance is evaluated in terms of range endurance and speed other definitions of performance can include manoeuvrability autonomy or be more sensor specific in the following the theoretical background of underwater locomotion is elaborated on briefly since underwater gliding poses a special case in terms of locomotion the most important flight mechanics of gliders are presented after that the transit performance of both underwater gliders and propeller driven auvs is defined this section is concluded with a short review on the effects of marine biofouling on the hydrodynamic properties of lifting bodies an important aspect when evaluating flight performance in real world conditions throughout the paper the hydrodynamic forces drag d and lift l are expressed in terms of the dimensionless drag coefficient c d and lift coefficient c l respectively 1 d 1 2 ρ u 2 c d α r e a 2 l 1 2 ρ u 2 c l α r e a here ρ is the density of the surrounding fluid i e seawater u is the inflow velocity and a the reference area that the hydrodynamic coefficients are referenced to both hydrodynamic coefficients can be functions of the angle of attack α and the reynolds number r e 2 1 gliding locomotion underwater gliders glide along an inclined trajectory by alternating between positive and negative net buoyancy b n e t as schematically shown in fig 1 the lifting surfaces generate a lift force that is responsible for horizontal travel of the vehicle the angle of attack α and the inflow velocity determine hydrodynamic drag and lift acting on the vehicle the instantaneous angle of attack on the vehicle can be controlled by moving an internal mass and hence changing the vehicle s attitude the ratio of the hydrodynamic forces also determines the glide path angle γ as 3 γ tan 1 c d c l from conservation of mechanical energy the following expressions for vertical velocity w also known as sink rate and horizontal velocity u can be derived as wagner 2003 dhanak and xiros 2016 4 u 2 b n e t ρ a c l α r e c l 2 α r e c d 2 α r e 3 4 5 w 2 b n e t ρ a c d α r e c l 2 α r e c d 2 α r e 3 4 2 2 transit efficiency and glide metric the transit efficiency is evaluated in terms of the energy required per metre horizontal travel and denoted by e t in joule per metre for the propeller driven auv superscript p the energy required per metre is equal to the drag force d 6 e t p d s s d for the glider superscript g it can be seen from fig 1 that the travelled transit distance s h is inversely proportional to the tangent of the glide path angle and directly proportional to the apogee depth d yielding 7 s h 2 d tan γ the effective pump energy e p expended at apogee depth d is 8 e p b n e t d assuming negligible pump energy consumption to initiate a dive cycle 7 and 8 can now be combined to obtain the glider s energy consumption per metre travelled horizontally per dive cycle as 9 e t g 1 2 b n e t tan γ 1 2 b n e t c d c l here it also is assumed that the time required to reach terminal velocity steady state is much smaller than the total time of a dive cycle i e the acceleration phase does not affect the transit efficiency when estimating the achievable range for a given vehicle configuration energy consumption from propulsion as well as all other on board systems e g scientific instrumentation needs to be included it therefore is more practical to study propulsive power rather than energy consumption for the propeller driven auv the propulsive power p p is the effective power needed to overcome drag and is expressed as 10 p p p 1 2 ρ u 3 c d a 1 η p p where the propulsive efficiency η p p for the propeller based powertrain is introduced for the underwater glider the equivalent propulsive power p p g averaged over one dive cycle for the transit case is given as 11 p p g 1 2 ρ u 3 c g l a 1 η p g where η p g is the efficiency of the buoyancy system and c g l denotes the glide coefficient its dependency on c d and c l is derived from 4 and 9 by substituting the net buoyancy term as 12 c g l c d c d 2 c l 2 3 2 2 c l 3 in cases where c d and c l are r e independent and only a function of α the optimum angle of attack that enables maximum range can be identified by finding the simple zero of the derivative of the glide coefficient with respect to α by taking the ratio of p p g p p p a simple design metric referred to as the glide metric for the determination of a favourable propulsion system is derived the underwater glider thus is considered more efficient in transit when the following inequality is satisfied 13 c d c d 2 c l 2 3 2 2 c d 0 c l 3 η p g η p p where c d 0 represents the reference drag coefficient at zero angle of attack ideally the reference drag coefficient is taken as the bare hull drag coefficient enabling comparison between underwater glider and propeller driven auv however for small wings the drag contribution can be argued to be negligible since the wing surface area is significantly smaller than the wetted surface area of the body from an engineering perspective the propulsive efficiency of the buoyancy engine is hard to evaluate the efficiency of buoyancy engines can vary significantly from 8 to 70 depending on operating pressure and the actual technology used rudnick et al 2004 kobayashi et al 2010 worall et al 2007 whereas the propulsive efficiency of propeller based powertrains averages at about 50 furlong et al 2007 phillips et al 2012 therefore the ratio η p p η p g is neglected in the performance evaluation in section 4 i e assumed to be equal to 1 due to the glider s complex dynamics physical interpretation of metrics such as 13 often is rather cumbersome despite their conceptually simple derivation chen et al 2015 and fu et al 2018 have applied a similar metric based on a power conversion principle power consumption in the horizontal direction compared to net buoyancy potential output the benefit of using 13 is its sole dependency on hydrodynamic coefficients and therefore simple integration in the design process 2 3 effects of marine biofouling hydrodynamic coefficients are often computed only for ideal conditions assuming smooth surfaces for the vehicle and all appendices however especially on long endurance missions this assumption is likely to be violated by the formation of marine biofouling marine biofouling is caused by the adhesion and growth of marine animals plants and slime on the surface of a submerged body and can significantly decrease the operational efficiency of underwater vehicles the type and intensity of biofouling strongly depends on environmental variables such as water quality temperature currents and sunlight conditions lobe et al 2010 orme et al 2001 first traces of biofouling can be seen after just a few weeks of operation and in the worst case render the vehicle inoperative within three months of operation haldeman et al 2016 even though the negative effects of marine biofouling are well known to the maritime community its effects on vehicle performance in particular with respect to different propulsion systems are yet to be studied while propeller driven vehicles mostly suffer from increased drag underwater gliders suffer from increased drag and simultaneously decreased lift results from experimental orme et al 2001 and numerical khor and xiao 2011 studies on lifting bodies are in fairly good agreement with the results published by walker et al 2014 suggesting a decrease in lift coefficient by up to 40 and an increase in drag coefficient by up to 90 for medium to severe levels of biofouling in accordance the hydrodynamic coefficients are corrected for biofouling by applying penalty factors the equations for biofouling corrected drag and lift coefficients c d b f and c l b f respectively then read 14 c d b f 1 9 c d 15 c l b f 0 6 c l 3 numerical modelling a simple yet generic steady state model for flight mechanics of underwater vehicles is derived from force balance using analytical as well as semi empirical expressions for hydrodynamic estimates the model is valid for both propeller driven auvs and underwater gliders the applicability and usefulness of similar simple models has been proven in the past nahon 1996 furlong et al 2007 when using such models it is of uttermost importance to understand the limitations imposed by the model itself in order to interpret output thereof fig 2 shows forces angles and coordinate systems in a free body diagram the model is constrained to the xz plane dive plane hence only 3 degrees of freedom dof are considered surge heave and pitch the auv is modelled in a body fixed coordinate system and an earth fixed coordinate system using cartesian coordinates all forces and their positions are expressed in the body fixed coordinate system the origin of the body fixed coordinate system is chosen as the stern of the hull exemplarily the auv is divided into three sections body wings and tail fins these sections are referred to by subscripts b w and t respectively however the model is easily modifiable and can be adjusted to other subdivisions the centre of pressure of each section is described by its longitudinal and if applicable vertical positions i e x b w t and z b w t and is considered to be constant for all flight conditions this is one of the major simplifications and yet a necessary sacrifice of solution accuracy in order to achieve reasonably fast computation the same assumption is applied to the centre of buoyancy c b and the centre of gravity c g their locations are defined by their vertical z and longitudinal x coordinates with subscripts b and g respectively the chord lengths of the control surfaces wing and tail are denoted by c and their deflection by δ with corresponding subscripts the thrust force t is applied at the respective x and z location x t and z t optionally vectored thrust can be implemented into the model by considering the thrust vector angle δ t interference effects between thrusters and hull or control surfaces are neglected e g increased elevator lift due to locally increased pressure in the propeller slipstream the angle between the coordinate systems is the pitch angle ϕ see fig 2 the slope angle or glide path angle see 3 γ is defined as the direction of travel relative to the horizontal axis and the vehicle speed along γ is the absolute velocity u pitch angle and slope angle are coupled through the angle of attack α as 16 ϕ α γ the angle of attack is assumed to be constant over the entire vehicle the hydrodynamic force along the axis of motion is drag d the hydrodynamic force perpendicular to that is lift l lift and drag are calculated separately for each vehicle section the buoyancy force b is acting positively upwards through c b and the gravity force g is acting positively downward through c g the difference between b and g is the net buoyancy for static equilibrium in the body fixed coordinate system around origin the following three equations must be satisfied 17 f x b g t t sin ϕ cos δ t 1 1 1 t l b d b l w d w l t d t sin α cos α 0 18 f z b g t t cos ϕ sin δ t 1 1 1 t l b d b l w d w l t d t

forces for which z i 0 as well as moments caused by vectored thrust when it is applied elsewhere than in the origin the off centreline moments m o c are given by 20 m o c z b z w z t t l b d b l w d w l t d t sin α cos α and the thrust vectoring moment m t is given by 21 m t x t z t t t sin δ t cos δ t the hydrodynamic forces that appear in 17 20 are calculated separately for each source of origin this model considers frictional drag lift and lift induced drag for simplification the dynamic pressure q is defined beforehand as 22 q 1 2 ρ u 2 3 1 forces on the body the buoyancy force b is defined as 23 b ρ g v where g is the gravitational constant and v is the volume displaced by the vehicle the gravity force g is the product of vehicle dry mass m and the gravitational constant g 24 g m g it is assumed that the auv is a streamlined body thus neglecting form drag and only considering friction drag and lift induced drag furthermore wave drag is neglected assuming operation at sufficiently large water depths the body friction drag d b f is calculated as 25 d b f q c f a w e t here a w e t is the reference area which in case of friction drag is the wetted surface area c f is the frictional drag coefficient which has to be determined depending on the governing flow regime the flow regime generally is characterized by the reynolds number r e schlichting et al 2016 which is a function of the specific length l the inflow velocity u and the kinematic viscosity ν of the surrounding fluid here ν 1 10 6 m2 s 1 26 r e l u ν the reynolds number determines whether the flow is laminar turbulent or in the transition region in between turbulent flow develops at higher reynolds numbers but can also be caused by e g by surface roughness and vortex shedding edges a simple but common approach is to identify a critical reynolds number at which the flow switches from laminar to turbulent this critical reynolds number often is assumed to be 550 000 schlichting et al 2016 transition effects are difficult to model and the interested reader is referred to lidtke et al 2019 for a deeper analysis of transition effects on underwater gliders the frictional drag coefficient in the turbulent case r e 550000 is estimated from prandtl s one seventh power law prandtl 1925 27 c f turbulent 0 027 r e 1 7 and for the laminar case from blasius skin friction line phillips et al 2017 28 c f laminar 1 327 r e 1 2 additionally it is recommended to increase the frictional drag coefficient by the form factor k joung et al 2012 phillips et al 2017 for spheroids hoerner 1965 suggests multiplication with the following expression 29 1 k 1 1 5 2 r l 3 2 7 2 r l 3 where l as previously is the vehicle length and 2 r is the nominal vehicle diameter when the auv is moving with a non zero α the vehicle body generates hydrodynamic lift l b and lift induced drag d b i the angle of attack is assumed constant over the hull length these forces are estimated as hoerner 1965 30 l b q c l a w e t π 31 d b i q c d i a w e t π here c l and c d i are the coefficients of lift and lift induced drag respectively the reference area in 31 and 30 still is the wetted surface area scaling with 1 π is necessary in order to stay consistent with hoerner 1965 the coefficients for lift and lift induced drag are also estimated from hoerner 1965 32 c d i c d sin 3 α 33 c l c d sin 2 α cos α in 32 and 33 c d is the two dimensional drag coefficient here assumed to be 1 1 for bodies of revolution which is the drag coefficient for a 2d cylinder the total body drag is 34 d b d b f d b i 3 2 forces on control surfaces the forces on the control surfaces i e wings and tail fins rudders are modelled similarly to the body forces all control surfaces are approximated as rectangular not swept and not twisted surfaces with constant cross section over the whole wing span the lift and drag forces are calculated as 35 l t w q c l a p 36 d t w q c d a p it shall be noted that the reference area changes in comparison to 31 and 30 in 35 and 36 the reference area is the wing planform area a p hoerner 1965 and due to the assumptions made it is the product of wing span and chord length the three dimensional lift coefficient is given as torenbeek and wittenberg 2009 37 c l c l 1 2 e a r here a r is the aspect ratio of the control surface and e is the span efficiency also known as oswald efficiency number in practice this value often is taken as 0 9 although its true value is strictly design dependent and can be significantly lower sadraey 2017 c l is the two dimensional lift coefficient for the control surface computed as 38 c l c l α α δ here c l α is the lift curve slope and assumed to be equal to 2 π which can be derived from vortex theory for thin aerofoils of infinite span in incompressible flow torenbeek and wittenberg 2009 the surface deflection δ needs to be added to the angle of attack in order to consider the local angle of attack body wing interference usually is negligible for large wing span to body diameter ratios b d unfortunately most underwater gliders have relatively small b d ratios e g typically 3 for underwater gliders 13 for aerial gliders and hence body wing interference has to be accounted for in order to do so the aspect ratio a r is artificially increased by multiplication factor k w b which typically is chosen as 1 3 hoak and finck 1978 graham and mcdowell 2008 the aspect ratio is calculated as follows for the semi span one free end and full span two free ends 39 ar b k w b 2 2 a one free end 40 ar b k w b 2 a two free ends the total drag of the control surfaces is the sum of profile drag and lift induced drag it again is assumed that skin friction dominates the profile drag hence form drag is dismissed the coefficient of total drag for control surfaces is 41 c d 2 c f c d i the skin friction coefficient is the same as in 28 with reynolds number from 26 only the characteristic length changes to chord length of the control surface scaling by factor 2 is necessary since the reference area in 36 is the planform area not the total wetted surface area the induced drag coefficient is calculated as anderson jr 1985 42 c d i c l 2 π e ar with 22 42 it is now possible to solve the governing set of eqs 17 19 in computer algebra software e g matlab and determine the resulting steady state vehicle flight mechanics the modular structure of this system of equations allows for simple implementation of external higher fidelity data in the form of look up tables e g from experimental data from wind tunnel testing or numerical data from more sophisticated methods such as vortex lattice method vlm or computational fluid dynamics cfd software 4 transit efficiency of legacy gliders case studies on the hull shapes of the legacy gliders slocum spray and seaglider are performed with the goal of evaluating the transit efficiency of these vehicles in glider configuration and propeller configuration when operating in both ideal and biofouling conditions the transit efficiency is evaluated by means of the glide metric 13 with the efficiency ratio set to one several simplifications and assumptions are made in order to perform this case study most commercial propeller driven auvs are designed to have positive buoyancy and maintain submerged level flight through hydrodynamic lift see e g mcphail 2009 some large scale auvs tangirala and dzielski 2007 tiwari and sharma 2020 and highly specialized auvs such as hovering and hydrobatic auvs bhat et al 2019 use buoyancy systems to achieve neutral buoyancy and few use a combination of both methods bi et al 2020 in this study it is assumed that the propeller driven auv can maintain level flight at no additional energy cost i e the power component from actuation of either control surfaces additional induced drag has to be overcome or buoyancy system is neglected it further is assumed that the size of the propeller powertrain equals the size of the buoyancy engine powertrain in general compressibility effects as well as buoyancy variations ocean stratification are neglected in this study this assumption is required in order to keep the model at a reasonably complex level whether this assumption holds depends on the actual design of the underwater glider seaglider is designed to compress at the same rate as seawater leading to constant buoyancy eriksen et al 2001 the feasibility of buoyancy engine be sizing is not assessed even though the forward velocity of underwater gliders is directly proportional to the magnitude of net buoyancy and hence size of the be open seawater based systems provide significantly larger buoyancy changes than closed oil based systems the ratio of propeller train efficiency to vbs efficiency is assumed to be 1 as mentioned in section 2 2 there is a large variation of vbs efficiency depending on operating conditions and technology the introduced uncertainty is too large to be considered in this study 4 1 slocum and spray the slocum underwater glider is based on a idea of heat exchange powered buoyancy driven underwater vehicles by henry stommel from 1989 stommel 1989 it was developed in collaboration with webb et al 2001 and named after joshua slocum the first human to solo circumnavigate the earth as of today the glider is commercially available in thermally and electrically powered vehicle configurations slocum s hull is of typical torpedo like myring shape scripps institution of oceanography has developed a similar underwater glider only electrical which is named after spray joshua slocum s sloop in the typical range of operating reynolds number 1 105 to 1 106 the hydrodynamic coefficients can be considered constant with respect to reynolds number sherman et al 2001 rudnick et al 2004 lift and drag coefficients have been determined numerically by vehicle control technologies inc vct here the reader should be cautious and note that the reference area is the hull length squared a convention taken over from vct the published coefficients α in radians read as follows for slocum humphreys et al 2003 humphreys 2003c 43 c d 0 0015587 α 2 0 058202 44 c l 0 13058 α 2 0 051143 α α and for spray humphreys et al 2003 humphreys 2003a 45 c d 0 0020406 α 2 0 044463 46 c l 0 11878 α 2 0 038418 α α coefficients for slocum for a wide range of angles of attack have also been determined experimentally in wind tunnel tests in the past berman 2003 the data confirms the computed lift coefficient but shows significant deviations in drag coefficient which are reported to likely be due to uncertainties in the processing of drag force measurements however the experimental data qualitatively supports the numerical data increasing confidence levels therein since bare hull coefficients are not available an empirical estimate for the wing drag is subtracted from the vehicle drag at zero angle of attack assuming that wing drag is governed by skin friction drag 27 and 41 with the approximate wing dimensions from rudnick et al 2004 and jenkins et al 2003 are used for the drag reduction 4 2 seaglider the commercial underwater glider seaglider has been thoroughly investigated in the past by several researchers the vehicle s design and main particulars are presented in eriksen et al 2001 and rudnick et al 2004 seaglider s laminar flow shape hull experiences significant re effects as previously reported e g by sherman et al 2001 and rudnick et al 2004 the coefficients published by vct humphreys 2003b humphreys et al 2003 do not take into account reynolds number effects and hence cannot be used in this study fortunately an extensive data set of lift drag and moment coefficients from full scale wind tunnel tests with different vehicle configurations has been published in techy et al 2010 the reader should note that here volumetric hydrodynamic coefficients are used i e the reference area is the square of the cube root of the body volume i e v 2 3 for this study the data has partly been digitized and post processed the data confirms the r e effects and therefore physically sound solutions need to be determined numerically through regression in two dimensions i e angle of attack and inflow velocity in this study the matlab curve fitting tool is used to interpolate and extrapolate the drag and lift coefficients for different values of u and α the drag coefficients and lift coefficients have been curve fitted with a 2nd order 2nd order polynomial r 2 95 81 and a 2nd order 1st order polynomial r 2 98 05 respectively the coefficients are shown in table 1 47 c d p 00 p 10 u p 01 α p 20 u 2 p 11 u α p 02 α 2 48 c l p 00 p 10 u p 01 α p 20 u 2 p 11 u α curve fitting enables evaluation of c d and c l at any given input value and application of a numerical nonlinear system solver for computation of the re corrected flight states the bare hull drag coefficient at zero angle of attack can be approximated by a simple power function r 2 0 9839 as also see fig 3 49 c d 0 034 u 0 55 due to the reynolds number effects the optimum glide path angle also becomes dependent on r e making the evaluation of 9 significantly more difficult while for slocum and spray the transit performance can be evaluated by considering only a constant optimum angle of attack a wider range of angles of attack must be considered for seaglider the minimum energy consumption lowest glide coefficient 12 is then found numerically as the lower envelope for of the different levels of energy consumption in all possible flight states due to extrapolation uncertainties the presented results for seaglider are only be considered reliable for the velocity range up to 0 862ms 1 the highest velocity studied by techy et al 2010 4 3 transit performance the transit performance of the legacy underwater gliders is evaluated in terms of the glide metric 13 for each configuration i e underwater glider and propeller modified vehicle biofouling conditions are considered by penalizing the hydrodynamic coefficients artificially as in 14 and 15 according to section 2 3 in order to correctly interpret the results the reader is reminded that a glide metric lower than 1 indicates more energy efficient horizontal travel of the underwater glider compared to a propeller driven auv of the same shape vice versa a glide metric greater than 1 means more energy efficient horizontal travel of the propeller driven auv a metric of value 1 means equally energy efficient travel these relations come from the division of the equivalent propulsive power of the glider by the propulsive power of the propeller driven auv leading to the glide metric 13 fig 4 shows the glide metric for all three vehicles in ideal conditions and in the presence of biofouling for the slocum and spray bodies with r e independent hydrodynamic coefficients advantages for gliding locomotion in ideal conditions can be observed 25 to 30 lower power consumption whereas in the presence of biofouling the propeller configurations proves significantly more efficient 45 to 50 seaglider s transit performance is significantly influenced by r e effects and tends to decrease with increasing velocity for the ideal case the glider configuration proves more efficient up to a horizontal velocity of 0 95ms 1 where transit efficiency of both vehicle configurations is equal this point already lies above the highest velocity studied by techy et al 2010 yet a trend of rapidly decreasing glider performance can clearly be seen for the biofouling case as for the other two gliders the propeller driven version of the vehicle is more efficient throughout the considered velocity range from 15 to 300 higher efficiency furthermore the transit performance of seaglider is subject to significant oscillations these can be explained as follows both optimum angle of attack and glide coefficient c g l can be approximated as functions of velocity squared within the velocity range of interest with a minimum at 0 7ms 1 as shown in fig 3 the bare hull drag coefficient can be approximated by a power function the observed oscillations in the results are caused by division of the glide coefficient parabolic shape by the bare hull drag coefficient power function the hydrodynamic reasons for this behaviour go beyond the scope of this paper the effect of biofouling amplifies the observed oscillations the drastic decrease in glider transit performance when the vehicle is subject to biofouling is due to a double penalty in drag and lift rendering propeller driven auvs more efficient than underwater gliders biofouling can be prevented or reduced by avoiding tropical and subtropical water masses as well as by operating in deep water and minimizing surfacing time if long endurance missions are to be conducted in biofouling prone areas sufficient antifouling measures have to be taken and a propeller driven auv can be the vehicle type of choice a further risk related to biofouling is the associated change in buoyancy and mass an issue that has to be addressed in the future 5 model validation and application it can be shown that the model presented in section 3 predicts the hydrodynamic behaviour of underwater vehicles qualitatively correct within acceptable errors bounds the model has been validated against the published slocum data humphreys 2003c humphreys et al 2003 in the velocity range 0 1ms 1 to 1ms 1 uniform increments of 0 1ms 1 for angles of attack from 0 to 15 uniform increments of 0 05 the model input data is given in table 2 and is based on the data published by rudnick et al 2004 fig 5a shows the glide polar for the slocum hull using the published cfd data continuous lines and the presented model dashed lines the glide polar itself serves as a fairly good means of visualization of the related error since it contains information about both lift and drag at various angles of attack figs 5b and 5c show the percentage error distribution for drag and lift forces it can be seen that lift is modelled with satisfying accuracy throughout the model range with errors typically not exceeding 15 the empirical estimates for drag forces deviate from the published cfd data by up to 25 the presented model proves to be better at predicting lower velocities 0 25ms 1 and higher velocities 0 75ms 1 where the associated error mostly remains under 15 for medium velocities the associated area tends to be slightly higher mostly around 10 to 20 the steady state flight mechanics model is now applied to the slocum underwater vehicle in order to study the effects of wing size on vehicle performance while the wing positioning only affects the requirements towards moving masses ignoring changing interference effects related to wing positioning the actual wing span can be modified to optimize a glider s transit performance using the model input data from table 2 the glide metric 13 with reference drag coefficient c d 0 being the body only drag coefficient at zero angle of attack is calculated for different wing configurations aspect ratios different net buoyancies ranging from 1n to 8n are used and the wing span is varied from 0 to 250 of the standard wing size the results are shown in fig 6 the blue area shows the glide metric as computed band for each wing configuration at the resulting optimal flight state the width of that band represents the range of achievable glide velocities the results suggest that slocum s actual wing span represents a near optimum design with the glide metric being close to a minimum at 100 wing span both increasing and decreasing wing spans have adverse effects on transit performance 6 discussion evaluating the transit performance of underwater vehicles is an ambitious task and in order to keep model complexity at a reasonable level several assumptions had to be made it is of great importance to bear in mind these assumptions when analysing or interpreting results a known issue is the underestimation of skin friction drag which likely originates from a violated smooth body assumption phillips et al 2008 commonly made when applying both empirical or computational methods in fact the discrepancy between modelling approaches and experimental data can easily be accounted for by changing the respective expressions in the model i e improving modelling of the frictional drag coefficient in this study the model is validated against the much higher fidelity results from cfd computations when validating against experimental data empirical estimates for the frictional drag coefficients as presented in gudmundsson 2014 essentially based on schlichting et al 2016 or in phillips et al 2017 can yield better results the decision to validate against cfd data was necessary due to the lack of reliable high quality experimental data data on the effects of biofouling or in a broader sense the effects of surface roughness on lift and drag properties at varying angles of attack are scarce and require further attention consideration of such effects has been proven to be important offering potential for future research furthermore due to the operational portfolio of underwater gliders the transition between laminar and turbulent flow can play an important role as mentioned in section 3 1 the transition zone is difficult to capture using simple models and more work is required on this topic the interested reader is referred to literature e g lidtke et al 2019 the study shows that for certain applications the less expensive lower fidelity models can be very useful e g for performance evaluation at the early design stage for the design of controllers and manoeuvring simulations higher fidelity models are required which are also capable of considering nonlinearities introduced by e g waves and currents such models can be found e g in thomasson and woolsey 2013 for controller design for underwater gliders subject to environmental disturbances the reader is referred to ullah et al 2019 the effects of a moving atmosphere on soaring of birds have also been studied both analytically and empirically by taylor et al 2016 who are suggesting that birds increase their airspeed in unfavourable headwinds and decrease their airspeed in favourable winds in order to minimize cost of transport further research on the applicability of such results to underwater robots is expected to yield interesting results improving the performance of underwater vehicles is a popular topic among maritime and robotic researchers there are many different approaches to solve this problem including bio inspired and biomimetic robots recent research on body and or caudal fin bcf and median and paired fins mpf swimmers lead to the conclusion that bio inspired auv design can further improve the overall performance of auvs scaradozzi et al 2017 for future research it will be interesting to extend the evaluation of auv propulsion systems to include new means of locomotion such as bcf and mpf one difficulty that also arises with other propulsion systems are uncertainties in the powertrain efficiencies as mentioned in section 2 2 the powertrain efficiency for propellers are well known potentially due to maturity of technology whereas the efficiency of buoyancy systems can vary significantly this may be understood as a call for further research on buoyancy systems and their implementation in underwater vehicles 7 conclusions this paper contributes to answering the often disputed transit performance of underwater gliders in comparison to common propeller driven auvs by extending previous studies e g steinberg et al 2010 and dhanak and xiros 2016 in terms of operating conditions and speed a simple but practical glide metric based on hydrodynamic coefficients is introduced and consequently used to compare the transit performance of the existing state of the art legacy underwater gliders to propeller driven versions thereof mathematical evaluation of the left hand side of the glide metric 13 shows that in the best possible case assume c l c d c d 0 the glider can be twice as efficient as the propeller driven vehicle in reality however the reference drag coefficient of the unwinged vehicle at zero angle of attack can be significantly lower than the glider s drag coefficient yielding higher glide metrics for the legacy gliders slocum and spray this glide metric is about 0 75 indicating a 25 higher efficiency for gliding locomotion for the seaglider hull this glide metric fluctuates around the same value for velocities up to 0 8ms 1 but experiences significantly adverse r e effects for velocities 0 8ms 1 while these results are true for ideal operating conditions it is also found that the presence of biofouling inflicts a double penalty on underwater gliders by increasing drag and decreasing lift when biofouling is taken into account propeller driven vehicles generally show superior transit performance as a result the choice of propulsion method becomes not only a question of design but also operating conditions the most significant demerits are the associated modelling uncertainties in particular in the estimation of frictional drag modelling of transitional flows and consideration of powertrain efficiencies furthermore a tool for the prediction of vehicle performance is provided in form of an intermediate fidelity flight mechanics model the model is validated against the published slocum data humphreys 2003c and it is shown that the vehicle performance is predicted qualitatively correct within acceptable error bounds strictly 30 as an example the model is demonstrated finding an optimum wing span that provides best transit performance unsurprisingly this optimal wing span is found to be the already existing one the strengths of the intermediate fidelity model lie in its simplicity and modularity allowing not only for quick computation time but also implementation of external data sets from cfd studies or wind tunnel tests in the form of look up tables also if more specific design parameters are known more design specific approximations for estimations of hull forces can be used e g jorgensen 1973b a and hopkins 1951 for a detailed analysis of more complex flow phenomena such as interference between wings and hull as well as the flow around appendages like antennas and acoustic links a thorough cfd based approach however still is deemed unavoidable credit authorship contribution statement clemens deutsch conceptualization data

21747,in this paper the influence of container dimension constraints on the cavity expansion characteristics were preliminary investigated through series of high speed water entry experiments with

expansion within the water filled containers experimental results show that the cavity in a larger container will reach a larger radius and collapses later than the cavity in a much smaller container the container size has little effect on the time of surface closure and the location of deep closure but more on the time of deep closure moreover it is found that as the container size decreases to a

during an hram event generally during the water entry of a projectile the drag highly contributes to the creation of the cavity this cavity may continue to grow if the momentum associated to the water is high enough to separate the fluid from the projectile and to continue its expansion until it reaches a maximum and then eventually collapses based on the physical mechanism responsible for cavity creation more recent work by truscott et al 2014 summarized two types of cavity formation including the low speed air entrainment and supercavitation of high speed projectiles for low bond numbers

cavity formation however the majority of these investigations into water entry by spheres or other objects focused on the low speeds where inertial forces and surface tension are important factors that can t be ignored for the high speed water entry determination of the unsteady cavity evolution becomes more complex as unsteady flows are involved by high speed cameras may and albert 1952 was the first to observe the cavity motion surface closure and deep closure phenomena induced by subsonic speed spheres entry into water lee et al 1997 presented a method for modeling the cavity formation and collapse induced by high speed vertical impact of a rigid projectile into water based on the work of birkhoff and isaacs 1951 birkhoff and zarantonello 1957 shi and kume 2001 shi and takami 2001 studied the hydrodynamic behaviors of projectiles water entry with the velocity of 342 and 352 m s and observed the cavity expansion using an optical technique guo et al 2012 investigated the projectile nose shape effect on cavity characteristics and developed a cavity model based on an extension of the method in duclaux et al 2007 used to solve the besant rayleigh problem in addition to these notable studies other works on high speed water entry problems involves the influence on cavity dynamics such as oblique angle and compressibility in chen et al 2018a b recently deletombe et al 2013 performed experiments of the impact in infinite and confined water containers of tumbling projectiles at 850 m s they demonstrated the effect of the tumbling of projectiles and the container size on the cavity shape and dynamics and observed higher pressures of shorter duration during the drag stage than during the cavity growth nevertheless they concluded that none of these stages could be neglected for the sizing of structures because they could both carry significant amounts of energy based on their work thomas fourest et al 2014 2015a b took container confinement effects into account and modified the rayleigh plesset equation to simulate a bubble created by a hram event induced by tumbling projectile entry of a water filled confined geometry at ballistic speed the rayleigh plesset equation is applied to two cases of impact one in a small closed tank and one in a larger hydrodynamic pool as deletombe et al 2013 described the cavity behaviors due to high speed water entry by a regular projectile is quite different from that by a tumbling projectile since the tumbling projectile possibly transmits its kinetic energy to the liquid medium more quickly instead a regular projectile that does not tumble transfers its kinetic energy more slowly and creates a more elongated cavity shape in its wake bless 1979 observed that the pressure resulting from the tumbling of the projectile could be five times more intense than the one observed in a case without tumbling however the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the cavity expansion due to regular projectiles and on the other hand cavity characteristics under container constraints condition due to regular projectiles are also both of great interests may 1951 studied the wall effects in vertical water entry of spheres and concluded that wall effects can t be negligible until the tank width is at least five times the maximum diameter of the cavity nevertheless the available literature on these problems is still limited on account of this this paper concerns an experimental effort to study the container confinement effects on cavity characteristics induced by regular cylindrical projectiles impacting water filled cylindrical containers with different radius with an objective to provide original dynamic data for studying the nature of hydrodynamic ram caused by the cavity expansion along the ballistic trajectory and also for numerical modelling and validation in future work a digital high speed photography provides the basis for the present study 2 experimental setup the experimental configuration and container installation are shown in fig 1 where the projectile accelerator is a non power driven light gas gun which was fixed on a metal framework and vertically aimed at a water filled cylindrical shaped container the container consists of a transparent pc exterior wall and a steel base they are bonded with high strength adhesive to ensure that no separation occurs during the impact process then reoccupy glass glue evenly daub their seam inside and outside to waterproof during the test three container radius i e 0 035 m 0 115 m and 0 245 m was employed to investigate the container constraint effects besides the depth of water in all containers is maintained at 800 mm and the free surface of the water is 200 mm away from the top of the gas gun tube the experimental projectile is constructed of 45 steel with full annealing to provide enough strength to avoid plastic deformation during the water entry process and has a flat nose section as depicted in fig 1 c all the projectiles are 6 mm in diameter lengths in 30 mm and 6 40 g in average mass in the experiments the projectile were launched to velocities in the range of 80 470 m s the initial impact velocity was measured by laser based optical devices as well as by the high speed camera system before tests velocities measured by the laser based optical devices and high speed camera were compared and showed a very small deviation 3 to record the projectile motion and the cavity expansion a photron fastcam sa5 digital high speed camera was placed horizontally at in front of the container perpendicular to the trajectory of the projectile incidence the selected frame rate and resolution were 21 000 per second and 1024 416 pixels respectively these settings were selected based on early testing and represent an optimal trade off between available lighting and the minimization of blur in the images to increase the contrast between cavity boundary and surrounding fluid and capture accurate the cavity profile more easily white paper with 10 10 mm2 grid is positioned at the background screen which was provided by several 1300 w tungsten lamps the cavity size is measured from each frame of sequent images by extracting the pixel positions additionally in some water entry cases three dynamic pressure transducers designed for repeated transient events are adopted to record the pressure history of projectile water entry the transducers are positioned on one side of the container wall 100 mm 300 mm and 500 mm below the free surface of water respectively however this paper does not involve the pressure analysis which will be carried out in the following work 3 results and discussions 3 1 photograph sequences of projectile water entry fig 2 and fig 3 shows the water entry processes of the projectile penetrating the 0 035 m and 0 115 m radius container at a nearly equivalent velocity of about 127 m s respectively and the processes of the projectile penetrating the 0 115 m and 0 245 m radius container at a relatively higher velocity of 320 m s were compared in fig 4 5 fig 2 indicates that as the projectile impacts the water surface a splash and then an upward jet are formed above the water surface the splash arches upward and gradually expands into the shape of a hat during this process the shrinkage starts from both ends of the elongated cavity after surface collapse occurs until a pinching off is produced in both sides of the cavity the results show that the cavity expansion is strongly inhibited by the smallest container that almost every cross section of the slender cavity before the shrinkage starts seems not to be fully expanded and the whole cavity looks like a long and uniform bar increase the container size to triple radius i e 0 115 m the deep closure does not appear but only surface closure occurs at about 3 24 ms for the current projectile velocity as shown in fig 3 in addition the splash generated in this container is not as obvious as in the smallest container keep the container size in fig 3 unchanged and continue to increase the projectile velocity to about 320 m s as displayed in fig 4 the whole cavity dimension increases obviously besides there are two shrinking regions appearing in the elongated cavity 3 76 ms and one of which produces a deep closure 4 48 ms maintain the same velocity in fig 4 and increase the container radius in fig 4 by approximately 2 times i e 0 245 m as shown in fig 5 the deep closure was not observed but only one shrinking region formed 5 64 ms over the process to sum up for a given projectile velocity the smaller the container size the more easily the deep closure occurs refer to fig 2 3 fig 4 5 while in a relatively larger container this given projectile velocity should be increased to observe the deep closure phenomenon and for a given size container the deep closure more easily occurs in higher projectile velocity water entry cases while only the phenomenon of surface closure dominates the relatively low velocity cases refer to fig 3 4 3 2 cavity evolution the comparisons of the time cavity evolution before deep closure for the projectile impacts into three radius containers at a nearly same velocity of 217 m s are illustrated in fig 6 7 the results show that the overall cavity size in the 0 035 m container is much smaller than that in other two larger containers thus once the container is decreased to the magnitude of the maximum cavity diameter it will have a strong confinement effect on the cavity expansion moreover the overall cavity size in other two larger containers don t show much difference in early stages before 1 ms however as the time increases the cavity size in the middle container gradually gets smaller than that in the largest container to better investigate the container confinements on the cavity evolution in a cavity cross section we chose two projectile impact velocity ranges to be the objects of study within each velocity range the cavity cross section at the same penetration depth in three radius containers is selected respectively one cavity section is at the location of about 167 mm away from the free surface and at the time of about 1 08 ms after the projectile impact at the velocity in the range of 158 160 m s the other cavity section is selected at the location of about 210 mm away from the free surface and at the time of about 1 1 ms after the projectile impacting these containers at the velocity range of 216 218 m s the time evolution of cavity radius for each cross section in three radius containers was measured by the optical technique and compared in fig 8 and fig 9 where the cavity expansion of the same location was found to be obviously inhibited by the container size since the cavity in a larger container reaches a larger radius and collapses later than the cavity in a much smaller container fig 10 illustrates the effect of container inhibition on the maximum cavity radius where a fairly good linearity for the maximum cavity radius with the container radius was observed 3 3 surface closure and deep closure as a projectile penetrates the free surface the cavity begins to expand until the pressure difference between the surrounding fluid and the cavity balances the induced inertial effects then the fluid will be driven back to its undisturbed state which will lead to an ensuing cavity collapse at or below the free surface surface closure is an event of great importance as it terminates the air into the cavity however it is rather difficult to determine the time of surface closure by measuring the instant at which air stops entering the cavity in this paper the time of surface closure t s is specified as the time when the cavity near the free surface was just pulled away from the surface fig 11 summarizes the time of surface closure t s versus the velocity for impacting different size containers where it is shown that the time of surface closure increases approximately linearly with the initial impact velocity for the projectile impacting all containers under impact of the projectile at nearly same velocities the container radius effect on the time of surface closure is roughly described in fig 12 which indicates that the container radius shows weak influence on the time of surface closure in related studies lee et al 1997 predicted a variation trend of the surface closure time with the impact velocity and found that the surface closure decreased with the increase of the velocity in the low speed region 40 m s which was in good agreement with the low speed experimental results of gilbarg and anderson 1948 30 m s and in the transition region up to a high speed region 40 m s the surface closure time increases with the impact velocity which is consistent with the present results 80 470 m s this paper employed two dimensionless factors and tried to find a rule for the time of surface closure in high speed water entry cases one factor is the dimensionless time of surface closure defined as t sc v 0 t s d in which d denote the projectile diameter the other is the cavitation number σ 2 p a p c ρ l v 0 2 where p a is the atmospheric pressure p c is the cavity pressure and ρ l is the density of water birkhoff and isaacs 1951 and may 1975 used the dimensionless time of surface closure to characterize the low speed water entry and deduced from their experimental results that the dimensionless factor should be approximately constant which is obviously different from the results of this paper setting the pressure in the cavity p c to zero may lead to some error in the cavitation number for the velocity less than 165 m s lee et al 1997 however the variation trend of dimensionless time of surface closure with the cavitation number as shown in fig 13 becomes very meaningful since the data shows a good convergence and exponential decay fig 11 also contains the time of deep closure for projectile penetrating three radius containers at different velocities it is shown that the time of deep closure decreases with the impact velocity in all containers however it is inconsistent with the invariance in the deep closure time which was obtained by lee et al 1997 in high speed water entry study which is probably because the effect of container confinements on cavity development becomes stronger and promotes early deep closure as the impact velocity increases besides from fig 11 it is found that the phenomenon of deep closure more easily occurs when the projectile impacting the smaller containers with a relatively lower velocity which may only lead to a surface closure in a larger container therefore the projectile initial velocity should be increased to observe the deep closure phenomenon when impacting larger containers and that for a given projectile velocity that can produce the deep closure in both middle and large size containers more time is needed to produce the deep closure in larger containers the surface closure typically occurs prior to the deep closure for all water entry cases in the velocity ranges that the paper presented except for the case of the projectile impacting the 0 115 m radius container at 338 8 m s and the 0 245 m radius container at 460 475 m s as shown in fig 11 the reason of which is believed to be due to the combination effects of the large velocities in the cavity wall motion induced by a relatively high energy deposition into the fluid and a choked flow condition that will inhibit early surface closure and instead promote early deep closure lee et al 1997 fig 14 plots the deep closure location against the velocity for projectile impacting all size containers where the deep closure location is the depth from the water surface to the position of deep closure creation in the direction of the projectile s vertical incidence within the range of velocity overlap although the container with a radius of 0 115 m has a slightly deeper closure than the container with a radius of 0 245 m the location at which the deep closure occurs shows a good linearity to the initial velocity for all size containers in generally which indicates that the location of deep closure seems to depends more on the impact velocity than the container size 3 4 average expansion velocity of a cavity cross section in the presented study the average expansion velocity of a cavity cross section is defined as the average velocity when the cavity radius reaches maximum from zero guo et al 2012 has studied the average cavity velocities for a flat and hemispherical projectile horizontal water entry at high speeds and found that the average cavity wall velocity of each location were almost equal and showed a weak dependence on the instantaneous velocity that the projectile reached the location however few measurements are compared for the average cavity wall velocity as a projectile vertically enters different size containers though substantial research on cavity characteristics induced by vertical water entry has been performed the average expansion velocity of each cavity cross section at the same location for the projectile impacting three radius containers at similar velocity can be calculated out from fig 8 9 the container confinement effect on the average velocity of each cross section is illustrated in fig 15 where it is shown that the average cavity velocity of the cross section increases with the container radius but the velocity increment gets smaller as the container radius increases fig 16 illustrates the cavity evolution of different cavity cross sections along the elongated cavity in cases of the projectile impacting three size containers with the velocity of 160 m s and the corresponding average expansion velocity of each cavity cross section with the time that the projectile reaches the cavity section is depicted in fig 17 where it is shown that the variation trends of the average cavity expansion velocity along the elongated cavity in medium and large container are different from that in the small container since the average velocity of each cavity section in the medium and large container shows a good linearity but weak dependence on the time that the projectile reaches the cavity section while the average cavity section velocity in the small container increases first and then decreases with time that is not an exclusive case for that phenomenon fig 18 summarized the average expansion velocities of different cavity cross sections along the elongated cavity for the projectile penetrating the three size containers with the velocity in the range of 84 7 88 9 m s where a similar characteristic with that appeared in fig 17 can be found it is believed that the reason for the phenomenon is because the region with a bulge in the cavity average velocity locates around the location that the deep closure occurs which can be proofed in fig 19 and 20 where the time and location of the deep closure for the small container impacted by the projectile at the velocity of 158 4 m s and 85 2 m s are illustrated it is shown in fig 19 and 20 that the time that the deep closure occurs is 2 14 ms and 2 32 ms respectively which is just in the time range of the bulge appears in the cavity average velocity typically the deep closure is a very complex phenomenon which will lead to a pinching process whose subsequent collapse can be a significant source of pressure waves in an hram event under container constraint effect the cavity in the deep closure cross section expands and pinches off very quickly as the deep closure occurs thereby leading to a high average velocity and an intensive pressure wave disimile et al 2009 3 5 velocity attenuation characteristics and drag coefficient considering a projectile with an initial velocity v 0 penetrating into water along a straight trajectory the projectile motion can be described from newton s second law 1 m p d v p d t 1 2 ρ w a 0 c d v p 2 where m p and v p denotes the projectile mass and velocity respectively a 0 is defined as the projected frontal area of projectiles c d represents the drag coefficient which is associated with projectile nose shapes assuming c d is a constant over the water entry process the velocity attenuation as a function of time t can be determined from the integration of eq 1 2 v p v 0 1 1 β v 0 t where β is the velocity decay coefficient defined as β π ρ w r 0 2 c d 2 m p the comparisons of velocity attenuation with time for projectiles penetrating the 0 035 m radius and 0 115 m radius containers with several similar velocities are shown in fig 21 where the curves were fitted through the data points to the theoretical eq 2 from fig 21 it is shown that the projectile velocity decays faster in the small container with the radius of 0 035 m thus a greater drag coefficient will be obtained in the small container than that in the medium sized container fig 22 summarized the drag coefficients obtained by fitting the data points to the eq 2 for the projectile penetrating the three size containers at different velocities it can be found that the drag coefficients for the projectile in the smallest container are obviously greater than those in other two larger containers while the drag coefficients in the two larger containers are at the same level that does not show much difference furthermore from eq 1 the change rate of the projectile kinetic energy e t with respect to penetration distance x p can be expressed as 3 d e t d x p m p v p d v p d x p m β v p 2 1 2 ρ w c d a 0 v p 2 from the formula above it can be concluded that the higher the velocity decay coefficient the more the projectile energy is transferred to the fluid section which would produce severe hydro dynamic pressure waves hence for the projectile penetrating into the three size water filled containers the smallest container with radius of 0 035 m will suffer more severe hydrodynamic pressures in experiments the container wall rupture phenomenon was indeed observed during the projectile penetrating the smallest container with the initial velocity of 215 9 m s as shown in fig 23 where the rupture began with the bottom of the container and developed upward progressively in the direction opposite to projectile movement 4 concluding remarks in this paper the container size inhibition effects on the cavity expansion characteristics induced by high speed projectiles water entry were preliminarily studied by series water entry experiments particular attention is given to the characteristics of cavity evolution maximum cavity radius surface and deep closure average cavity wall velocity and the drag coefficient the objective of the presented work is mainly to provide original dynamic data for studying the nature of hydrodynamic ram caused by the cavity expansion along the ballistic trajectory and also for numerical modelling and validation in subsequent work within the limitations of presented study the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 the container size has an obvious and significant inhibition effect on the time of cavity evolution that the cavity in a larger container will reach a larger radius and collapses later than the cavity in a much smaller container the maximum cavity radius increases linearly with the container radius 2 surface closure typically occurs prior to the deep closure for all water entry cases in the velocity ranges that the paper presented the container size seems to have little effect on the time of surface closure and the location of deep closure but more on the time of deep closure results show that the time of deep closure decreases with the impact velocity in all containers and the deep closure more easily occurs in a smaller container under impact by the projectile at relatively low velocities while it may only produce a surface closure in a larger container 3 the average cavity velocity increases with the container radius but the velocity increment gets smaller as the container radius increases with the inhibition of container size the average cavity velocity trend has a raised area near the deep closure location while in larger containers without generation of deep closure the average cavity velocity presented a linear decrease trend with the time of the projectile reaching the cavity section 4 the velocity attenuation characteristics were strongly affected as the container size decreases to a magnitude comparable to the diameter of the cavity where the drag coefficients are obviously greater than those in the cases of other larger container penetration credit authorship contribution statement zitao guo supervision writing review editing conceptualization methodology tuo

studied the hydrodynamic behaviors of projectiles water entry with the velocity of 342 and 352 m s and observed the cavity expansion using an optical technique guo et al 2012 investigated the projectile nose shape effect on cavity characteristics and developed a cavity model based on an extension of the method in duclaux et al 2007 used to solve the besant rayleigh problem in addition to these notable studies other works on high speed water entry problems involves the influence on cavity dynamics such as oblique angle and compressibility in chen et al 2018a b recently deletombe et al 2013 performed experiments of the impact in infinite and confined water containers of tumbling projectiles at 850 m s they demonstrated the effect of the tumbling of projectiles and the container size on the cavity shape and dynamics and observed higher pressures of shorter duration during the drag stage than during the cavity growth nevertheless they concluded that none of these stages could be neglected for the sizing of structures because they could both carry significant amounts of energy based on their work thomas fourest et al 2014 2015a b took container confinement effects into account and modified the rayleigh plesset equation to simulate a bubble created by a hram event induced by tumbling projectile entry of a water filled confined geometry at ballistic speed the rayleigh plesset equation is applied to two cases of impact one in a small closed tank and one in a larger hydrodynamic pool as deletombe et al 2013 described the cavity behaviors due to high speed water entry by a regular projectile is quite different from that by a tumbling projectile since the tumbling projectile possibly transmits its kinetic energy to the liquid medium more quickly instead a regular projectile that does not tumble transfers its kinetic energy more slowly and creates a more elongated cavity shape in its wake bless 1979 observed that the pressure resulting from the tumbling of the projectile could be five times more intense than the one observed in a case without tumbling however the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the cavity expansion due to regular projectiles and on the other hand cavity characteristics under container constraints condition due to regular projectiles are also both of great interests may 1951 studied the wall effects in vertical water entry of spheres and concluded that wall effects can t be negligible until the tank width is at least five times the maximum diameter of the cavity nevertheless the available literature on these problems is still limited on account of this this paper concerns an experimental effort to study the container confinement effects on cavity characteristics induced by regular cylindrical projectiles impacting water filled cylindrical containers with different radius with an objective to provide original dynamic data for studying the nature of hydrodynamic ram caused by the cavity expansion along the ballistic trajectory and also for numerical modelling and validation in future work a digital high speed photography provides the basis for the present study 2 experimental setup the experimental configuration and container installation are shown in fig 1 where the projectile accelerator is a non power driven light gas gun which was fixed on a metal framework and vertically aimed at a water filled cylindrical shaped container the container consists of a transparent pc exterior wall and a steel base they are bonded with high strength adhesive to ensure that no separation occurs during the impact process then reoccupy glass glue evenly daub their seam inside and outside to waterproof during the test three container radius i e 0 035 m 0 115 m and 0 245 m was employed to investigate the container constraint effects besides the depth of water in all containers is maintained at 800 mm and the free surface of the water is 200 mm away from the top of the gas gun tube the experimental projectile is constructed of 45 steel with full annealing to provide enough strength to avoid plastic deformation during the water entry process and has a flat nose section as depicted in fig 1 c all the projectiles are 6 mm in diameter lengths in 30 mm and 6 40 g in average mass in the experiments the projectile were launched to velocities in the range of 80 470 m s the initial impact velocity was measured by laser based optical devices as well as by the high speed camera system before tests velocities measured by the laser based optical devices and high speed camera were compared and showed a very small deviation 3 to record the projectile motion and the cavity expansion a photron fastcam sa5 digital high speed camera was placed horizontally at in front of the container perpendicular to the trajectory of the projectile incidence the selected frame rate and resolution were 21 000 per second and 1024 416 pixels respectively these settings were selected based on early testing and represent an optimal trade off between available lighting and the minimization of blur in the images to increase the contrast between cavity boundary and surrounding fluid and capture accurate the cavity profile more easily white paper with 10 10 mm2 grid is positioned at the background screen which was provided by several 1300 w tungsten lamps the cavity size is measured from each frame of sequent images by extracting the pixel positions additionally in some water entry cases three dynamic pressure transducers designed for repeated transient events are adopted to record the pressure history of projectile water entry the transducers are positioned on one side of the container wall 100 mm 300 mm and 500 mm below the free surface of water respectively however this paper does not involve the pressure analysis which will be carried out in the following work 3 results and discussions 3 1 photograph sequences of projectile water entry fig 2 and fig 3 shows the water entry processes of the projectile penetrating the 0 035 m and 0 115 m radius container at a nearly equivalent velocity of about 127 m s respectively and the processes of the projectile penetrating the 0 115 m and 0 245 m radius container at a relatively higher velocity of 320 m s were compared in fig 4 5 fig 2 indicates that as the projectile impacts the water surface a splash and then an upward jet are formed above the water surface the splash arches upward and gradually expands into the shape of a hat during this process the shrinkage starts from both ends of the elongated cavity after surface collapse occurs until a pinching off is produced in both sides of the cavity the results show that the cavity expansion is strongly inhibited by the smallest container that almost every cross section of the slender cavity before the shrinkage starts seems not to be fully expanded and the whole cavity looks like a long and uniform bar increase the container size to triple radius i e 0 115 m the deep closure does not appear but only surface closure occurs at about 3 24 ms for the current projectile velocity as shown in fig 3 in addition the splash generated in this container is not as obvious as in the smallest container keep the container size in fig 3 unchanged and continue to increase the projectile velocity to about 320 m s as displayed in fig 4 the whole cavity dimension increases obviously besides there are two shrinking regions appearing in the elongated cavity 3 76 ms and one of which produces a deep closure 4 48 ms maintain the same velocity in fig 4 and increase the container radius in fig 4 by approximately 2 times i e 0 245 m as shown in fig 5 the deep closure was not observed but only one shrinking region formed 5 64 ms over the process to sum up for a given projectile velocity the smaller the container size the more easily the deep closure occurs refer to fig 2 3 fig 4 5 while in a relatively larger container this given projectile velocity should be increased to observe the deep closure phenomenon and for a given size container the deep closure more easily occurs in higher projectile velocity water entry cases while only the phenomenon of surface closure dominates the relatively low velocity cases refer to fig 3 4 3 2 cavity evolution the comparisons of the time cavity evolution before deep closure for the projectile impacts into three radius containers at a nearly same velocity of 217 m s are illustrated in fig 6 7 the results show that the overall cavity size in the 0 035 m container is much smaller than that in other two larger containers thus once the container is decreased to the magnitude of the maximum cavity diameter it will have a strong confinement effect on the cavity expansion moreover the overall cavity size in other two larger containers don t show much difference in early stages before 1 ms however as the time increases the cavity size in the middle container gradually gets smaller than that in the largest container to better investigate the container confinements on the cavity evolution in a cavity cross section we chose two projectile impact velocity ranges to be the objects of study within each velocity range the cavity cross section at the same penetration depth in three radius containers is selected respectively one cavity section is at the location of about 167 mm away from the free surface and at the time of about 1 08 ms after the projectile impact at the velocity in the range of 158 160 m s the other cavity section is selected at the location of about 210 mm away from the free surface and at the time of about 1 1 ms after the projectile impacting these containers at the velocity range of 216 218 m s the time evolution of cavity radius for each cross section in three radius containers was measured by the optical technique and compared in fig 8 and fig 9 where the cavity expansion of the same location was found to be obviously inhibited by the container size since the cavity in a larger container reaches a larger radius and collapses later than the cavity in a much smaller container fig 10 illustrates the effect of container inhibition on the maximum cavity radius where a fairly good linearity for the maximum cavity radius with the container radius was observed 3 3 surface closure and deep closure as a projectile penetrates the free surface the cavity begins to expand until the pressure difference between the surrounding fluid and the cavity balances the induced inertial effects then the fluid will be driven back to its undisturbed state which will lead to an ensuing cavity collapse at or below the free surface surface closure is an event of great importance as it terminates the air into the cavity however it is rather difficult to determine the time of surface closure by measuring the instant at which air stops entering the cavity in this paper the time of surface closure t s is specified as the time when the cavity near the free surface was just pulled away from the surface fig 11 summarizes the time of surface closure t s versus the velocity for impacting different size containers where it is shown that the time of surface closure increases approximately linearly with the initial impact velocity for the projectile impacting all containers under impact of the projectile at nearly same velocities the container radius effect on the time of surface closure is roughly described in fig 12 which indicates that the container radius shows weak influence on the time of surface closure in related studies lee et al 1997 predicted a variation trend of the surface closure time with the impact velocity and found that the surface closure decreased with the increase of the velocity in the low speed region 40 m s which was in good agreement with the low speed experimental results of gilbarg and anderson 1948 30 m s and in the transition region up to a high speed region 40 m s the surface closure time increases with the impact velocity which is consistent with the present results 80 470 m s this paper employed two dimensionless factors and tried to find a rule for the time of surface closure in high speed water entry cases one factor is the dimensionless time of surface closure defined as t sc v 0 t s d in which d denote the projectile diameter the other is the cavitation number σ 2 p a p c ρ l v 0 2 where p a is the atmospheric pressure p c is the cavity pressure and ρ l is the density of water birkhoff and isaacs 1951 and may 1975 used the dimensionless time of surface closure to characterize the low speed water entry and deduced from their experimental results that the dimensionless factor should be approximately constant which is obviously different from the results of this paper setting the pressure in the cavity p c to zero may lead to some error in the cavitation number for the velocity less than 165 m s lee et al 1997 however the variation trend of dimensionless time of surface closure with the cavitation number as shown in fig 13 becomes very meaningful since the data shows a good convergence and exponential decay fig 11 also contains the time of deep closure for projectile penetrating three radius containers at different velocities it is shown that the time of deep closure decreases with the impact velocity in all containers however it is inconsistent with the invariance in the deep closure time which was obtained by lee et al 1997 in high speed water entry study which is probably because the effect of container confinements on cavity development becomes stronger and promotes early deep closure as the impact velocity increases besides from fig 11 it is found that the phenomenon of deep closure more easily occurs when the projectile impacting the smaller containers with a relatively lower velocity which may only lead to a surface closure in a larger container therefore the projectile initial velocity should be increased to observe the deep closure phenomenon when impacting larger containers and that for a given projectile velocity that can produce the deep closure in both middle and large size containers more time is needed to produce the deep closure in larger containers the surface closure typically occurs prior to the deep closure for all water entry cases in the velocity ranges that the paper presented except for the case of the projectile impacting the 0 115 m radius container at 338 8 m s and the 0 245 m radius container at 460 475 m s as shown in fig 11 the reason of which is believed to be due to the combination effects of the large velocities in the cavity wall motion induced by a relatively high energy deposition into the fluid and a choked flow condition that will inhibit early surface closure and instead promote early deep closure lee et al 1997 fig 14 plots the deep closure location against the velocity for projectile impacting all size containers where the deep closure location is the depth from the water surface to the position of deep closure creation in the direction of the projectile s vertical incidence within the range of velocity overlap although the container with a radius of 0 115 m has a slightly deeper closure than the container with a radius of 0 245 m the location at which the deep closure occurs shows a good linearity to the initial velocity for all size containers in generally which indicates that the location of deep closure seems to depends more on the impact velocity than the container size 3 4 average expansion velocity of a cavity cross section in the presented study the average expansion velocity of a cavity cross section is defined as the average velocity when the cavity radius reaches maximum from zero guo et al 2012 has studied the average cavity velocities for a flat and hemispherical projectile horizontal water entry at high speeds and found that the average cavity wall velocity of each location were almost equal and showed a weak dependence on the instantaneous velocity that the projectile reached the location however few measurements are compared for the average cavity wall velocity as a projectile vertically enters different size containers though substantial research on cavity characteristics induced by vertical water entry has been performed the average expansion velocity of each cavity cross section at the same location for the projectile impacting three radius containers at similar velocity can be calculated out from fig 8 9 the container confinement effect on the average velocity of each cross section is illustrated in fig 15 where it is shown that the average cavity velocity of the cross section increases with the container radius but the velocity increment gets smaller as the container radius increases fig 16 illustrates the cavity evolution of different cavity cross sections along the elongated cavity in cases of the projectile impacting three size containers with the velocity of 160 m s and the corresponding average expansion velocity of each cavity cross section with the time that the projectile reaches the cavity section is depicted in fig 17 where it is shown that the variation trends of the average cavity expansion velocity along the elongated cavity in medium and large container are different from that in the small container since the average velocity of each cavity section in the medium and large container shows a good linearity but weak dependence on the time that the projectile reaches the cavity section while the average cavity section velocity in the small container increases first and then decreases with time that is not an exclusive case for that phenomenon fig 18 summarized the average expansion velocities of different cavity cross sections along the elongated cavity for the projectile penetrating the three size containers with the velocity in the range of 84 7 88 9 m s where a similar characteristic with that appeared in fig 17 can be found it is believed that the reason for the phenomenon is because the region with a bulge in the cavity average velocity locates around the location that the deep closure occurs which can be proofed in fig 19 and 20 where the time and location of the deep closure for the small container impacted by the projectile at the velocity of 158 4 m s and 85 2 m s are illustrated it is shown in fig 19 and 20 that the time that the deep closure occurs is 2 14 ms and 2 32 ms respectively which is just in the time range of the bulge appears in the cavity average velocity typically the deep closure is a very complex phenomenon which will lead to a pinching process whose subsequent collapse can be a significant source of pressure waves in an hram event under container constraint effect the cavity in the deep closure cross section expands and pinches off very quickly as the deep closure occurs thereby leading to a high average velocity and an intensive pressure wave disimile et al 2009 3 5 velocity attenuation characteristics and drag coefficient considering a projectile with an initial velocity v 0 penetrating into water along a straight trajectory the projectile motion can be described from newton s second law 1 m p d v p d t 1 2 ρ w a 0 c d v p 2 where m p and v p denotes the projectile mass and velocity respectively a 0 is defined as the projected frontal area of projectiles c d represents the drag coefficient which is associated with projectile nose shapes assuming c d is a constant over the water entry process the velocity attenuation as a function of time t can be determined from the integration of eq 1 2 v p v 0 1 1 β v 0 t where β is the velocity decay coefficient defined as β π ρ w r 0 2 c d 2 m p the comparisons of velocity attenuation with time for projectiles penetrating the 0 035 m radius and 0 115 m radius containers with several similar velocities are shown in fig 21 where the curves were fitted through the data points to the theoretical eq 2 from fig 21 it is shown that the projectile velocity decays faster in the small container with the radius of 0 035 m thus a greater drag coefficient will be obtained in the small container than that in the medium sized container fig 22 summarized the drag coefficients obtained by fitting the data points to the eq 2 for the projectile penetrating the three size containers at different velocities it can be found that the drag coefficients for the projectile in the smallest container are obviously greater than those in other two larger containers while the drag coefficients in the two larger containers are at the same level that does not show much difference furthermore from eq 1 the change rate of the projectile kinetic energy e t with respect to penetration distance x p can be expressed as 3 d e t d x p m p v p d v p d x p m β v p 2 1 2 ρ w c d a 0 v p 2 from the formula above it can be concluded that the higher the velocity decay coefficient the more the projectile energy is transferred to the fluid section which would produce severe hydro dynamic pressure waves hence for the projectile penetrating into the three size water filled containers the smallest container with radius of 0 035 m will suffer more severe hydrodynamic pressures in experiments the container wall rupture phenomenon was indeed observed during the projectile penetrating the smallest container with the initial velocity of 215 9 m s as shown in fig 23 where the rupture began with the bottom of the container and developed upward progressively in the direction opposite to projectile movement 4 concluding remarks in this paper the container size inhibition effects on the cavity expansion characteristics induced by high speed projectiles water entry were preliminarily studied by series water entry experiments particular attention is given to the characteristics of cavity evolution maximum cavity radius surface and deep closure average cavity wall velocity and the drag coefficient the objective of the presented work is mainly to provide original dynamic data for studying the nature of hydrodynamic ram caused by the cavity expansion along the ballistic trajectory and also for numerical modelling and validation in subsequent work within the limitations of presented study the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 the container size has an obvious and significant inhibition effect on the time of cavity evolution that the cavity in a larger container will reach a larger radius and collapses later than the cavity in a much smaller container the maximum cavity radius increases linearly with the container radius 2 surface closure typically occurs prior to the deep closure for all water entry cases in the velocity ranges that the paper presented the container size seems to have little effect on the time of surface closure and the location of deep closure but more on the time of deep closure results show that the time of deep closure decreases with the impact velocity in all containers and the deep closure more easily occurs in a smaller container under impact by the projectile at relatively low velocities while it may only produce a surface closure in a larger container 3 the average cavity velocity increases with the container radius but the velocity increment gets smaller as the container radius increases with the inhibition of container size the average cavity velocity trend has a raised area near the deep closure location while in larger containers without generation of deep closure the average cavity velocity presented a linear decrease trend with the time of the projectile reaching the cavity section 4 the velocity attenuation characteristics were strongly affected as the container size decreases to a magnitude comparable to the diameter of the cavity where the drag coefficients are obviously greater than those in the cases of other larger container penetration credit authorship contribution statement zitao guo supervision writing review editing conceptualization methodology tuo

21748,an optimization tool is developed to simulate the performance of a marine propulsion system of a fishing trawler for ship conceptual design it consists of two modules implemented in matlab the first optimization module simulates the performance of a high speed turbocharged four stroke marine diesel engine along the engine load diagram it couples 1d engine simulation tool and a nonlinear optimizer to minimize the bsfc of the marine engine and to verify the limitations of emissions defined by international organizations by optimizing turbocharger and injection parameters the second module assists in the selection of a suitable fixed pitch propeller from wageningen b series at the ship design speed at engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption and by verifying the propeller cavitation strength and noise issues instead of only maximizing the propeller efficiency or minimizing the bsfc as considered in previous researches then the objective of the propeller optimization module is changed to compute the propeller performance by 1 maximizing the propeller efficiency 2 minimizing the bsfc for the purpose of comparison with the current study the current case shows a significant reduction in the amount of fuel consumed by around 30 in comparison with the other two cases keywords marine propulsion system marine turbocharged diesel engine exhaust emissions marine propeller nonlinearly constrained optimization 1 introduction stringent environmental regulations are applied by the international and national organizations to reduce the exhaust emissions from ships different solutions and methods were considered to verify these limitations lloyd s register 2012 these methods considered the different parts of the ships such as the hull form propulsion system aerodynamic resistance fuel used and renewable energies the propulsion system in which this study is focused on is the main system of any ship it consists of a prime mover transmission shaft and propeller in order to propel the ship at the desired speed and to support manoeuvring stopping and backing the power generated from the prime mover passes through the transmission shaft and transmitted to the propeller which in turn transferred to the main thrust bearing of the ship during the different stages of ship design the propulsion system requires careful calculations and simulations to ensure its reliability to maximize its efficiency and to minimize the consumption of fuel bulut et al 2015 different software systems are available to simulate both the engine and the propeller performances these numerical models are suitable to predict the behaviour of the components of the marine system under different working conditions without doing experimental tests as presented in the following subsections 1 1 engine simulation model the numerical simulation of the performance of diesel engines started taking place at the beginning of the 20th century by goodenough and baker 1927 since the second world war the development of fast techniques was achieved to predict the performance of the different types of engines and the associated gas dynamics atherton 1996 costall 2007 depending on the complexity of the system as presented in fig 1 look up table models altosole and figari 2011 martelli and figari 2018 tadros et al 2018b zero dimensional models quasi steady models followed by filling and emptying models and gas dynamic models till the 2d and 3d models ammar and farag 2016 sun et al 2017 2018 are the main levels of engine modelling either it compression ignition ci or spark ignition si these different simulation models were developed to deal with the complexity of an engine where the methods of design dynamic control etc are the different mechanical systems disciplines considered xin 2011 different parameters must be defined according to the complexity of the utilized model to simulate the engine performance and to compute the amount of exhaust emissions the main components considered in the simulation model are presented in fig 2 as follows 1 injection system 2 turbocharger compressor turbine shaft and wastegate 3 intercooler 4 intake and exhaust manifolds 5 engine cylinders 6 atmospheric initial conditions due to the acceptable simulation time with more details in thermodynamic mechanical chemical fluid heat transfer and automatic control processes an overview of the different 0d and 1d engine models used in previous investigations is presented 1 1 1 zero dimensional models these models as presented in refs altosole et al 2017 benvenuto et al 2016 mizythras et al 2018 tadros et al 2015 are the simplest fastest and most suitable to predict the behaviour of a combustion process to calculate the output power and to specify the characteristics of exhaust emissions using laws of conservation of mass and energy heywood 1988 they do not consider the behaviour of the flow inside the engine components and the engine combustion models can be divided into i single zone models where the fluid inside the engine is considered as a thermodynamic system ii two zone models where two distinct thermodynamic systems are considered and presented by an unburned and a burned zone there is an interaction in energy and mass between the two zones assumed and the surroundings iii multi zone models in which the combustion chamber are divided into several zones and are based on chemical kinetics 1 1 2 quasi steady models in these models the overall performance of the engine is determined using the interaction between various sub models either it is particular or empirical functions almajri et al 2017 sowale et al 2018 however the quasi steady models assume that the intake and exhaust fluid pass through various volumes each of them is separate without any form of mass accumulation 1 1 3 filling and emptying models due to some limitations in quasi steady models in estimation the variation in pressures and volumes in the intake and exhaust ports as well as the cylinders which affect the calculations of camshaft timing backflow phenomena etc the filling and emptying models compute the pressures in the intake and exhaust systems along the engine cycle these models are described in details by watson and janota 1982 and give more information than the quasi steady models these models are depending on the time step analysis and the pressures are calculated at each degree of crank rotation they also allow the analysis of transient operations theotokatos and kyrtatos 2001 1 1 4 gas dynamic models gas dynamic or wave action models in which the previous models are considered are widely used in designing and optimizing various types of engines due to their ability to compute the variation in pressures in the intake and exhaust system using 1d unsteady compressible flow and compared well against experimental data payri et al 1986 pearson and winterbone 1997 this technique is used in different software systems such as 1 avl 2017 2 diesel rk 2015 3 gamma technologies 2017 4 gasdyn 2018 5 lotus engineering software lesoft 2017 and 6 ricardo wave software 2016 which was used in

nonlinearity of the systems and models presented above different optimization methods are considered to optimize the value of different variables that affect the system performance hillier and lieberman 1980 1 3 1 engine optimization module a marine diesel engine is considered a complicated and nonlinear system its performance depends on a large number of parameters that must be controlled therefore optimization methods are applied instead of the traditional methods wong et al 2013 different methods were used depending on the type of problem and their ability to solve it alonso et al 2007 combined artificial neural networks ann and genetic algorithm ga to minimize fuel consumption and exhaust emissions from the diesel engine cruz peragón and jiménez espadafor 2007 used ga to

number and material strength on propeller selection then chen and shih 2007 considered the vibration part to improve the propeller performance and gaafary et al 2011 optimize the selection of a marine propeller by considering the effect of cavitation material strength and the propeller thrust required tadros et al 2018a developed an optimization model coupling openprop epps and kimball 2013 and a nonlinear optimizer to select a propeller for a given ship by considering the geometry of the propeller blades and based on lifting line theory next tadros et al 2020a extended the research work to select the propeller at the engine operating point with minimum bsfc 1 4 main objective and brief description of the current study the previously mentioned research work presents different useful methods to simulate the performance of the prime mover and propulsor however the lack of data of the engine load diagram is the main problem facing the designers to select an effective propeller marques et al 2018 applied optimization procedure to match engine and propeller for a liquefied natural gas lng ship operated in rough weather conditions in order to minimize the consumption of fuel while using simple engine model based on polynomial equations marques et al 2017 without considering the exhaust emissions this engine model played a key role in the reduction of the simulation time during the optimization problem during the initial stages of ship design more details are required to simulate an efficient system and to reduce consumption and emissions in this study an optimization procedure is used to simulate the performance of a ship propulsion system an optimization tool is developed by the authors to be used during the initial stages of ship design this tool is composed of two optimization modules the first module simulates the engine performance for the whole operating conditions and the second one is used to select an efficient propeller for the design speed of a ship trawler at the minimum fuel consumption of the engine the first optimization module which is used by tadros et al 2019 to simulate a large marine diesel engine is adapted to compute the bsfc and the exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide co2 and nitrogen oxides nox of a high speed marine turbocharged diesel engine for all operating conditions in engine load diagram this module finds the optimal value of turbocharger speed the amount of fuel injected and the start angle of injection to minimize the fuel consumption and to verify the exhaust emissions according to the restrictions applied by the international maritime organization imo 2018 it couples ricardo wave software 2016 as a 1d and gas dynamic engine simulation software with a nonlinearly constrained optimizer implemented in matlab this numerical model avoids the need for experimental tests to estimate the engine performance and the exhaust emissions for every working point in the load diagram in order to save time and cost the nonlinear optimizer adopted fmincon the mathworks inc 2016 shows a good computing performance to reach the optimal solution unlike the other optimizers used in previous researches using the same optimizer and the data produced by the engine model the second optimization module is developed to automatically select a suitable fixed pitch propeller from wageningen b series for the design speed of a ship trawler at the minimum fuel consumption along the engine load diagram by verifying cavitation strength and noise issues this module presents a practical technique to design a propeller at the engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption in order to decrease the fuel consumed and therefore the exhaust emissions during the sailing of the ship instead of only maximizing the propeller efficiency or minimizing the bsfc as presented in previous researches a comparison study is performed between the propeller performance when the propeller efficiency is maximized the bsfc is minimized and the fuel consumption is also minimized then the propeller curve is computed for different ship speeds and loads in calm water the losses along the transmission shaft are taken into consideration this tool can be further used in different marine applications it can be integrated into a basic ship design tool and to a ship routing code vettor and guedes soares 2016 zaccone et al

simulation model is a fishing trawler general characteristics of the ship are presented in table 1 the total resistance of the ship r t as shown in fig 3 is calculated using the numerical equations presented by holtrop and mennen 1982 and holtrop 1984 and it is divided into viscous resistance r v and wave making resistance r w as in the following equation 1 r t r v r w 2 2 engine data the engine installed to propel the fishing trawler is a man r6 730 it is a high speed turbocharged four stroke marine diesel engine with six cylinders in line the range of working speed in 1 000 2 100 rpm delivering 537 kw maximum power at 2 300 rpm rated speed man diesel and turbo 2017 this engine can be installed as a prime mover in small boats like yachts trawlers table 2 shows the main specifications of the engine 3 engine optimization module 3 1 general overview this module is used to simulate engine performance for different speeds and loads it couples a nonlinear optimizer and ricardo wave as a 1d and gas dynamic engine simulation software as presented in fig 4 the fuel injection and turbocharger parameters are optimized in order to minimize the bsfc of the selected marine diesel engine and to verify the limitation of exhaust emissions a detailed description of the thermodynamic fluid chemical mechanical and control processes during the engine simulation is presented in section 3 2 the nonlinear optimization method used in this work is fmincon starting at an initial estimate it finds the minimum of a multivariable function based on interior point algorithm nocedal and wright 2000 as fmincon is a heuristic minimizer multi start procedures are performed to choose the suitable initial start based on the performance of the optimizer in evaluating the objective and the constraints of the optimization model 3 2 ricardo wave and governing equations firstly the engine model is built in ricardo wave the model is presented as a grid of pipes and junctions to simulate the performance of the engine and to predict the amount of exhaust emissions the temperature and pressure are the main inputs of the atmospheric initial conditions and the working fluid in the engine is considered as an ideal gas and is described by the following equation ferguson and kirkpatrick 2001 2 p ρ r t where p is the fluid pressure and t is the fluid temperature ρ is the fluid density and r is the gas constant the compressor and turbine of the turbocharger are modelled using non dimensional maps which allow the interrelation between the four parameters corrected flow rate pressure ratio corrected speed and efficiency due to the lack of data the maps of the compressor and turbine are selected and scaled from existing ones to fit the requirement of the engine a proportional integral pi control model implemented in ricardo wave as presented in equation 3 is used to control the opening area of wastegate valve to protect the turbocharger from overboost pressure the pressure at the intake manifold is higher than a preset value the control model regulates the speed of the turbine which in turn regulates the speed of the compressor by diverting some amount of exhaust gases before entering the turbine wheel 3 u t k p e t k i e t d t where u is the control signal to the plant k p is the proportional gain e is the magnitude of the error and k i is the integral gain the colburn analogy method ede 1967 is used to compute the amount of heat transfer in the intercooler and the manifolds while the pressure losses are calculated using a fixed friction coefficient parrish 1973 each cylinder is equipped with four valves two for the intake and two for the exhaust to improve the flow of intake and exhaust gases and thus the engine performance the profile of valves and the valve timings are defined to control the engine intake and exhaust cycle the injection system is modelled by considering the diesel fuel oil in combustion the quantity of injected fuel the start angle the period and the rate of injection then the engine processes are computed based on the first law of thermodynamics as in equation 4 heywood 1988 4 d e δ q δ w where de is the change in internal energy δq is the heat transfer into the system δw is the work done by the system during the combustion process the total heat added dq as presented in equation 5 is computed for each crank angle considering the amount of heat added from the combustion of fuel q comb and the heat exchanged dq w with the cylinder walls 5 d q q c o m b d x b d q w the combustion process is controlled using the wiebe function suggested by watson et al 1980 which determine the behaviour of burning mass fraction x b this wiebe function is one of the classical formulas of double wiebe function used to predict the combustion process in diesel engines ghojel 2010 it is used in different engine simulation software systems and does not need any calibration and shows a higher accuracy in predicting the combustion process in marine engines tadros et al 2020b it is used to compute the amount of burning fuel along the three phases of combustion premix diffusion and tail it depends on the period of ignition delay which is considered the period between soi and starts angle of combustion soc and fuel cetane number the duration of burning for each working condition is proportional to the burn duration at the rated speed the heat transfer inside the cylinder is calculated along the engine cycle using the empirical equation presented by woschni 1967 the exhaust emissions presented in co2 and nox emissions are computed based on the emission factor ef as presented by kristensen 2012 the co2 emissions are computed as a function of bsfc where 6 c o 2 e m i s s i o n s b s f c e f the formation of nox emissions are calculated using the extended zeldovich mechanism heywood 1988 depending on the burned and unburned zones of combustion the principal reactions depend on the formation of nitric oxide no emissions from molecular nitrogen as presented in eqs 7 9 while the nox emissions are computed as nitrogen dioxide no2 7 o n 2 n o n 8 n o 2 n o o 9 n o h n o h the rate constant r for the reaction in eq 7 is given by 10 r a a p e m e t a a e m t while for eqs 8 9 the rate constant is given by 11 r a e t a t where o is atom of oxygen n is atom of nitrogen h is atom of hydrogen and oh is hydroxide a is a pre exponential constant t a is the reaction activation temperature t is burned zone temperature apem is arrhenius pre exponent multiplier and aem is arrhenius exponent multiplier according to the manufacturer the engine verified the limitation of nox emissions applied by the imo at tier 2 which is equal to 7 7 g kwh at 2 100 rpm and rated power so the multipliers of arrhenius pre exponent and arrhenius exponent as presented in eq 10 are calibrated at 100 load due to the lack of data of the chemical reaction coefficients 3 3 nonlinear optimization process the nonlinear constrained optimizer fmincon as described above is coupled with the engine model to find the optimal values of turbocharger speed ts in rpm soi in degree and fuel rate fr in kg h to minimize the fuel consumption which is the main objective of this part and to verify the emission limitations for a given power and speed the design variables of the optimization model are presented by a three dimensional vector x ts soi fr and the optimization problem is subjected to the following constraints 12 p b x p b o b j 13 t a f t e r c y l i n d e r x t a f t e r c y l i n d e r m a x 14 p max x p m a x m a x 15 n o x x n o x m a x 16 a f r m i n a f r x a f r m a x 17 t s m i n t s t s m a x 18 s o i m i n s o i s o i m a x 19 f r m i n f r f r m a x where p b is the brake power t aftercylinder x is the exhaust temperature after cylinder in degree k p max x is the firing pressure in bar no x x is nox emissions in g kw h and afr x is the air fuel ratio and is changeable for each load eq 12 presents equality restriction of the optimization problem while eqs 13 15 present the conditions of the inequality restrictions eqs 17 19 indicate the variation range of each variable considered and the value of the parameters of the engine optimization model are presented in table 3 in order to insert these constraints into the cost function a simple static penalty function method is considered all equality and inequality restrictions are normalized where their absolute values are less than one as in the following equations 20 h x p b p b o b j 1 21 g 1 x p max p m a x m a x 1 22 g 2 x t a f t e r c y l i n d e r t a f t e r c y l i n d e r m a x 1 23 g 3 x n o x n o x m a x 1 24 g 4 x a f r a f r max 1 25 g 5 x a f r a f r min 1 therefore the cost function for the optimization model is written as in the following expression 26 c o s t f u n c t i o n b s f c x r i 1 5 max g i x 0 h x where r is a penalty parameter equal to 1 000 as suggested by zhao and xu 2013 4 results and discussion firstly the marine diesel engine model is built in ricardo wave taking into account the maps of the turbocharger the intercooler the dimensions of the intake and exhaust system and the injection system the maps of the turbocharger are scaled from existing ones due to the lack of data by considering the maximum value of corrected mass flow rate the compression ratio and the speed of the shaft of the turbocharger the intercooler is modelled using two junctions and many thin pipes and is calibrated using the data of the heat transfer provided by the manufacturer the intake and exhaust valve timings and the injection pressure are constant for the different working conditions these parameters are validated where the percentage of error between the calculated results and the real data of air flow rate compression ratio heat transfer in the intercooler and bsfc do not exceed 5 at the rated speed then the engine model is coupled with the nonlinear optimization method to optimize the values of turbocharger speed soi and the amount of injected fuel along the theoretical propeller and full load curves as presented by man diesel turbo as in figs 5 6 in order to achieve the amount of bsfc for each load and speed for validation purposes the calculated values of bsfc along the two curves show a good fitting with the real data provided by the manufacturer the results of this optimization process are used to recalibrate the previous parts of the engine model for better accuracy after calibrating and validating the optimization model the computation of the performance of the engine is extended to simulate the load diagram of the engine varying from 33 to 110 of the engine speed and from 5 to 100 of engine load as shown in figs 7 17 figs 7 9 present the variation of bsfc co2 and nox emissions along the engine load diagram as considered the main calculated results the engine operates with a suitable bsfc at 100 of speed and 80 of the load while it is minimized at 75 of engine speed the value of bsfc increases in general with the reduction of loads the co2 emissions in fig 8 show the same variation as in bsfc where the ef used is constant the calculated nox emissions in g kw h are presented in fig 9 the chemical reactions of the extended zeldovich mechanism are calibrated at the power rating and the engine verifies the limitation applied by imo where nox emissions do not exceed the limit value at the rated speed 7 7 g kw h and show a reduction in its value when reducing speeds and loads this reduction is achieved due to two factors the amount of intake air and the maximum temperature of combustion which are decreased with the reduction of engine load and speed the variation of intake air is presented using the volumetric efficiency as in fig 10 which shows a significant reduction with the low loads the amount of intake air inside the engine and thus the compression ratio are depending on the speed of the turbocharger which reduced with the low loads as shown in fig 13 the afr is an important variable to present it affects the amount of formation of nox emissions and the thermodynamic properties of both the fluid during the combustion process and of the exhaust gas afr is inversed proportional to the engine loads and speeds where the increase in the amount of air inside the cylinder increases the rate of combustion of the engine to achieve the given load and to decrease the fuel consumption the afr is controlled for each load to neither exceed the emission limitations nor the firing pressure which can lead to engine failure the variation of brake thermal efficiency is also presented and shows a maximum value of 41 at 75 of engine speed the values of soi and afr are optimized for each working condition in order to minimize the fuel consumption and the nox emissions and to ensure the durability and the safety of the engine this parameter has a direct effect on the pressure and temperature inside the engine where an earlier angle of injection increases the maximum pressure and thus the flame temperature and vice versa it also affects the performance of the turbine which requires a high temperature for better turbine efficiency the early injection reduces the temperature of the exhaust gas into the turbine and vice versa in fig 14 the variation of the optimized soi for the engine operating range is presented to verify the pressure and temperature limitations during the combustion and the exhaust processes it has been shown that the retarded injection angle is applied in many working conditions to minimize the temperature inside the cylinder and thus the exhaust emissions at low loads the early injection angles are considered to achieve the required power due to the reduction in the amount of air and fuel inside the cylinders figs 15 17 show the calculated values of firing pressures exhaust pressures and temperatures for different engine speeds and loads respectively in order to check the safety of the engine during the working conditions as they do not exceed the limits specified in the optimization process as described above these values decrease when reducing the engine loads where they are affected by the compression ratio soi afr and valves timing 5 propeller optimization module 5 1 general overview this module is the second component of the optimization tool it is used to automatically select a suitable fixed pitch propeller from wageningen b series for the design ship speed of a fishing trawler at the minimum fuel

diagram varies from 50 to 85 of the maximum engine load and from 70 to 100 of the maximum engine speed in this area the optimizer searches about the optimal design of the propeller for the design speed of the ship to be more realistic instead of the whole engine load diagram 5 4 nonlinear optimization process the optimizer fmincon is coupled with the propeller model to find the optimum values of propeller geometry and gearbox ratio for the cruising speed of the ship by minimizing the fuel consumption which is the main objective of this part and by verifying the cavitation strength and noise issues the design variables of the optimization process are defined by the vector x d n ear p d gbr and the boundary limits of each variable are expressed as 39 d m i n d d m a x 40 n m i n n n

series with the nonlinear optimizer the diameter rotational speed ear pitch diameter ratio of the propeller and gearbox ratio between engine and propeller are optimized for the given fishing trawler cruising speed with a four blades propeller to select an optimum propeller working at the engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption and to verify the limits of cavitation strength and noise the propeller is designed for 9 knots design ship speed and the efficiency of the gearbox ηgb 97 and the efficiency of the transmission shaft ηt 99 are considered as losses between the brake power p b and the delivered power p d as computed from equation 67 fig 19 shows a general overview of the powertrain of the marine propulsion system between the marine diesel engine and the propeller 67 p d p b η g b η t the wake fraction w and thrust deduction fraction t are considered to compute the advance speed v a as in equation 68 while the thrust force t is calculated from the total resistance as in equation 69 68 v a v s 1 w 69 t r t 1 t in order to have a better overview between the current study and those presented in the literature review a comparison study is performed between three cases using the same conditions of the propeller module while changing the objective function as follows 1 maximum propeller efficiency 2 minimum bsfc and 3 minimum fuel consumption fc the optimized parameters are presented in table 5 where the different propeller parameters are optimized and the propeller verifies the cavitation the strength and the noise issues and the propeller is chosen at the normal engine operating conditions that vary from 1 470 to 2 100 rpm and from 50 to 85 of the maximum brake power the objective of each model is verified for instance the propeller efficiency is maximized in the first case in comparison to the other cases the bsfc is minimized in the second case than in the first and third ones while the fuel consumption shows its lower level in the third case it has been noticed a 13 increase in propeller efficiency in the first case in relation to the last two cases due to the large propeller diameter the lower propeller speed and lower expanded area ratio the propeller diameter shows its lower value in the second case by 6 4 and 5 in relation to the first and the third cases respectively the propeller speed increases in the second case in comparison with the other two cases to compensate for the reduction in propeller diameter and to produce the required thrust the pitch diameter ratio is increased in the first case while keeping constant in the other two cases to achieve a minimum value of fuel consumption the propeller needs to be designed for the minimum level of the normal operating area of the engine for instance the propeller is selected to operate at 73 and 67 of the engine rated power for the first two cases respectively while it is optimized at 50 for the third case where a 30 reduction in fuel consumption is achieved at the same ship speed when optimizing the propeller parameters at the minimum fuel consumption rather than only maximizing the propeller efficiency the engine propeller interaction is shown in fig 20 based on the computed results in the third case and the propeller curve is computed in calm water for different engine speeds and loads to estimate the bsfc and exhaust emissions for different operating conditions 7 conclusions this paper presents an overview of the different software systems used to simulate and optimize both the engine and the propeller performances under different operating conditions without the need of doing experimental tests then a software tool consisting of two optimization modules is developed to optimize the performance of a marine propulsion system the first module simulates the performance of a high speed turbocharged four stroke marine diesel engine by coupling a nonlinear optimization method and ricardo wave as 1d engine simulation software the main findings of this module are summarized as follows 1 the model minimizes the brake specific fuel consumption of the engine by finding the optimal values of the parameters of the turbocharger and the injectors 2 the model verifies the limitations of exhaust emissions according to the international regulations and thermodynamic properties inside the engine to ensure the safety aspects inside the engine 3 due to the optimizer adopted fmincon the time consumed during the simulation is acceptable and does not require high performance computers unlike the other optimizers 4 the model can be adapted to simulate the performance of any engine either it is compression ignition or spark ignition 5 more variables can be considered in the optimization procedure for a robust design of the engine such as the injection profile valves profile size of intake and exhaust system by considering the types of the material used using the data provided from the engine module the second optimization module presents a practical technique to automatically select a suitable fixed pitch propeller from wageningen b series for the design ship speed at the engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption the main findings of this module are summarized as follows 1 the propeller diameter rotational speed ear and pitch diameter ratio and gearbox ratio are optimized 2 the model verifies cavitation strength and noise issues then a comparison study is performed using the same module to compare the propeller performance of the current study with the concepts mentioned in the literature review by changing the objective of the study to maximize the propeller efficiency and to minimize the bsfc the objective of each case is verified in comparison to the other cases however the main contribution of this study is that a 30 reduction in fuel consumption is achieved when the propeller is selected at the engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption than only maximizing the propeller efficiency or minimizing the bsfc this tool can be further used during the different stages of ship design in order to simulate and optimize the performance of marine propulsion system in terms of fuel consumption for different types of ships and can be integrated with other numerical models to minimize the amount of fuel consumed and exhaust emissions during ship

first optimization module simulates the performance of a high speed turbocharged four stroke marine diesel engine along the engine load diagram it couples 1d engine simulation tool and a nonlinear optimizer to minimize the bsfc of the marine engine and to verify the limitations of emissions defined by international organizations by optimizing turbocharger and injection parameters the second module assists in the selection of a suitable fixed pitch propeller from wageningen b series at the ship design speed at engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption and by verifying the propeller cavitation strength and noise issues instead of only maximizing the propeller efficiency or minimizing the bsfc as considered in previous researches then the objective of the propeller optimization module is changed to compute the propeller performance by 1 maximizing the propeller efficiency 2 minimizing the bsfc for the purpose of comparison with the current study the current case shows a significant reduction in the amount of fuel consumed by around 30 in comparison with the other two cases keywords marine propulsion system marine turbocharged diesel engine exhaust emissions marine propeller nonlinearly constrained optimization 1 introduction stringent environmental regulations are applied by the international and national organizations to reduce the exhaust emissions from ships different solutions and methods were considered to verify these limitations lloyd s register 2012 these methods considered the different parts of the ships such as the hull form propulsion system aerodynamic resistance fuel used and renewable energies the propulsion system in which this study is focused on is the main system of any ship it consists of a prime mover transmission shaft and propeller in order to propel the ship at the desired speed and to support manoeuvring stopping and backing the power generated from the prime mover passes through the transmission shaft and transmitted to the propeller which in turn transferred to the main thrust bearing of the ship during the different stages of ship design the propulsion system requires careful calculations and simulations to ensure its reliability to maximize its efficiency and to minimize the consumption of fuel bulut et al 2015 different software systems are available to simulate both the engine and the propeller performances these numerical models are suitable to predict the behaviour of the components of the marine system under different working conditions without doing experimental tests as presented in the following subsections 1 1 engine simulation model the numerical simulation of the performance of diesel engines started taking place at the beginning of the 20th century by goodenough and baker 1927 since the second world war the development of fast techniques was achieved to predict the performance of the different types of engines and the associated gas dynamics atherton 1996 costall 2007 depending on the complexity of the system as presented in fig 1 look up table models altosole and figari 2011 martelli and figari 2018 tadros et al 2018b zero dimensional models quasi steady models followed by filling and emptying models and gas dynamic models till the 2d and 3d models ammar and farag 2016 sun et al 2017 2018 are the main levels of engine modelling either it compression ignition ci or spark ignition si these different simulation models were developed to deal with the complexity of an engine where the methods of design dynamic control etc are the different mechanical systems disciplines considered xin 2011 different parameters must be defined according to the complexity of the utilized model to simulate the engine performance and to compute the amount of exhaust emissions the main components considered in the simulation model are presented in fig 2 as follows 1 injection system 2 turbocharger compressor turbine shaft and wastegate 3 intercooler 4 intake and exhaust manifolds 5 engine cylinders 6 atmospheric initial conditions due to the acceptable simulation time with more details in thermodynamic mechanical chemical fluid heat transfer and automatic control processes an overview of the different 0d and 1d engine models used in previous investigations is presented 1 1 1 zero dimensional models these models as presented in refs altosole et al 2017 benvenuto et al 2016 mizythras et al 2018 tadros et al 2015 are the simplest fastest and most suitable to predict the behaviour of a combustion process to calculate the output power and to specify the characteristics of exhaust emissions using laws of conservation of mass and energy heywood 1988 they do not consider the behaviour of the flow inside the engine components and the engine combustion models can be divided into i single zone models where the fluid inside the engine is considered as a thermodynamic system ii two zone models where two distinct thermodynamic systems are considered and presented by an unburned and a burned zone there is an interaction in energy and mass between the two zones assumed and the surroundings iii multi zone models in which the combustion chamber are divided into several zones and are based on chemical kinetics 1 1 2 quasi steady models in these models the overall performance of the engine is determined using the interaction between various sub models either it is particular or empirical functions almajri et al 2017 sowale et al 2018 however the quasi steady models assume that the intake and exhaust fluid pass through various volumes each of them is separate without any form of mass accumulation 1 1 3 filling and emptying models due to some limitations in quasi steady models in estimation the variation in pressures and volumes in the intake and exhaust ports as well as the cylinders which affect the calculations of camshaft timing backflow phenomena etc the filling and emptying models compute the pressures in the intake and exhaust systems along the engine cycle these models are described in details by watson and janota 1982 and give more information than the quasi steady models these models are depending on the time step analysis and the pressures are calculated at each degree of crank rotation they also allow the analysis of transient operations theotokatos and kyrtatos 2001 1 1 4 gas dynamic models gas dynamic or wave action models in which the previous models are considered are widely used in designing and optimizing various types of engines due to their ability to compute the variation in pressures in the intake and exhaust system using 1d unsteady compressible flow and compared well against experimental data payri et al 1986 pearson and winterbone 1997 this technique is used in different software systems such as 1 avl 2017 2 diesel rk 2015 3 gamma technologies 2017 4 gasdyn 2018 5 lotus engineering software lesoft 2017 and 6 ricardo wave software 2016 which was used in engine simulation in this study to meet the market needs where different investigations are performed as in cornolti et al 2013 mavrelos and theotokatos 2018 stoumpos et al 2018 1 2 propeller

marques et al 2018 applied optimization procedure to match engine and propeller for a liquefied natural gas lng ship operated in rough weather conditions in order to minimize the consumption of fuel while using simple engine model based on polynomial equations marques et al 2017 without considering the exhaust emissions this engine model played a key role in the reduction of the simulation time during the optimization problem during the initial stages of ship design more details are required to simulate an efficient system and to reduce consumption and emissions in this study an optimization procedure is used to simulate the performance of a ship propulsion system an optimization tool is developed by the authors to be used during the initial stages of ship design this tool is composed of two optimization modules the first module simulates the engine performance for the whole operating conditions and the second one is used to select an efficient propeller for the design speed of a ship trawler at the minimum fuel consumption of the engine the first optimization module which is used by tadros et al 2019 to simulate a large marine diesel engine is adapted to compute the bsfc and the exhaust emissions of carbon dioxide co2 and nitrogen oxides nox of a high speed marine turbocharged diesel engine for all operating conditions in engine load diagram this module finds the optimal value of turbocharger speed the amount of fuel injected and the start angle of injection to minimize the fuel consumption and to verify the exhaust emissions according to the restrictions applied by the international maritime organization imo 2018 it couples ricardo wave software 2016 as a 1d and gas dynamic engine simulation software with a nonlinearly constrained optimizer implemented in matlab this numerical model avoids the need for experimental tests to estimate the engine performance and the exhaust emissions for every working point in the load diagram in order to save time and cost the nonlinear optimizer adopted fmincon the mathworks inc 2016 shows a good computing performance to reach the optimal solution unlike the other optimizers used in previous researches using the same optimizer and the data produced by the engine model the second optimization module is developed to automatically select a suitable fixed pitch propeller from wageningen b series for the design speed of a ship trawler at the minimum fuel consumption along the engine load diagram by verifying cavitation strength and noise issues this module presents a practical technique to design a propeller at the engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption in order to decrease the fuel consumed and therefore the exhaust emissions during the sailing of the ship instead of only maximizing the propeller efficiency or minimizing the bsfc as presented in previous researches a comparison study is performed between the propeller performance when the propeller efficiency is maximized the bsfc is minimized and the fuel consumption is also minimized then the propeller curve is computed for different ship speeds and loads in calm water the losses along the transmission shaft are taken into

delivering 537 kw maximum power at 2 300 rpm rated speed man diesel and turbo 2017 this engine can be installed as a prime mover in small boats like yachts trawlers table 2 shows the main specifications of the engine 3 engine optimization module 3 1 general overview this module is used to simulate engine performance for different speeds and loads it couples a nonlinear optimizer and ricardo wave as a 1d and gas dynamic engine simulation software as presented in fig 4 the fuel injection and turbocharger parameters are optimized in order to minimize the bsfc of the selected marine diesel engine and to verify the limitation of exhaust emissions a detailed description of the thermodynamic fluid chemical mechanical and control processes during the engine simulation is presented in section 3 2 the nonlinear optimization method used in this work is fmincon starting at an initial estimate it finds the minimum of a multivariable function based on interior point algorithm nocedal and wright 2000 as fmincon is a heuristic minimizer multi start procedures are performed to choose the suitable initial start based on the performance of the optimizer in evaluating the objective and the constraints of the optimization model 3 2 ricardo wave and governing equations firstly the engine model is built in ricardo wave the model is presented as a grid of pipes and junctions to simulate the performance of the engine and to predict the amount of exhaust emissions the temperature and pressure are the main inputs of the atmospheric initial conditions and the working fluid in the engine is considered as an ideal gas and is described by the following equation ferguson and kirkpatrick 2001 2 p ρ r t where p is the fluid pressure and t is the fluid temperature ρ is the fluid density and r is the gas constant the compressor and turbine of the turbocharger are modelled using non dimensional maps which allow the interrelation between the four parameters corrected flow rate pressure ratio corrected speed and efficiency due to the lack of data the maps of the compressor and turbine are selected and scaled from existing ones to fit the requirement of the engine a proportional integral pi control model implemented in ricardo wave as presented in equation 3 is used to control the opening area of wastegate valve to protect the turbocharger from overboost pressure the pressure at the intake manifold is higher than a preset value the control model regulates the speed of the turbine which in turn regulates the speed of the compressor by diverting some amount of exhaust gases before entering the turbine wheel 3 u t k p e t k i e t d t where u is the control signal to the plant k p is the proportional gain e is the magnitude of the error and k i is the integral gain the colburn analogy method ede 1967 is used to compute the amount of heat transfer in the intercooler and the manifolds while the pressure losses are calculated using a fixed friction coefficient parrish 1973 each cylinder is equipped with four valves two for the intake and two for the exhaust to improve the flow of intake and exhaust gases and thus the engine performance the profile of valves and the valve timings are defined to control the engine intake and exhaust cycle the injection system is modelled by considering the diesel fuel oil in combustion the quantity of injected fuel the start angle the period and the rate of injection then the engine processes are computed based on the first law of thermodynamics as in equation 4 heywood 1988 4 d e δ q δ w where de is the change in internal energy δq is the heat transfer into the system δw is the work done by the system during the combustion process the total heat added dq as presented in equation 5 is computed for each crank angle considering the amount of heat added from the combustion of fuel q comb and the heat exchanged dq w with the cylinder walls 5 d q q c o m b d x b d q w the combustion process is controlled using the wiebe function suggested by watson et al 1980 which determine the behaviour of burning mass fraction x b this wiebe function is one of the classical formulas of double wiebe function used to predict the combustion process in diesel engines ghojel 2010 it is used in different engine simulation software systems and does not need any calibration and shows a higher accuracy in predicting the combustion process in marine engines tadros et al 2020b it is used to compute the amount of burning fuel along the three phases of combustion premix diffusion and tail it depends on the period of ignition delay which is considered the period between soi and starts angle of combustion soc and fuel cetane number the duration of burning for each working condition is proportional to the burn duration at the rated speed the heat transfer inside the cylinder is calculated along the engine cycle using the empirical equation presented by woschni 1967 the exhaust emissions presented in co2 and nox emissions are computed based on the emission factor ef as presented by kristensen 2012 the co2 emissions are computed as a function of bsfc where 6 c o 2 e m i s s i o n s b s f c e f the formation of nox emissions are calculated using the extended zeldovich mechanism heywood 1988 depending on the burned and unburned zones of combustion the principal reactions depend on the formation of nitric oxide no emissions from molecular nitrogen as presented in eqs 7 9 while the nox emissions are computed as nitrogen dioxide no2 7 o n 2 n o n 8 n o 2 n o o 9 n o h n o h the rate constant r for the reaction in eq 7 is given by 10 r a a p e m e t a a e m t while for eqs 8 9 the rate constant is given by 11 r a e t a t where o is atom of oxygen n is atom of nitrogen h is atom of hydrogen and oh is hydroxide a is a pre exponential constant t a is the reaction activation temperature t is burned zone temperature apem is arrhenius pre exponent multiplier and aem is arrhenius exponent multiplier according to the manufacturer the engine verified the limitation of nox emissions applied by the imo at tier 2 which is equal to 7 7 g kwh at 2 100 rpm and rated power so the multipliers of arrhenius pre exponent and arrhenius exponent as presented in eq 10 are calibrated at 100 load due to the lack of data of the chemical reaction coefficients 3 3 nonlinear optimization process the nonlinear constrained optimizer fmincon as described above is coupled with the engine model to find the optimal values of turbocharger speed ts in rpm soi in degree and fuel rate fr in kg h to minimize the fuel consumption which is the main objective of this part and to verify the emission limitations for a given power and speed the design variables of the optimization model are presented by a three dimensional vector x ts soi fr and the optimization problem is subjected to the following constraints 12 p b x p b o b j 13 t a f t e r c y l i n d e r x t a f t e r c y l i n d e r m a x 14 p max x p m a x m a x 15 n o x x n o x m a x 16 a f r m i n a f r x a f r m a x 17 t s m i n t s t s m a x 18 s o i m i n s o i s o i m a x 19 f r m i n f r f r m a x where p b is the brake power t aftercylinder x is the exhaust temperature after cylinder in degree k p max x is the firing pressure in bar no x x is nox emissions in g kw h and afr x is the air fuel ratio and is changeable for each load eq 12 presents equality restriction of the optimization problem while eqs 13 15 present the conditions of the inequality restrictions eqs 17 19 indicate the variation range of each variable considered and the value of the parameters of the engine optimization model are presented in table 3 in order to insert these constraints into the cost function a simple static penalty function method is considered all equality and inequality restrictions are normalized where their absolute values are less than one as in the following equations 20 h x p b p b o b j 1 21 g 1 x p max p m a x m a x 1 22 g 2 x t a f t e r c y l i n d e r t a f t e r c y l i n d e r m a x 1 23 g 3 x n o x n o x m a x 1 24 g 4 x a f r a f r max 1 25 g 5 x a f r a f r min 1 therefore the cost function for the optimization model is written as in the following expression 26 c o s t f u n c t i o n b s f c x r i 1 5 max g i x 0 h x where r is a penalty parameter equal to 1 000 as suggested by zhao and xu 2013 4 results and discussion firstly the marine diesel engine model is built in ricardo wave taking into account the maps of the turbocharger the intercooler the dimensions of the intake and exhaust system and the injection system the maps of the turbocharger are scaled from existing ones due to the lack of data by considering the maximum value of corrected mass flow rate the compression ratio and the speed of the shaft of the turbocharger the intercooler is modelled using two junctions and many thin pipes and is calibrated using the data of the heat transfer provided by the manufacturer the intake and exhaust valve timings and the injection pressure are constant for the different working conditions these parameters are validated where the percentage of error between the calculated results and the real data of air flow rate compression ratio heat transfer in the intercooler and bsfc do not exceed 5 at the rated speed then the engine model is coupled with the nonlinear optimization method to optimize the values of turbocharger speed soi and the amount of injected fuel along the theoretical propeller and full load curves as presented by man diesel turbo as in figs 5 6 in order to achieve the amount of bsfc for each load and speed for validation purposes the calculated values of bsfc along the two curves show a good fitting with the real data provided by the manufacturer the results of this optimization process are used to recalibrate the previous parts of the engine model for better accuracy after calibrating and validating the optimization model the computation of the performance of the engine is extended to simulate the load diagram of the engine varying from 33 to 110 of the engine speed and from 5 to 100 of engine load as shown in figs 7 17 figs 7 9 present the variation of bsfc co2 and nox emissions along the engine load diagram as considered the main calculated results the engine operates with a suitable bsfc at 100 of speed and 80 of the load while it is minimized at 75 of engine speed the value of bsfc increases in general with the reduction of loads the co2 emissions in fig 8 show the same variation as in bsfc where the ef used is constant the calculated nox emissions in g kw h are presented in fig 9 the chemical reactions of the extended zeldovich mechanism are calibrated at the power rating and the engine verifies the limitation applied by imo where nox emissions do not exceed the limit value at the rated speed 7 7 g kw h and show a reduction in its value when reducing speeds and loads this reduction is achieved due to two factors the amount of intake air and the maximum temperature of combustion which are decreased with the reduction of engine load and speed the variation of intake air is presented using the volumetric efficiency as in fig 10 which shows a significant reduction with the low loads the amount of intake air inside the engine and thus the compression ratio are depending on the speed of the turbocharger which reduced with the low loads as shown in fig 13 the afr is an important variable to present it affects the amount of formation of nox emissions and the thermodynamic properties of both the fluid during the combustion process and of the exhaust gas afr is inversed proportional to the engine loads and speeds where the increase in the amount of air inside the cylinder increases the rate of combustion of the engine to achieve the given load and to decrease the fuel consumption the afr is controlled for each load to neither exceed the emission limitations nor the firing pressure which can lead to engine failure the variation of brake thermal efficiency is also presented and shows a maximum value of 41 at 75 of engine speed the values of soi and afr are optimized for each working condition in order to minimize the fuel consumption and the nox emissions and to ensure the durability and the safety of the engine this parameter has a direct effect on the pressure and temperature inside the engine where an earlier angle of injection increases the maximum pressure and thus the flame temperature and vice versa it also affects the performance of the turbine which requires a high temperature for better turbine efficiency the early injection reduces the temperature of the exhaust gas into the turbine and vice versa in fig 14 the variation of the optimized soi for the engine operating range is presented to verify the pressure and temperature limitations during the combustion and the exhaust processes it has been shown that the retarded injection angle is applied in many working conditions to minimize the temperature inside the cylinder and thus the exhaust emissions at low loads the early injection angles are considered to achieve the required power due to the reduction in the amount of air and fuel inside the cylinders figs 15 17 show the calculated values of firing pressures exhaust pressures and temperatures for different engine speeds and loads respectively in order to check the safety of the engine during the working conditions as they do not exceed the limits specified in the optimization process as described above these values decrease when reducing the engine loads where they are affected by the compression ratio soi afr and valves timing 5 propeller optimization module 5 1 general overview this module is the second

diagram varies from 50 to 85 of the maximum engine load and from 70 to 100 of the maximum engine speed in this area the optimizer searches about the optimal design of the propeller for the design speed of the ship to be more realistic instead of the whole engine load diagram 5 4 nonlinear optimization process the optimizer fmincon is coupled with the propeller model to find the optimum values of propeller geometry and gearbox ratio for the cruising speed of the ship by minimizing the fuel consumption which is the main objective of this part and by verifying the cavitation strength and

series with the nonlinear optimizer the diameter rotational speed ear pitch diameter ratio of the propeller and gearbox ratio between engine and propeller are optimized for the given fishing trawler cruising speed with a four blades propeller to select an optimum propeller working at the engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption and to verify the limits of cavitation strength and noise the propeller is designed for 9 knots design ship speed and the efficiency of the gearbox ηgb 97 and the efficiency of the transmission shaft ηt 99 are considered as losses between the brake power p b and the delivered power p d as computed from equation 67 fig 19 shows a general overview of the powertrain of the marine propulsion system between the marine diesel engine and the propeller 67 p d p b η g b η t the wake fraction w and thrust deduction fraction t are considered to compute the advance speed v a as in equation 68 while the thrust force t is calculated from the total resistance as in equation 69 68 v a v s 1 w 69 t r t 1 t in order to have a better overview between the current study and those presented in the literature review a comparison study is performed between three cases using the same conditions of the propeller module while changing the objective function as follows 1 maximum propeller efficiency 2 minimum bsfc and 3 minimum fuel consumption fc the optimized parameters are presented in table 5 where the different propeller parameters are optimized and the propeller verifies the cavitation the strength and the noise issues and the propeller is chosen at the normal engine operating conditions that vary from 1 470 to 2 100 rpm and from 50 to 85 of the maximum brake power the objective of each model is verified for instance the propeller efficiency is maximized in the first case in comparison to the other cases the bsfc is minimized in the second case than in the first and third ones while the fuel consumption shows its lower level in the third case it has been noticed a 13 increase in propeller efficiency in the first case in relation to the last two cases due to the large propeller diameter the lower propeller speed and lower expanded area ratio the propeller diameter shows its lower value in the second case by 6 4 and 5 in relation to the first and the third cases respectively the propeller speed increases in the second case in comparison with the other two cases to compensate for the reduction in propeller diameter and to produce the required thrust the pitch diameter ratio is increased in the first case while keeping constant in the other two cases to achieve a minimum value of fuel consumption the propeller needs to be designed for the minimum level of the normal operating area of the engine for instance the propeller is selected to operate at 73 and 67 of the engine rated power for the first two cases respectively while it is optimized at 50 for the third case where a 30 reduction in fuel consumption is achieved at the same ship speed when optimizing the propeller parameters at the minimum fuel consumption rather than only maximizing the propeller efficiency the engine propeller interaction is shown in fig 20 based on the computed results in the third case and the propeller curve is computed in calm water for different engine speeds and loads to estimate the bsfc and exhaust emissions for different operating conditions 7 conclusions this paper presents an overview of the different software systems used to simulate and optimize both the engine and the propeller performances under different operating conditions without the need of doing experimental tests then a software tool consisting of two optimization modules is developed to optimize the performance of a marine propulsion system the first module simulates the performance of a high speed turbocharged four stroke marine diesel engine by coupling a nonlinear optimization method and ricardo wave as 1d engine simulation software the main findings of this module are summarized as follows 1 the model minimizes the brake specific fuel consumption of the engine by finding the optimal values of the parameters of the turbocharger and the injectors 2 the model verifies the limitations of exhaust emissions according to the international regulations and thermodynamic properties inside the engine to ensure the safety aspects inside the engine 3 due to the optimizer adopted fmincon the time consumed during the simulation is acceptable and does not require high performance computers unlike the other optimizers 4 the model can be adapted to simulate the performance of any engine either it is compression ignition or spark ignition 5 more variables can be considered in the optimization procedure for a robust design of the engine such as the injection profile valves profile size of intake and exhaust system by considering the types of the material used using the data provided from the engine module the second optimization module presents a practical technique to automatically select a suitable fixed pitch propeller from wageningen b series for the design ship speed at the engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption the main findings of this module are summarized as follows 1 the propeller diameter rotational speed ear and pitch diameter ratio and gearbox ratio are optimized 2 the model verifies cavitation strength and noise issues then a comparison study is performed using the same module to compare the propeller performance of the current study with the concepts mentioned in the literature review by changing the objective of the study to maximize the propeller efficiency and to minimize the bsfc the objective of each case is verified in comparison to the other cases however the main contribution of this study is that a 30 reduction in fuel consumption is achieved when the propeller is selected at the engine operating point with minimum fuel consumption than only maximizing the propeller efficiency or minimizing the bsfc this tool can be further used during the different stages of ship design in order to simulate and optimize the performance of marine propulsion system in terms of fuel consumption for different types of ships and can be integrated with other numerical models to minimize the amount of fuel consumed and exhaust emissions during ship

may in fact have a great influence in the prediction of ship responses the occurrence of bimodal wave spectra is assessed by analysing the era interim wave database and in particular the parameters describing the different spectral components for wind sea and swell a brief description of the global wave climate is provided with a discussion on the significance of the average conditions as representative for the actual scenarios that can be expected and the consistency of the results with previous studies is verified the contribution of the two regimes in different areas is then investigated as well as the probability of crossing seas separating the stormy conditions by the highly swell dominated periods highlighting those regions where a traditional single peak representation could lead to inaccuracies in the representation of the actual sea state a qualitative analysis is then supported by some examples in which two different spectral models are compared in a number selected locations keywords wave climate swell wind sea multi peaked wave spectra 1 introduction the sea surface is the boundary layer between the air of the atmosphere and water and for this reason any perturbation of this boundary layer generates waves that due to the low viscosity of water can persist for long time even after the perturbation stops depending on the type of perturbation waves can be wind waves often simply called waves tides or tsunamis nevertheless the majority of the energy is carried out by wind waves which are also responsible except for rare events of most of the loads and motions to marine fixed or floating structures making their understanding and study of prime importance in ocean engineering for all design operation and maintenance problems of offshore and coastal structures design of such structures is then based on the estimated wave induced loads in frequency and directional domains requiring the knowledge or assessment of the energy balance of local wind waves and swells generated in different areas wind waves are generally far from being the regular stereotype of a wave especially when being generated by a local storm their irregularity in space and time can be better described as a stochastic process a thorough representation can be given by mean of the directional wave spectra that provide detailed information on the frequency and directional distribution of the wave energy content in practical applications however this kind of representation often results unpractical due to the large amount of data necessary especially when a large domain and a long period of time are involved in the analysis for this reason an effort has been done to summarise the most important information required in a limited number of parameters typically three responsible for representing respectively the energy content the frequency distribution and the mean direction such a representation can be considered adequate in most of the practical applications when the sea states are composed of one wave system only however this is often not the case after a storm the local waves called wind sea propagate away from their generation area traveling long distances across the globe barber and ursell 1948 munk et al 1963 snodgrass et al 1966 if an obstacle able to dissipate their energy is not encountered in this phase when their phase speed exceeds the local wind speed they are swell on its path a swell system can pass through areas where other storms are developing new wave systems or encounter other swells coming from different origins each of these wave system have his own spectrum and interacts with the others and with the local wind in a complex way that is still subject of studies in the wave modelling community babanin 2012 cavaleri et al 2007 zieger et al 2015 this complex combination may compromise the accuracy of such a simple parametric representation that eventually is insufficient to summarise the required information to deal with this issue a similar group of parameters can be given for any different wave system typically the wave spectrum is partitioned in two sectors the low frequency part for swell and the high frequency for wind sea guedes soares 1984 their probability of occurrence varies guedes soares 1991 lucas et al 2011 but is significant in general although more often than not a single peak representation is used for simplicity examples of the importance of adopting combined sea states spectra in practical applications for offshore and ship structural analysis can be found among the others in andersen et al 2008 lawford et al 2008 teixeira and guedes soares 2009 several wave climatology studies have been published e g barstow et al 1995 sterl and caires 2005 young 1999 but only few of them highlight the differences between the two wave regimes using different sources such as voluntary ship observations gulev and grigorieva 2006 remote sensing chen et al 2002 and numerical models semedo et al 2011 anoop et al 2015 and naseef and kumar 2019 in the present study a discussion on wind sea and swell climate as well as considerations on crossing seas resulting from the state of the art era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 is justified by the improvements in model and assimilation system including the new european remote sensing satellite altimeter wave heights of this product with respect to its predecessor era40 uppala et al 2005 a comparison between era40 and era interim as well as hipocas guedes soares 2008 can be found in campos and guedes soares 2016a b in section 2 the condition of combined sea state is introduced era interim reanalysis is described with focus on the spectral separation method and as well as the multi peaked spectral model adopted section 3 provides an overview on the global wave climate and discusses the variability of wind sea and swell in section 4 the contribution of the two spectral components is analysed detecting the areas where the influence of both regimes is more important in the composition of the sea state while the occurrences of crossing sea is studied in section 5 in section 6 some representative locations are taken into consideration to show the differences between a traditional single peak spectrum and a double peak model also considering directional representation conclusions and final remarks are presented in section 7 2 combined sea states a combined sea state refers to a condition in which two or more wave system of different nature are present in the same area guedes soares 1984 jeffreys 1926 1925 such a condition may arise from different circumstances in particular the cause is typically different between open oceans and marginal or constrained seas developing a mathematical model able to catch all these possibilities of combined sea states possibly described by a very limited number of parameters is a challenging task more often than not in practical applications unidirectional single peak models are adopted taking into account the overall energy content of the sea state through the significant wave height h s and the distribution in frequency through a representative wave period e g the peak period t p or the mean period t m thorough parametric representation of complex combinations of existing wind waves and swell in a given location requires a detailed analysis of the actual wave spectrum both in frequency and directional domain to identify the existing wave systems ewans et al 2006 boukhanovsky and guedes soares 2009 proposed a technique to fit a parametric spectral model to the actual spectra based on the analysis of the location of the peaks in frequency and direction it has been shown that limiting the wave system identification to the spectral domain as commonly done in the wave databases explained below in this section may lead to a misclassification of 30 80 of multipeaked spectra in this study the state of the art of the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf product era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 is used as it represents an improved characterization of the sea conditions over era40 which was used in a previous study by semedo et al 2011 it is a global atmospheric reanalysis from 1979 continuously updated in real time that includes besides atmospheric variables the wave parameters produced using the ecmwf integrated forecasting system the database consists of 6 hourly global fields with a 1 1 grid resolution for the wave parameters from 1979 to present only the period from 1979 to 2013 has been used in this work for the scope of this analysis an important feature of the era interim database is that separate spectral components parameters for wind sea still under the influence of local wind and the remaining called swell are provided from the 2d wave energy spectrum f f θ provided by the wam model for each grid point and time step as function of frequency f and direction θ the separation of the two component is done by detecting the frequency f ˆ that satisfy the equality 1 1 2 28 u c ˆ c o s θ φ 1 where u is the wind friction velocity holthuijsen 2007 c c f is the wave phase speed θ is the wave direction and φ is the wind direction as previously discussed this kind of classification may be not fully comprehensive nevertheless the need of having readily available global information on combined wave system for a long period of time in order to provide meaningful statistics and the difficulties in retrieving and analysing the large amount of data represented by full spectra obliged to accept the approach and its limitations for both components as well as for the total spectrum the mean parameters describing the wave energy content h s the mean wave energy period t m and the mean wave direction θ m the above described partition leads to the possibility to have a six parameters definition of each sea state whether the output parameters are the result of a combined sea state with double peak spectra and or crossing sea may be assessed considering the relation between the h s the distance of the peaks difference between the peak periods t p and the difference between the mean directions in lucas et al 2011 a classification of the sea states is proposed although the emphasis is in that case limited to characterizing the shape of the spectra and not its direction which implies that crossing seas are not explicitly considered in order to compare the traditional single peak representation of the wave spectra by only considering the h s t m parameters with a double peak model that takes into account wind sea and swell it is assumed that the non linear interaction between the two systems is negligible within this hypothesis the total directional wave spectrum s f θ can be expressed as the sum of the spectra of the interested wave systems as 2 s f θ s w f θ s s f θ s w f d w f θ s s f d s f θ where s w s f θ and s w s f are the directional and frequency spectra for wind sea and swell and d w s f θ are the directional dispersion functions of the two systems the most common representation of the frequency spectrum is by the jonswap model hasselmann et al 1973 which although derived from measurements in developing seas can find a justification in its narrowness to be applied also to swell in combined sea states guedes soares 1984 lucas and guedes soares 2015 the model proposed by guedes soares 1984 is here adopted based on the superposition of two jonswap frequency spectra represented as 3 s i f s p m f γ q where s p m is the pierson moskowitz spectrum in the formulation proposed by the issc hogben et al 1976 4 s p m f 0 11 h 2 t t f 5 e x p 0 44 t f 4 and q e x p 1 296 t f 1 2 2 σ 2 further details of the method and the parameters can be found in the reference here in fact the focus the comparison of the two representations which would not significantly differ if another model is adopted 3 overview on global wave climate as wind is the main responsible for the generation of ocean waves a discussion on wave fields cannot abstain from providing an overview of the most important wind climate features that ultimately cause waves fig 1 shows the seasonal averages of global wind speed u 10 and the corresponding mean directions ϕ as arrows for winter djf and summer jja the main characteristics are strong average wind in the extra tropical areas especially in winter for the northern hemisphere nh and in summer for the southern hemisphere sh although for the latter the seasonal differences are less marked tropics generally present milder conditions but the presence of intense regional features can be clearly detected especially in the indian ocean due to summer monsoons and somali wind jet anoop et al 2015 naseef and kumar 2019 in the northern hemisphere maxima can be found in winter in the north atlantic south of iceland and greenland between parallels 45n and 60n with average values of about 12 m s and prevalent east or northeast direction of a slightly lower extent are the averages in the northwest pacific but more southern around the 40th parallel north in a belt around the parallel 30n latitudes the global circulation generates the weakest winds with mean values between 4 5 m s and 6 5 m s south of these latitudes trade winds with speeds of about 8 m s and prevalent west or south west direction show much lower seasonality except for the western pacific where they drop to averages of 6 m s in summer a similar pattern characterises the southern hemisphere global circulation where due to the minor impact of continents an almost 360 belt of strong westerlies is observed between parallels 60s and 40s the maxima are in summer and in the southern indian ocean with average wind speeds exceeding 12 m s the most important difference is due to the monsoons generated in the indian ocean which cause the average wind speeds to increase significantly in summer around parallel 15s with mean values of about 10 m s and north west direction consequently also the northern portion namely the arabian sea somali jet determined by the combination of african orography and summer monsoon chakraborty et al 2009 and the bay of bengal are hit by strong north east winds with summer averages respectively exceeding 12 m s and of around 8 m s the wave field maps are provided in fig 2 similarly then for the wind seasonal average values and mean directions are provided distinguishing the total significant wave height h s the swell h s s and the wind sea h s w portions below parallel 65s values are not of interest due to the presence of ice that compromise the statistical significance of the results the global results appear consistent with a previous analysis performed with other databases semedo et al 2011 minor divergences can be identified when focusing on regional climates where mesoscale systems play an important role and the local bathymetry and topography near coast can significantly influence the outputs of the model these difference can be explained by the improved four dimensional variational data assimilation technique and the higher horizontal resolution of era interim dee et al 2011 with respect to era 40 the contribution of the wind sea and swell components to the total wave spectra can vary significantly depending on the season and the location as highlighted in fig 2 wind sea mean is generally lower than swell this can be explained considering that relatively strong winds blowing for a long enough period of time over a large sea surface are necessary produce and maintain wind generated waves however due to the low viscosity of water the attenuation rate is also low and waves propagate for long distances even when and where wind stops giving its contribution the strict relation between wind and wave field can be clearly seen especially when wind sea lower panels of fig 2 is considered as expected average directions of wind sea waves are everywhere well reproducing average wind directions with regard to the wave heights the overall maxima average exceeding 3m can be found in summer in the southern indian ocean which is due not only to the intensity of winds in that area but also to their persistency which contribute to increase the mean value of wind sea similarly high mean values are seen offshore the somali coast due to the presence of the strong somali jet except for the indian ocean averages are always lower than 1 2m 1 5m in some case on marginal seas between parallels 30n and 30s above parallel 30n seasonal influence is marked with means between 2 5m and 3m offshore in winter and around 1m or lower in summer swell intensity and directions central panels of fig 2 describe well the propagation of waves from higher latitude where extra tropical storms are generated towards lower latitudes where wind sea is in most of the cases nearly absent and following the mean wave direction on the generation areas the western coasts of europe and america for these reasons prevalent average directions are west at the higher latitudes and south north respectively in the northern southern hemispheres at the lower latitudes the nature of swell and the low attenuation rate of waves in open ocean makes it being relevant in a much greater area than wind sea excluding marginal seas where sheltering and dissipation play an important role and waves do not have enough space to propagate out or after a storm swell is determinant for the wave climate everywhere with average values of h s s higher than 3 5m in correspondence to the extra tropical storms areas but also in most of the open waters higher than 2m in winter and higher than 2 5m in almost all the sh in summer when in the nh averages rarely exceeds 1 5m all in all while the significance of wind sea to the total sea state energy h s in upper panels of fig 2 is largely marginal in some areas the contribution of swell is fundamental for the characterization of wave climate practically at any location besides studying their seasonal features a better awareness of the different impact of wind sea and swell on the local wave climate can arise from the analysis of short time variability the coefficient of variation cv namely the ratio between the standard deviations and the means is shown in fig 3 in the same scale both for swell left and wind sea right wave heights the former is close to zero almost everywhere giving a clear picture about the low variability of swell waves that hence are almost ever present in the ocean and open seas this is not the case for wind sea for which the cv is higher than unity almost everywhere except in correspondence to the constant trade winds mentioned above the cv also provides an indication on the significance of the mean values as descriptive of the expected wave conditions due to the low variability swell averages are more representative of the swell conditions that one can expect to encounter in a determined area for wind sea which is strictly correlated with the local wind the mean value may be insufficient to represent the actual climate these considerations can explain why global seas are swell dominated nevertheless this may not be the case in stormy conditions when wind sea waves can be comparable or higher than swell as a consequence as will be shown in section 6 single peak spectra can often represent well the sea states out of storms unless multiple swells are superposed whereas for developing seas the persistency of swells from previous storms is rather likely if the indication of the mean values of wave heights can result as scarcely connotative the average directions may be even more misleading to represent the real conditions at sea wind direction is seldom constant and although the irregularity is partially filtered by the time required to perturb the sea surface wind sea is directly affected by this instability on the other hand swell direction depends on the direction of the original waves but is also influenced by the location relative to the storm and diffraction effect even on large scale caused by land masses fig 4 shows the estimated standard deviation of swell and wind sea direction computed with the method of yamartino 1984 where the variability of wind sea direction right is generally very high except for those regions characterised by very stable winds such as the trade winds at the tropics and to a minor extent the westerlies in the southern indian ocean the direction of swell left tends to be much more constant but its pattern is completely different from the one of wind sea and characteristic of each hemisphere in the nh the eastern sides of the ocean basins are characterised by swell propagated far away from the extra tropical storms thus its direction is very stable different is the case for the western sides and the marginal seas where due to the limited fetch swell portion of the spectra often results from the drop of wind speed rather than by its propagation in the sh limited variation in the swell direction can be expected where exceptions are marginal seas around indonesian archipelago offshore argentinian coast and in a less pronounced form west of tasmania and new zealand for the reasons explained above finally in the central atlantic and pacific oceans the areas of high variability can be explained by the different propagation deepness of swell coming from the northern and southern extra tropical storms in different periods of the year the previous considerations are important when a decision on which kind of spectral model to adopt single or multiple peak if swell is due to a wind drop the separation frequency f ˆ that satisfies the condition of equation 1 will probably move from lower to higher frequencies while wind speed decreases thus partitioning a single peak spectrum in two portions that is swell and wind sea are in these cases correlated if swell derives from propagation instead when both the regimes identified by f ˆ frequency are significant in terms of energy content they probably describe two independent wave systems and a double peak model of the spectrum can be considered as more representative of the sea state 4 characterisation of spectral component contribution as shown in the previous section the relative contribution of swell and wind waves in the composition of the sea state that characterises a certain region vary significantly depending on the location analysed as well as the season the following analysis aims at determining when and where a traditional single wave system representation may be acceptable compared to the cases in which a more detailed awareness of the two wave regimes is recommendable in order to have a statistical evidence of the relative contribution of wind sea and swell the energy content must be analysed the energy e carried out by waves is proportional to its spectral zero moment m 0 thus the portion of energy carried by each of the component can be computed as the ratio between the relative zero moment and the total one e g the swell energy weight is given by w s e s e the swell energy weight has values between zero and one where zero correspond to the hypothetical case for which wind transfers energy to all wave frequencies and one indicates that the entire spectrum is characterised by swell from the previous considerations it is evident that w s can be used to detect stormy conditions when the influence of wind to the sea state cannot be neglected as those events in which w s is lower than a determined threshold fig 5 and fig 6 show the probability of swell energy weight to be lower than 50 and 90 of the total energy carried by waves in winter and summer respectively the upper panels of the two figures clearly show that the probability of w s to be lower than 50 is extremely low and practically zero in most of the cases meaning that swell always contributes for at least 50 of the energy content and demonstrates that oceans are highly swell dominated only exceptions to this rule are some marginal seas baltic sea southern north sea aegean sea south west caribbean sea of japan and east china sea in winter and arafura sea in summer and the somali coast in summer due to the already discussed somali jet different is the case if only 10 of wave energy carried by wind sea is considered sufficient to indicate a stormy condition panels b of figs 5 and 6 vast parts of the open oceans still indicate a low occurrence of these events but the contribution of wind sea appears significant in all the marginal seas along the trade winds on the western sides of the ocean basins in the nh as well as in the areas corresponding to the northern extratropical storms especially in winter and in the main belt of the southern westerlies all over the year as a consequence it can be stated that in the blue areas incidence of storms is always negligible and the wave spectrum can be considered with a good approximation only constituted by swell single peak spectrum except if different swell systems not detectable with the database used are present in contrast in the red the area both wind sea and swell are generally relevant and is higher the probability of missing information by considering the sea state as formed by a single wave system section 6 some practical example will be provided the previous findings demonstrating an evident time prevalence of swell over wind sea suggest to abandon the typical seasonal separation when dealing with double peaked spectra instead an independent analysis of stormy conditions wind affected can in this case unveil more significant information regarding the global wave climate with this goal the conditional averages have been computed for each grid point where the condition is the swell energy portion to be higher or lower the value of 90 as for instance for the significant wave height 5 e s t o r m y h s w s 0 9 e v e n t s w s 0 9 h s n e v e n t s w s 0 9 6 e s w e l l d o m i n a t e d h s w s 0 9 e v e n t s w s 0 9 h s n e v e n t s w s 0 9 the results of the previous equations for u 10 h s h s s and h s w and the respective directions are shown in fig 7 where the left side corresponds to stormy conditions w s 0 9 and the right side to the rest such averages are obviously unevenly distributed in time among the different grid points according to the occurrences depicted in the panels b of figs 5 and 6 as an example a point located on the gulf of guinea where the probability of w s to be lower than 0 9 is practically null almost all the available data contributes to the swell dominated averages while the average conditions in case of storm are estimated using very few data as expected stormy conditions left side correspond to much stronger winds able to transfer energy to a significant portion of wave frequency components nevertheless wind sea do not prevail over swell instead it is always lower by about one or more meters as a consequence h s is clearly the result of both contributions none of which can be neglected the right side panels on the contrary show a sort of background ocean weather that can be expected when no storms are present and over which wind sea components are overlapped indeed when looking at swell no significant differences may be noticed between the two cases except for a slight increase of its maximum in the southern indian ocean as a further confirmation of the regularity of swell climate moreover in this case the contribution of wind sea is obviously negligible and h s is almost a replication of h s s 5 probability of crossing seas another important aspect to characterise a sea state is its directionality typically wave height period and mean direction are considered and when a more reliable short crested wave systems representation is required a standard directional spreading function is typically used to include the dependency of the spectral energy to the direction θ nevertheless especially in the presence of both swell and wind sea this approach may be misleading if two different systems with a similar energetic contribution come from different directions the mean direction will not be representative for either one of the systems as a practical example if swell comes from north east and wind sea with similar intensity from south east the resulting mean direction will be approximately east but the impact of such a sea state for instance on a fixed marine structure or a ship navigating in that area can be significantly different in the two representations a similar approach to section 4 is adopted here in order to identify the areas where crossing seas may be expected with a certain frequency but excluding the cases when wind sea contribution can be reasonably neglected see lower right panel on fig 7 that is when w s 0 9 fig 8 shows the joint probability of swell energy portion to be lower than 0 9 and difference between swell and wind sea direction higher than 30 in winter and summer possible crossing seas due to different swell systems are excluded from the analysis the probability of crossing seas settles around values of 50 on the extratropical areas with higher occurrences in winter for the nh and in summer for the sh when storms are more frequent slightly increasing on the west sides of the oceans in the nh east north america and japan in winter due to the lower contribution of swell higher probability can be found in the areas interested by trade winds due to the complex interaction of swells generated by the extra tropical storms such as the central indian ocean naseef and kumar 2019 a wide area in the pacific ocean between the hawaii and the central america western north africa coastal low level jets are also responsible for generating local waves which direction is different from the relevant swell direction significantly increasing the probability of crossing seas in a wider or more limited area depending on the location the most evident example of such phenomenon is offshore the somali coast where crossing sea is nearly always expectable in summer but more local effect can be seen also along the west coasts of california morocco and iberian peninsula in summer and the west coasts of chile south africa namibia and australia in winter coastal areas and marginal seas are in general more affected by crossing seas with probabilities often being around 60 this is due to the influence of regional circulations interacting with waves generated offshore to diffraction or refraction phenomena and environments characterised by particular topography or local winds these cases should be investigated with finer wave model grids when a more detailed analysis is required 6 differences between single and double peak modelling taking into account the previous considerations six locations has been selected as representative to analyse the differences between a traditional single peak representation of the wave spectra and a double peak model caribbean sea gulf of guinea central indian ocean us north east coast somali coast campos basin brazilian coast and north sea tables 1 and 2 summarise the mean wave climate in the analysed locations in stormy and moderate scenarios respectively as defined in section 4 and represented in fig 7 table 2 gives a further evidence of the marginal importance of wind sea when swell energy portion is predominant in table 1 it can be noticed that in the first two locations the caribbean sea and the gulf of guinea wind sea and swell are almost aligned and swell is prevalent also in the central indian ocean and in the east coast of the us h s s have higher or similar intensity then h s w but mean directions diverges for 57 and 47 respectively the somali coast represent a particular case where the storms are driven by a strong wind jet ranjha et al 2013 leading to wind sea and swell systems of similar intensity but substantial different directions being the former aligned with the shore while the latter coming from the central indian ocean brazilian coast wave climate is known for being characterised by a combination of wave systems from different directions especially in campos basin see fig 8a a strategic area in terms of oil and gas exploration campos and guedes soares 2016c campos et al 2019 the southern north sea is also characteristic in fact being partially protected by the british isles from the north atlantic storms experiences a swell that enters from the northern bound of the north sea but that results lower than the eastwards locally generated waves the model described in section 2 equations 2 4 have been adopted in the following to evaluate the effects of considering a single or double peak representation of the spectra different models could lead to slightly different results but do not change the qualitative meaning of the comparisons in fig 9 the two representations of the wave spectra are applied to the first two locations characterised by comparable conditions for swell dominated left and stormy conditions right once more the adequacy of a single wave system representation for swell dominated conditions is confirmed with the two spectra that almost coincide on the opposite when wind sea gains strength the spectral information provided by a traditional single peak representation starts being distorted in the case of the gulf of guinea lower right panel where the differences both in significant wave heights and periods between the two systems are greater the single peak model approximates the swell but completely neglects the wind sea contribution in the case of the caribbean sea upper right both the peaks are underestimated by a factor of 2 and 3 respectively when the single peak model is adopted this inability of correctly representing the peaks may be determinant especially when structural responses or motion of floating structures are computed which are often highly dominated by the effect of peaks either in the wave spectrum or in the transfer function rather than their tails however the two locations previously analysed may be ambiguous the separation method described in section 2 does not in fact guarantee that the two components effectively correspond to two different wave systems if the wind blows for a certain period on a sea surface and then partially drops down it can become slower than part of the just generated wave system the lower frequency portion that as a consequence falls into the definition of swell the same can happen when the system moves to a zone with milder wind conditions although this separation method is perfectly meaningful from the meteorological point of view it can be misleading when the parametric representations of the partitioned sea states are used for instance to compute wave loads differently in the case of the other considered locations the significant difference between θ m s and θ m w clearly denotes the presence of two separate systems in order to adequately represent this difference a directional spectral model has to be adopted this is done by adapting the previous model to a directional representation as suggested in lucas et al 2011 for the approximation of the directional spreading function the well established power cosine form longuet higgins et al 1963 mitsuyasu et al 1975 is accepted 7 q f θ c s c o s 2 s f θ θ m w i t h θ θ m π 2 where s f is a parameter that controls the level of directional spreading in this case it has been taken s f 2 for wind sea and s f 4 for swell and c s is a normalisation factor that for constant s f can be computed by means of the gamma function γ as 8 c s 2 2 s 1 γ s 1 γ s πγ 2 s in fig 10 the mean stormy conditions in the central indian ocean are represented the left panel where the same concepts as in fig 9 are adopted shows a similar shape as for the upper right panel of the previous figure although shifted to lower frequencies and higher energy a critical difference can be noticed by comparing the directional spectra in the central and the left panels the swell system coming from the southern westerlies 177 and the wind sea system generated by the indian cyclone coming in this location from east south east 120 are roughly summarised in a more intense system coming from south south east 160 and a quite high peak period as a practical example of the consequences of this approximation one may consider a ship heading south in this location during a storm assuming the first representation intense pitch and heave could be expected but the direction could anyway be considered among the most favourable options if the two separate systems are represented instead a significant component of beam sea with relatively low period would probably cause a critical roll motion and force to change course the previous example can be exceptionally important in the route selection process but the consequences can be notable also in other practical applications the north east coast of the usa also presents a particular crossing sea conditions as shown in fig 11 due to the tendency of waves to propagate eastwards in this eastern coast swell is not as strong as on the european side of the north atlantic and mostly aligns with the coast in a south west to north east directions on the contrary especially in winter this area is subjected to strong wind from the shore able to generate intense local storms this combination of wave systems of similar magnitude with different directions may partially explain the general overestimation in this area of wave height from visual observations from ships as pointed in vettor and guedes soares 2016 the somali coast as already mentioned is characterised by a peculiar wave regime caused by the presence of a strong wind jet that can cause heavy wind sea waves from the spectral point of view this condition is shown in fig 12 on the right panel most faithful representation is provided with an important wind sea aligned with the shore in the south west to north east direction coupled with a swell coming from the central indian ocean the wind sea contribution and especially its direction seems to be hidden in the single peak directional spectrum shown on the central panel clearly limiting the awareness of an important feature to understand the wave climate in that area the situation in the campos basin fig 13 offshore the brazilian coast presents some similarities with the somali coast also in this case the swell components deriving from the propagation of waves from the southern extratropical region are almost perpendicular to the coast while the wind sea is aligned with it in the north east to south west direction opposite of the previous location this combination creates again a stormy wave climate characterised by two systems at about 90 degrees of difference making the overall integral parameters h s t p and θ m clearly insufficient for a meaningful representation of the actual wave conditions finally the north sea condition is analysed in fig 14 the particularity is in this case that the peak of wind sea is higher than the one of swell for the first time among the considered location this kind of frequency distribution of the wave energy can be often expected in the marginal seas characterised by a limited fetch where swell component is mostly due to the drop of the local wind that becomes slower than the locally generated waves or from the often obstructed incursion of swell from the open oceans as in the case of the north sea for waves coming from the northern isles of scotland as shown in the several examples above a single peak representation of the wave spectra generally leads to an overestimation of the spectral energy in the central range of the frequency that can vary depending on the location and the actual conditions and an underestimation of the peaks relative to the components of wind sea and swell often more pronounced for wind sea due to the tendency of the global modal frequency to be closer to the swell peak frequency in these cases a double peak representation guedes soares 1984 seems more appropriate similar conclusions have been found by analysing single storms not shown here when analysing wave loads these differences may be critical due to the importance of peaks both in the wave spectra and in the transfer functions for a correct overall estimation of the total loads where crossing sea are expected with a certain frequency also wave direction can become an issue when the sea state is summarised as composed by a single wave system the actual directions of waves can result very different from those indicated by the average value neglecting this factor can be dangerous for instance when ship motions are assessed for instance a low period beam wave system even if could appear as less important compared to the main swell component can cause excessive roll and unsafe operations it must although be considered that as shown in spentza et al 2017 for the case of ship motions adopting a parametric double peak spectral model representation does not always lead to more accurate results the reason can be found on the fact that only parameters describing the energy content and the frequency of the peak for each spectral component are available whereas the information regarding the actual energy distribution in frequency and direction is missing in order to supply these lack of knowledge one has to assume standard values for the peak enhancement and directional spreading function which generally derive from the statistical analysis of measured spectra and fitting to single peak models thus not directly applying to double peak representations further investigations are then needed to provide spectral models that better fit to the actual energy distribution characteristic of each location 7 conclusions a brief analysis of the global distribution of wind sea and swell has been provided by analysing the era interim database in the period from 1979 to 2013 as is common practice the mean values of the respective wave heights and directions are considered and the results are coherent with previous findings that can be found in literature from the analysis of different sources nevertheless a look at the variability of both magnitude and direction showed that the mean values are in most cases a simple statistical parameter not representatives of the conditions that one can expect to experience this is even more the case for wind sea height and in the higher latitudes and marginal seas wave direction while swell is characterised by a particularly constant behaviour except for its directionality in some specific regions the study of the energy contribution of the two spectral components revealed that the occurrence of swell dominated sea states is extremely high in particular the cases in which energy carried by wind sea is higher than the one carried by swell are practically absent if not in very peculiar region due to wind jets or very short fetches moreover it has been found that when the wind sea energy contribution is lower than about 10 one does not incur in significant errors by neglecting it and using the traditional single peak representation differently when its contribution is higher misleading information should be expected if an appropriate multi peak spectral model is not considered it must be noted that the scheme adopted for the separation of the two spectral components although perfectly justified from the meteorological point of view does not necessary imply the presence of double peak spectra and may be misleading when the parametric representations of the partitioned sea states are analysed and these data are used for instance to compute wave loads this is not expected to be an issue when wind sea and swell components come from rather different directions in which case the presence of two different systems is certain however it is worth to investigate the differences between this spectral separation scheme and a separation aimed at identifying multi peaked spectra especially for wave load assessment the analysis and comparison of wave spectra of a number for selected locations considering both a traditional representation that summarises the sea state in a single set of integral parameters and a double peak representation that uses all the information about the two wave components helped to better understand the effect of the two approaches and estimate the loss of information and awareness of the actual sea condition when the traditional approach is adopted in highly swell dominated sea states the traditional approach appeared adequate in fact the two representations are almost identical however when wind sea component grows in most of the cases swell still plays an important role while the total energy content being a zero moment is well represented by the sum of the two this is not the case for its distribution in frequency and direction the peak frequency tends in general to be closer to the swell peak causing a pronounced underestimation of the wind sea peak while the direction results as a weighted average between the mean directions of the two components ending not being representative for neither of the two these differences and loss of information can have significant effects when the wave data are used in real cases for instance in engineering for the assessment of wave loads on marine structures or ship motions and are worth to be further investigated credit authorship contribution statement

21749,the paper aims at providing a global view of the wave climate with specific focus on separation of the wave components and the analysis of crossing seas the knowledge about complex sea states may in fact have a great influence in the prediction of ship responses the occurrence of bimodal wave spectra is assessed by analysing the era interim wave database and in particular the parameters describing the different spectral components for wind sea and swell a brief description of the global wave climate is provided with a discussion on the significance of the average conditions as representative for the actual scenarios that can be expected and the consistency of the results with previous studies is verified the contribution of the two regimes in different areas is then investigated as well as the probability of crossing seas separating the stormy conditions by the highly swell dominated periods highlighting those regions where a traditional single peak representation could lead to inaccuracies in the representation of the actual sea state a qualitative analysis is then supported by some examples in which two different spectral models are compared in a number selected locations keywords wave climate swell wind sea multi peaked wave spectra 1 introduction the sea surface is the boundary layer between the air of the atmosphere and water and for this reason any perturbation of this boundary layer generates waves that due to the low viscosity of water can persist for long time even after the perturbation stops depending on the type of perturbation waves can be wind waves often simply called waves tides or tsunamis nevertheless the majority of the energy is carried out by wind waves which are also responsible except for rare events of most of the loads and motions to marine fixed or floating structures making their understanding and study of prime importance in ocean engineering for all design operation and maintenance problems of offshore and coastal structures design of such structures is then based on the estimated wave induced loads in frequency and directional domains requiring the knowledge or assessment of the energy balance of local wind waves and swells generated in different areas wind waves are generally far from being the regular stereotype of a wave especially when being generated by a local storm their irregularity in space and time can be better described as a stochastic process a thorough representation can be given by mean of the directional wave spectra that provide detailed information on the frequency and directional distribution of the wave energy content in practical applications however this kind of representation often results unpractical due to the large amount of data necessary especially when a large domain and a long period of time are involved in the analysis for this reason an effort has been done to summarise the most important information required in a limited number of parameters typically three responsible for representing respectively the energy content the frequency distribution and the mean direction such a representation can be considered adequate in most of the practical applications when the sea states are composed of one wave system only however this is often not the case after a storm the local waves called wind sea propagate away from their generation area traveling long distances across the globe barber and ursell 1948 munk et al 1963 snodgrass et al 1966 if an obstacle able to dissipate their energy is not encountered in this phase when their phase speed exceeds the local wind speed they are swell on its path a swell system can pass through areas where other storms are developing new wave systems or encounter other swells coming from different origins each of these wave system have his own spectrum and interacts with the others and with the local wind in a complex way that is still subject of studies in the wave modelling community babanin 2012 cavaleri et al 2007 zieger et al 2015 this complex combination may compromise the accuracy of such a simple parametric representation that eventually is insufficient to summarise the required information to deal with this issue a similar group of parameters can be given for any different wave system typically the wave spectrum is partitioned in two sectors the low frequency part for swell and the high frequency for wind sea guedes soares 1984 their probability of occurrence varies guedes soares 1991 lucas et al 2011 but is significant in general although more often than not a single peak representation is used for simplicity examples of the importance of adopting combined sea states spectra in practical applications for offshore and ship structural analysis can be found among the others in andersen et al 2008 lawford et al 2008 teixeira and guedes soares 2009 several wave climatology studies have been published e g barstow et al 1995 sterl and caires 2005 young 1999 but only few of them highlight the differences between the two wave regimes using different sources such as voluntary ship observations gulev and grigorieva 2006 remote sensing chen et al 2002 and numerical models semedo et al 2011 anoop et al 2015 and naseef and kumar 2019 in the present study a discussion on wind sea and swell climate as well as considerations on crossing seas resulting from the state of the art era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 is justified by the improvements in model and assimilation system including the new european remote sensing satellite altimeter wave heights of this product with respect to its predecessor era40 uppala et al 2005 a comparison between era40 and era interim as well as hipocas guedes soares 2008 can be found in campos and guedes soares 2016a b in section 2 the condition of combined sea state is introduced era interim reanalysis is described with focus on the spectral separation method and as well as the multi peaked spectral model adopted section 3 provides an overview on the global wave climate and discusses the variability of wind sea and swell in section 4 the contribution of the two spectral components is analysed detecting the areas where the influence of both regimes is more important in the composition of the sea state while the occurrences of crossing sea is studied in section 5 in section 6 some representative locations are taken into consideration to show the differences between a traditional single peak spectrum and a double peak model also considering directional representation conclusions and final remarks are presented in section 7 2 combined sea states a combined sea state refers to a condition in which two or more wave system of different nature are present in the same area guedes soares 1984 jeffreys 1926 1925 such a condition may arise from different circumstances in particular the cause is typically different between open oceans and marginal or constrained seas developing a mathematical model able to catch all these possibilities of combined sea states possibly described by a very limited number of parameters is a challenging task more often than not in practical applications unidirectional single peak models are adopted taking into account the overall energy content of the sea state through the significant wave height h s and the distribution in frequency through a representative wave period e g the peak period t p or the mean period t m thorough parametric representation of complex combinations of existing wind waves and swell in a given location requires a detailed analysis of the actual wave spectrum both in frequency and directional domain to identify the existing wave systems ewans et al 2006 boukhanovsky and guedes soares 2009 proposed a technique to fit a parametric spectral model to the actual spectra based on the analysis of the location of the peaks in frequency and direction it has been shown that limiting the wave system identification to the spectral domain as commonly done in the wave databases explained below in this section may lead to a misclassification of 30 80 of multipeaked spectra in this study the state of the art of the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf product era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 is used as it represents an improved characterization of the sea conditions over era40 which was used in a previous study by semedo et al 2011 it is a global atmospheric reanalysis from 1979 continuously updated in real time that includes besides atmospheric variables the wave parameters produced using the ecmwf integrated forecasting system the database consists of 6 hourly global fields with a 1 1 grid resolution for the wave parameters from 1979 to present only the period from 1979 to 2013 has been used in this work for the scope of this analysis an important feature of the era interim database is that separate spectral components parameters for wind sea still under the influence of local wind and the remaining called swell are provided from the 2d wave energy spectrum f f θ provided by the wam model for each grid point and time step as function of frequency f and direction θ the separation of the two component is done by detecting the frequency f ˆ that satisfy the equality 1 1 2 28 u c ˆ c o s θ φ 1 where u is the wind friction velocity holthuijsen 2007 c c f is the wave phase speed θ is the wave direction and φ is the wind direction as previously discussed this kind of classification may be not fully comprehensive nevertheless the need of having readily available global information on combined wave system for a long period of time in order to provide meaningful statistics and the difficulties in retrieving and analysing the large amount of data represented by full spectra obliged to accept the approach and its limitations for both components as well as for the total spectrum the mean parameters describing the wave energy content h s the mean wave energy period t m and the mean wave direction θ m the above described partition leads to the possibility to have a six parameters definition of each sea state whether the output parameters are the result of a combined sea state with double peak spectra and or crossing sea may be assessed considering the relation between the h s the distance of the peaks difference between the peak periods t p and the difference between the mean directions in lucas et al 2011 a classification of the sea states is proposed although the emphasis is in that case limited to characterizing the shape of the spectra and not its direction which implies that crossing seas are not explicitly considered in order to compare the traditional single peak representation of the wave spectra by only considering the h s t m parameters with a double peak model that takes into account wind sea and swell it is assumed that the non linear interaction between the two systems is negligible within this hypothesis the total directional wave spectrum s f θ can be expressed as the sum of the spectra of the interested wave systems as 2 s f θ s w f θ s s f θ s w f d w f θ s s f d s f θ where s w s f θ and s w s f are the directional and frequency spectra for wind sea and swell and d w s f θ are the directional dispersion functions of the two systems the most common representation of the frequency spectrum is by the jonswap model hasselmann et al 1973 which although derived from measurements in developing seas can find a justification in its narrowness to be applied also to swell in combined sea states guedes soares 1984 lucas and guedes soares 2015 the model proposed by guedes soares 1984 is here adopted based on the superposition of two jonswap frequency spectra represented as 3 s i f s p m f γ q where s p m is the pierson moskowitz spectrum in the formulation proposed by the issc hogben et al 1976 4 s p m f 0 11 h 2 t t f 5 e x p 0 44 t f 4 and q e x p 1 296 t f 1 2 2 σ 2 further details of the method and the parameters can be found in the reference here in fact the focus the comparison of the two representations which would not significantly differ if another model is adopted 3 overview on global wave climate as wind is the main responsible for the generation of ocean waves a discussion on wave fields cannot abstain from providing an overview of the most important wind climate features that ultimately cause waves fig 1 shows the seasonal averages of global wind speed u 10 and the corresponding mean directions ϕ as arrows for winter djf and summer jja the main characteristics are strong average wind in the extra tropical areas especially in winter for the northern hemisphere nh and in summer for the southern hemisphere sh although for the latter the seasonal differences are less marked tropics generally present milder conditions but the presence of intense regional features can be clearly detected especially in the indian ocean due to summer monsoons and somali wind jet anoop et al 2015 naseef and kumar 2019 in the northern hemisphere maxima can be found in winter in the north atlantic south of iceland and greenland between parallels 45n and 60n with average values of about 12 m s and prevalent east or northeast direction of a slightly lower extent are the averages in the northwest pacific but more southern around the 40th parallel north in a belt around the parallel 30n latitudes the global circulation generates the weakest winds with mean values between 4 5 m s and 6 5 m s south of these latitudes trade winds with speeds of about 8 m s and prevalent west or south west direction show much lower seasonality except for the western pacific where they drop to averages of 6 m s in summer a similar pattern characterises the southern hemisphere global circulation where due to the minor impact of continents an almost 360 belt of strong westerlies is observed between parallels 60s and 40s the maxima are in summer and in the southern indian ocean with average wind speeds exceeding 12 m s the most important difference is due to the monsoons generated in the indian ocean which cause the average wind speeds to increase significantly in summer around parallel 15s with mean values of about 10 m s and north west direction consequently also the northern portion namely the arabian sea somali jet determined by the combination of african orography and summer monsoon chakraborty et al 2009 and the bay of bengal are hit by strong north east winds with summer averages respectively exceeding 12 m s and of around 8 m s the wave field maps are provided in fig 2 similarly then for the wind seasonal average values and mean directions are provided distinguishing the total significant wave height h s the swell h s s and the wind sea h s w portions below parallel 65s values are not of interest due to the presence of ice that compromise the statistical significance of the results the global results appear consistent with a previous analysis performed with other databases semedo et al 2011 minor divergences can be identified when focusing on regional climates where mesoscale systems play an important role and the local bathymetry and topography near coast can significantly influence the outputs of the model these difference can be explained by the improved four dimensional variational data assimilation technique and the higher horizontal resolution of era interim dee et al 2011 with respect to era 40 the contribution of the wind sea and swell components to the total wave spectra can vary significantly depending on the season and the location as highlighted in fig 2 wind sea mean is generally lower than swell this can be explained considering that relatively strong winds blowing for a long enough period of time over a large sea surface are necessary produce and maintain wind generated waves however due to the low viscosity of water the attenuation rate is also low and waves propagate for long distances even when and where wind stops giving its contribution the strict relation between wind and wave field can be clearly seen especially when wind sea lower panels of fig 2 is considered as expected average directions of wind sea waves are everywhere well reproducing average wind directions with regard to the wave heights the overall maxima average exceeding 3m can be found in summer in the southern indian ocean which is due not only to the intensity of winds in that area but also to their persistency which contribute to increase the mean value of wind sea similarly high mean values are seen offshore the somali coast due to the presence of the strong somali jet except for the indian ocean averages are always lower than 1 2m 1 5m in some case on marginal seas between parallels 30n and 30s above parallel 30n seasonal influence is marked with means between 2 5m and 3m offshore in winter and around 1m or lower in summer swell intensity and directions central panels of fig 2 describe well the propagation of waves from higher latitude where extra tropical storms are generated towards lower latitudes where wind sea is in most of the cases nearly absent and following the mean wave direction on the generation areas the western coasts of europe and america for these reasons prevalent average directions are west at the higher latitudes and south north respectively in the northern southern hemispheres at the lower latitudes the nature of swell and the low attenuation rate of waves in open ocean makes it being relevant in a much greater area than wind sea excluding marginal seas where sheltering and dissipation play an important role and waves do not have enough space to propagate out or after a storm swell is determinant for the wave climate everywhere with average values of h s s higher than 3 5m in correspondence to the extra tropical storms areas but also in most of the open waters higher than 2m in winter and higher than 2 5m in almost all the sh in summer when in the nh averages rarely exceeds 1 5m all in all while the significance of wind sea to the total sea state energy h s in upper panels of fig 2 is largely marginal in some areas the contribution of swell is fundamental for the characterization of wave climate practically at any location besides studying their seasonal features a better awareness of the different impact of wind sea and swell on the local wave climate can arise from the analysis of short time variability the coefficient of variation cv namely the ratio between the standard deviations and the means is shown in fig 3 in the same scale both for swell left and wind sea right wave heights the former is close to zero almost everywhere giving a clear picture about the low variability of swell waves that hence are almost ever present in the ocean and open seas this is not the case for wind sea for which the cv is higher than unity almost everywhere except in correspondence to the constant trade winds mentioned above the cv also provides an indication on the significance of the mean values as descriptive of the expected wave conditions due to the low variability swell averages are more representative of the swell conditions that one can expect to encounter in a determined area for wind sea which is strictly correlated with the local wind the mean value may be insufficient to represent the actual climate these considerations can explain why global seas are swell dominated nevertheless this may not be the case in stormy conditions when wind sea waves can be comparable or higher than swell as a consequence as will be shown in section 6 single peak spectra can often represent well the sea states out of storms unless multiple swells are superposed whereas for developing seas the persistency of swells from previous storms is rather likely if the indication of the mean values of wave heights can result as scarcely connotative the average directions may be even more misleading to represent the real conditions at sea wind direction is seldom constant and although the irregularity is partially filtered by the time required to perturb the sea surface wind sea is directly affected by this instability on the other hand swell direction depends on the direction of the original waves but is also influenced by the location relative to the storm and diffraction effect even on large scale caused by land masses fig 4 shows the estimated standard deviation of swell and wind sea direction computed with the method of yamartino 1984 where the variability of wind sea direction right is generally very high except for those regions characterised by very stable winds such as the trade winds at the tropics and to a minor extent the westerlies in the southern indian ocean the direction of swell left tends to be much more constant but its pattern is completely different from the one of wind sea and characteristic of each hemisphere in the nh the eastern sides of the ocean basins are characterised by swell propagated far away from the extra tropical storms thus its direction is very stable different is the case for the western sides and the marginal seas where due to the limited fetch swell portion of the spectra often results from the drop of wind speed rather than by its propagation in the sh limited variation in the swell direction can be expected where exceptions are marginal seas around indonesian archipelago offshore argentinian coast and in a less pronounced form west of tasmania and new zealand for the reasons explained above finally in the central atlantic and pacific oceans the areas of high variability can be explained by the different propagation deepness of swell coming from the northern and southern extra tropical storms in different periods of the year the previous considerations are important when a decision on which kind of spectral model to adopt single or multiple peak if swell is due to a wind drop the separation frequency f ˆ that satisfies the condition of equation 1 will probably move from lower to higher frequencies while wind speed decreases thus partitioning a single peak spectrum in two portions that is swell and wind sea are in these cases correlated if swell derives from propagation instead when both the regimes identified by f ˆ frequency are significant in terms of energy content they probably describe two independent wave systems and a double peak model of the spectrum can be considered as more representative of the sea state 4 characterisation of spectral component contribution as shown in the previous section the relative contribution of swell and wind waves in the composition of the sea state that characterises a certain region vary significantly depending on the location analysed as well as the season the following analysis aims at determining when and where a traditional single wave system representation may be acceptable compared to the cases in which a more detailed awareness of the two wave regimes is recommendable in order to have a statistical evidence of the relative contribution of wind sea and swell the energy content must be analysed the energy e carried out by waves is proportional to its spectral zero moment m 0 thus the portion of energy carried by each of the component can be computed as the ratio between the relative zero moment and the total one e g the swell energy weight is given by w s e s e the swell energy weight has values between zero and one where zero correspond to the hypothetical case for which wind transfers energy to all wave frequencies and one indicates that the entire spectrum is characterised by swell from the previous considerations it is evident that w s can be used to detect stormy conditions when the influence of wind to the sea state cannot be neglected as those events in which w s is lower than a determined threshold fig 5 and fig 6 show the probability of swell energy weight to be lower than 50 and 90 of the total energy carried by waves in winter and summer respectively the upper panels of the two figures clearly show that the probability of w s to be lower than 50 is extremely low and practically zero in most of the cases meaning that swell always contributes for at least 50 of the energy content and demonstrates that oceans are highly swell dominated only exceptions to this rule are some marginal seas baltic sea southern north sea aegean sea south west caribbean sea of japan and east china sea in winter and arafura sea in summer and the somali coast in summer due to the already discussed somali jet different is the case if only 10 of wave energy carried by wind sea is considered sufficient to indicate a stormy condition panels b of figs 5 and 6 vast parts of the open oceans still indicate a low occurrence of these events but the contribution of wind sea appears significant in all the marginal seas along the trade winds on the western sides of the ocean basins in the nh as well as in the areas corresponding to the northern extratropical storms especially in winter and in the main belt of the southern westerlies all over the year as a consequence it can be stated that in the blue areas incidence of storms is always negligible and the wave spectrum can be considered with a good approximation only constituted by swell single peak spectrum except if different swell systems not detectable with the database used are present in contrast in the red the area both wind sea and swell are generally relevant and is higher the probability of missing information by considering the sea state as formed by a single wave system section 6 some practical example will be provided the previous findings demonstrating an evident time prevalence of swell over wind sea suggest to abandon the typical seasonal separation when dealing with double peaked spectra instead an independent analysis of stormy conditions wind affected can in this case unveil more significant information regarding the global wave climate with this goal the conditional averages have been computed for each grid point where the condition is the swell energy portion to be higher or lower the value of 90 as for instance for the significant wave height 5 e s t o r m y h s w s 0 9 e v e n t s w s 0 9 h s n e v e n t s w s 0 9 6 e s w e l l d o m i n a t e d h s w s 0 9 e v e n t s w s 0 9 h s n e v e n t s w s 0 9 the results of the previous equations for u 10 h s h s s and h s w and the respective directions are shown in fig 7 where the left side corresponds to stormy conditions w s 0 9 and the right side to the rest such averages are obviously unevenly distributed in time among the different grid points according to the occurrences depicted in the panels b of figs 5 and 6 as an example a point located on the gulf of guinea where the probability of w s to be lower than 0 9 is practically null almost all the available data contributes to the swell dominated averages while the average conditions in case of storm are estimated using very few data as expected stormy conditions left side correspond to much stronger winds able to transfer energy to a significant portion of wave frequency components nevertheless wind sea do not prevail over swell instead it is always lower by about one or more meters as a consequence h s is clearly the result of both contributions none of which can be neglected the right side panels on the contrary show a sort of background ocean weather that can be expected when no storms are present and over which wind sea components are overlapped indeed when looking at swell no significant differences may be noticed between the two cases except for a slight increase of its maximum in the southern indian ocean as a further confirmation of the regularity of swell climate moreover in this case the contribution of wind sea is obviously negligible and h s is almost a replication of h s s 5 probability of crossing seas another important aspect to characterise a sea state is its directionality typically wave height period and mean direction are considered and when a more reliable short crested wave systems representation is required a standard directional spreading function is typically used to include the dependency of the spectral energy to the direction θ nevertheless especially in the presence of both swell and wind sea this approach may be misleading if two different systems with a similar energetic contribution come from different directions the mean direction will not be representative for either one of the systems as a practical example if swell comes from north east and wind sea with similar intensity from south east the resulting mean direction will be approximately east but the impact of such a sea state for instance on a fixed marine structure or a ship navigating in that area can be significantly different in the two representations a similar approach to section 4 is adopted here in order to identify the areas where crossing seas may be expected with a certain frequency but excluding the cases when wind sea contribution can be reasonably neglected see lower right panel on fig 7 that is when w s 0 9 fig 8 shows the joint probability of swell energy portion to be lower than 0 9 and difference between swell and wind sea direction higher than 30 in winter and summer possible crossing seas due to different swell systems are excluded from the analysis the probability of crossing seas settles around values of 50 on the extratropical areas with higher occurrences in winter for the nh and in summer for the sh when storms are more frequent slightly increasing on the west sides of the oceans in the nh east north america and japan in winter due to the lower contribution of swell higher probability can be found in the areas interested by trade winds due to the complex interaction of swells generated by the extra tropical storms such as the central indian ocean naseef and kumar 2019 a wide area in the pacific ocean between the hawaii and the central america western north africa coastal low level jets are also responsible for generating local waves which direction is different from the relevant swell direction significantly increasing the probability of crossing seas in a wider or more limited area depending on the location the most evident example of such phenomenon is offshore the somali coast where crossing sea is nearly always expectable in summer but more local effect can be seen also along the west coasts of california morocco and iberian peninsula in summer and the west coasts of chile south africa namibia and australia in winter coastal areas and marginal seas are in general more affected by crossing seas with probabilities often being around 60 this is due to the influence of regional circulations interacting with waves generated offshore to diffraction or refraction phenomena and environments characterised by particular topography or local winds these cases should be investigated with finer wave model grids when a more detailed analysis is required 6 differences between single and double peak modelling taking into account the previous considerations six locations has been selected as representative to analyse the differences between a traditional single peak representation of the wave spectra and a double peak model caribbean sea gulf of guinea central indian ocean us north east coast somali coast campos basin brazilian coast and north sea tables 1 and 2 summarise the mean wave climate in the analysed locations in stormy and moderate scenarios respectively as defined in section 4 and represented in fig 7 table 2 gives a further evidence of the marginal importance of wind sea when swell energy portion is predominant in table 1 it can be noticed that in the first two locations the caribbean sea and the gulf of guinea wind sea and swell are almost aligned and swell is prevalent also in the central indian ocean and in the east coast of the us h s s have higher or similar intensity then h s w but mean directions diverges for 57 and 47 respectively the somali coast represent a particular case where the storms are driven by a strong wind jet ranjha et al 2013 leading to wind sea and swell systems of similar intensity but substantial different directions being the former aligned with the shore while the latter coming from the central indian ocean brazilian coast wave climate is known for being characterised by a combination of wave systems from different directions especially in campos basin see fig 8a a strategic area in terms of oil and gas exploration campos and guedes soares 2016c campos et al 2019 the southern north sea is also characteristic in fact being partially protected by the british isles from the north atlantic storms experiences a swell that enters from the northern bound of the north sea but that results lower than the eastwards locally generated waves the model described in section 2 equations 2 4 have been adopted in the following to evaluate the effects of considering a single or double peak representation of the spectra different models could lead to slightly different results but do not change the qualitative meaning of the comparisons in fig 9 the two representations of the wave spectra are applied to the first two locations characterised by comparable conditions for swell dominated left and stormy conditions right once more the adequacy of a single wave system representation for swell dominated conditions is confirmed with the two spectra that almost coincide on the opposite when wind sea gains strength the spectral information provided by a traditional single peak representation starts being distorted in the case of the gulf of guinea lower right panel where the differences both in significant wave heights and periods between the two systems are greater the single peak model approximates the swell but completely neglects the wind sea contribution in the case of the caribbean sea upper right both the peaks are underestimated by a factor of 2 and 3 respectively when the single peak model is adopted this inability of correctly representing the peaks may be determinant especially when structural responses or motion of floating structures are computed which are often highly dominated by the effect of peaks either in the wave spectrum or in the transfer function rather than their tails however the two locations previously analysed may be ambiguous the separation method described in section 2 does not in fact guarantee that the two components effectively correspond to two different wave systems if the wind blows for a certain period on a sea surface and then partially drops down it can become slower than part of the just generated wave system the lower frequency portion that as a consequence falls into the definition of swell the same can happen when the system moves to a zone with milder wind conditions although this separation method is perfectly meaningful from the meteorological point of view it can be misleading when the parametric representations of the partitioned sea states are used for instance to compute wave loads differently in the case of the other considered locations the significant difference between θ m s and θ m w clearly denotes the presence of two separate systems in order to adequately represent this difference a directional spectral model has to be adopted this is done by adapting the previous model to a directional representation as suggested in lucas et al 2011 for the approximation of the directional spreading function the well established power cosine form longuet higgins et al 1963 mitsuyasu et al 1975 is accepted 7 q f θ c s c o s 2 s f θ θ m w i t h θ θ m π 2 where s f is a parameter that controls the level of directional spreading in this case it has been taken s f 2 for wind sea and s f 4 for swell and c s is a normalisation factor that for constant s f can be computed by means of the gamma function γ as 8 c s 2 2 s 1 γ s 1 γ s πγ 2 s in fig 10 the mean stormy conditions in the central indian ocean are represented the left panel where the same concepts as in fig 9 are adopted shows a similar shape as for the upper right panel of the previous figure although shifted to lower frequencies and higher energy a critical difference can be noticed by comparing the directional spectra in the central and the left panels the swell system coming from the southern westerlies 177 and the wind sea system generated by the indian cyclone coming in this location from east south east 120 are roughly summarised in a more intense system coming from south south east 160 and a quite high peak period as a practical example of the consequences of this approximation one may consider a ship heading south in this location during a storm assuming the first representation intense pitch and heave could be expected but the direction could anyway be considered among the most favourable options if the two separate systems are represented instead a significant component of beam sea with relatively low period would probably cause a critical roll motion and force to change course the previous example can be exceptionally important in the route selection process but the consequences can be notable also in other practical applications the north east coast of the usa also presents a particular crossing sea conditions as shown in fig 11 due to the tendency of waves to propagate eastwards in this eastern coast swell is not as strong as on the european side of the north atlantic and mostly aligns with the coast in a south west to north east directions on the contrary especially in winter this area is subjected to strong wind from the shore able to generate intense local storms this combination of wave systems of similar magnitude with different directions may partially explain the general overestimation in this area of wave height from visual observations from ships as pointed in vettor and guedes soares 2016 the somali coast as already mentioned is characterised by a peculiar wave regime caused by the presence of a strong wind jet that can cause heavy wind sea waves from the spectral point of view this condition is shown in fig 12 on the right panel most faithful representation is provided with an important wind sea aligned with the shore in the south west to north east direction coupled with a swell coming from the central indian ocean the wind sea contribution and especially its direction seems to be hidden in the single peak directional spectrum shown on the central panel clearly limiting the awareness of an important feature to understand the wave climate in that area the situation in the campos basin fig 13 offshore the brazilian coast presents some similarities with the somali coast also in this case the swell components deriving from the propagation of waves from the southern extratropical region are almost perpendicular to the coast while the wind sea is aligned with it in the north east to south west direction opposite of the previous location this combination creates again a stormy wave climate characterised by two systems at about 90 degrees of difference making the overall integral parameters h s t p and θ m clearly insufficient for a meaningful representation of the actual wave conditions finally the north sea condition is analysed in fig 14 the particularity is in this case that the peak of wind sea is higher than the one of swell for the first time among the considered location this kind of frequency distribution of the wave energy can be often expected in the marginal seas characterised by a limited fetch where swell component is mostly due to the drop of the local wind that becomes slower than the locally generated waves or from the often obstructed incursion of swell from the open oceans as in the case of the north sea for waves coming from the northern isles of scotland as shown in the several examples above a single peak representation of the wave spectra generally leads to an overestimation of the spectral energy in the central range of the frequency that can vary depending on the location and the actual conditions and an underestimation of the peaks relative to the components of wind sea and swell often more pronounced for wind sea due to the tendency of the global modal frequency to be closer to the swell peak frequency in these cases a double peak representation guedes soares 1984 seems more appropriate similar conclusions have been found by analysing single storms not shown here when analysing wave loads these differences may be critical due to the importance of peaks both in the wave spectra and in the transfer functions for a correct overall estimation of the total loads where crossing sea are expected with a certain frequency also wave direction can become an issue when the sea state is summarised as composed by a single wave system the actual directions of waves can result very different from those indicated by the average value neglecting this factor can be dangerous for instance when ship motions are assessed for instance a low period beam wave system even if could appear as less important compared to the main swell component can cause excessive roll and unsafe operations it must although be considered that as shown in spentza et al 2017 for the case of ship motions adopting a parametric double peak spectral model representation does not always lead to more accurate results the reason can be found on the fact that only parameters describing the energy content and the frequency of the peak for each spectral component are available whereas the information regarding the actual energy distribution in frequency and direction is missing in order to supply these lack of knowledge one has to assume standard values for the peak enhancement and directional spreading function which generally derive from the statistical analysis of measured spectra and fitting to single peak models thus not directly applying to double peak representations further investigations are then needed to provide spectral models that better fit to the actual energy distribution characteristic of each location 7 conclusions a brief analysis of the global distribution of wind sea and swell has been provided by analysing the era interim database in the period from 1979 to 2013 as is common practice the mean values of the respective wave heights and directions are considered and the results are coherent with previous findings that can be found in literature from the analysis of different sources nevertheless a look at the variability of both magnitude and direction showed that the mean values are in most cases a simple statistical parameter not representatives of the conditions that one can expect to experience this is even more the case for wind sea height and in the higher latitudes and marginal seas wave direction while swell is characterised by a particularly constant behaviour except for its directionality in some specific regions the study of the energy contribution of the two spectral components revealed that the occurrence of swell dominated sea states is extremely high in particular the cases in which energy carried by wind sea is higher than the one carried by swell are practically absent if not in very peculiar region due to wind jets or very short fetches moreover it has been found that when the wind sea energy contribution is lower than about 10 one does not incur in significant errors by neglecting it and using the traditional single peak representation differently when its contribution is higher misleading information should be expected if an appropriate multi peak spectral model is not considered it must be noted that the scheme adopted for the separation of the two spectral components although perfectly justified from the meteorological point of view does not necessary imply the presence of double peak spectra and may be misleading when the parametric representations of the partitioned sea states are analysed and these data are used for instance to compute wave loads this is not expected to be an issue when wind sea and swell components come from rather different directions in which case the presence of two different systems is certain however it is worth to investigate the differences between this spectral separation scheme and a separation aimed at identifying multi peaked spectra especially for wave load assessment the analysis and comparison of wave spectra of a number for selected locations considering both a traditional representation that summarises the sea state in a single set of integral parameters and a double peak representation that uses all the information about the two wave components helped to better understand the effect of the two approaches and estimate the loss of information and awareness of the actual sea condition when the traditional approach is adopted in highly swell dominated sea states the traditional approach appeared adequate in fact the two representations are almost identical however when wind sea component grows in most of the cases swell still plays an important role while the total energy content being a zero moment is well represented by the sum of the two this is not the case for its distribution in frequency and direction the peak frequency tends in general to be closer to the swell peak causing a pronounced underestimation of the wind sea peak while the direction results as a weighted average between the mean directions of the two components ending not being representative for neither of the two these differences and loss of information can have significant effects when the wave data are used in real cases for instance in engineering for the assessment of wave loads on marine structures or ship motions and are worth to be further investigated credit authorship contribution statement
