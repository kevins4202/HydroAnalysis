17145,endevours on the enhancement of nitrate removal efficiency during methane oxidation coupled with denitrification ame d has always overlooked the role of membrane employed it would be highly beneficial to enrich the biomass content and to manage biofilm on the membrane in the utilization of methane and denitrification in this study an innovative and scalable double layer membrane dlm was designed and prepared for a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr to simultaneously enhance nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency during aerobic methane oxidation coupled with the denitrification ame d process the dlm allowed quick bacterial attachment and biomass accumulation for biofilm growth which would be then self regulated for well distribution of functional microbes on within the dlm upon a high biofilm density of over 70 g vss m 2 achieved on the dlm the methane utilization efficiency of the mbfr was enhanced significantly to over 1 3 times than the control mbfr with conventional polypropylene membrane the mbfr employed dlm also demonstrated the maximum nitrate removal flux of 740 mg no3 n m 2 d 1 that was approximately 1 64 times of that in control mbfr at continuous mode operation this dlm indeed favored the enrichment of type ii aerobic methanotrophs of methylocystaceae and methanol utilization denitrifiers of rhodocyclaceae that preferentially utilize methanol as the cross feeding intermediates to promote the methane utilization efficiency and thus to enhance the nitrate removal flux these results raised from new designed dlm confirmed the importance of membrane surface properties on the effectiveness of mbfr and offered great potential to address challenging problems of mbfrs during engineering application graphical abstract image

notorious greenhouse gas ghg with a significant global warming potential gwp of more than 25 times higher than carbon dioxide co2 playing an extremely key role in warming the global climate ipcc 2013 zhu et al 2016 delre et al 2017 huang et al 2020 methane generated from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is over 520 tg every year which are responsible for approximately 5 of global ch4 emission czepiel et al 1993 qiao et al 2020 nie et al 2019 the increasing interests in control ghg emissions calls for the development of novel technologies to minimize ch4 emissions and or to utilized ch4 in wwtps in the last decades methane oxidation coupled to denitrification mod gained great attention as a potentially sustainable and economical mean for onsite ch4 minimazation and utilization modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 since that the methane generated onsite from the anaerobic treatment process can be accessibly and readily available and instantaneously utilized as an electron donor for denitrification in wwtps which will significantly decrease the cost of carbon sources for denitrification 0 24 kmol 1 electron of methane vs 2 7 kmol 1 electron of methanol alrashed et al 2018 in general mod can be executed aerobically or anaerobically which has been classified as aerobic mod ame d and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo respectively rhee and fuhs 1978 zhu et al 2016 raghoebarsing et al 2006 ettwig et al 2010 ame d process has been recognized as a synergistic metabolism process accomplished by aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers during which the methanotrophs aerobically oxidize methane firstly to release organic carbon sources that are simultaneously or sequentially used by co existing denitrifiers compared to damo process whose application for methane emission control from wwtps suffers from the rather slow microorganisms growth and accumulation and low nitrate nitrite reduction rate chen et al 2014 he et al 2013 ettwig et al 2010 vaksmaa et al 2017 ame d appears to be a more promising and practically feasible technology to address challenging issues about simultaneous onsite utilization of methane and removal of nitrogenous contaminants from wastewater due to its merits of high aerobic methanotrophs growth rate and resistance to various environmental conditions modin et al 2010a lee et al 2019 alrashed et al 2018 nevertheless it is highly expected to achieve satisfied denitrification efficiency and high methane utilization efficiency during the continuous operation of ame d mechsner and hamer 1985 sun et al 2013 xu et al 2020 modin et al 2007 stein and klotz 2011 until now many researchers have demonstrated that membrane biofilm reactor mbfr is one of the most applicable systems to implement ame d process modin et al 2007 shi et al 2013 lee et al 2019 however there are two major technical bottlenecks constraining the effectivenesses of methane utilization and denitrification and the engineering application of methane based denitrification mbfrs lee et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 the first drawback is unstable gaseous methane utilization efficiency sometimes of as low as 6 52 that is mainly related with the membrane permeability methane solubility biomass density and activities ontiveros valencia et al 2018 lee et al 2019 xu et al 2020 which would require high c n ratio and induce serious methane leakage from biofilm to bulk liquid from the summarized literatures table 1 the c n ratios of the ame d process execuated biologically in the mbfrs are ranged from 4 8 to 12 5 modin et al 2008 2010b sun et al 2013 zhu et al 2017 xu et al 2020 that is much higher than the theoretical value of from 1 27 to 1 39 modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 more seriously this insufficient or delayed methane utilization and thereby unstable carbon sources production would result in overflow of methane into the atmosphere for instance alrashed et al 2018 observed the dissolved methane concentration in the mbfr effluent up to 8 13 mg l 1 which was mainly resulted from the slow rate of methane oxidation by biofilm biomass other than the transport of gaseous methane thus effective enhancement of the methane utilization efficiency for minimization of the dissolved methane in bulk is quite eventually significance to the mbfrs effectiveness and performances the second bottleneck of the ame d is its relatively low denitrification efficiency that is related closely with biofilm biomass and functional bacterial spatial distribution as well as the mass transport within the biofilm which significantly limits the mbfr feasibility in total nitrogen tn removal from wastewater modin et al 2010b denitrification rate is usually expressed as the amount of nitrate removed by capita biomass every day i e mmol n g 1 vss d 1 from the literature reported it is worthy to note that the observed maximum denitrification efficiency was 7 32 mmol n g 1 vss d 1 under a ratio of o2 and ch4 of 0 25 zhu et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to improve the methane utilization efficiency and to obtain consistently satisfied denitrification efficiency for the methane base mbfr which could be exerted from the aspects of functional biomass enrichment and effective mass transport within the biofilm nerenberg 2016 zhu et al 2016 as the core unit of the mbfrs the membrane performs two major functions i e to work as a medium for gaseous substrate transfer and a carrier for microbial biomass attachment and growth sustainable adjustment of the transfer rate of the gas from membrane lumen to biofilm to match the rate of gaseous substrate utilization by functional microbes is crucial to effective methane utilization and denitrification martin and nerenberg 2012 ontiveros valencia et al 2018 many studies have reported that biofilm management on the gas transfer membrane in mbfrs is one feasible way to enhance gaseous substrates utilization efficiency modin et al 2010b lee et al 2019 where an excessively thick biofilm would cause substrates limitation due to diffusional resistance while a thin biofilm accompanied with insufficient biomass content exhibited rather low gaseous substrates utilization efficiency proper manageable biofilm structures and rational biomass distribution helped to enhance methane utilization and denitrification efficiency by affecting microbial deposition accumulation growth as well as substrate utilization lackner et al 2009 as biofilm behavior is related closely to the membrane surface properties and structures therefore achieving biofilm management by modification of the membrane surface is one of the options to tackle these two challenges constraining the engineering application of methane based denitrification mbfrs the objective of the present study is to prepare an innovative dlm for the mbfr and to investigate its enhancement for the system effectiveness the dlm was fabricated on the conventional hydrophobic pp membrane by electrospinning to provide more room for bacterial attachment and accumulation the effects of membrane structure on biofilm enrichment methane utilization and denitrification efficiency were evaluated in the mbfrs operated under batch and continuous modes special attentions were paid to the biofilm biomass enrichment and to sequential substrate utilization performance the obtained results provide useful guidance to bridge the lab scale to the engineering application of the mathene based mbfrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbfr system and experiments design the mbfr chamber was made from plexiglas tube with a total volume of 650 ml and a working volume of 600 ml similar to the previous reported mbfrs gaseous substrates including independent methane and oxygen gas were provided separatedly by gas storage and their flow rates were accurately controlled by mass flow meters mic21 beijing jes technology co ltd china two equal size mbfrs were operated in parallel fig 1 including a control mbfr consisting of polypropylene pp hollow fiber membrane teijin fibers ltd japan was marked as c mbfr and an experimental mbfr marked as e mbfr employed modified dlm module see section 2 2 each mbfr was installed with 32 pieces of membranes with an average length of 20 cm providing a total surface area of 40 20 cm2 and a specific surface area of 6 70 m2 m 3 the ame d culture used herein was derived from a mother mbfr that had been acclimated with active sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant shenzhen china and fed with continuous methane gas 99 99 shente gas co ltd china as the sole electron donor after incubation for over six months the mother mbfr had a nitrate removal rate of around 3 5 0 3 mg n l 1 d 1 the volatile suspended solids vss of the inoculated culture for mbfrs was averaged at 2300 mg l 1 upon which the methane oxidation rate in the mbfrs was about 1 3 mmol ch4 g 1 vss d 1 to ensure its perform aerobic mod for all mbfrs nitrate mineral salts nms containing chemical compositions of in every liter l distilled water of 330 mg cacl2 2h2o 480 mg mgso4 7h2o 9 1 mg feso4 7h2o and pre determined kno3 for varied nitrogen loading rate were mixed with inoculated culture in a volumetric ratio of 10 1 this mixed medium also included 2 ml l 1 phosphate buffer 1 ml l 1 acidic trace element solution and 1 ml l 1 alkaline element solution which was strictly followed the recipe described in detail by modin et al 2010a the c mbfr and e mbfr were operated side by side for over 100 days being comprised of 57 days batch mode phase with stepwise increase of feeding nitrate concentration and 49 days continuous mode operation with different hydraulic retention time hrt each mbfr was consistently fed with a gas mixture containing 75 ch4 and 25 o2 the gas pressure was kept at 22 psig to provide the methane flux of 194 mmol ch4 m 2 d 1 the operation condition parameters were summarized in table s1 for effective biofilm formation the mbfrs were initially operated under the batch mode comprised of phase i ii iii and iv during which the feeding solution contained an average no3 n concentration of 5 0 10 0 20 0 and 25 0 mg l 1 respectivel and each phase lasted for 2 to 4 operation cycles afterwards both of mbfrs were adjusted to the continuous mode by feeding 25 1 5 mg l 1 nitrate solution during which three hydraulic retention time hrt 24 18 and 12 h were adopted 2 2 dlm preparation electrostatic spinning method was used to prepare dlm by constructing a three dimensional network fibrous layer on the surface of pp membrane 200 µm o d and 50 µm i d 0 02 0 05 µm pore size figure s1 firstly pre determined polyacrylonitrile pan mw 150 000 was dissolved in n n dimethylformamide dmf ar 99 5 to obtain 6 0 wt spinning solution which was then delivered at the rate of 20 µl min 1 to the syringe nozzle electric field was generated by a high voltage power supplier whose anode and cathode was connected with the syringe nozzle and the aluminum plate respectively the pp membrane mounted on a homemade rotating plate was placed between nozzle and aluminum plate during the electrospinning the applied voltage was controlled at 15 kv to continuously eject spinning solution from the nozzle by which a fibrous layer was gradually formed and coated on the exterior of pp membrane the thickness of the spinning fiber layer was controlled by spinning time the obtained double layer membranes were dried at 60 cfor 4 h before its characterization and employment 2 3 membrane characterization the pp membrane and prepared dlm properties especially its structure and hydrophilicity were characterized their sectional profiles were observed by using a scanning electron microscope su8010 hitachi japan followed the previous report chen et al 2014 the hydrophilicity of the membrane indicated as its contact angle with water droplet was measured by using contact angle tester harke h00804 china the external fibrous structure of the dlm was characterized in terms of fiber diameter pore size and porosity by using an analyzer asap2020m micromeritics usa as an essentially thermodynamic process initial deposition of microorganisms onto the membrane surface mainly related with their interface interaction energy between them based on the extended derjaguin landau verwery oxerbeek xdlvo theory the interface energy was calculated according to eqs s1 to s11 described in supporting information the contact angles of the membrane with glycerin and methylene chloride were measured by contact angle tester and the zeta potential required to calculate these surface energy parameters was determined by zeta potentiometer nanotrac wave acemicrotrac inc usa 2 4 biofilm characterization the biofilm samples were collected regularly from c mbr and e mbr simultaneously by cutting off one piece of hollow fiber membrane the biofilm formed on the membrane surface and its spatial topography were visualized at different phases by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm a1r mp nikon japan during which more than 1 cm membrane fiber was stained with live dead biofilm viability kit invitrogen ca for 30 min and rinsed with filter sterilized water twice before images capturing zhou et al 2020 the biofilm was carefully sampled from the membrane surface at the same sampling time as clsm and the biomass density was measured following the modified methods according to the literatures modin et al 2010b celmer et al 2008 in brief the membrane modules were removed separately from the mbfrs and the biofilm biomass was collected manually with a plastic spatula from the membranes of known length and number and then transferred and re suspended into a 50 ml beaker the re suspended biomass sludge solution was filtered onto a pre weighted glass fiber filter with a constant weight m0 which was then dried at 103 105 c for 120 min to a constant weight m1 after thoroughly cooling to room temperature subsequently above dried glass fiber filter with biomass were then put into a pretreated and dried crucible with the weight of m2 both of filter and crucible were transferred into a muffle furnace and ignited at a temperature of 550 c for 60 min after thoroughly cooling to room temperature their constant weight marked as m3 could be obtained accordingly the biomass density of membrane with known surface area s was thus calculated by eq 1

filter dried at 103 105 c is total weight ofm2 is the weight of dried crucible m3 is total weight of biomass and crucible ignited at 550 c for 60 min g approximately 200 mg of biofilm biomass was withdrawn separately from the mbfr at the end of the experiments and was used for microbial community and functional gene characterization genomic dna was extracted by using dna powersoil isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad usa according to the manufacturer instructions the extracted dna was quantified with a nanodrop analyzer thermo scientific wilmington de usa polymerase chain reaction pcr with the forward primer 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and the reverse primer 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used to amplify partial 16s ribosomal rrna 16s rrna gene flanking v3 and v4 region cao et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 the amplified and then purified amplicons were sent to majorbio shanghai china for illumina miseq sequencing 2 5 denitrification efficiency biomass activities and methane utilization efficiency the overall mbfr treatment performances for denitrification at batch mode and continuous mode operation were determined in term of nitrate removal flux which was

1000 m g 1 g t 0 1 v h 22 4 l 1 m o l t 1 according to the mass balances of the methane lee et al 2019 the methane utilization efficiency in the mbfr for denitrification was obtained by using eq 5 5 r

the temperature of the oven and the tcd detector was kept at a constant level of 200 and 250 c respectively helium gas was used as carrier gas 99 99 shente gas co ltd china with a constant flow rate of 10 ml min 1 under a pressure of 6 psig 3 results 3 1 membrane characterization upon the optimized preparation condition parameters dlm composed of the inner base pp membrane and the external fibrous structure was successfully obtained figure s2a and 2b by using the electrostatic spinning method this dlm surface was uniformly covered by fibrous layer with a thickness of around 35 μm different from the base pp membrane solely with the hydrophobic surface the dlm surface was evenly covered by pan fibrous that had a normalized pore size of around 6 μm which was more than 5 times larger than those of the microorganisms figure s2b table s2 this fibrous structure of dlm and their relative large pore size provided sufficient interspace with a high porosity of over 70 and micro environments for bacterial attachment and colonization and then favored accompanied biofilm growth and metabolism moreover this dlm also had a rather hydrophobic external surface that was indicated by the increased water contact angle from 85 4 1 7 to 100 7 2 3 beneath which meanwhile has a tight base membrane surface this relative hydrophobic outer surface allowed direct attachment and colonization of biomass which was highly beneficial for the microbial accumulation and effective gaseous substrate transportation 3 2 denitrification flux in the batch mode mbfrs the modified dlm was employed to the e mbfr and was operated in parallel with the c mbfr at the batch mode firstly for about 60 days fig 2 with continuous supply of gaseous substrates the nitrate concentration in both of c mbfr and e mbfr was gradually decreased from 5 mg l 1 to below 0 5 mg l 1 after 9 days start up operation at phase i without any carbon sources added meaning successful biological denitrification utilizing the carbon source derived from aerobic methane oxidation at this start phase both of c mbfr and e mbfr displayed relatively limited nitrate reduction flux of around 75 mg n m 2 d 1 after sequential 6 days operation the nitrate removal flux of c mbfr stepwise increased to 160 5 mg n m 2 d 1 and consistently produced low effluent nitrate concentration below 0 3 mg l 1 in comparison the nitrate removal flux of the e mbfr reached to 112 5 mg n m 2 d 1 at the end of phase i when the influent nitrate concentration increased to 10 mg l 1 at phase ii the nitrate reduction flux of c mbfr quickly increased to 292 5 mg n m 2 d 1 after 7 days more than 0 7 times higher than that in e mbfr notwithstanding the nitrate reduction rate of the e mbfr accelerated sharply at day 22 after which it increased from 169 5 to 321 0 mg n m 2 d 1 after 5 days operation therefore at the end of phase ii both e mbfr and c mbfr obtained a rather comparable level for nitrate reduction afterwards once the influent nitrate concentration increased up to 20 mg l 1 at phase iii the nitrate reduction profile in the c mbfr began to be rather different from e mbfr as it displayed slight change and gradually reached a stable level of 385 5 mg n m 2 d 1 in contrast the nitrate reduction flux in the e mbfr performed a higher nitrate removal flux than the c mbfr at day 28 and thereafter kept a continuously increasing trend finally e mbfr achieved the maximum nitrate reduction flux of 622 5 mg n m 2 d 1 approximately 1 5 times of that of the c mbfr to further evaluate the stability of the denitrification performance of the mbfr and the reliability of the dlm an elevated nitrage concentration over 25 mg l 1 was used in phase ⅳ and it was clearly observed that e mbfr and c mbfr relatively stable denitrification by matured biofilms while e mbfr 622 5 mg n m 2 d 1 displayed consistently higher nitrate removal flux than c mbfr 392 5 mg n m 2 d 1 throughout the experiments the nitrite concentrations in both of the c mbfr and e mbfr effluent were less than 0 2 mg l 1 probably because that the nitrite reduction to n2 was not the limiting step for overall denitrification process alrashed et al 2018 lee et al 2019 therefore after a long term batch mode operation although the c mbfr performed a relatively higher denitrification rate in the initial phase the results clearly demonstrated that the e mbfr exhibited a significantly high denitrification capability in term of nitrate removal flux due to the employment of the dlm 3 3 biofilm formation and biomass characteristics in the batch mode mbfrs under the same gaseous substrates pressure and ratio for mbfrs the varied membranes employed within them took major responsible to their rather distinct biofilm formation accumulation and growth profiles during the batch mode operation phases the biofilm coverage on the membrane surface and biofilm biomass density were visually characterized in the initial 5 days at phase i after inoculation the sem and clsm observations of the biofilm displayed that there were rather limited active microorganisms visualized as rarely green dots on the base pp membrane figure s3a1 fig 3 a1 while more active microorganisms found on the dlm although which had rather fluffy and loose spatial structure figure s3b1 fig 3b1 the biomass density quantified above difference and indicated that the biomass on the dlm was about 24 g vss m 2 that was more than 10 times higher than that on the base pp membrane this phenomena indeed was resulted from the beneficial roles from dlm structural design and from its favorable interfacial energy for bacterial attachment with the progression of mbfrs operation the visualized biofilm images in phase ⅱ demonstrated that the dlm surface had been almost completely covered by activated microbes figure s3b2 fig 3b2 while less than 60 surface of the base pp membrane was occupied by co existing bacterial clusters figure s3a2 fig 3a2 meanwhile the biomass density on the dlm continuously increased to 49 g vss m 2 over 7 times higher than that on the base pp membrane the biofilm on the base pp membrane began to accumulate from phase iii and gradually increased from 6 47 to 28 26 g vss m 2 until the phase ⅳ the biomass density on the base pp membrane and dlm reached to rather stable level of about 70 and 36 g vss m 2 respectively figure s3 fig 3a4 b4 c thus it is reasonable to recognize that the dlm employed in the mbfr could quickly accumulate microorganisms at the initial start up phase and help to obtain sufficient active biomass content at the matured phase this quick biofilm formation as well as high active biomass content take the major roles to enhance mbfr denitrification efficiency and gaseous substrate utilization efficiency considering the correlation between biofilms characteristics in fig 3 and no3 n removal performance in fig 2 it is noted that the improved no3 n removal flux during phase i to iii in whether e mbfr or c mbfr were initially attributed to gradually accumulation of biofilms biomass with operation time for c mbfr the no3 n removal flux was increased by almost 6 times from phase i to iii corresponding to the enrichment of biofilm biomass by about 15 times similar trend was also observed in e mbfr where the no3 n removal flux increased with the increase of biofilm biomass however there was rather insignificant improvement of the no3 n removal flux observed in both e mbfr and c mbfr at phase iv when the biofilm biomass was increased by 13 5 and 26 8 respectively the reason might be attributed to the limitation for substrate diffusion that was resulted from thick biofilm biomass accumulation martin et al 2013 celmer et al 2008 hwang et al 2010 the substrate transport and utilization profiles in the biofilm would be discussion in detail in section 4 2 3 4 methane utilization and microbial activities in continuous mode mbfrs after the biofilm matured the batch mode operation was changed to continuous mode one to evaluate the effects of applied hrts onto the mbfrs performance at day 57 the results of biomass density demonstrated that the average biomass density of mature biofilm attached on the dlm and base pp membrane was stably kept at 70 and 36 g vss m 2 respectively at the end of batch mode operation fig 3b according to the same measured method it was estimated that the average biofilm density of e mbfr and c mbfr during continuous mode operation were also kept at 70 and 36 g vss m 2 respectively by monitoring the dissolved methane concentration in the mbfr bulk and its effluent nitrate concentration for each hrt at continuous mode operation figure s4 the methane utilization efficiency methane oxidation rate and denitrification rate could be estimated for each mbfr at different hrts table 2 attributing to dlm employment and its induced high biofilm biomass the methane leakage was effectively constrained in e mbfr accompanying with its consistently higher methane utilization efficiency than those in the c mbr which appeared to be independent on the applied hrts the denitrification rate in the c mbfr was changed insignificantly under varied hrts from 12 to 24 h in comparison short hrt was beneficial to the nitrate removal flux in the e mbfr although its effluent nitrate concentration was slightly increased accordingly e mbfr displayed the highest nitrate removal flux of over 740 mg n m 2 d 1 and methane utilization efficiency of 64 when the hrt was kept at 12 h which were over 0 6 and 0 3 times higher than c mbfr respectively the results from continuous mode operation evidenced that dlm employment could simultaneously enhance the nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency giving rise to great significance to the application of mbfrs from the result of fig 3c the biomass density of the matured e mbfr biofilm was almost two times of that in the c mbfr denoting quite thicker biofilm formed in e mbfr it is worth noting that the denitrifier in the c mbfr represented a better specific denitrification rate rd rate than e mbfr table 2 which was most likely to be no3 n diffusion limitations in the thick biofilms or even inactive cell accumulation in e mbfr martin et al 2013 hwang et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 nerenberg 2016 notwithstanding the e mbfr still displayed higher methane utilization efficiency rm efficiency and denitrification removal flux 3 5 microbial community structurs in mbfrs besides the effectivenesses enhancement in terms of denitrification efficiency and methane utilization efficiency dlm employment in the e mbfr also affected the microbial community structures including relative bacterial abundances at the class level and the relative abundances of relevant functional bacterial texa of the biofilm fromed in e mbfr fig 4 a which was rather different from those in the c mbfr and related closely with the membrane structure and surface properties from the class level anaerolineae γ proteobacteria and α proteobacteria were the most abundant in both mbfrs accounting for 14 87 21 71 and 8 92 in c mbfr and 17 15 8 23 and 6 34 in e mbfr respectively many studies had reported that anaerolineae that may exert the function of denitrification was widely available in anaerobic reactors li and lu 2017 sotres et al 2016 meanwhile α proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria were the major subdivision containing aerobic methane oxidizers and denitrifiers and played key roles in the cycle of nitrogen ho et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 aerobic methanotrophs mainly including methylococcaceae methylocystaceae and beijirinckiaceae which execute methane oxidation were all detected in c mbfr and e mbfr fig 4b among these methylococcaceae that belongs to type ii aerobic methanotrophs was predominance with the abundance of 1 18 in c mbfr followed by 0 73 beijirinckiaceae and 0 63 methylocystaceae concurring well with previous reported mbfrs where its importance in aerobic methane oxidation has been recognized xu et al 2020 in comparison two typical type ii aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and beijirinckiaceae were found to be the dominant methane oxidizer enriched in e mbfr which accounted for 1 12 and 1 14 abundance respectively fig 4b at the same time there major denitrifying bacteria xanthomonadaceae rhodocyclaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae were enriched in both of c mbfr and e mbfr the abundance of these three predominant functional denitrifier in c mbfr was 2 07 0 65 and 1 83 respectively in comparison to the corresponding abundance in e mbfr was 1 44 4 08 and 1 63 respectively it was also noted that rhodocyclaceae was the most domain denitrifier in e mbfr representing approximately 6 28 times of that in c mbfr except for relative functional bacterial caldilineaceae and microtrichaceae were the most abundant in both mbfrs which accounted for 3 54 and 6 65 in c mbfr and 4 55 and 5 04 in e mbfr respectively it has been demonstrated in the literatures that caldilineaceae and microtrichaceae correlated with the formation of biofilms in mbr yu et al 2018 tu et al 2020 in the mbfrs key operation condition parameters such as gaseous substrates pressure and loading rate are essential to biofilm growth and functional microorganisms enrichment ontiveros valencia et al 2018 in this study the high gaseous substrates pressure of around 22 psig and stepwise increased nitrate concentration from 5 0 to 25 0 mg l 1 ensured sufficient substrates transport and high nitrate surface loading rate providing a beneficial environment for growth and enrichment of functional microorganisms it was thus observed that there is a positively correlation of biofilm density in the mbfrs with the influent nitrate concentration fig 3 which concurred well with previous reports that demonstrated the obvious enrichment of aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers by the increment of gaseous substrates pressure and nitrate loading rate xu et al 2020 cao et al 2019 nie et al 2019 lee et al 2019 therefore it is worthy to note that the influent nitrate concentration would beneficially affect functional microorganisms enrichment in the mbfrs 4 discussion 4 1 enhanced bacterial accumulation and biofilm formation on the dlm biofilm formation is a process that consists of three steps initial bacterial adsorption bacterial consolidation and colonization notermans et al 1991 from the direct observation of the biofilm formation on the membranes fig 3a b it was observed that the initial bacterial adsorption and accumulation rates onto the dlm surfaces were quite higher than those onto the base pp membrane this meant that dlm surface accelerated the bacterial adsorption and accumulation significantly at the start up phase two major reasons are taking responsible for this advantage raised from dlm the first is that the outer fiber layer possessing sufficient porous structure provided effective spatial habitat for bacterial adsorption and biofilm formation this fiber layer had intertwining fibrous structure resembled a sieve that could quickly trap microorganisms into its inner side pores with assist of hydraulic shear and transportation figure s2b2 another one is that the beneficial interfacial interaction between microorganism and membrane raised from the dlm which played important roles for the initial attachment and deposition of microorganisms onto the membrane the comparison of the interfacial interaction energies when the microorganisms approached to the base pp membrane and the dlm was carried out table s3 and fig 5 it was recognized that the single microbe have to overcome energy barrier resistance before approaching to base pp membrane or dlm from the liquid bulk partial enlargement of fig 5a1 and a2 showed that both membranes and microbes had an energy barrier around 5 nm while the energy barrier between the dlm surface and microbe was 3186 kt which was lower than that of the base pp membrane of 5905 kt this indicated that the microbes were much easier to overcome the energy barrier to close to dlm membrane afterwards the interfacial interaction energy between the microbe and membrane were both negative meaning their attractive force for possible bacterial attachment once the interface distance d between the single microbe and the membrane is smaller than d0 0 158 nm this microbe would be deemed to successful deposit onto the membrane surface it was estimated that when the microbes were initially adsorbed on the dlm surface their interface interaction energy per unit area was 9 71 10 5 kj m 2 while the corresponding value for the base pp membrane was 7 75 10 5 kj m 2 this implied that microbes were easier to irreversibly attach onto the dlm membrane from fig 5b1 and b2 it was also clear that the lewis acid base effect played a dominant role when the distance between the microbe and membrane was less than 1 nm the rather lower interface interaction energy from the dlm implied that the microbes would be much more readily captured from bulk solution which then resulted in high biomass accumulation rate notwithstanding the captured microbes at the initial phase was easily attached to the outer side of the dlm which in turn reduced the possibility of microbes penetrating fibrous layer and reaching the bottom of the fibrous layer and thus resulted in the failure of bacterial colonization on the inner pp membrane this phenomena might also explain the lower nitrate removal flux in the e mbfr at start up phase fig 2 regarding the hydrophobic base pp membrane although there were few microbes attached on it during the initial phase the biofilm directly attached to the pp membrane surface would create a highly advantageous habitat i e the microbes could survive directly with the gaseous substrates ontiveros valencia et al 2018 wu et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable that the c mbfr performed better nitrate removal flux than the e mbfr from phase i to ii fig 2 considering the relatively large amount of microorganisms on the dlm at the initial stages it is conceivable that the biofilm would further produce much more slimy adhesive substances e g eps that would promote microbial consolidation and growth lai et al 2018 ontiveros valencia et al 2018 therefore the biomass density on the dlm at phase ii reached to 49 g vss m 2 which was one time higher in contrast with that at phase i accompanying with the continuous growth of biofilm on the dlm microbes was then gradually colonized from the external fiber layer to the internal pp membrane surface leading to an impressive increasing of gaseous substrate utilization efficiency and nitrate removal flux finally the biomass density of matured biofilm on the dlm was about 70 g vss m 2 which was approximately 2 times of that on the pp membrane and attributed to its advantageous habitat provided by high porous structure and beneficial interfacial interaction energy 4 2 manageable biofilm improved denitrification and methane utilization the high biomass density on the dlm fig 3 helped e mbfr to obtain a high nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency compared to the c mbfr table 2 especially upon the functional microorganisms distributed spontaneously on the dlm surface as illustrated in fig 6 the ch4 diffusion from membrane lumen into the bulk liquid mainly including i gas transfer from the membrane to biofilm ii gas utilization by aerobic methanotrophs in biofilm and iii gas transfer from biofilm to the bulk martin and nerenberg 2012 rittmann 2018 in brief the total methane flux in step i described by eq 8 mainly depends on both the gas supply pressure and the parameters of the membrane wall martin and nerenberg 2012 8 j t f l u x h p t m p t m c m b where jt flux is the methane total flux mmol ch4 l 2 t 1 h is henry s law constant l2 t 2 p is membrane permeability t 1 tm is the thickness of the membrane p is the partial pressure in membrane lumen cmb is the concentration of dissolved methane at the interface between the membrane and biofilm as for the circumstance of the dlm which would supply rather comparable total methane supply flux as pp membrane when the differences of methanotrophs activities and the influences of microbial consolidation in membrane lumen onto the mass transfer resistance were neglected fig 6 since that aerobic methane oxidation was mainly occurred in step ii and was mainly accomplished by methanotrophs using o2 molecules zhu et al 2016 rhee and fuhs 1978 modin et al 2007 the methane consumption flux for the biofilm on the membrane surface could be presented in eq 7 according to multiplicative mond kinetics bae and rittmann 1996 alrashed et al 2018 9 j c f l u x q max f 1 x f s f 1 k 1 s f 1 s f 2 k 2 s f 2 where jc flux is the methane consumption flux mmol ch4 l 2 t 1 sf1 and sf2 is ch4 and do concentration in the biofilm mmol ch4 l 3 and mmol o2 l 3 respectively qmax is the maximum specific methane utilization rate of methanotrophic bacteria mmol ch4 g 1 cell t 1 f1 is the fraction of methanotrophic bacteria xf is the biomass density g cell l 2 k1 and k2 represent the half maximum rate concentration for methane mmol ch4 l 3 and o2 mmol o2 l 3 respectively the kinetic parameters including qmax k1 and k2 are constant in all methane consumption reactions while k1 and k2 was 0 45 mg l 1 and 61 µg l 1 respectively van bodegom et al 2001 considering that the methane and do concentration inside the biofilm of whether c mbfr or e mbfr was much higher than k1 and k2 respectively which meant that the monod term sf1 k1 sf1 and sf2 k2 sf2 for these two mbfrs were rather similar therefore the methane consumption flux depends dominantly on xf and f1 meanwhile the 16s rrna gene profiles in fig 4b revealed the relatively abundant of aerobic methanetrophic f1 in c mbfr was very close to those of e mbfr compared to the matured biofilm attached to the base pp membrane the biomass density xf of dlm was significantly higher meaning a greater methane consumption flux fig 6 based on these results herein the biomass density xf of the matured biofilm attached on dlm was about 2 times of that on pp membrane fig 3c which contributed to the methane utilization efficiency of e mbfr was 1 13 1 36 times of those in c mbfr under varied hrt table 2 according to the mass balances methods proposed by lee et al 2019 it is further concluded that the methane leakage flux jl flux was the methane total flux jt flux minus the methane consumption flux js flux therefore the methane leak flux jl flux of e mbfr was found to be much lower than that of c mbfr the above analysis concurred well with the dissolved methane concentration results in the bulk solution figure s4 moreover the accumulation of dissolved methane in c mbfr and e mbfr also implied a faster methane transfer rate than its consumption rate which thus confirmed that methane oxidation was the rate limiting step for the denitrification efficiency alrashed et al 2018 from the biochemical mechanism of ame d process it is noted that higher methane consumption flux of e mbfr would result in a higher organic metabolite excreted by aerobic methanotrophs accordingly denitrifying bacteria in e mbfr would obtain more carbon intermediates to remove nitrate biologically the high abundance functional microorganism species and their rational spatial distribution on dlm in e mbfr also contributed to the enhanced nitrate removal flux for example the dominated methylocystaceae population in the e mbfr would attribute to the enhancement of denitrification efficiency since type ⅱ aerobic methanotrophs could release more organic carbon for denitrifiers compared to type ⅰ aerobic methanotrophs ho et al 2016 bao et al 2014 alrashed et al 2018 moreover rhodocyclaceae belonging to methanol utilization denitrifiers was the most domain denitrifier in e mbfr and could also preferentially utilize methanol as organic carbon at a high metabolizing rate xu et al 2020 kalyuhznaya et al 2009 cao et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 which would be a benefit for improving the denitrification efficiency therefore efficient biofilm management on the dlm and thereby rational functional microorganisms enrichment are effective to simultaneously enhance the nitrate removal rate and the methane utilization efficiency in the mbfr 4 3 environmental implications a dlm was prepared by constructing the outer fiber layer intertwining fibrous structure on the exterior of base pp hollow fiber via electrostatic spinning method this fibrous structure resembled a sieve with a porosity over 70 and provided sufficient habitat for biofilm formation and also had a fovarable interface interaction energy circumstances to improve bacteria initial attachment leading to high biofilm biomass density of 70 g vss m 2 that was more than 2 times of that on the base pp membrane enhanced biomass accumulation and high biofilm density in the e mbfr achieved the maximum increment of over 30 in methane utilization efficiency and 60 in denitrification efficiency employment of dlm in the e mbfr also help to obtain rational function microorganism distribution considering the volumetric denitrification rate in the conventional wwtps is approximately 400 mg no3 n l 1 d 1 and the maximum nitrate removal flux observed in e mbfr a dlm packing density of more than 650 m2 m 3 could be satisfy the overall denitrification requirement of the wwtps which is far below that of a commercial mbfrs with a packing density of above 2000 m2 m 3 lee et al 2018 overall this study provides an innovative scalable double layer membrane to achieve stable enhancement of mbfrs performance for ame d process which offers great potential to address challenging issues pertaining to mbfr engineering application 5 conclusion the surface properties of the membrane used in mbfr affect the ame d performance by changing the biofilm formation profiles and influencing the substrates transport and utilization this study developed a reliable enhancement way for nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency by employment of an innovative scalable dlm this dlm performed excellently in bacterial attachment and accumulation for biofilm growth and obtained more than 2 times biofilm biomass density of the base pp membrane which was mainly owing to the outer fiber layer structure of dlm and its favorable interfacial interaction with microorganisms upon the new membrane employed both nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency in the e mbfr were simultaneously increased to around 60 and 30 respectively and this simultaneous enhancement is reported for the first time so far the accelerated biomass accumulation and improved biofilm density in the e mbfr would also give rise to self regulation of functional microbes on the membrane surface and then help to efficiently utilize gaseous substrates and produce carbon sources for denitrification in this e mbfr type ⅱ aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and methanol utilization denitrifiers rhodocyclaceae were dominantly enriched functional microbes that execute cross food synergy and take important role in the enhancement of the mbfr performance credit authorship

17145,endevours on the enhancement of nitrate removal efficiency during methane oxidation coupled with denitrification ame d has always overlooked the role of membrane employed it would be highly beneficial to enrich the biomass content and to manage biofilm on the membrane in the utilization of methane and denitrification in this study an innovative and scalable double layer membrane dlm was designed and prepared for a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr to simultaneously enhance nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency during aerobic methane oxidation coupled with the denitrification ame d process the dlm allowed quick bacterial attachment and biomass accumulation for biofilm growth which would be then self regulated for well distribution of functional microbes on within the dlm upon a high biofilm density of over 70 g vss m 2 achieved on the dlm the methane utilization efficiency of the mbfr was enhanced significantly to over 1 3 times than the control mbfr with conventional polypropylene membrane the mbfr employed dlm also demonstrated the maximum nitrate removal flux of 740 mg no3 n m 2 d 1 that was approximately 1 64 times of that in control mbfr at continuous mode operation this dlm indeed favored the enrichment of type ii aerobic methanotrophs of methylocystaceae and methanol utilization denitrifiers of rhodocyclaceae that preferentially utilize methanol as the cross feeding intermediates to promote the methane utilization efficiency and thus to enhance the nitrate removal flux these results raised from new designed dlm confirmed the importance of membrane surface properties on the effectiveness of mbfr and offered great potential to address challenging problems of mbfrs during engineering application graphical abstract image

notorious greenhouse gas ghg with a significant global warming potential gwp of more than 25 times higher than carbon dioxide co2 playing an extremely key role in warming the global climate ipcc 2013 zhu et al 2016 delre et al 2017 huang et al 2020 methane generated from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is over 520 tg every year which are responsible for approximately 5 of global ch4 emission czepiel et al 1993 qiao et al 2020 nie et al 2019 the increasing interests in control ghg emissions calls for the development of novel technologies to minimize ch4 emissions and or to utilized ch4 in wwtps in the last decades methane oxidation coupled to denitrification mod gained great attention as a potentially sustainable and economical mean for onsite ch4 minimazation and utilization modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 since that the methane generated onsite from the anaerobic treatment process can be accessibly and readily available and instantaneously utilized as an electron donor for denitrification in wwtps which will significantly decrease the cost of carbon sources for denitrification 0 24 kmol 1 electron of methane vs 2 7 kmol 1 electron of methanol alrashed et al 2018 in general mod can be executed aerobically or anaerobically which has been classified as aerobic mod ame d and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo respectively rhee and fuhs 1978 zhu et al 2016 raghoebarsing et al 2006 ettwig et al 2010 ame d process has been recognized as a synergistic metabolism process accomplished by aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers during which the methanotrophs aerobically oxidize methane firstly to release organic carbon sources that are simultaneously or sequentially used by co existing denitrifiers compared to damo process whose application for methane emission control from wwtps suffers from the rather slow microorganisms growth and accumulation and low nitrate nitrite reduction rate chen et al 2014 he et al 2013 ettwig et al 2010 vaksmaa et al 2017 ame d appears to be a more promising and practically feasible technology to address challenging issues about simultaneous onsite utilization of methane and removal of nitrogenous contaminants from wastewater due to its merits of high aerobic methanotrophs growth rate and resistance to various environmental conditions modin et al 2010a lee et al 2019 alrashed et al 2018 nevertheless it is highly expected to achieve satisfied denitrification efficiency and high methane utilization efficiency during the continuous operation of ame d mechsner and hamer 1985 sun et al 2013 xu et al 2020 modin et al 2007 stein and klotz 2011 until now many researchers have demonstrated that membrane biofilm reactor mbfr is one of the most applicable systems to implement ame d process modin et al 2007 shi et al 2013 lee et al 2019 however there are two major technical bottlenecks constraining the effectivenesses of methane utilization and denitrification and the engineering application of methane based denitrification mbfrs lee et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 the first drawback is unstable gaseous methane utilization efficiency sometimes of as low as 6 52 that is mainly related with the membrane permeability methane solubility biomass density and activities ontiveros valencia et al 2018 lee et al 2019 xu et al 2020 which would require high c n ratio and induce serious methane leakage from biofilm to bulk liquid from the summarized literatures table 1 the c n ratios of the ame d process execuated biologically in the mbfrs are ranged from 4 8 to 12 5 modin et al 2008 2010b sun et al 2013 zhu et al 2017 xu et al 2020 that is much higher than the theoretical value of from 1 27 to 1 39 modin et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 more seriously this insufficient or delayed methane utilization and thereby unstable carbon sources production would result in overflow of methane into the atmosphere for instance alrashed et al 2018 observed the dissolved methane concentration in the mbfr effluent up to 8 13 mg l 1 which was mainly resulted from the slow rate of methane oxidation by biofilm biomass other than the transport of gaseous methane thus effective enhancement of the methane utilization efficiency for minimization of the dissolved methane in bulk is quite eventually significance to the mbfrs effectiveness and performances the second bottleneck of the ame d is its relatively low denitrification efficiency that is related closely with biofilm biomass and functional bacterial spatial distribution as well as the mass transport within the biofilm which significantly limits the mbfr feasibility in total nitrogen tn removal from wastewater modin et al 2010b denitrification rate is usually expressed as the amount of nitrate removed by capita biomass every day i e mmol n g 1 vss d 1 from the literature reported it is worthy to note that the observed maximum denitrification efficiency was 7 32 mmol n g 1 vss d 1 under a ratio of o2 and ch4 of 0 25 zhu et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to improve the methane utilization efficiency and to obtain consistently satisfied denitrification efficiency for the methane base mbfr which could be exerted from the aspects of functional biomass enrichment and effective mass transport within the biofilm nerenberg 2016 zhu et al 2016 as the core unit of the mbfrs the membrane performs two major functions i e to work as a medium for gaseous substrate transfer and a carrier for microbial biomass attachment and growth sustainable adjustment of the transfer rate of the gas from membrane lumen to biofilm to match the rate of gaseous substrate utilization by functional microbes is crucial to effective methane utilization and denitrification martin and nerenberg 2012 ontiveros valencia et al 2018 many studies have reported that biofilm management on the gas transfer membrane in mbfrs is one feasible way to enhance gaseous substrates utilization efficiency modin et al 2010b lee et al 2019 where an excessively thick biofilm would cause substrates limitation due to diffusional resistance while a thin biofilm accompanied with insufficient biomass content exhibited rather low gaseous substrates utilization efficiency proper manageable biofilm structures and rational biomass distribution helped to enhance methane utilization and denitrification efficiency by affecting microbial deposition accumulation growth as well as substrate utilization lackner et al 2009 as biofilm behavior is related closely to the membrane surface properties and structures therefore achieving biofilm management by modification of the membrane surface is one of the options to tackle these two challenges constraining the engineering application of methane based denitrification mbfrs the objective of the present study is to prepare an innovative dlm for the mbfr and to investigate its enhancement for the system effectiveness the dlm was fabricated on the conventional hydrophobic pp membrane by electrospinning to provide more room for bacterial attachment and accumulation the effects of membrane structure on biofilm enrichment methane utilization and denitrification efficiency were evaluated in the mbfrs operated under batch and continuous modes special attentions were paid to the biofilm biomass enrichment and to sequential substrate utilization performance the obtained results provide useful guidance to bridge the lab scale to the engineering application of the mathene based mbfrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbfr system and experiments design the mbfr chamber was made from plexiglas tube with a total volume of 650 ml and a working volume of 600 ml similar to the previous reported mbfrs gaseous substrates including independent methane and oxygen gas were provided separatedly by gas storage and their flow rates were accurately controlled by mass flow meters mic21 beijing jes technology co ltd china two equal size mbfrs were operated in parallel fig 1 including a control mbfr consisting of polypropylene pp hollow fiber membrane teijin fibers ltd japan was marked as c mbfr and an experimental mbfr marked as e mbfr employed modified dlm module see section 2 2 each mbfr was installed with 32 pieces of membranes with an average length of 20 cm providing a total surface area of 40 20 cm2 and a specific surface area of 6 70 m2 m 3 the ame d culture used herein was derived from a mother mbfr that had been acclimated with active sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant shenzhen china and fed with continuous methane gas 99 99 shente gas co ltd china as the sole electron donor after incubation for over six months the mother mbfr had a nitrate removal rate of around 3 5 0 3 mg n l 1 d 1 the volatile suspended solids vss of the inoculated culture for mbfrs was averaged at 2300 mg l 1 upon which the methane oxidation rate in the mbfrs was about 1 3 mmol ch4 g 1 vss d 1 to ensure its perform aerobic mod for all mbfrs nitrate mineral salts nms containing chemical compositions of in every liter l distilled water of 330 mg cacl2 2h2o 480 mg mgso4 7h2o 9 1 mg feso4 7h2o and pre determined kno3 for varied nitrogen loading rate were mixed with inoculated culture in a volumetric ratio of 10 1 this mixed medium also included 2 ml l 1 phosphate buffer 1 ml l 1 acidic trace element solution and 1 ml l 1 alkaline element solution which was strictly followed the recipe described in detail by modin et al 2010a the c mbfr and e mbfr were operated side by side for over 100 days being comprised of 57 days batch mode phase with stepwise increase of feeding nitrate concentration and 49 days continuous mode operation with different hydraulic retention time hrt each mbfr was consistently fed with a gas mixture containing 75 ch4 and 25 o2 the gas pressure was kept at 22 psig to provide the methane flux of 194 mmol ch4 m 2 d 1 the operation condition parameters were summarized in table s1 for effective biofilm formation the mbfrs were initially operated under the batch mode comprised of phase i ii iii and iv during which the feeding solution contained an average no3 n concentration of 5 0 10 0 20 0 and 25 0 mg l 1 respectivel and each phase lasted for 2 to 4 operation cycles afterwards both of mbfrs were adjusted to the continuous mode by feeding 25 1 5 mg l 1 nitrate solution during which three hydraulic retention time hrt 24 18 and 12

delivered at the rate of 20 µl min 1 to the syringe nozzle electric field was generated by a high voltage power supplier whose anode and cathode was connected with the syringe nozzle and the aluminum plate respectively the pp membrane mounted on a homemade rotating plate was placed between nozzle and aluminum plate during the electrospinning the applied voltage was controlled at 15 kv to continuously eject spinning solution from the nozzle by which a fibrous layer was gradually formed and coated on the exterior of pp membrane the thickness of the spinning fiber layer was controlled by spinning time the obtained double layer membranes were dried at 60 cfor 4 h before its characterization and employment 2 3 membrane characterization the pp membrane and prepared dlm properties especially its structure and hydrophilicity were characterized their sectional profiles were observed by using a scanning electron microscope su8010 hitachi japan followed the previous report chen et al 2014 the hydrophilicity of the membrane indicated as its contact angle with water droplet was measured by using contact angle tester harke h00804 china the external fibrous structure of the dlm was characterized in terms of fiber diameter pore size and porosity by using an analyzer asap2020m micromeritics usa as an essentially thermodynamic process initial deposition of microorganisms onto the membrane surface mainly related with their interface interaction energy between them based on the extended derjaguin landau verwery oxerbeek xdlvo theory the interface energy was calculated according to eqs s1 to s11 described in supporting information the contact angles of the membrane with glycerin and methylene chloride were measured by contact angle tester and the zeta potential required to calculate these surface energy parameters was determined by zeta potentiometer nanotrac wave acemicrotrac inc usa 2 4 biofilm characterization the biofilm samples were collected regularly from c mbr and e mbr simultaneously by cutting off one piece of hollow fiber membrane the biofilm formed on the membrane surface and its spatial topography were visualized at different phases by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm a1r mp nikon japan during which more than 1 cm membrane fiber was stained with live dead biofilm viability kit invitrogen ca for 30 min and rinsed with filter sterilized water twice before images capturing zhou et al 2020 the biofilm was carefully sampled from the membrane surface at the same sampling time as clsm and the biomass density was measured following the modified methods according to the literatures modin et al 2010b celmer et al 2008 in brief the membrane modules were removed separately from the mbfrs and the biofilm biomass was collected manually with a plastic spatula from the membranes of known length and number and then transferred and re suspended into a 50 ml beaker the re suspended biomass sludge solution was filtered onto a pre weighted glass fiber filter with a constant weight m0 which was then dried at 103 105 c for 120 min to a constant weight m1 after thoroughly cooling to room temperature subsequently above dried glass fiber filter

min after thoroughly cooling to room temperature their constant weight marked as m3 could be obtained accordingly the biomass density of membrane with known surface area s was thus calculated by eq 1

fibrous structure was successfully obtained figure s2a and 2b by using the electrostatic spinning method this dlm surface was uniformly covered by fibrous layer with a thickness of around 35 μm different from the base pp membrane solely with the hydrophobic surface the dlm surface was evenly covered by pan fibrous that had a normalized pore size of around 6 μm which was more than 5 times larger than those of the microorganisms figure s2b table s2 this fibrous structure of dlm and their relative large pore size provided sufficient interspace with a high porosity of over 70 and micro environments for bacterial attachment and colonization and then favored accompanied biofilm growth and metabolism moreover this dlm also had a rather hydrophobic external surface that was indicated by the increased water contact angle from 85 4 1 7 to 100 7 2 3 beneath which meanwhile has a tight base membrane surface this relative hydrophobic outer surface allowed direct attachment and colonization of biomass which was highly beneficial for the microbial accumulation and effective gaseous substrate transportation 3 2 denitrification flux in the batch mode mbfrs the modified dlm was employed to the e mbfr and was operated in parallel with the c mbfr at the batch mode firstly for about 60 days fig 2 with continuous supply of gaseous substrates the nitrate concentration in both of c mbfr and e mbfr was gradually decreased from 5 mg l 1 to below 0 5 mg l 1 after 9 days start up operation at phase i without any carbon sources added meaning successful biological denitrification utilizing the carbon source derived from aerobic methane oxidation at this start phase both of c mbfr and e mbfr displayed relatively limited nitrate reduction flux of around 75 mg n m 2 d 1 after sequential 6 days operation the nitrate removal flux of c mbfr stepwise increased to 160 5 mg n m 2 d 1 and consistently produced low effluent nitrate concentration below 0 3 mg l 1 in comparison the nitrate removal flux of the e mbfr reached to 112 5 mg n m 2 d 1 at the end of phase i when the influent nitrate concentration increased to 10 mg l 1 at phase ii the nitrate reduction flux of c mbfr quickly increased to 292 5 mg n m 2 d 1 after 7 days more than 0 7 times higher than that in e mbfr notwithstanding the nitrate reduction rate of the e mbfr accelerated sharply at day 22 after which it increased from 169 5 to 321 0 mg n m 2 d 1 after 5 days operation therefore at the end of phase ii both e mbfr and c mbfr obtained a rather comparable level for nitrate reduction afterwards once the influent nitrate concentration increased up to 20 mg l 1 at phase iii the nitrate reduction profile in the c mbfr began to be rather different from e mbfr as it displayed slight change and gradually reached a stable level of 385 5 mg n m 2 d 1 in contrast the nitrate reduction flux in the e mbfr performed a higher nitrate removal flux than the c mbfr at day 28 and thereafter kept a continuously increasing trend finally e mbfr achieved the maximum nitrate reduction flux of 622 5 mg n m 2 d 1 approximately 1 5 times of that of the c mbfr to further evaluate the stability of the denitrification performance of the mbfr and the reliability of the dlm an elevated nitrage concentration over 25 mg l 1 was used in phase ⅳ and it was clearly observed that e mbfr and c mbfr relatively stable denitrification by matured biofilms while e mbfr 622 5 mg n m 2 d 1 displayed consistently higher nitrate removal flux than c mbfr 392 5 mg n m 2 d 1 throughout the experiments the nitrite concentrations in both of the c mbfr and e mbfr effluent were less than 0 2 mg l 1 probably because that the nitrite reduction to n2 was not the limiting step for overall denitrification process alrashed et al 2018 lee et al 2019 therefore after a long term batch mode operation although the c mbfr performed a relatively higher denitrification rate in the initial phase the results clearly demonstrated that the e mbfr exhibited a significantly high denitrification capability in term of nitrate removal flux due to the employment of the dlm 3 3 biofilm formation and biomass characteristics in the batch mode mbfrs under the same gaseous substrates pressure and ratio for mbfrs the varied membranes employed within them took major responsible to their rather distinct biofilm formation accumulation and growth profiles during the batch mode operation phases the biofilm coverage on the membrane surface and biofilm biomass density were visually characterized in the initial 5 days at phase i after inoculation the sem and clsm observations of the biofilm displayed that there were rather limited active microorganisms visualized as rarely green dots on the base pp membrane figure s3a1 fig 3 a1 while more active microorganisms found on the dlm although which had rather fluffy and loose spatial structure figure s3b1 fig 3b1 the biomass density quantified above difference and indicated that the biomass on the dlm was about 24 g vss m 2 that was more than 10 times higher than that on the base pp membrane this phenomena indeed was resulted from the beneficial roles from dlm structural design and from its favorable interfacial energy for bacterial attachment with the progression of mbfrs operation the visualized biofilm images in phase ⅱ demonstrated that the dlm surface had been almost completely covered by activated microbes figure s3b2 fig 3b2 while less than 60 surface of the base pp membrane was occupied by co existing bacterial clusters figure s3a2 fig 3a2 meanwhile the biomass density on the dlm continuously increased to 49 g vss m 2 over 7 times higher than that on the base pp membrane the biofilm on the base pp membrane began to accumulate from phase iii and gradually increased from 6 47 to 28 26 g vss m 2 until the phase ⅳ the biomass density on the base pp membrane and dlm reached to rather stable level of about 70 and 36 g vss m 2 respectively figure s3 fig 3a4 b4 c thus it is reasonable to recognize that the dlm employed in the mbfr could quickly accumulate microorganisms at the initial start up phase and help to obtain sufficient active biomass content at the matured phase this quick biofilm formation as well as high active biomass content take the major roles to enhance mbfr denitrification efficiency and gaseous substrate utilization efficiency considering the correlation between biofilms characteristics in fig 3 and no3 n removal performance in fig 2 it is noted that the improved no3 n removal flux during phase i to iii in whether e mbfr or c mbfr were initially attributed to gradually accumulation of biofilms biomass with operation time for c mbfr the no3 n removal flux was increased by almost 6 times from phase i to iii corresponding to the enrichment of biofilm biomass by about 15 times similar trend was also observed in e mbfr where the no3 n removal flux increased with the increase of biofilm biomass however there was rather insignificant improvement of the no3 n removal flux observed in both e mbfr and c mbfr at phase iv when the biofilm biomass was increased by 13 5 and 26 8 respectively the reason might be attributed to the limitation for substrate diffusion that was resulted from thick biofilm biomass accumulation martin et al 2013 celmer et al 2008 hwang et al 2010 the substrate transport and utilization profiles in the biofilm would be discussion in detail in section 4 2 3 4 methane utilization and microbial activities in continuous mode mbfrs after the biofilm matured the batch mode operation was changed to continuous mode one to evaluate the effects of applied hrts onto the mbfrs performance at day 57 the results of biomass density demonstrated that the average biomass density of mature biofilm attached on the dlm and base pp membrane was stably kept at 70 and 36 g vss m 2 respectively at the end of batch mode operation fig 3b according to the same measured method it was estimated that the average biofilm density of e mbfr and c mbfr during continuous mode operation were also kept at 70 and 36 g vss m 2 respectively by monitoring the dissolved methane concentration in the mbfr bulk and its effluent nitrate concentration for each hrt at continuous mode operation figure s4 the methane utilization efficiency methane oxidation rate and denitrification rate could be estimated for each mbfr at different hrts table 2 attributing to dlm employment and its induced high biofilm biomass the methane leakage was effectively constrained in e mbfr accompanying with its consistently higher methane utilization efficiency than those in the c mbr which appeared to be independent on the applied hrts the denitrification rate in the c mbfr was changed insignificantly under varied hrts from 12 to 24 h in comparison short hrt was beneficial to the nitrate removal flux in the e mbfr although its effluent nitrate concentration was slightly increased accordingly e mbfr displayed the highest nitrate removal flux of over 740 mg n m 2 d 1 and methane utilization efficiency of 64 when the hrt was kept at 12 h which were over 0 6 and 0 3 times higher than c mbfr respectively the results from continuous mode operation evidenced that dlm employment could simultaneously enhance the nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency giving rise to great significance to the application of mbfrs from the result of fig 3c the biomass density of the matured e mbfr biofilm was almost two times of that in the c mbfr denoting quite thicker biofilm formed in e mbfr it is worth noting that the denitrifier in the c mbfr represented a better specific denitrification rate rd rate than e mbfr table 2 which was most likely to be no3 n diffusion limitations in the thick biofilms or even inactive cell accumulation in e mbfr martin et al 2013 hwang et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 nerenberg 2016 notwithstanding the e mbfr still displayed higher methane utilization efficiency rm efficiency and denitrification removal flux 3 5 microbial community structurs in mbfrs besides the effectivenesses enhancement in terms of denitrification efficiency and methane utilization efficiency dlm employment in the e mbfr also affected the microbial community structures including relative bacterial abundances at the class level and the relative abundances of relevant functional bacterial texa of the biofilm fromed in e mbfr fig 4 a which was rather different from those in the c mbfr and related closely with the membrane structure and surface properties from the class level anaerolineae γ proteobacteria and α proteobacteria were the most abundant in both mbfrs accounting for 14 87 21 71 and 8 92 in c mbfr and 17 15 8 23 and 6 34 in e mbfr respectively many studies had reported that anaerolineae that may exert the function of denitrification was widely available in anaerobic reactors li and lu 2017 sotres et al 2016 meanwhile α proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria were the major subdivision containing aerobic methane oxidizers and denitrifiers and played key roles in the cycle of nitrogen ho et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 aerobic methanotrophs mainly including methylococcaceae methylocystaceae and beijirinckiaceae which execute methane oxidation were all detected in c mbfr and e mbfr fig 4b among these methylococcaceae that belongs to type ii aerobic methanotrophs was predominance with the abundance of 1 18 in c mbfr followed by 0 73 beijirinckiaceae and 0 63 methylocystaceae concurring well with previous reported mbfrs where its importance in aerobic methane oxidation has been recognized xu et al 2020 in comparison two typical type ii aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and beijirinckiaceae were found to be the dominant methane oxidizer enriched in e mbfr which accounted for 1 12 and 1 14 abundance respectively fig 4b at the same time there major denitrifying bacteria xanthomonadaceae rhodocyclaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae were enriched in both of c mbfr and e mbfr the abundance of these three predominant functional denitrifier in c mbfr was 2 07 0 65 and 1 83 respectively in comparison to the corresponding abundance in e mbfr was 1 44 4 08 and 1 63 respectively it was also noted that rhodocyclaceae was the most domain denitrifier in e mbfr representing approximately 6 28 times of that in c mbfr except for relative functional bacterial caldilineaceae and microtrichaceae were the most abundant in both mbfrs which accounted for 3 54 and 6 65 in c mbfr and 4 55 and 5 04 in e mbfr respectively it has been demonstrated in the literatures that caldilineaceae and microtrichaceae correlated with the formation of biofilms in mbr yu et al 2018 tu et al 2020 in the mbfrs key operation condition parameters such as gaseous substrates pressure and loading rate are essential to biofilm growth and functional microorganisms enrichment ontiveros valencia et al 2018 in this study the high gaseous substrates pressure of around 22 psig and stepwise increased nitrate concentration from 5 0 to 25 0 mg l 1 ensured sufficient substrates transport and high nitrate surface loading rate providing a beneficial environment for growth and enrichment of functional microorganisms it was thus observed that there is a positively correlation of biofilm density in the mbfrs with the influent nitrate concentration fig 3 which concurred well with previous reports that demonstrated the obvious enrichment of aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers by the increment of gaseous substrates pressure and nitrate loading rate xu et al 2020 cao et al 2019 nie et al 2019 lee et al 2019 therefore it is worthy to note that the influent nitrate concentration would beneficially affect functional microorganisms enrichment in the mbfrs 4 discussion 4 1 enhanced bacterial accumulation and biofilm formation on the dlm biofilm formation is a process that consists of three steps initial bacterial adsorption bacterial consolidation and colonization notermans et al 1991 from the direct observation of the biofilm formation on the membranes fig 3a b it was observed that the initial bacterial adsorption and accumulation rates onto the dlm surfaces were quite higher than those onto the base pp membrane this meant that dlm surface accelerated the bacterial adsorption and accumulation significantly at the start up phase two major reasons are taking responsible for this advantage raised from dlm the first is that the outer fiber layer possessing sufficient porous structure provided effective spatial habitat for bacterial adsorption and biofilm formation this fiber layer had intertwining fibrous structure resembled a sieve that could quickly trap microorganisms into its inner side pores with assist of hydraulic shear and transportation figure s2b2 another one is that the beneficial interfacial interaction between microorganism and membrane raised from the dlm which played important roles for the initial attachment and deposition of microorganisms onto the membrane the comparison of the interfacial interaction energies when the microorganisms approached to the base pp membrane and the dlm was carried out table s3 and fig 5 it was recognized that the single microbe have to overcome energy barrier resistance before approaching to base pp membrane or dlm from the liquid bulk partial enlargement of fig 5a1 and a2 showed that both membranes and microbes had an energy barrier around 5 nm while the energy barrier between the dlm surface and microbe was 3186 kt which was lower than that of the base pp membrane of 5905 kt this indicated that the microbes were much easier to overcome the energy barrier to close to dlm membrane afterwards the interfacial interaction energy between the microbe and membrane were both negative meaning their attractive force for possible bacterial attachment once the interface distance d between the single microbe and the membrane is smaller than d0 0 158 nm this microbe would be deemed to successful deposit onto the membrane surface it was estimated that when the microbes were initially adsorbed on the dlm surface their interface interaction energy per unit area was 9 71 10 5 kj m 2 while the corresponding value for the base pp membrane was 7 75 10 5 kj m 2 this implied that microbes were easier to irreversibly attach onto the dlm membrane from fig 5b1 and b2 it was also clear that the lewis acid base effect played a dominant role when the distance between the microbe and membrane was less than 1 nm the rather lower interface interaction energy from the dlm implied that the microbes would be much more readily captured from bulk solution which then resulted in high biomass accumulation rate notwithstanding the captured microbes at the initial phase was easily attached to the outer side of the dlm which in turn reduced the possibility of microbes penetrating fibrous layer and reaching the bottom of the fibrous layer and thus resulted in the failure of bacterial colonization on the inner pp membrane this phenomena might also explain the lower nitrate removal flux in the e mbfr at start up phase fig 2 regarding the hydrophobic base pp membrane although there were few microbes attached on it during the initial phase the biofilm directly attached to the pp membrane surface would create a highly advantageous habitat i e the microbes could survive directly with the gaseous substrates ontiveros valencia et al 2018 wu et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable that the c mbfr performed better nitrate removal flux than the e mbfr from phase i to ii fig 2 considering the relatively large amount of microorganisms on the dlm at the initial stages it is conceivable that the biofilm would further produce much more slimy adhesive substances e g eps that would promote microbial consolidation and growth lai et al 2018 ontiveros valencia et al 2018 therefore the biomass density on the dlm at phase ii reached to 49 g vss m 2 which was one time higher in contrast with that at phase i accompanying with the continuous growth of biofilm on the dlm microbes was then gradually colonized from the external fiber layer to the internal pp membrane surface leading to an impressive increasing of gaseous substrate utilization efficiency and nitrate removal flux finally the biomass density of matured biofilm on the dlm was about 70 g vss m 2 which was approximately 2 times of that on the pp membrane and attributed to its advantageous habitat provided by high porous structure and beneficial interfacial interaction energy 4 2 manageable biofilm improved denitrification and methane utilization the high biomass density on the dlm fig 3 helped e mbfr to obtain a high nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency compared to the c mbfr table 2 especially upon the functional microorganisms distributed spontaneously on the dlm surface as illustrated in fig 6 the ch4 diffusion from membrane lumen into the bulk liquid mainly including i gas transfer from the membrane to biofilm ii gas utilization by aerobic methanotrophs in biofilm and iii gas transfer from biofilm to the bulk martin and nerenberg 2012 rittmann 2018 in brief the total methane flux in step i described by eq 8 mainly depends on both the gas supply pressure and the parameters of the membrane wall martin and nerenberg 2012 8 j t f l u x h p t m p t m c m b where jt flux is the methane total flux mmol ch4 l 2 t 1 h is henry s law constant l2 t 2 p is membrane permeability t 1 tm is the thickness of the membrane p is the partial pressure in membrane lumen cmb is the concentration of dissolved methane at the interface between the membrane and biofilm as for the circumstance of the dlm which would supply rather comparable total methane supply flux as pp membrane when the differences of methanotrophs activities and the influences of microbial consolidation in membrane lumen onto the mass transfer resistance were neglected fig 6 since that aerobic methane oxidation was mainly occurred in step ii and was mainly accomplished by methanotrophs using o2 molecules zhu et al 2016 rhee and fuhs 1978 modin et al 2007 the methane consumption flux for the biofilm on the membrane surface could be presented in eq 7 according to multiplicative mond kinetics bae and rittmann 1996 alrashed et al 2018 9 j c f l u x q max f 1 x f s f 1 k 1 s f 1 s f 2 k 2 s f 2 where jc flux is the methane consumption flux mmol ch4 l 2 t 1 sf1 and sf2 is ch4 and do concentration in the biofilm mmol ch4 l 3 and mmol o2 l 3 respectively qmax is the maximum specific methane utilization rate of methanotrophic bacteria mmol ch4 g 1 cell t 1 f1 is the fraction of methanotrophic bacteria xf is the biomass density g cell l 2 k1 and k2 represent the half maximum rate concentration for methane mmol ch4 l 3 and o2 mmol o2 l 3 respectively the kinetic parameters including qmax k1 and k2 are constant in all methane consumption reactions while k1 and k2 was 0 45 mg l 1 and 61 µg l 1 respectively van bodegom et al 2001 considering that the methane and do concentration inside the biofilm of whether c mbfr or e mbfr was much higher than k1 and k2 respectively which meant that the monod term sf1 k1 sf1 and sf2 k2 sf2 for these two mbfrs were rather similar therefore the methane consumption flux depends dominantly on xf and f1 meanwhile the 16s rrna gene profiles in fig 4b revealed the relatively abundant of aerobic methanetrophic f1 in c mbfr was very close to those of e mbfr compared to the matured biofilm attached to the base pp membrane the biomass density xf of dlm was significantly higher meaning a greater methane consumption flux fig 6 based on these results herein the biomass density xf of the matured biofilm attached on dlm was about 2 times of that on pp membrane fig 3c which contributed to the methane utilization efficiency of e mbfr was 1 13 1 36 times of those in c mbfr under varied hrt table 2 according to the mass balances methods proposed by lee et al 2019 it is further concluded that the methane leakage flux jl flux was the methane total flux jt flux minus the methane consumption flux js flux therefore the methane leak flux jl flux of e mbfr was found to be much lower than that of c mbfr the above analysis concurred well with the dissolved methane concentration results in the bulk solution figure s4 moreover the accumulation of dissolved methane in c mbfr and e mbfr also implied a faster methane transfer rate than its consumption rate which thus confirmed that methane oxidation was the rate limiting step for the denitrification efficiency alrashed et al 2018 from the biochemical mechanism of ame d process it is noted that higher methane consumption flux of e mbfr would result in a higher organic metabolite excreted by aerobic methanotrophs accordingly denitrifying bacteria in e mbfr would obtain more carbon intermediates to remove nitrate biologically the high abundance functional microorganism species and their rational spatial distribution on dlm in e mbfr also contributed to the enhanced nitrate removal flux for example the dominated methylocystaceae population in the e mbfr would attribute to the enhancement of denitrification efficiency since type ⅱ aerobic methanotrophs could release more organic carbon for denitrifiers compared to type ⅰ aerobic methanotrophs ho et al 2016 bao et al 2014 alrashed et al 2018 moreover rhodocyclaceae belonging to methanol utilization denitrifiers was the most domain denitrifier in e mbfr and could also preferentially utilize methanol as organic carbon at a high metabolizing rate xu et al 2020 kalyuhznaya et al 2009 cao et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 which would be a benefit for improving the denitrification efficiency therefore efficient biofilm management on the dlm and thereby rational functional microorganisms enrichment are effective to simultaneously enhance the nitrate removal rate and the methane utilization efficiency in the mbfr 4 3 environmental implications a dlm was prepared by constructing the outer fiber layer intertwining fibrous structure on the exterior of base pp hollow fiber via electrostatic spinning method this fibrous structure resembled a sieve with a porosity over 70 and provided sufficient habitat for biofilm formation and also had a fovarable interface interaction energy circumstances to improve bacteria initial attachment leading to high biofilm biomass density of 70 g vss m 2 that was more than 2 times of that on the base pp membrane enhanced biomass accumulation and high biofilm density in the e mbfr achieved the maximum increment of over 30 in methane utilization efficiency and 60 in denitrification efficiency employment of dlm in the e mbfr also help to obtain rational function microorganism distribution considering the volumetric denitrification rate in the conventional wwtps is approximately 400 mg no3 n l 1 d 1 and the maximum nitrate removal flux observed in e mbfr a dlm packing density of more than 650 m2 m 3 could be satisfy the overall denitrification requirement of the wwtps which is far below that of a commercial mbfrs with a packing density of above 2000 m2 m 3 lee et al 2018 overall this study provides an innovative scalable double layer membrane to achieve stable enhancement of mbfrs performance for ame d process which offers great potential to address challenging issues pertaining to mbfr engineering application 5 conclusion the surface properties of the membrane used in mbfr affect the ame d performance by changing the biofilm formation profiles and influencing the substrates transport and utilization this study developed a reliable enhancement way for nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency by employment of an innovative scalable dlm this dlm performed excellently in bacterial attachment and accumulation for biofilm growth and obtained more than 2 times biofilm biomass density of the base pp membrane which was mainly owing to the outer fiber layer structure of dlm and its favorable interfacial interaction with microorganisms upon the new membrane employed both nitrate removal flux and methane utilization efficiency in the e mbfr were simultaneously increased to around 60 and 30 respectively and this simultaneous enhancement is reported for the first time so far the accelerated biomass accumulation and improved biofilm density in the e mbfr would also give rise to self regulation of functional microbes on the membrane surface and then help to efficiently utilize gaseous substrates and produce carbon sources for denitrification in this e mbfr type ⅱ aerobic methanotrophs methylocystaceae and methanol utilization denitrifiers rhodocyclaceae were dominantly enriched functional microbes that execute cross food synergy and take important role in the enhancement of the mbfr performance credit authorship

17146,it is critical to both effectively remove and recover phosphate p from wastewater given the wide ranging environmental i e preventing eutrophication and restoring water quality and economic i e overcoming p resource scarcity benefits more recently considerable academic effort has been devoted towards harvesting p as vivianite which can be used as a potential slow release fertilizer and possible reagent for the manufacture of lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 the precursor in fabricating li ion secondary batteries in this study we propose an innovative p recovery process in which p is first preconcentrated via a flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi device followed by immobilization as vivianite crystals in a fluidized bed crystallization fbc column the effects of different operational parameters on fcdi p preconcentration performance and energy consumption are investigated results show that 63 of p can be removed and concentrated in the flow electrode chamber with a reasonable energy requirement under optimal operating conditions the fbc system resulted in immobilization of 80 of p as triangular or quadrangular pellets which were verified to be high purity

living organisms is an increasingly scarce and non renewable natural resource lei et al 2020 wu et al 2020 given present trends in global population growth and diet preference i e more meat and dairy based diets the demand for p fertilizers for use in modern agriculture is envisaged to substantially increase over the coming decades cordell et al 2009 currently almost all p fertilizers are obtained from p mines located in several countries e g morocco china and the united states at an annual mining rate of 20 million metric tonnes globally cordell et al 2009 cordell et al 2011 lei et al 2017 it is estimated that accessible p minerals could be exhausted within the next 50 100 years at current mining rates provided no breakthrough is achieved in enhancing p mining usage efficiency cordell et al 2009 in addition the fertilizer producers also recognize that due to the mining of lower grade ore the quality of existing p reserves is declining leading to cost increases associated with mining processing and shipping lei et al 2017 on the other hand a significant fraction of the consumed p ultimately ends up in wastewaters e g dairy shed effluent municipal discharges which have been shown to cause severe environmental problems such as eutrophication and consequent formation of hypoxic zones in natural waters e g lakes reservoirs estuaries and the open ocean copetti et al 2016 mayer et al 2016 ye et al 2017 judicious p management is a global grand challenge hukari et al 2016 macintosh et al 2018 one obvious way to alleviate p resource shortages and reduce the potential risks to water contamination is to recover and reuse p from wastewaters presenting significant economic and environmental benefits bradford hartke et al 2015 lei et al 2017 for example it is estimated that p contained in sewage if properly recovered could meet 15 20 of the global demand for p yuan et al 2012 existing p recovery strategies include biological processes chemical precipitation and crystallization desmidt et al 2014 loganathan et al 2014 ye et al 2017 while each technique has its merits and drawbacks the general principle is similar i e convert the soluble p into solid form and separate from wastewater for further refinement and reuse for instance current wastewater treatment plants wwtps generally introduce additional iron or aluminum salts into activated sludge systems to efficiently precipitate dissolved p in order to comply with the increasingly stringent discharge standards wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 nevertheless effective separation and recovery of these precipitates as high purity p products that meet market requirements remain a great challenge p crystallization which enables the extraction of refined larger sized and thus separable products has been demonstrated in pilot and full scale wwtps especially in european countries such as switzerland and the netherlands which suffer from p shortages desmidt et al 2014 one well developed available approach is to simultaneously remove p and ammonium and fix them as struvite magnesium ammonium p mgnh4po4 6h2o crystals a commonly used slow release fertilizer kim et al 2018 however struvite crystals can only be formed under strictly controlled conditions i e high p concentration appropriate mg nh4 po4 molar ratio and ph range hug and udert 2013 typically as the concentration of mg is much lower compared to p and ammonium in most wastewaters an additional dosage of mg source is invariably required liu et al 2018 reducing the economic feasibility of this technology more recently p removal and recovery as vivianite crystals has been proposed and thus attracted considerable attentions li et al 2018b prot et al 2019 wu et al 2019b importantly it has been revealed that vivianite is the major p sink in iron dosing wwtps wilfert et al 2018 wilfert et al 2016 wu et al 2019b compared with a struvite based approach this alternative could be more economically viable as the reagent costs are significantly decreased by dosing fe ii instead of the more expensive mg source in addition for wastewaters containing insufficient ammonium the vivianite pathway has further economic appeal the recovered vivianite crystals can either be used in the electronics industry or potentially as an agricultural fertilizer tian et al 2019 wu et al 2019b however iit remains a great challenge however to recover high quality p crystals with an expected purity of 95 directly from wastewaters due to the low p concentration and the presence of other co existing species such as organic matter which may influence the crystallization process and lower product quality chen et al 2017 lei et al 2018 prot et al 2019 thus a pretreatment process to selectively enrich p and remove block co existing impurities is highly desirable flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi although initially developed as a promising brackish water desalination technology could be a suitable alternative given its excellent nutrient enrichment performance bian et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 it should be emphasized that this enrichment is expected to facilitate the crystallization process via enhancing the ion activity and consequently the level of supersaturation liu et al 2018 furthermore macromolecular and weakly charged pollutants could also be effectively blocked from entering the electrode chamber due to the presence of ion exchange membranes iems vanoppen et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 this selectivity is anticipated to enhance fe availability for vivianite crystallization by for example reducing complexation by organic matter thereby improving the purity of recovered products in this study a fcdi fbc coupled system was employed to extract p from both a simple feed solution and a more complex solution representative of anaerobic digestion supernatant and further convert it into vivianite crystals the primary objectives of the current study are to i investigate the performance of an fcdi system with respect to p selective preconcentration and impurities removal from feed solutions typical of wastewaters ii determine the optimum parameters for fcdi operation and iii evaluate vivianite crystal formation in a coupled fbc system and thoroughly characterize the extracted products 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemical reagents used

closed cycle scc or isolated closed cycle icc mode with the wastewater running through the spacer chamber in single pass mode see si fig s1 during icc operation the positively and negatively charged flow electrodes are individually recirculated between their respective reservoirs and electrode chambers in contrast the two flow electrodes streams in scc mode are mixed in a shared reservoir where the oppositely charged carbon electrodes can be neutralized resulting in the release of the absorbed ions and regeneration of the exhausted electrodes he et al 2018 the flow electrode was continuously recycled between the reservoir and fcdi cell at a flowrate of 29 ml min 1 controlled by a peristaltic pump bt100 1l longer the effects of operational parameters i e current density 0 28 6 a m 2 and

vernier connected to the data acquisition system sensordaq vernier the current i and voltage v through the electrical circuit were recorded every ten seconds using the vernier current probe the concentrated stream brine can be effectively separated from the flow electrodes either by settling the solid particle electrodes via gravity or through a microfiltration mf module immersed in the electrode reservoir as reported previously he et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020a the mf module provided by our industry partner jiuwu hi tech nanjing china has a length of 50 mm outer diameter of 12 mm inner diameter of 6 mm and pore size of 0 45 μm the ion concentrations were measured using ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex with a cg16 5 50 mm guard column and a cs16 5 250 mm separation column ph was continuously monitored using a ph meter inserted within the recirculation pipeline outside the fbc column vivianite production using fbc after every 2 hours of operation the concentrated electrolyte p rich stream was separated from the solid electrode particles by using a mf module immersed in the electrode reservoir the collected p rich stream ferrous sulfate and naoh or hno3 solutions were fed into the crystallizer at particular flowrates using a peristaltic pump the ph and fe ii p molar ratio were set at 6 and 1 5 the theoretical fe ii p ratio in vivianite respectively the fbc is an acrylic cylindrical column composed of a lower reaction zone inner diameter of 2 cm height of 80 cm and volume of 252 ml and upper settling zone inner diameter of 4 cm height of 20 cm and volume of 252 ml as shown in fig 1 the sudden expansion of the settling zone compared to the reaction zone results in a reduced hydraulic loading preventing the generated fine particles from draining out the hrt and internal recirculation rate for the crystallizer were controlled at 72 min and 500 respectively which resulted in an up flow velocity of 30 m h 1 to suppress fe

results and discussions 3 1 salt removal and p preconcentration using fcdi 3 1 1 treatment of the simple synthetic wastewater the influences of current density and hrt on icc fcdi desalination performance and cell voltage are presented in fig 2 for a fixed hrt while higher current density led to reduced effluent conductivity the cell voltage increased accordingly fig 2b note that a turning optimal point occurred where a sharp increase in cell voltage was observed fig 2b it would not be economically effective to operate the fcdi at a current density beyond the turning point due to the excessively high energy consumption at a hrt of 1 96 min the turning point appeared at the current density of 11 4 a m 2 with a reasonable cell voltage of 2 0 v achieved while higher salt removal rates can be obtained at longer hrts the water productivity is compromised and higher cell voltage is required inducing undesired side reactions thus the optimal hrt of 1 96 min was used for subsequent investigations the results also demonstrate that the fcdi system was capable of reducing p and cl concentrations in the feed stream to extremely low levels though low ion concentrations in the spacer chamber will result in a dramatic increase in cell voltage and operating cost fig 3 a and fig 3b interestingly no obvious variations in p cl selectivity 0 8 1 2 were observed when changing current density and hrt while the larger p hydrated ionic radius is expected to reduce its movement compared to cl within the fcdi unit its higher average valence 50 hpo4 2 and 50 h2po4 under a condition similar to that of ad supernatant should enhance its migration within the electric field given the balance between these two influencing factors similar ion removal efficiency and minor selectivity differences were observed fig 3c with the optimal parameters obtained from the preliminary studies the salt and p removal performances were investigated in both icc and scc operation modes as displayed in fig 4 both p and cl concentrations in the effluent stream showed a sharp decrease before attaining an approximate steady state under both operational conditions with fairly similar removal efficiencies achieved 62 for cl and 63 for p respectively in both scc and icc modes we also calculated the electrical energy consumption normalized to the volume of water treated e v and normalized to the amount of p removed e p and p flux f p of the fcdi system according to eqs 4 6 note that e v and e p were 0 38 kwh m 3 and 2 98 kwh kg 1 p in scc mode with these values almost half of those for icc mode with an e v of 0 88 kwh m 3 and e p of 6 94 kwh kg 1 p nevertheless similar f p values 41 6 kg p m 2 d 1 were observed in both modes as they were all operated under the same current density with high charge efficiencies as illustrated in table 1 the p recovery performance in the fcdi system under investigation here is comparable to that of other electrochemical systems with regard to a range of commonly used metrics η p e v e p and f p during the fcdi operation removed ions will gradually accumulate in the flow electrodes chambers resulting in the linear increment of ion concentrations observed in fig 4a and 4b in icc mode the p concentration in the anode electrolyte reached 500 mg l whereas the cl concentration was 300 mg l 1 on analyzing the mass balance fig 4a it was surprising to find that 63 5 of p and 25 5 of cl were eventually present in the anode electrolyte fig s2 continuous measurement of the anode electrolyte ph provide a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon as the electrolyte solutions are relatively unbuffered at least in the case of use of simple feed stream even limited occurrence of faradaic reactions such as oxidation of flow anode carbon particles and oxygen reduction by flow cathode particles is likely to result in short term ph changes in the flow electrode chambers as illustrated in fig 4a the electrolyte ph gradually decreased from 7 initially to 2 at the end of the experiment nativ et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a note that p will be mostly converted from charged species hpo4 2 and h2po4 to uncharged species h3po4 when the ph decreased to lower than 2 pk a for this acid base pair is 2 12 favoring p desorption from charged electrode particles to the electrolyte as for scc mode the positively and negatively charged electrodes will be mixed and neutralized in a shared reservoir within which the absorbed ions are spontaneously released back into the electrolyte the final p and cl concentrations reached 500 and 550 mg l 1 respectively fig 4b the occurrence of significant ongoing change in ph will be mitigated by the neutralisation that occurs on mixing of flow anode and flow cathode streams in the electrolyte reservoir with the electrolyte ph stabilized at 7 mass balance calculations revealed that the majority of removed ions 98 cl and 100 p were finally present in the electrolyte fig s2 these results demonstrated that the charged electrodes can be fully regenerated with the adsorbed ions being completely released therefore scc would be a better option in view of both the higher ion recovery efficiencies and lower energy consumption he et al 2018 3 1 2 treatment of the complex synthetic wastewater fcdi was also employed to treat a solution containing constituents typical of a more complex wastewater including calcium and ammonium ions as well as organic matter as the salinity of this more complex solution was much higher than that of the simple electrolyte used in initial studies a higher current density of 22 8 a m 2 was employed with the hrt fixed at 1 96 min as illustrated in fig s3 the conductivity of the wastewater decreased from 6400 to 3450 μs cm 1 after fcdi treatment and remained fairly stable during the treatment process the distribution of particular ions and toc between the electrolyte and effluent streams is illustrated in fig s4 note that nearly 40 of the p was concentrated in the electrolyte with the rest remaining in the effluent this is a lower proportion than obtained in the case of the simple feed solution with the decrease attributed to competition from otherco existing ions importantly organic matter was effectively blocked from transport to the electrode chamber by the iem while hardness ions such as ca2 readily migrated through the cation exchange membrane into the cathode chamber where they were principally electrosorbed by the negatively charged carbon particles though some calcium carbonate precipitation was also evident zhang et al 2018 note that less than 10 of the ca and toc were present in the concentrated electrolyte with their absence greatly reducing the load on the ensuing fbc process and improving the purity of the harvested vivianite products regular acid alkali washing is required to remove accumulated materials from the spacer and electrode chambers 3 2 p recovery as vivianite crystals in an fbc reactor 3 2 1 crystal formation based on our previous studies the concentrated electrolyte 50 60 ml every 2 hour can be effectively separated from the slurry electrodes by using a mf module immersed in the electrode reservoir fig 1 zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020a the electrolyte p rich stream obtained following such mf separation and additional fe ii solution were introduced to a fbc to produce vivianite crystals to simplify the crystallization process only p rich stream collected from the simple wastewater was used during the operation green flocs were observed in the column at the beginning of the experiments during day 1 fig s5a c which gradually changed to small green particles at day 2 fig s5d f before generating blue particles after day 4 fig s5g h as can be seen from the photos in fig s5i the recovered products were light green pellets it is reported that pure vivianite is colorless and becomes opaque with a green or blue hue once oxidized wu et al 2019b while we have attempted to remove most of the oxygen via nitrogen gas aeration in the feed stream trace amounts of oxygen will still exist in the bulk solution causing the partial oxidation particularly of fe ii located at near the surface of the newly produced vivianite indeed it is difficult to find pure vivianite in most natural environments wu et al 2019b 3 2 2 morphology and size distribution of the pellets collected from the fbc process as can be seen from the photo in fig 5 a the recovered products possessed a light green color and were agglomerated as a loosely structured powder further investigations via optical light microscopy and sem analysis provided more detailed information about the pellet microstructure as clearly shown in the optical microscope images fig s6a c the majority of recovered pellets possessed a consistent morphology of either a triangular or quadrangular shape for example p pellets obtained after 48 hours of operation were mostly semi transparent quadrangular crystals with high uniformity and sizes ranging from 5 to 30 μm fig s6b in contrast crystals with darker colors and greater sizes which ranged from 20 to 80 μm were obtained when the fbc was operated for 228 hours fig s6c with these results demonstrating the growth of crystals during this period a steady p removal efficiency of 91 5 was reached during the operation at the end of the operation 372 hours the samples were collected and examined using sem and eds mapping as can be observed from the sem images in fig 5b d the primary crystals had relatively smooth surfaces with platy morphology with some smaller agglomerates sporadically attached to the surface of the larger crystals these larger crystals were generally composed of multiple thin layers with a size and thickness of 120 μm and 20 μm fig 5c respectively it should also be noted that some crystals were stacked together during the crystallization processes generating larger granules as presented in fig 5b edx mapping showed that fe p and o were the major elements on the surface of the crystal products after the background signals associated with the sem carbon stubs had been subtracted fig 6a c further analysis revealed that the elemental composition i e fe p o weight atomic ratio of the obtained products was very close to that of pure vivianite fig 6d suggesting the successful formation of crystals the saturation index si eq 4 is an important metric to determine whether the given operational conditions were feasible for the generation of vivianite crystals based on our previous studies liu et al 2018 noticeable crystallization is expected to occur at si values ranging between 4 to 11 when the si is beyond the upper limit homogenous nucleation precipitation takes place whereas low supersaturation values of si 4 typically results in the slow growth of vivianite pellets as calculated by eq 4 the corresponding si in our experiment was 6 36 which was located within the suitable supersaturation range for efficient vivianite crystallization fig 7 depicts a more precise particle size distribution psd of the fbc generated vivianite crystals during the 372 hour continuous operation a bimodal psd was observed with the first peak located at 5 10 μm while the second peak ranged between 70 to 100 μm during the fbc operation the first peak gradually declined accompanied by an increase in the second peak indicating the growth of crystals with time as summarized in table 2 while all the collected samples had a similar d10 of around 4 0 μm d50 and d90 increased substantially with operation time for instance d50 and d90 values for the samples collected after 36 hours of operation were 13 0 and 45 0 μm but increased to 52 8 and 152 4 μm after 372 hours these observations indicate that the fbc system was effective at transforming soluble p in the fcdi concentrate into solid p crystals with the sem images confirming that the large particles produced were indeed crystals rather than agglomerates of smaller particles further investigation indicated that the position within the fbc had no obvious influence on the pellet psd revealing that pellets were formed homogeneously within the column fig s7 it should also be emphasized that the generation of vivianite with larger dimensions enables the effective separation of crystals from solution via gravity separation the size of the vivianite crystals harvested from our fbc system was one of largest reported among previous studies liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 with even larger crystals likely to be obtained if operational time was extended further 3 2 3 vivianite identification via exafs in order to identify the possible fe species present in the recovered pellets principal component analysis pca coupled with target transformation tt and lcf analyses were performed on the fe k edge exafs data the pca performed on the powdered samples and standards identified three independent spectral components necessary to reproduce the exafs data set supported by the observed minimum in the empirical indicator ind value 2 43 10 5 indeed only three components vivianite strengite and ferrihydrite were required to reproduce the exafs spectra of all samples by the tt analysis with less than 5 misfit observed these three reference compounds were then selected for the following lcf with the acquired results summarized in table 3 it should be noted that vivianite was the predominant mineral identified in the recovered products from all positions within the column demonstrating the effectiveness of our fbc system for preferentially fixing p from the fcdi concentrate fig 8 unfortunately a small fraction of impurities particularly ferrihydrite and magnetite also existed in the solid products particularly at the bottom of the column this phenomena however is not surprising as it is unavoidable that a small amount of air could be introduced when pumping solutions into the fbc column causing the rapid oxygenation of fe ii and precipitation of ferrihydrite meanwhile the local high ph near the base dosing point caused by the uneven mixing of the naoh stream with the fe ii and p streams would also accelerate the fe ii oxidation at a ph value below 4 fe2 is the major species of fe ii when ph increases to higher than 5 fe2 will be converted to soluble ferrous hydroxide species i e feoh and fe oh 2 0 rapid fe ii oxidation will be observed as the reaction rate constants of soluble ferrous hydroxide species with dissolved oxygen are five orders of magnitude higher compared to that of fe2 morgan and lahav 2007 it should be noted that other impurities might also be introduced into the products especially when magnesium or calcium are present in the feed solution leading to possible variation in vivianite properties wu et al 2019b by replacing the ordinary cem with a monovalent cation selective membrane fcdi is able to prevent multivalent cations e g magnesium or calcium from entering the electrode chamber and thereby eliminate their side effects on the vivianite crystallization process choi et al 2016 nativ et al 2018 in addition macromolecular or weakly charged pollutants could also be effectively blocked by iems which is expected to increase the availability of fe ii for vivianite formation overall the fcdi process not only ensures the pre concentration of p from wastewater but it also enables the removal of undesirable substances providing the prerequisites necessary for the generation of high purity vivianite pellets 3 3 cost assessments and comparisons a cost analysis based on the chemical usage and electric energy consumption is provided in si table s2 although additional electric energy is required to drive the preconcentration of p from wastewater during the first fcdi stage inexpensive chemicals feso4 7h2o are used for vivianite crystallization in the second fbc stage it is estimated that 13 5 kg feso4 7h2o and 2 98 kwh electric energy were consumed when recovering one kilogram p during the fcdi fbc process representing a gross cost of 1 34 for recovery of one kilogram of p in contrast expensive reagents e g mgcl2 6h2o and naoh are needed for a struvite crystallization process the total cost of these chemicals for recovery of one kilogram of p is 1 74 slightly higher than that of the current fcdi fbc process table s2 considering the ability to remove impurities from wastewater and the overall economic effectiveness of the p recovery process mentioned above the fcdi fbc vivianite process appears to have some advantages over the struvite process 4 conclusions p recovery from wastewaters will not only prevent the eutrophication of natural waters but will also enable sustainable supplementation of scarce p resources in this study an integrated fcdi fbc system has been employed to selectively extract p from wastewater as vivianite a promising slow release agricultural fertilizer and raw material for the manufacture of lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 the precursor in fabricating li ion batteries fcdi was adopted as the initial step to rapidly pre concentrate p within the electrode chamber the influence of different operational parameters particularly current density and hrt on fcdi ion removal performance and energy consumption were thoroughly evaluated the preconcentration process not only enabled a substantial reduction of the volume from which p was to be recovered but also removed undesired species thereby facilitating the recovery of p as vivianite in the subsequent fbc system our results indicated that nearly 80 of p was fixed as triangular or quadrangular shaped pellets which were confirmed to be vivianite crystals with an average size of 50 μm by both sem eds and exafs while the current study suggests that fcdi fbc is a promising technique for efficient p extraction from aqueous solutions several challenges remain that require resolution before full scale implementation of this technique can be realized firstly there is a critical need to enhance the selectivity towards p and further reduce energy consumption during the fcdi preconcentration process this issue can potentially be addressed by developing innovative electrodes and membranes manipulating the operational modes and limiting the occurrence of in situ faradaic reactions appropriately secondly there is a need for deeper exploration into the formation and growth of vivianite crystals and vivianite crystal separation efficiency thirdly design of scaled up units and long term continuous operation 3 months of these units should be undertaken to investigate the robustness of the coupled process and to assist in the development of anti fouling strategies of the integrated systems these long term studies using prototype units should also assist in evaluation of the monetary benefits of the integrated process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17146,it is critical to both effectively remove and recover phosphate p from wastewater given the wide ranging environmental i e preventing eutrophication and restoring water quality and economic i e overcoming p resource scarcity benefits more recently considerable academic effort has been devoted towards harvesting p as vivianite which can be used as a potential slow release fertilizer and possible reagent for the manufacture of lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 the precursor in fabricating li ion secondary batteries in this study we propose an innovative p recovery process in which p is first preconcentrated via a flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi device followed by immobilization as vivianite crystals in a fluidized bed crystallization fbc column the effects of different operational parameters on fcdi p preconcentration performance and energy consumption are investigated results show that 63 of p can be removed and concentrated in the flow electrode chamber with a reasonable energy requirement under optimal operating conditions the fbc system resulted in immobilization of 80 of p as triangular or quadrangular pellets which were verified to be high purity vivianite crystals by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx and extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy this study provides a pathway for efficient recovery of p as a value added product i e vivianite from p rich wastewaters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow electrode capacitive deionization fluidized bed crystallization phosphate removal and recovery vivianite 1 introduction phosphorus p an irreplaceable nutritional element as well as a structural and functional component e g dna rna and atp of all living organisms is an increasingly scarce and non renewable natural resource lei et al 2020 wu et al 2020 given present trends in global population growth and diet preference i e more meat and dairy based diets the demand for p fertilizers for use in modern agriculture is envisaged to substantially increase over the coming decades cordell et al 2009 currently almost all p fertilizers are obtained from p mines located in several countries e g morocco china and the united states at an annual mining rate of 20 million metric tonnes globally cordell et al 2009 cordell et al 2011 lei et al 2017 it is estimated that accessible p minerals could be exhausted within the next 50 100 years at current mining rates provided no breakthrough is achieved in enhancing p mining usage efficiency cordell et al 2009 in addition the fertilizer producers also recognize that due to the mining of lower grade ore the quality of existing p reserves is declining leading to cost increases associated with mining processing and shipping lei et al 2017 on the other hand a significant fraction of the consumed p ultimately ends up in wastewaters e g dairy shed effluent municipal discharges which have been shown to cause severe environmental problems such as eutrophication and consequent formation of hypoxic zones in natural waters e g lakes reservoirs estuaries and the open ocean copetti et al 2016 mayer et al 2016 ye et al 2017 judicious p management is a global grand challenge hukari et al 2016 macintosh et al 2018 one obvious way to alleviate p resource shortages and reduce the potential risks to water contamination is to recover and reuse p from wastewaters presenting significant economic and environmental benefits bradford hartke et al 2015 lei et al 2017 for example it is estimated that p contained in sewage if properly recovered could meet 15 20 of the global demand for p yuan et al 2012 existing p recovery strategies include biological processes chemical precipitation and crystallization desmidt et al 2014 loganathan et al 2014 ye et al 2017 while each technique has its merits and drawbacks the general principle is similar i e convert the soluble p into solid form and separate from wastewater for further refinement and reuse for instance current wastewater treatment plants wwtps generally introduce additional iron or aluminum salts into activated sludge systems to efficiently precipitate dissolved p in order to comply with the increasingly stringent discharge standards wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 nevertheless effective separation and recovery of these precipitates as high purity p products that meet market requirements remain a great challenge p crystallization which enables the extraction of refined larger sized and thus separable products has been demonstrated in pilot and full scale wwtps especially in european countries such as switzerland and the netherlands which suffer from p shortages desmidt et al 2014 one well developed available approach is to simultaneously remove p and ammonium and fix them as struvite magnesium ammonium p mgnh4po4 6h2o crystals a commonly used slow release fertilizer kim et al 2018 however struvite crystals can only be formed under strictly controlled conditions i e high p concentration appropriate mg nh4 po4 molar ratio and ph range hug and udert 2013 typically as the concentration of mg is much lower compared to p and ammonium in most wastewaters an additional dosage of mg source is invariably required liu et al 2018 reducing the economic feasibility of this technology more recently p removal and recovery as vivianite crystals has been proposed and thus attracted considerable attentions li et al 2018b prot et al 2019 wu et al 2019b importantly it has been revealed that vivianite is the major p sink in iron dosing wwtps wilfert et al 2018 wilfert et al 2016 wu et al 2019b compared with a struvite based approach this alternative could be more economically viable as the reagent costs are significantly decreased by dosing fe ii instead of the more expensive mg source in addition for wastewaters containing insufficient ammonium the vivianite pathway has further economic appeal the recovered vivianite crystals can either be used in the electronics industry or potentially as an agricultural fertilizer tian et al 2019 wu et al 2019b however iit remains a great challenge however to recover high quality p crystals with an expected purity of 95 directly from wastewaters due to the low p concentration and the presence of other co existing species such as organic matter which may influence the crystallization process and lower product quality chen et al 2017 lei et al 2018 prot et al 2019 thus a pretreatment process to selectively enrich p and remove block co existing impurities is highly desirable flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi although initially developed as a promising brackish water desalination technology could be a suitable alternative given its excellent nutrient enrichment performance bian et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b zhang et al 2021 it should be emphasized that this enrichment is expected to facilitate the crystallization process via enhancing the ion activity and consequently the level of supersaturation liu et al 2018 furthermore macromolecular and weakly charged pollutants could also be effectively blocked from entering the electrode chamber due to the presence of ion exchange membranes iems vanoppen et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 this selectivity is anticipated to enhance fe availability for vivianite crystallization by for example reducing complexation by organic matter thereby improving the purity of recovered products in this study a fcdi fbc coupled system was employed to extract p from both a simple feed solution and a more complex solution representative of anaerobic digestion supernatant and further convert it into vivianite crystals the primary objectives of the current study are to i investigate the performance of an fcdi system with respect to p selective preconcentration and impurities removal from feed solutions typical of wastewaters ii determine the optimum parameters for fcdi operation and iii evaluate vivianite crystal formation in a coupled fbc system and thoroughly characterize the extracted products 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemical reagents used were of analytical reagent grade which were purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification simple synthetic wastewater with initial nacl and p concentrations of 500 and 200 mg l 1

solution containing constituents more typical of an actual wastewater including ca2 nh4 and total organic carbon toc composed of sodium alginate and humic acid was also prepared see composition in table s1 and tested flow electrodes were prepared by mixing 9 wt of 100 mesh activated carbon darco and norit sigma aldrich 1 wt carbon black powder vulcan xc72r from cabot co and 90 wt milli q water in a glass bottle in order to completely wet the surface of the carbon powders the as prepared flow electrodes were continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer overnight prior to use the fe ii solution 2 m was prepared by dissolving feso4 in milli q water with the ph adjusted to 2 by hno3 to minimize the extent of fe ii oxidation 2 2 experimental setup and operation p preconcentration via

closed cycle scc or isolated closed cycle icc mode with the wastewater running through the spacer chamber in single pass mode see si fig s1 during icc operation the positively and negatively charged flow electrodes are individually recirculated between their respective reservoirs and electrode chambers in contrast the two flow electrodes streams in scc mode are mixed in a shared reservoir where the oppositely charged carbon electrodes can be neutralized resulting in the release of the absorbed ions and regeneration of the exhausted electrodes he et al 2018 the flow electrode was continuously recycled between the reservoir and fcdi cell at a flowrate of 29 ml min 1 controlled by a peristaltic pump bt100 1l longer the effects of operational parameters i e current density 0 28 6 a m 2 and

vernier connected to the data acquisition system sensordaq vernier the current i and voltage v through the electrical circuit were recorded every ten seconds using the vernier current probe the concentrated stream brine can be effectively separated from the flow electrodes either by settling the solid particle electrodes via gravity or through a microfiltration mf module immersed in the electrode reservoir as reported previously he et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020a the mf module provided by our industry partner jiuwu hi tech nanjing china has a length of 50 mm outer diameter of 12 mm inner diameter of 6 mm and pore size of 0 45 μm the ion concentrations were measured using ion chromatography ics 3000 dionex with a cg16 5 50 mm guard column and a cs16 5 250 mm separation column ph was continuously monitored using a ph meter inserted within the recirculation pipeline outside the fbc column vivianite production using fbc after every 2 hours of operation the concentrated electrolyte p rich stream was separated from the solid electrode particles by using a mf module immersed in the electrode reservoir the collected p rich stream ferrous sulfate and naoh or hno3 solutions were fed into the crystallizer at particular flowrates using a peristaltic pump the ph and fe ii p molar ratio were set at 6 and 1 5 the theoretical fe ii p ratio in vivianite respectively the fbc is an acrylic cylindrical column composed of a lower reaction zone inner diameter of 2 cm height of 80 cm and volume of 252 ml and upper settling zone inner diameter of 4 cm height of 20 cm and volume of 252 ml as shown in fig 1 the sudden expansion of the settling zone compared to the reaction zone results in a reduced hydraulic loading preventing the generated fine particles from draining out the hrt and internal recirculation rate for the crystallizer were controlled at 72 min and 500 respectively which resulted in an up flow velocity of 30 m h 1 to suppress fe

results and discussions 3 1 salt removal and p preconcentration using fcdi 3 1 1 treatment of the simple synthetic wastewater the influences of current density and hrt on icc fcdi desalination performance and cell voltage are presented in fig 2 for a fixed hrt while higher current density led to reduced effluent conductivity the cell voltage increased accordingly fig 2b note that a turning optimal point occurred where a sharp increase in cell voltage was observed fig 2b it would not be economically effective to operate the fcdi at a current density beyond the turning point due to the excessively high energy consumption at a hrt of 1 96 min the turning point appeared at the current density of 11 4 a m 2 with a reasonable cell voltage of 2 0 v achieved while higher salt removal rates can be obtained at longer hrts the water productivity is compromised and higher cell voltage is required inducing undesired side reactions thus the optimal hrt of 1 96 min was used for subsequent investigations the results also demonstrate that the fcdi system was capable of reducing p and cl concentrations in the feed stream to extremely low levels though low ion concentrations in the spacer chamber will result in a dramatic increase in cell voltage and operating cost fig 3 a and fig 3b interestingly no obvious variations in p cl selectivity 0 8 1 2 were observed when changing current density and hrt while the larger p hydrated ionic radius is expected to reduce its movement compared to cl within the fcdi unit its higher average valence 50 hpo4 2 and 50 h2po4 under a condition similar to that of ad supernatant should enhance its migration within the electric field given the balance between these two influencing factors similar ion removal efficiency and minor selectivity differences were observed fig 3c with the optimal parameters obtained from the preliminary studies the salt and p removal performances were investigated in both icc and scc operation modes as displayed in fig 4 both p and cl concentrations in the effluent stream showed a sharp decrease before attaining an approximate steady state under both operational conditions with fairly similar removal efficiencies achieved 62 for cl and 63 for p respectively in both scc and icc modes we also calculated the electrical energy consumption normalized to the volume of water treated e v and normalized to the amount of p removed e p and p flux f p of the fcdi system according to eqs 4 6 note that e v and e p were 0 38 kwh m 3 and 2 98 kwh kg 1 p in scc mode with these values almost half of those for icc mode with an e v of 0 88 kwh m 3 and e p of 6 94 kwh kg 1 p nevertheless similar f p values 41 6 kg p m 2 d 1 were observed in both modes as they were all operated under the same current density with high charge efficiencies as illustrated in table 1 the p recovery performance in the fcdi system under investigation here is comparable to that of other electrochemical systems with regard to a range of commonly used metrics η p e v e p and f p during the fcdi operation removed ions will gradually accumulate in the flow electrodes chambers resulting in the linear increment of ion concentrations observed in fig 4a and 4b in icc mode the p concentration in the anode electrolyte reached 500 mg l whereas the cl concentration was 300 mg l 1 on analyzing the mass balance fig 4a it was surprising to find that 63 5 of p and 25 5 of cl were eventually present in the anode electrolyte fig s2 continuous measurement of the anode electrolyte ph provide a reasonable explanation for this phenomenon as the electrolyte solutions are relatively unbuffered at least in the case of use of simple feed stream even limited occurrence of faradaic reactions such as oxidation of flow anode carbon particles and oxygen reduction by flow cathode particles is likely to result in short term ph changes in the flow electrode chambers as illustrated in fig 4a the electrolyte ph gradually decreased from 7 initially to 2 at the end of the experiment nativ et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a note that p will be mostly converted from charged species hpo4 2 and h2po4 to uncharged species h3po4 when the ph decreased to lower than 2 pk a for this acid base pair is 2 12 favoring p desorption from charged electrode particles to the electrolyte as for scc mode the positively and negatively charged electrodes will be mixed and neutralized in a shared reservoir within which the absorbed ions are spontaneously released back into the electrolyte the final p and cl concentrations reached 500 and 550 mg l 1 respectively fig 4b the occurrence of significant ongoing change in ph will be mitigated by the neutralisation that occurs on mixing of flow anode and flow cathode streams in the electrolyte reservoir with the electrolyte ph stabilized at 7 mass balance calculations revealed that the majority of removed ions 98 cl and 100 p were finally present in the electrolyte fig s2 these results demonstrated that the charged electrodes can be fully regenerated with the adsorbed ions being completely released therefore scc would be a better option in view of both the higher ion recovery efficiencies and lower energy consumption he et al 2018 3 1 2 treatment of the complex synthetic wastewater fcdi was also employed to treat a solution containing constituents typical of a more complex wastewater including calcium and ammonium ions as well as organic matter as the salinity of this more complex solution was much higher than that of the simple electrolyte used in initial studies a higher current density of 22 8 a m 2 was employed with the hrt fixed at 1 96 min as illustrated in fig s3 the conductivity of the wastewater decreased from 6400 to 3450 μs cm 1 after fcdi treatment and remained fairly stable during the treatment process the distribution of particular ions and toc between the electrolyte and effluent streams is illustrated in fig s4 note that nearly 40 of the p was concentrated in the electrolyte with the rest remaining in the effluent this is a lower proportion than obtained in the case of the simple feed solution with the decrease attributed to competition from otherco existing ions importantly organic matter was effectively blocked from transport to the electrode chamber by the iem while hardness ions such as ca2 readily migrated through the cation exchange membrane into the cathode chamber where they were principally electrosorbed by the negatively charged carbon particles though some calcium carbonate precipitation was also evident zhang et al 2018 note that less than 10 of the ca and toc were present in the concentrated electrolyte with their absence greatly reducing the load on the ensuing fbc process and improving the purity of the harvested vivianite products regular acid alkali washing is required to remove accumulated materials from the spacer and electrode chambers 3 2 p recovery as vivianite crystals in an fbc reactor 3 2 1 crystal formation based on our previous studies the concentrated electrolyte 50 60 ml every 2 hour can be effectively separated from the slurry electrodes by using a mf module immersed in the electrode reservoir fig 1 zhang et al 2019b zhang et al 2020a the electrolyte p rich stream obtained following such mf separation and additional fe ii solution were introduced to a fbc to produce vivianite crystals to simplify the crystallization process only p rich stream collected from the simple wastewater was used during the operation green flocs were observed in the column at the beginning of the experiments during day 1 fig s5a c which gradually changed to small green particles at day 2 fig s5d f before generating blue particles after day 4 fig s5g h as can be seen from the photos in fig s5i the recovered products were light green pellets it is reported that pure vivianite is colorless and becomes opaque with a green or blue hue once oxidized wu et al 2019b while we have attempted to remove most of the oxygen via nitrogen gas aeration in the feed stream trace amounts of oxygen will still exist in the bulk solution causing the partial oxidation particularly of fe ii located at near the surface of the newly produced vivianite indeed it is difficult to find pure vivianite in most natural environments wu et al 2019b 3 2 2 morphology and size distribution of the pellets collected from the fbc process as can be seen from the photo in fig 5 a the recovered products possessed a light green color and were agglomerated as a loosely structured powder further investigations via optical light microscopy and sem analysis provided more detailed information about the pellet microstructure as clearly shown in the optical microscope images fig s6a c the majority of recovered pellets possessed a consistent morphology of either a triangular or quadrangular shape for example p pellets obtained after 48 hours of operation were mostly semi transparent quadrangular crystals with high uniformity and sizes ranging from 5 to 30 μm fig s6b in contrast crystals with darker colors and greater sizes which ranged from 20 to 80 μm were obtained when the fbc was operated for 228 hours fig s6c with these results demonstrating the growth of crystals during this period a steady p removal efficiency of 91 5 was reached during the operation at the end of the operation 372 hours the samples were collected and examined using sem and eds mapping as can be observed from the sem images in fig 5b d the primary crystals had relatively smooth surfaces with platy morphology with some smaller agglomerates sporadically attached to the surface of the larger crystals these larger crystals were generally composed of multiple thin layers with a size and thickness of 120 μm and 20 μm fig 5c respectively it should also be noted that some crystals were stacked together during the crystallization processes generating larger granules as presented in fig 5b edx mapping showed that fe p and o were the major elements on the surface of the crystal products after the background signals associated with the sem carbon stubs had been subtracted fig 6a c further analysis revealed that the elemental composition i e fe p o weight atomic ratio of the obtained products was very close to that of pure vivianite fig 6d suggesting the successful formation of crystals the saturation index si eq 4 is an important metric to determine whether the given operational conditions were feasible for the generation of vivianite crystals based on our previous studies liu et al 2018 noticeable crystallization is expected to occur at si values ranging between 4 to 11 when the si is beyond the upper limit homogenous nucleation precipitation takes place whereas low supersaturation values of si 4 typically results in the slow growth of vivianite pellets as calculated by eq 4 the corresponding si in our experiment was 6 36 which was located within the suitable supersaturation range for efficient vivianite crystallization fig 7 depicts a more precise particle size distribution psd of the fbc generated vivianite crystals during the 372 hour continuous operation a bimodal psd was observed with the first peak located at 5 10 μm while the second peak ranged between 70 to 100 μm during the fbc operation the first peak gradually declined accompanied by an increase in the second peak indicating the growth of crystals with time as summarized in table 2 while all the collected samples had a similar d10 of around 4 0 μm d50 and d90 increased substantially with operation time for instance d50 and d90 values for the samples collected after 36 hours of operation were 13 0 and 45 0 μm but increased to 52 8 and 152 4 μm after 372 hours these observations indicate that the fbc system was effective at transforming soluble p in the fcdi concentrate into solid p crystals with the sem images confirming that the large particles produced were indeed crystals rather than agglomerates of smaller particles further investigation indicated that the position within the fbc had no obvious influence on the pellet psd revealing that pellets were formed homogeneously within the column fig s7 it should also be emphasized that the generation of vivianite with larger dimensions enables the effective separation of crystals from solution via gravity separation the size of the vivianite crystals harvested from our fbc system was one of largest reported among previous studies liu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 with even larger crystals likely to be obtained if operational time was extended further 3 2 3 vivianite identification via exafs in order to identify the possible fe species present in the recovered pellets principal component analysis pca coupled with target transformation tt and lcf analyses were performed on the fe k edge exafs data the pca performed on the powdered samples and standards identified three independent spectral components necessary to reproduce the exafs data set supported by the observed minimum in the empirical indicator ind value 2 43 10 5 indeed only three components vivianite strengite and ferrihydrite were required to reproduce the exafs spectra of all samples by the tt analysis with less than 5 misfit observed these three reference compounds were then selected for the following lcf with the acquired results summarized in table 3 it should be noted that vivianite was the predominant mineral identified in the recovered products from all positions within the column demonstrating the effectiveness of our fbc system for preferentially fixing p from the fcdi concentrate fig 8 unfortunately a small fraction of impurities particularly ferrihydrite and magnetite also existed in the solid products particularly at the bottom of the column this phenomena however is not surprising as it is unavoidable that a small amount of air could be introduced when pumping solutions into the fbc column causing the rapid oxygenation of fe ii and precipitation of ferrihydrite meanwhile the local high ph near the base dosing point caused by the uneven mixing of the naoh stream with the fe ii and p streams would also accelerate the fe ii oxidation at a ph value below 4 fe2 is the major species of fe ii when ph increases to higher than 5 fe2 will be converted to soluble ferrous hydroxide species i e feoh and fe oh 2 0 rapid fe ii oxidation will be observed as the reaction rate constants of soluble ferrous hydroxide species with dissolved oxygen are five orders of magnitude higher compared to that of fe2 morgan and lahav 2007 it should be noted that other impurities might also be introduced into the products especially when magnesium or calcium are present in the feed solution leading to possible variation in vivianite properties wu et al 2019b by replacing the ordinary cem with a monovalent cation selective membrane fcdi is able to prevent multivalent cations e g magnesium or calcium from entering the electrode chamber and thereby eliminate their side effects on the vivianite crystallization process choi et al 2016 nativ et al 2018 in addition macromolecular or weakly charged pollutants could also be effectively blocked by iems which is expected to increase the availability of fe ii for vivianite formation overall the fcdi process not only ensures the pre concentration of p from wastewater but it also enables the removal of undesirable substances providing the prerequisites necessary for the generation of high purity vivianite pellets 3 3 cost assessments and comparisons a cost analysis based on the chemical usage and electric energy consumption is provided in si table s2 although additional electric energy is required to drive the preconcentration of p from wastewater during the first fcdi stage inexpensive chemicals feso4 7h2o are used for vivianite crystallization in the second fbc stage it is estimated that 13 5 kg feso4 7h2o and 2 98 kwh electric energy were consumed when recovering one kilogram p during the fcdi fbc process representing a gross cost of 1 34 for recovery of one kilogram of p in contrast expensive reagents e g mgcl2 6h2o and naoh are needed for a struvite crystallization process the total cost of these chemicals for recovery of one kilogram of p is 1 74 slightly higher than that of the current fcdi fbc process table s2 considering the ability to remove impurities from wastewater and the overall economic effectiveness of the p recovery process mentioned above the fcdi fbc vivianite process appears to have some advantages over the struvite process 4 conclusions p recovery from wastewaters will not only prevent the eutrophication of natural waters but will also enable sustainable supplementation of scarce p resources in this study an integrated fcdi fbc system has been employed to selectively extract p from wastewater as vivianite a promising slow release agricultural fertilizer and raw material for the manufacture of lithium iron phosphate lifepo4 the precursor in fabricating li ion batteries fcdi was adopted as the initial step to rapidly pre concentrate p within the electrode chamber the influence of different operational parameters particularly current density and hrt on fcdi ion removal performance and energy consumption were thoroughly evaluated the preconcentration process not only enabled a substantial reduction of the volume from which p was to be recovered but also removed undesired species thereby facilitating the recovery of p as vivianite in the subsequent fbc system our results indicated that nearly 80 of p was fixed as triangular or quadrangular shaped pellets which were confirmed to be vivianite crystals with an average size of 50 μm by both sem eds and exafs while the current study suggests that fcdi fbc is a promising technique for efficient p extraction from aqueous solutions several challenges remain that require resolution before full scale implementation of this technique can be realized firstly there is a critical need to enhance the selectivity towards p and further reduce energy consumption during the fcdi preconcentration process this issue can potentially be addressed by developing innovative electrodes and membranes manipulating the operational modes and limiting the occurrence of in situ faradaic reactions appropriately secondly there is a need for deeper exploration into the formation and growth of vivianite crystals and vivianite crystal separation efficiency thirdly design of scaled up units and long term continuous operation 3 months of these units should be undertaken to investigate the robustness of the coupled process and to assist in the development of anti fouling strategies of the integrated systems these long term studies using prototype units should also assist in evaluation of the monetary benefits of the integrated process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

17147,there is an ongoing debate around the effect of microaerobic aerobic conditions on the wastewater treatment performance and stability of enriched purple phototrophic bacteria ppb cultures it is well known that oxygen induced oxidative conditions inhibit the synthesis of light harvesting complexes required for photoheterotrophy however in applied research several publications have reported efficient wastewater treatment at high dissolved oxygen do levels this study evaluated the impact of different do concentrations 0 0 25 mg l 1 0 0 5 mg l 1 and 0 4 5 mg l 1 on the cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal performances the biomass yields and the final microbial communities of ppb enriched cultures treating real wastewaters domestic and poultry processing wastewater the results show that the presence of oxygen suppressed photoheterotrophic growth which led to a complete pigment and colour loss in a matter of 20 30 h after starting the batch under aerobic conditions chemoheterotrophy was the dominant catabolic pathway with wastewater treatment performances similar to those achieved in common aerobic reactors rather than those corresponding to phototrophic systems i e considerable total cod decrease 45 57 aerobically vs 10 anaerobically this includes faster consumption of cod and nutrients lower nutrient removal efficiencies 50 58 vs 72 99 for nh4 n lower cod n p substrate ratios 100 4 5 5 0 0 4 0 8 vs 100 6 7 12 0 9 1 2 and lower apparent biomass yields 0 15 0 31 vs 0 8 1 2 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 the suppression of photoheterotrophy inevitably resulted in a reduction of the relative ppb abundances in all the aerated tests below 20 at the end of the tests as ppb lost their main competitive advantage against competing aerobic heterotrophic microbes this was explained by the lower aerobic ppb growth rates 2 4 d 1 at 35 c when compared to common growth rates for aerobic heterotrophs 6 0 d 1 at 20 c therefore ppb effectively outcompete other microbes under illuminated anaerobic conditions but not under aerobic or even micro aerobic conditions as shown by continuously aerated tests controlled at undetectable do levels while their aerobic heterotrophic capabilities provide some resilience at non sterile conditions ppb cannot dominate when growing chemoheterotrophically and will be outcompeted graphical abstract image graphical abstract

therefore ppb based processes represent a promising novel alternative for resource recovery from waste streams during anoxygenic photosynthesis light energy is collected via light harvesting complexes lhc containing various carotenoids and bacteriochlorophylls bchl the harvested light energy is further transformed into chemical energy in reaction centres bchls absorb wavelengths in the near infrared nir range 780 890 nm for bchl a and 970 1040 nm for bchl b with common maximum absorption peaks at 800 nm 850 nm or 1010 nm while carotenoids absorb mostly fractions of visible vis light e g 500 nm for lycopene or 550 555 nm for spirilloxanthin canniffe and hunter 2014 niedzwiedzki et al 2015 okubo et al 2006 saer and blankenship 2017 wang et al 2012 besides vis light harvesting with further transfer of excited electrons to bchls and to reaction centres for intracellular energy generation carotenoids also fulfil photoprotective functions frank and polívka 2009 hartigan et al 2002 saer and blankenship 2017 these carotenoids give phototrophically grown ppb cultures their very characteristic purple colour other than phototrophic growth ppb can also grow without light via fermentation anaerobic or chemoheterotrophic respiration aerobically or performing denitrification capson tojo et al 2020 in the presence of oxygen energy for cellular metabolism is mostly derived from aerobic respiratory chains and virtually no bchl or carotenoids are synthesized zeilstra ryalls et al 1998 this is because the oxidative conditions resulting from the prolonged presence of oxygen inhibit the expression of most of the genes coding for the light harvesting antenna responsible for energy capture and reaction centre complexes the main components of photosystems and responsible for energy transformation via electrical charge separation bauer et al 2003 gregor and klug 1999 sganga and bauer 1992 zhu et al 1986 using rhodobacter capsulatus as model organism it has been found that in the presence of oxygen a regulator known as crtj responds to oxidising growth conditions by oxidising a molecular hs hs bond to an s s bond which stimulates the dna binding activity of the repressor bauer et al 2003 this process is responsible for the repression of photosynthesis gene expression with a redox pair potential of 270 mv madigan et al 2011 it has been hypothesized that repressing gene expression is a protection mechanism of the cells to avoid photooxidative damage zhu et al 1986 this suppression results in the inhibition of photoheterotrophy and the shift towards chemoheterotrophy which results in reduced biomass yields and cod n p substrate ratios izu et al 2001 jiao et al 2003 siefert et al 1978 yue et al 2015 both quantitative studies and theoretical analyses have confirmed this phenomenon under micro aerobic conditions with oxidative phosphorylation rather than cyclic photophosphorylation being the predominant atp production route in ppb under these conditions lu et al 2011a 2011b this is in agreement with studies showing that ppb require an oxidation reduction potential orp below 200 mv for efficient photoheterotrophic growth ormerod 1983 siefert et al 1978 which was further supported by modelling ppb addition to activated sludge reactors huang et al 2001 the latter concluded that ppb do not synthesize pigments under aerobic conditions huang et al 2001 some ppb can survive naturally in media where oxidative conditions are prevalent such as marine sediments but even in those situations it is widely accepted that ppb live in niches where reducing conditions low in oxygen are available hiraishi et al 2020 madigan et al 2011 vethanayagam 1991 due to the aforementioned reasons most research applying ppb for resource recovery has been carried out under anaerobic illuminated conditions nevertheless a number of articles have suggested that photoheterotrophic growth occurred under illuminated microaerobic 0 5 1 0 mg do l 1 dissolved oxygen and even aerobic conditions 2 0 8 0 mg do l 1 this was suggested by either directly claiming that photophosphorylation occurred in the presence of oxygen meng et al 2017 peng et al 2018 by reporting optimal ppb growth conditions under simultaneous light and oxygen supply lu et al 2019a yang et al 2018c zhou et al 2016 2015 or by reporting effective carotenoid and bchl synthesis under aerobic conditions lu et al 2019a meng et al 2020 2017 yang et al 2018b zhi et al 2020 conversely previous studies from the same research group reported oxidative phosphorylation as main atp generation process in the presence of oxygen which inherently points towards aerobic chemoheterotrophy rather than photoheterotrophy lu et al 2013 2011a 2011b wang et al 2016 this was further supported by the generally lower biomass yields reported under aerobic conditions 0 19 0 51 g cod g codremoved 1 lu et al 2011b meng et al 2017 wu et al 2012 which are far from those achieved photoheterotrophically up to 1 0 g cod g codremoved 1 hülsen et al 2018b 2018a 2014 winkler and straka 2019 low yields point towards the consumption of cod for atp generation e g via oxidative phosphorylation in addition several studies have reported faster cod removal rates aerobically when compared to their anaerobically grown ppb both illuminated lu et al 2019a 2013 2011b meng et al 2020 2017 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2018b zhao and zhang 2014 this further points towards chemoheterotrophic growth under aerobic conditions not necessarily of ppb in mixed cultures as growth rates for common aerobic heterotrophs are higher when compared to those of ppb growing photoheterotrophically maximum specific growth rate for heterotrophic biomass of 6 0 d 1 at 20 c uptake rate of 8 95 d 1 assuming a yield of 0 67 g cod g cod 1 henze et al 1987 vs photoheterotrophic acetic acid specific uptake rate by ppb of 2 4 g cod g cod 1 d 1 20 c puyol et al 2017 the aerobic uptakes rates via chemoheterotrophy for ppb have been recently determined using different pure cultures i e rhodopseudomonas palustris rhodospirillum rubrum rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodobacter capsulatus obtaining values of 3 2 8 0 d 1 at 28 c with fructose as substrate growth rates of 1 6 4 4 d 1 which are also higher than those achieved photoheterotrophically alloul et al 2021 considering the information presented above it is unclear how anaerobic photoheterotrophy can be performed under aerobic conditions and whether anaerobic photoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy take place simultaneously or are mutually exclusive it is also unclear how the competition of ppb with aerobic heterotrophs would play out under aerobic non sterile conditions treating real wastewater under anaerobic nir illuminated conditions the faster growth rates compared to common anaerobic vfa degrading microbes provide a selective advantage for ppb particularly in the case of acetate consumption photoheterotrophically compared to methanogenesis this is not the case under aerobic conditions in fact ppb have been reported to grow slower via respiration than common aerobic heterotrophs izu et al 2001 and ppb are therefore likely to be outcompeted over time hülsen et al 2019 izu et al 2001 siefert et al 1978 this is indicated by the very low abundances of ppb in activated sludge systems siefert et al 1978 zhang et al 2003 it is noteworthy that most studies reporting positive effects of high do levels have never considered this competition as tests have mostly been carried out using pure isolated cultures fed with artificial sterile media liu et al 2016 2015 lu et al 2019a 2013 2011b wang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 2012 zhou et al 2014 this is exacerbated by the general absence of microbial data in most studies claiming a positive effect of oxygen on the ppb treatment performance particularly at the end in batch studies tend among the studies reporting the microbial communities batch tests with durations of 3 4 days have shown that aerobic heterotrophs e g pseudomonas or hyphomonas are present at considerable proportions at tend under illuminated aerated conditions yang et al 2018c 2018a zhou et al 2015 and that the ppb diversity is reduced zhao and zhang 2014 in addition the presence of strict anaerobes at the end of batches suggests that anaerobic regions might have existed in the reactors despite aeration peng et al 2018 yang et al 2018c none of the aforementioned studies reported high proportions of bacteria commonly found in ppb mediated reactors e g rhodobacter or rhodopseudomonas capson tojo et al 2020 which suggests that they are not dominant or cannot compete when oxygen is supplied interestingly none of these studies reported the presence of pigment producing aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs i e erythrobacter roseobacter roseovarius rubriomonas or roseivivax oren 2011 when oxygen was provided in addition to obvious scientific reasons this lack of agreement on the effect of oxygen on the performance of ppb mediated treatment systems and its importance for resource recovery is clearly relevant for practical application on one hand ppbs might be outcompeted in a matter of days on the other a non detrimental effect of do and oxidative conditions could expand the application spectrum of ppb e g for in situ aquaculture resource recovery or for recovery form high do streams in addition this is highly relevant when considering the growth of ppb in open pond systems with large surfaces for oxygen transfer as an excessive oxygen concentration e g due to diffusion or excessive mixing using paddle wheels might lead to oxidative environments if the organic matter concentration in the liquid cannot maintain reducing conditions this article aims to shed light on the effect of oxygen on the treatment performance of ppb based systems using enriched cultures and non sterile real wastewaters particular attention was paid to the competition between ppb and common aerobic heterotrophs a number of batch tests at different controlled do ranges were carried out to determine the oxygen uptake rates ours and the maximum do concentrations that would allow efficient photoheterotrophic growth a flat plate reactor was also used to study the effect of air supply at constant flow rates to determine the lowest air flows at which photoheterotrophic growth is suppressed the cod and nutrient recoveries the absorption spectra for carotenoids and bchls assessment and the microbial populations were studied to elucidate the prevalent metabolic routes in each condition 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewaters used and ppb enriched inoculum two different wastewater streams domestic and poultry processing wastewaters were used to further validate the applicability of the obtained results the wastewater characteristics are presented in table s1 in detail and briefly described here 2 1 1 domestic wastewater raw domestic wastewater was collected at a local pump station brisbane australia and immediately stored at 4 c the wastewater was settled in 200 l tanks for at least 1 day and the supernatant was used as growth media the settled wastewater contained on average 510 3 mg l 1 total chemical oxygen demand tcod 427 18 mg l 1 soluble cod scod 57 5 1 mg l 1 nh4 n and 7 7 0 4 mg l 1 po4 3 p 2 1 2 poultry wastewater wastewater from a local poultry processing facility in brisbane australia was used the poultry wastewater consisted of a mixture of water streams resulting from feather removal bird degutting and general cleaning water the raw wastewater was pre screened on site at 3 mm and settled after its collection the wastewater was stored at 4 c on average the wastewater contained 1 620 299 mg tcod l 1 1 386 156 mg scod l 1 158 11 mg l 1 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn 37 7 mg l 1 total phosphorus tp 107 12 mg l 1 nh4 n and 21 1 3 mg l 1 po4 3 p 2 1 3 ppb inoculum to avoid substantial lag phases the experiments were inoculated with a ppb enriched sludge 50 60 ppb relative abundance the inoculum was collected from an open outdoor demonstration scale flat plate photobioreactor treating poultry wastewater and transferred to a 1l schott bottle the bottle was stirred magnetically at 150 rpm rct basic kika labortechnik covered with uv vis absorbing foil nd 1 2 299 transformation tubes and illuminated with a 150 w fluorescence lamp nelson portable flood light at 100 w m 2 this procedure ensured that the inoculum would be active at the start of the experiments the average volatile solids vs concentration in the inoculum before using it was 1 2 0 4 g l 1 it must be mentioned that the authors attempted without success to enrich ppb acclimated to microaerobic aerobic conditions via several aerated batch experiments see appendix a also see figure a1 and a2 for the experimental setup and resulting microbial communities 2 2 batch experiments at different do levels 2 2 1 experimental setup based on data from the literature four different do ranges were tested using three open 250 ml schott bottles as batch reactors i e 0 mg l 1 0 0 25 mg l 1 0 0 5 mg l 1 and 0 4 5 mg l 1 aiming at testing different do concentrations meng et al 2017 yang et al 2018a 2018c each reactor was covered with uv vis absorbing foil and stirred at 150 rpm rct basic kika labortechnik continuous illumination was provided by three one per bottle 150 w fluorescence lamps nelson portable flood light at an overall intensity of 120 130 w m 2 with a distribution of 17 below 700 nm 15 at 700 800 nm 20 at 800 900 nm and 48 at 900 1 000 nm measured with a stellarnet blue wave spectrometer these lamps have been widely applied in studies growing ppb photoheterotrophically hülsen 2014 hülsen et al 2016 capson tojo et al 2020 do and temperature t were measured using a m200 transmitter and a easysense o2 21 probe mettler toledo limited port melbourne australia in a continuous recycle loop at a flow rate of 42 55 ml min 1 peristaltic pump stauff pumps richlands australia and data were recorded every 15 seconds each bottle the do was kept within the desired concentrations using an on off feedback control loop implemented in a programmable logic controller equipped with labview labview national instruments texas usa ersahin et al 2014 this allowed to modify the set points as desired simply by varying the upper do limits values when the air compressor would stop and the lower do limits values at which the compressor would start the air compressors were 12v dc permanent magnetic aerators hailea ltd china the air flow rates into the reactors were controlled at 0 3 0 8 l min 1 unless specified otherwise by three flow meters brooks instrument 0 1 0 l min 1 air usa this setup allowed not only to keep the do within the desired limits but also to experimentally determine the our a schematic of the batch setup including the control loop is presented in figure s1a the described setup was also used in triplicate as abiotic control with acetic acid and water to determine potential cod losses of the acetic acid due to stripping a similar setup but without aeration and do monitoring was used as anaerobic control also run in triplicate the bottles were closed and the headspace was extended with one empty 50 ml syringe triplicate the headspace of the control reactors was flushed with pure nitrogen gas 2 2 2 batch operation the 0 mg l 1 0 0 25 mg l 1 and 0 0 5 mg l 1 do tests were started with 250 ml of a 1 4 vol vol mixture of inoculum 1 2 0 4 g vs l 1 and domestic wastewater glacial acetic acid was spiked at 500 mg cod l 1 to provide a readily available source of organics and to optimise the cod n p ratio of the media maximizing the nutrient removal and allowing for an easier interpretation of the results hülsen et al 2016 acetic acid was selected as substrate because i it is the most common substrate used for ppb enrichment growing photoheterotrophically hülsen et al 2014 ormerod 1983 and ii it is the most common acid produced during fermentation of non synthetic wastewaters puyol et al 2017 the initial ph was adjusted to 6 8 0 2 with 1m naoh the system was slightly modified for two particular tests firstly in the experiment with do at 0 mg l 1 the headspace of the reactors with do control opened to the atmosphere was continuously flushed with nitrogen gas to ensure anaerobic conditions secondly in the experiment at the highest do level 0 4 5 mg l 1 air was not supplied by on off control of compressors instead natural air diffusion into the liquid via droplet formation using the recycle pump was used for oxygen supply the tube from the pump was placed slightly over the liquid level in the same experiment the inoculation ratio was lower than in the others 1 9 volume inoculum volume wastewater which caused a considerable lag phase and lower removal rates see figure 1 a and b 4 5 and table 1 to avoid this issue the inoculation ratio was increased to 1 4 in the other experiments samples were taken every 5 6 h to study the kinetics of the process measuring scod tcod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations the experiments were stopped when no further scod consumption was observed leading to a duration of 31 78 h the temperature ranged between 35 and 39 c the total solids ts vs tkn and tp contents and the absorption spectra were determined at the start and end of the experiments the microbial communities at the start and end of the tests for both the anaerobic controls and the aerated reactors were studied for one flask of the triplicate tests run at 0 mg do l 1 0 0 5 mg do l 1 and 0 4 5 mg do l 1 2 3 estimation of the kinetic parameters of ppb respiration the experimental setup described above was also used to evaluate the kinetics of ppb aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth via respiration to ensure that ppb were responsible for the aerobic uptake a ppb culture enriched via 3 serial dilutions was used as inoculum with an initial ppb relative abundance of 63 figure s2 the enrichment was carried out under anaerobic illuminated conditions with uv vis filtering foil and using ormerod media as in hülsen et al 2014 a schott bottle with a working volume of 0 6 l total volume of 1 l was used the cycles lasted for 6 7 days and the serial dilutions were started with 10 of the total volume of the previous cycle a modified ormerod media with glucose as carbon and energy source instead of acetic acid was used as substrate for the aerobic test at an initial concentration of 500 mg cod l 1 glucose was chosen to avoid cod losses due to volatilisation and because several ppb species are known to perform glycolysis under aerobic conditions kegg 2019 the test in triplicate was started with 250 ml of a 1 4 vol vol mixture of inoculum 0 8 0 1 g vss l 1 and modified ormerod medium the do concentration in the experiments was controlled at 1 0 3 0 mg do l 1 to ensure that aerobic conditions were maintained and that oxygen was not limiting the temperature was 32 36 c the reactors were covered with aluminium foil to avoid light penetration and phototrophic growth the resulting glucose consumption curve figure s3 was used to estimate the corresponding kinetic parameters in agreement with most iwa mathematical models and generally wastewater treatment modelling a monod kinetic function for substrate uptake was used batstone et al 2002 henze et al 2000 jeppsson et al 2006 puyol et al 2019 the kinetic parameters i e maximum specific uptake rate kaer defined as growth rate µ divided by biomass yield y and half saturation constant ks aer were estimated by minimization of the residual sum of squares sum of errors of means divided by standard deviation as objective function using de function lsqnonlin in matlab matlab r2018b the mathworks inc natick ma batstone et al 2002 puyol et al 2017 95 confidence intervals were determined using the function nlparci the apparent biomass yield y was estimated as particulate cod increase divided by soluble cod consumption the biomass growth rate µ was calculated as µ kaer y 2 4 flat plate batch tests at different air flow rates 2 4 1 experimental setup three different conditions were tested using a flat plate reactor at increasing air flow rates i e 0 ml min 1 10 ml min 1 and 100 ml min 1 figure s1b shows a schematic of the flat plate reactor the flat plate was a rectangular acrylic reactor 34 2 40 cm with a working volume of 2 1 2 2 l and an illuminated surface volume ratio of 30 m2 m 3 hülsen et al 2016 continuous illumination was provided by two 150 w fluorescence lamps one on each side nelson portable flood light at an overall intensity of 120 130 w m 2 and a wavelength spectrum similar to the one presented

chatswood australia recycling reactor content from the bottom to the top of the reactor at a flow rate of 70 ml min 1 mixing also served for cleaning of the inner reactor wall minimising biofilm

continuously one measurement every 30 seconds using a mettler toledo m200 transmitter coupled to an easysense o2 21 probe mettler toledo limited port melbourne australia the ph was also monitored using a hannah hi8614 transmitter and a hi2910b 5 ph probe hanna instruments victoria australia 2 4 2 flat plate operation the reactor was run in consecutive batch cycles before aerating the reactor four anaerobic batches at 0 ml air min 1 were run to establish a baseline the fifth cycle was aerated at 100 ml air min 1 and the sixth cycle at 10 ml air min 1 aiming to evaluate the effect of low and high air flow rates and to find the lowest flow rates at which photoheterotrophic growth would be suppressed all cycles were started with a 0 7 1 5 vol vol mixture of inoculum and poultry wastewater a different wastewater was used in these experiments to assess if the wastewater matrix affected the results poultry wastewater was more complex and concentrated than domestic wastewater see table s1 real wastewaters were used to evaluate microbial competition under realistic conditions i e wastewater native competing microbes the inoculum described in section 2 1 3 was used for the first cycle for the aerated tests inoculum from the anaerobic cycles kept in an equivalent anaerobic control was used the ph was not adjusted the duration of each cycle was 3 4 days the temperature was 35 1 8 c the performance of the system was assessed by measuring the scod tcod nh4 n po4 3 p ts vs tkn and tp contents at the beginning and end of the batch cycles the absorption spectra and microbial communities of the inoculum used and of samples taken at the end of each batch run were also analysed 2 5 analytical methods tcod and scod concentrations were determined using cod cell tests merck 1 14541 0001 darmstadt germany the concentrations of nh4 n nox n no2 n and po4 3 p were measured via flow injection analysis fia quikchem8000 hach company loveland usa the concentrations of tkn

absorption spectra were measured between 300 1 000 nm using a spectrophotometer cary 50 conc varian 2 6 analysis of the microbial communities samples of suspended biomass were provided to the australian centre for ecogenomics for dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing using the illumina miseq platform the universal primer pair 926f 50 aaactyaaakgaattgacgg 30 and the 1392wr 50 acgggcggtgwgtrc 30 primer sets were used engelbrektson et al 2010 trimmomatic was used to trim the raw paired reads to remove reads shorter that 190 bp and or with low quality with a phred 33 lower than 20 bolger et al 2014 the trimmed paired reads were assembled using pandaseq with default parameters masella et al 2012 removal of adapter sequences was performed using the fastq clipper from the fastx toolkit pearson et al 1997 the resulting sequences were analysed via qiime v1 8 0 caporaso et al 2010 and de noised with dada2 callahan et al 2016 after which the features relative frequencies of the amplicon sequence variants asv were calculated the taxonomy was assigned by uclust against the silva rrna gene database 128 release quast et al 2013 asvs with only one or two reads were filtered from the asvs table the resulting asvs were processed according to hülsen et al 2018b 2 7 data treatment and statistical analyses statistical differences were assessed with anova carried out using the software r the r foundation version 3 5 3 a 5 significance threshold was used oxidative cod losses were estimated calculating the area below the our curves figure s4 and figure s5 using the trapezoidal rule in r trapz function in the pracma package when the our was not available in triplicate during a certain period the missing values were extrapolated from the other replicates where confidence intervals are presented for measured data these represent 95 confidence interval in mean from two tailed t test 5 significance threshold 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch experiments effect of different do levels on photoheterotrophic growth the cod and do concentrations as well as those of nutrients i e nh4 n and po4 3 p in the batch experiments are presented in figure 1 the evolution of the cod and nutrient concentrations in the anaerobic controls and aerated reactors at 0 mg do l 1 no aeration supplied and headspace continuously flushed with n2 were practically the same confirming that the unaerated setup was representative of anaerobic conditions thus enabling unbiased comparisons of both systems figure 1 the absorption spectra in the anaerobic tests confirmed the presence of absorbance peaks at 450 510 nm and 800 900 nm figure 2 characteristic of carotenoids and bchls oren 2011 the presence of lhc pigments and constant tcod levels with biomass yields close to 1 0 g cod g cod 1 evidenced the predominance of photoheterotrophic growth under anaerobic conditions table 1 and figure 1a the tcod conservation also demonstrates biological uptake rather than losses due to stripping in the open reactors photoheterotrophic growth was further confirmed by the cod n p removal ratios of 100 6 7 12 0 9 12 which are much higher compared to common chemoheterotrophic ratios e g 100 5 0 0 5 for aerobic heterotrophs tchobanoglous et al 2003 and are well in line with previous literature values for ppb growing photoheterotrophically under anaerobic illuminated conditions puyol et al 2017 increasing do levels had a substantial impact against both control and within the experiments including the 0 mg do l 1 experiment in all the aerated reactors no characteristics pigment peaks could be detected in the absorption spectra at the end of the experiments figure 2 and the colour was lost figure s7 at all levels above 0 mg l 1 at do concentrations between 0 0 25 mg do l 1 the scod removal efficiency was similar between the aerated and control reactors 63 vs 56 respectively but a considerable decrease in tcod was observed 57 reduction vs 8 4 to 3 8 in the controls table 1 this suggests cod consumption for atp production rather than assimilation for growth and a switch from anaerobic photoheterotrophy towards aerobic heterotrophic growth via respiration this is underlined by the substantially lower biomass yields in the aerated reactor 0 23 vs 1 2 g cod g codremoved 1 see table 1 reduced biomass yields resulted in less biomass growth which led to less n and p assimilation this resulted in lower cod n p ratios of 100 5 0 0 5 typical for aerobic heterotrophs tchobanoglous et al 2003 and a subsequent reduction in nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies 51 aerobically vs 81 anaerobically for nh4 n and 21 vs 48 for po4 3 p see table 1 similar behaviours were observed in the tests at 0 0 5 mg do l 1 and 0 4 5 mg do l 1 the biomass yields were reduced to 0 15 0 31 g cod g codremoved 1 compared to 0 9 1 0 g cod g codremoved 1 in the controls as described above this naturally decreased the tcod removal efficiencies 1 1 3 8 in the controls vs 45 54 aerobically as well as the removal of nh4 n 72 82 vs 50 58 and po4 3 p 52 44 vs 37 21 when compared to the controls while the scod removal efficiencies remained similar 56 59 vs 55 59 the prevalence of biological cod removal in the aerated tests was confirmed by the abiotic control figure s6 were cod stripping during the first 15 h was below 40 mg cod l 1 period when the cod consumption in the aerated reactors occurred see figure 1 this was also supported by cod balances closing at 80 85 in the 0 0 25 and 0 0 5 mg do l 1 tests the oxidized cod was estimated from the our barker and dold 1995 the removal rates of cod were also faster in aerated conditions when sufficient air was supplied i e 0 0 5 and 0 4 5 mg do l 1 aerobically maximum values up to 92 mg scod l 1 d 1 were achieved higher than the maximum anaerobic rates 58 mg scod l 1 d 1 this might be explained by the generally faster kinetics of aerobic metabolism when compared to photoheterotrophy e g maximum specific growth rate for heterotrophic biomass of 6 0 d 1 20 c henze et al 1987 vs 2 4 d 1 20 c for photoheterotrophic acetic acid uptake by ppb puyol et al 2017 to elucidate the main actors under aerobic conditions i e ppb growing heterotrophically or common heterotrophs the initial and final microbial communities in the batch reactors were analysed the results show that the relative abundance of ppb was reduced when oxygen was supplied as shown in figure 3 the relative abundance of ppb at the end of the batches generally dominated by allochromatium blastochloris and xanthobacteraceae ranged between 36 54 in the control reactors and the experiment at 0 mg do l 1 while the abundance was reduced to 22 in the experiment at 0 0 5 mg do l 1 and down to 3 3 in the experiment at 0 4 5 mg do l 1 similarly the abundances of anaerobic bacteria mainly belonging to bacteroidales or sphingobacteriales were also reduced instead the relative abundances of other non phototrophic aerobic organisms e g pseudomonadales chlamydiales or aerobic eukaryota increased indicating a strong competition and selective advantages for common aerobic heterotrophs under the tested conditions the high proportions of eukaryotes mainly aerobic protozoa such as intramacronucleata suggests that predation occurred under aerobic conditions which explains the low biomass yields found in the aerated reactors particularly significant in the experiment at 0 4 5 mg do l 1 due to the longer duration of the test the long duration of the batch tests limited the bioavailable cod particularly in the aerated experiments due to the faster cod uptake rates which resulted in decay and predation by aerobic grazers considering that the performances of the 0 0 25 and 0 0 5 mg do l 1 experiments were very similar see figures 1 and 2 only one sample was selected for microbial analysis regarding the oxidation reduction potential orp in the reactors the predominance of oxidative conditions can be confirmed by the measured do concentrations within common cod ranges in activated sludge plants treating wastewater such as those used in this study do concentrations of 0 1 0 mg do l 1 result in orps of 100 250 mv and do values over 1 0 mg do l 1 in orps of 250 370 mv which correspond to reducing conditions with orps well above the point at which crtj is oxidised madigan et al 2011 li and bishop 2001 in addition the presence of aerobic heterotrophs also evidences oxidative environments as they require positive orps to grow jay et al 2005 as mentioned above these oxidative conditions consequence of the continuous oxygen supply are responsible for the repression of photosynthetic gene expression 3 2 batch experiments evaluating the kinetics of ppb aerobic growth a dedicated batch experiment was carried out to evaluate the kinetics of ppb growth under aerobic conditions the resulting kinetic parameters corresponding to a monod kinetic function for substrate uptake see figure s3 were a maximum specific uptake rate kaer of 4 66 g cod g cod 1 d 1 and a half saturation constant ks aer of 0 4 mg cod l 1 at 32 36 c the measured biomass yield was 0 51 g cod g cod 1 resulting in a growth rate of 2 38 d 1 this assumes that glucose was mostly consumed for biomass growth as nutrients were not limiting and there was no excess of reducing power thus avoiding the accumulation of storage compounds such as polyhydroxyalkanoates or glycogen this value is lower than the typical growth rates reported for heterotrophic biomass maximum specific growth rate of 6 0 d 1 20 c henze et al 1987 which further explains why ppb were outcompeted by aerobes the faster removal kinetics in the aerated batch experiments see table 1 are in agreement with the obtained results recent yields and growth rates determined for pure ppb cultures i e rhodopseudomonas palustris rhodospirillum rubrum rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodobacter capsulatus on several organic substrates i e fructose succinate or acetic acid also agree with the obtained results with biomass yields of 0 50 0 76 g cod g cod 1 and growth rates of 2 4 3 9 d 1 at 28 c alloul et al 2021 3 3 flat plate batch tests effect of constant air supply on photoheterotrophic growth to determine the lowest oxygen supply that still allows photoheterotrophy and to confirm the results from the batch tests on another wastewater and also to obtain results free of grazers six batch cycles were carried out in a flat plate photobioreactor figure 4 due to the do sensor sensitivity of 0 2 mg do l 1 we decided to control the air flow rather than the do the average results from cycles 1 4 without air supply 0 ml min 1 show that an anaerobic operation baseline was achieved with removal efficiencies of 56 66 28 51 and 25 35 for scod soluble tkn and soluble p respectively as in the previous section photoheterotrophic growth could be confirmed via tcod conservation balances closed to 10 and by the presence of the characteristic carotenoid and bchl a absorption peaks at the end of the cycles figure 5 a note that the absorption peaks form the literature correspond to extracts which is why the correspoding peaks in our experiments do not match perfectly when oxygen was supplied at an air flow rate of 100 ml min 1 cycle 5 a similar situation to the one reported in the aerated batch reactors was observed specifically compared to the 0 4 5 mg do l 1 test a tcod loss of 48 confirmed cod consumption for atp synthesis respiration was confirmed by the do measurements figure 5b showing that a steep do decrease occurred during the first 10 h of the cycle period of the most significant cod consumption the colour loss figure s8 and the absence of absorbance peaks at the end of the cycle for both carotenoids and bchl a figure 5a also suggests that chemoheterotrophic growth by ppb heterotrophs or both was dominant it is important to note that very small bchl peaks are still observable figure 5a which might point to the presence of small amounts of pigments inside or outside the cells a similar behaviour was observed at an air flow rate of 10 ml min 1 cycle 6 which resulted in non detectable do concentrations 0 mg l 1 during the whole experimental period observing just a slight increase at the end interestingly even at effectively 0 mg do l 1 in the reactor pigmentation loss was still observed no absorbance peaks see figure 5b figure s8 the loss of photoheterotrophy and the predominance of chemoheterotrophy was again underlined by tcod losses of 44 these results suggest that even undetectable amounts of oxygen in several publications referred to as micro aerobic conditions can lead to oxidative conditions which in turn result in inhibition of pigment synthesis and eventually in colour loss in ppb enriched cultures the evolution of the cod and do concentrations and the ph during cycle 6 10 ml min 1 is shown in figure s9 analysis of the microbial communities confirmed the reduction in ppb abundance when oxygen was supplied figure 6 while the initial ppb abundance 48 dominated by blastochloris sp rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp was maintained in the anaerobic baseline tests cycles 1 4 this was reduced to 33 34 in the aerated experiments in contrast to the previous batch results figure 3 in these experiments grazers were not found and therefore the ppb decrease can simply be attributed to the growth of aerobic microbes in fact while the presence of aerobes initially and during the anaerobic baseline was negligible 0 2 0 4 heterotrophs such as simkaniaceae planctomicrobium flavobacterium or caulobacter accounted for 14 28 of the total 16s copies at the end of the aerated experiments these results suggest that in long term experiments the slower aerobic kinetics of ppb compared to common heterotrophs will result in ppb outcompetition nevertheless the colour loss cannot be explained by ppb outcompetition as ppb were still present in considerable proportions at the end of the aerated cycles 33 34 therefore suppression of pigments synthesis and pigment oxidation occurred due to the presence of oxygen and the resulting oxidative conditions as previously confirmed by the growth of aerobes without a proportional loss of the ppb community we note that the slightly higher tkn and tp removal efficiencies in the aerated experiment are a consequence of an enhanced hydrolysis of the complex organic matter present in the wastewater e g vs particulate cod and tkn see table s1 under aerobic conditions nevertheless the removal ratios were still higher in the anaerobic experiment e g cod p removal ratios of 100 1 6 1 9 and 100 0 5 0 9 for anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively confirming the results obtained in the previous batch experiments the complex nature of the poultry wastewater is also the reason why the removal efficiencies presented in figure 4 are expressed as tkn and tp rather than nh4 n and po4 3 p which are constantly mobilised from particulate tkn and tp 3 4 overall impact of do on the behavior of ppb enriched systems the obtained results show that photoheterotrophic growth in ppb enriched systems is inhibited under the oxidative conditions resulting from the presence of oxygen in any of the tested conditions oxygen supply resulted in oxidative conditions and a consequent colour pigments loss this led to a metabolic switch from photoheterotrophy to aerobic chemoheterotrophy either with or without preservation of the ppb community depending on the do level but always with lower ppb abundance levels after aeration this resulted in wastewater treatment parameters in terms of removal efficiencies cod n p ratios and biomass yields similar to those achieved in common aerobic technologies rather than anaerobic phototrophic systems the pigmentation loss likely occurred due to repression of the genes involved in pigment production and the consequent ppb outcompetition pemberton et al 1998 yurkov and hughes 2017 the results also suggest that this occurs independently from the wastewater source we argue that even a pure ppb culture in a sterile media would behave as described above but the colour loss would simply take more time as indicated by the high abundances of ppb in the control reactors shown in section 3 1 this is simply explained by the dilution of the initial pigment concentration within the cells as aerobic grow occurs without further pigment production ppb enrichments cultivated anaerobically 80 ppb relative abundance and aerated after growth without external carbon or nutrients supply kept colour for 5 7 days figure s10 this reinforces the role of cell death division in the loss of coloration suggesting also that ppb can conserve pigments inside their cells under aerobic conditions for considerable periods of time provided that carbon sources allowing aerobic growth either of ppb or others are not present in the media the loss of photoheterotrophy resulted in the loss of the main competitive advantage of ppb therefore they were slowly outcompeted by aerobic organisms when oxygen was supplied which is underlined by the decreased ppb relative abundance at the end of the aerated experiments the aerobic growth rates for ppb estimated as 2 4 d 1 in our experiment at 32 36 c figure s3 are lower than the growth rates of common aerobic chemoheterotrophs 6 d 1 at 20 c henze et al 1987 which explains the observed outcompetition colour loss and ppb outcompetition under aerobic conditions were previously observed in an anaerobic enriched ppb reactor where accidental oxygen leaks in the compressor resulted in overgrow of ppb by aerobes mainly thalassospira hülsen et al 2019 izu et al 2001 observed a similar phenomenon and attributed the outcompetition of ppb to the lower growth kinetics of ppb compared to aerobes despite their reduced competitiveness the capability of ppb to grow aerobically via respiration gives them some resilience even if photoheterotrophic growth is suppressed at lower do concentrations 0 0 5 mg do l 1 ppb were still present at the end of the tests underlining a degree of resilience at these do levels ppb likely switched to chemoheterotrophy and this ability even if at lower rates compared with common aerobic heterotrophs allowed them to survive in the system therefore it is logical to assume that ppb contributed actively to the aerobic cod removal in the presented experiments although to what extent is difficult to assess quantitatively without competition especially of fast growing aerobes ppb might very well survive and even thrive under aerobic conditions however the data suggest a struggle of ppb in an aerobic system and certainly a loss of photoheterotrophic capability due to pigment loss looking at the differences in rates between ppb and common aerobes ppb might be washed out after 3 4 serial dilutions 7 days this explains the low ppb abundances in conventional activated sludge cas systems siefert et al 1978 zhang et al 2003 in reality ppb will be outcompeted in a short period of time by faster growing aerobic heterotrophs in any aerobic non axenic process overall the results clearly show that oxygen and the resulting oxidative conditions suppressed photoheterotrophic growth of ppb while the wastewater treatment behaviour resembled aerobic systems e g tcod removal efficiencies of 45 57 apparent biomass yields of 0 15 0 31 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 and scod n p removal ratios of 100 4 5 5 0 0 4 0 8 rather than anaerobic phototrophic systems e g no tcod removal biomass yields of 1 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 removal ratios of 100 6 7 12 0 9 1 2 slower removal kinetics and higher nutrient removal efficiencies mainly due to the establishment of typical aerobic heterotrophs which resulted in lower abundances of ppb at the end of the tests these findings contradict several recent publications using a pure culture of rhodopseudomonas and artificial wastewater meng et al 2017 obtained similar biomass yields at different do levels up to 8 mg do l 1 also reporting that do levels above 1 mg do l 1 could even increase the carotenoid bchl contents when compared to anaerobic conditions no colour loss was observed at do levels of 0 2 0 5 mg do l 1 during the treatment of artificial brewery wastewater with a mixture of pure ppb cultures ectothiorhodospira rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodopseudomonas capsulate reporting average carotenoid and bchl contents of 2 53 and 10 8 mg g vs 1 lu et al 2019a pigments were also found when treating synthetic wastewater using an isolated ppb mixture with ectothiorhodospira as predominant genus at a do of 2 4 mg do l 1 with contents of 3 3 and 1 4 mg g vs 1 for carotenoids and bchl respectively zhi et al 2020 yang et al 2018a reported 6 5 mg g vs 1 of carotenoids in psb grown under dark aerobic conditions no light supply and over 2 mg do l 1 these findings are in direct contradiction with our results a possible reason could be that in all the studies claiming a positive high do effect ppb could not be outcompeted as pure cultures and sterile media were mostly used nevertheless this explanation cannot justify the high pigment contents or even increases compared with anaerobic tests at high do levels and surely under oxidative environments as most of these experiments were carried out in short batch tests selection of do tolerant ppb species cannot explain this observation by itself either 3 5 implications for industrial application this study shows that anaerobic conditions are required for effective ppb selection at aerobic micro aerobic conditions and the resulting oxidative environments ppb cannot grow photoheterotrophically and are therefore outcompeted by aerobic organisms as their main competitive advantage is lost this limits the application of ppb based processes for nutrient recovery to systems with low oxygen contents and reductive conditions excluding systems where one may wish to generate ppb in a sidestream from an aerobic system e g sidestream generation from aquaculture though oxygen scavengers could be added to alleviate this nevertheless the aerobic capabilities of ppb allow them to grow in the presence of oxygen at lower rates compared to aerobic heterotrophs therefore longer term aeration is required to fully outcompete ppb this opens the door for the application of combined systems a combination of aerobic anaerobic intervals could be applied in outdoor systems illuminated by sunlight meng et al 2018 reported this approach in the material and methods but the results and discussion did not present any data about the actual effects on the performance and microbial competition recently alloul et al 2021 proposed a hybrid 2 stage system where ppb were enriched photoheterotrophically in the 1st stage and aerobic heterotrophs were aerobically co cultivated with the produced ppb in the 2nd stage via this approach the authors reported an improved nutritional quality of the biomass with higher protein contents and a more attractive amino acid profile when compared to single aerobic biomass production in agreement with our study they observed that the proportion of ppb decreased to 10 pnsb after aerobic co cultivation with aerobic heterotrophic bacteria from over 90 pnsb in the 1st stage open ponds with limited passive oxygen diffusion will also be affected by the growth of aerobes but again the aerobic capabilities of ppb will allow them to grow and if the concentration of organic matter is high enough to allow oxygen depletion ppb will be able to consume the remaining cod photoheterotrophically provided that the oxygen is supplied in amounts low enough to avoid oxidative conditions at the given cod concentrations we believe that a potential combined process could be based on i resource recovery with high biomass yields and cod n p ratios being efficiently provided under anaerobic conditions during daytime photoheterotrophy and ii limited air supply during night hours to provide aerobic wastewater treatment but with reduced biomass yields and cod n p uptake ratios due to chemoheterotrophic growth this would likely increase the cod removal efficiencies while reducing the n and p removal efficiencies at night overall the volumetric capacity of a ppb mediated system would be increased potentially more than doubled when compared to daytime photoheterotrophy only this would have effects on the overall size and volume of the photobioreactor thus reducing the capital costs while slightly increasing the operational costs due to aeration the effects on the microbial community might be either substantially increased ppb proportions or ppb loss with more non phototrophic facultative microbes higher ppb proportions might occur due to the selective growth during the day where the abundance of ppb would be relatively high just before darkness this means that ppb could still consume a significant fraction of the supplied oxygen albeit at lower growth rates while facultative organisms would consume relatively less due to the lack of oxygen during the day meaning that they would grow but to a lesser extent compared with ppb over time this might result in ppb dominance of some specialised genera however this will depend entirely on the adaptation of the facultative microbes their slower growth during daytime and the aerobic capabilities of ppb must be able to cope with the faster growth of facultative aerobes at night aerobic grazers would be supressed in such a system due to intermittent low do conditions instead we expect higher volumetric loading rates and productivities at reduced hrts for a combined aerobic anaerobic day night interval system this provides enhanced capability against a pure solar phototrophic system which can only be fed during the day when solar radiation is provided here we propose a solution to this major problem but more research is required to determine whether this approach is feasible long term interval studies on real wastewater ideally outdoors should be carried out this should include the effects of temperature variations during day and night as this will substantially affect the kinetics of the different microbial clades involved which might lead to microbial shifts 4 conclusions at any of the do concentrations 0 5 4 5 mg do l 1 and air flow rates tested 10 and 100 ml min 1 oxygen supply led to inhibition of pigment production and colour loss which suppressed the photoheterotrophic capabilities of ppb this resulted in wastewater treatment parameters similar to those of aerobic reactors rather than anaerobic phototrophic systems i e considerable tcod decrease 45 57 vs 10 lower cod n p ratios 100 4 5 5 0 4 0 8 vs 100 6 7 12 0 9 1 2 and lower biomass yields 0 15 0 31 vs 0 8 1 2 g cod g codremoved 1 analyses of the microbial communities showed that the proportions of ppb decreased in the aerated experiments while the abundances of aerobic heterotrophs increased this suggests that ppb were outcompeted in these short tests and will eventually disappear from a real treatment setup in a matter of days depending of the retention times this was confirmed by the lower aerobic ppb growth rates 2 4 d 1 at 32 36 c when compared to common growth

17147,there is an ongoing debate around the effect of microaerobic aerobic conditions on the wastewater treatment performance and stability of enriched purple phototrophic bacteria ppb cultures it is well known that oxygen induced oxidative conditions inhibit the synthesis of light harvesting complexes required for photoheterotrophy however in applied research several publications have reported efficient wastewater treatment at high dissolved oxygen do levels this study evaluated the impact of different do concentrations 0 0 25 mg l 1 0 0 5 mg l 1 and 0 4 5 mg l 1 on the cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal performances the biomass yields and the final microbial communities of ppb enriched cultures treating real wastewaters domestic and poultry processing wastewater the results show that the presence of oxygen suppressed photoheterotrophic growth which led to a complete pigment and colour loss in a matter of 20 30 h after starting the batch under aerobic conditions chemoheterotrophy was the dominant catabolic pathway with wastewater treatment performances similar to those achieved in common aerobic reactors rather than those corresponding to phototrophic systems i e considerable total cod decrease 45 57 aerobically vs 10 anaerobically this includes faster consumption of cod and nutrients lower nutrient removal efficiencies 50 58 vs 72 99 for nh4 n lower cod n p substrate ratios 100 4 5 5 0 0 4 0 8 vs 100 6 7 12 0 9 1 2 and lower apparent biomass yields 0 15 0 31 vs 0 8 1 2 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 the suppression of photoheterotrophy inevitably resulted in a reduction of the relative ppb abundances in all the aerated tests below 20 at the end of the tests as ppb lost their main competitive advantage against competing aerobic heterotrophic microbes this was explained by the lower aerobic ppb growth rates 2 4 d 1 at 35 c when compared to common growth rates for aerobic heterotrophs 6 0 d 1 at 20 c therefore ppb effectively outcompete other microbes under illuminated anaerobic conditions but not under aerobic or even micro aerobic conditions as shown by continuously aerated tests controlled at undetectable do levels while their aerobic heterotrophic capabilities provide some resilience at non sterile conditions ppb cannot dominate when growing chemoheterotrophically and will be outcompeted graphical abstract image graphical abstract

photosynthesis as opposed to oxygenic photosynthesis to generate energy which enables the assimilation of pollutants from waste streams via photoheterotrophic growth using organic compounds as carbon source at biomass yields around 1 0 g cod g codremoved 1 hülsen et al 2018b 2018a 2014 winkler and straka 2019 ppb can be applied for simultaneous secondary and tertiary treatment partitioning soluble organics nitrogen n and phosphorus p into suspended aggregated flocculant or granular or attached biofilm biomass a recent review of 177 studies reported median cod n and p removal efficiencies under illuminated anaerobic conditions in various configurations of 76 53 and 58 respectively with optimal cod n p uptake ratios around 100 6 10 1 2 capson tojo et al 2020 lu et al 2019b puyol et al 2017 therefore ppb based processes represent a promising novel alternative for resource recovery from waste streams during anoxygenic photosynthesis light energy is collected via light harvesting complexes lhc containing various carotenoids and bacteriochlorophylls bchl the harvested light energy is further transformed into chemical energy in reaction centres bchls absorb wavelengths in the near infrared nir range 780 890 nm for bchl a and 970 1040 nm for bchl b with common maximum absorption peaks at 800 nm 850 nm or 1010 nm while carotenoids absorb mostly fractions of visible vis light e g 500 nm for lycopene or 550 555 nm for spirilloxanthin canniffe and hunter 2014 niedzwiedzki et al 2015 okubo et al 2006 saer and blankenship 2017 wang et al 2012 besides vis light harvesting with further transfer of excited electrons to bchls and to reaction centres for intracellular energy generation carotenoids also fulfil photoprotective functions frank and polívka 2009 hartigan et al 2002 saer and blankenship 2017 these carotenoids give phototrophically grown ppb cultures their very characteristic purple colour other than phototrophic growth ppb can also grow without light via fermentation anaerobic or chemoheterotrophic respiration aerobically or performing denitrification capson tojo et al 2020 in the presence of oxygen energy for cellular metabolism is mostly derived from aerobic respiratory chains and virtually no bchl or carotenoids are synthesized zeilstra ryalls et al 1998 this is because the oxidative conditions resulting from the prolonged presence of oxygen inhibit the expression of most of the genes coding for the light harvesting antenna responsible for energy capture and reaction centre complexes the main components of photosystems and responsible for energy transformation via electrical charge separation bauer et al 2003 gregor and klug 1999 sganga and bauer 1992 zhu et al 1986 using rhodobacter capsulatus as model organism it has been found that in the presence of oxygen a regulator known as crtj responds to oxidising growth conditions by oxidising a molecular hs hs bond to an s s bond which stimulates the dna binding activity of the repressor bauer et al 2003 this process is responsible for the repression of photosynthesis gene expression with a redox pair potential of 270 mv madigan et al 2011 it has been hypothesized that repressing gene expression is a protection mechanism of the cells to avoid photooxidative damage zhu et al 1986 this suppression results in the inhibition of photoheterotrophy and the shift towards chemoheterotrophy which results in reduced biomass yields and cod n p substrate ratios izu et al 2001 jiao et al 2003 siefert et al 1978 yue et al 2015 both quantitative studies and theoretical analyses have confirmed this phenomenon under micro aerobic conditions with oxidative phosphorylation rather than cyclic photophosphorylation being the predominant atp production route in ppb under these conditions lu et al 2011a 2011b this is in agreement with studies showing that ppb require an oxidation reduction potential orp below 200 mv for efficient photoheterotrophic growth ormerod 1983 siefert et al 1978 which was further supported by modelling ppb addition to activated sludge reactors huang et al 2001 the latter concluded that ppb do not synthesize pigments under aerobic conditions huang et al 2001 some ppb can survive naturally in media where oxidative conditions are prevalent such as marine sediments but even in those situations it is widely accepted that ppb live in niches where reducing conditions low in oxygen are available hiraishi et al 2020 madigan et al 2011 vethanayagam 1991 due to the aforementioned reasons most research applying ppb for resource recovery has been carried out under anaerobic illuminated conditions nevertheless a number of articles have suggested that photoheterotrophic growth occurred under illuminated microaerobic 0 5 1 0 mg do l 1 dissolved oxygen and even aerobic conditions 2 0 8 0 mg do l 1 this was suggested by either directly claiming that photophosphorylation occurred in the presence of oxygen meng et al 2017 peng et al 2018 by reporting optimal ppb growth conditions under simultaneous light and oxygen supply lu et al 2019a yang et al 2018c zhou et al 2016 2015 or by reporting effective carotenoid and bchl synthesis under aerobic conditions lu et al 2019a meng et al 2020 2017 yang et al 2018b zhi et al 2020 conversely previous studies from the same research group reported oxidative phosphorylation as main atp generation process in the presence of oxygen which inherently points towards aerobic chemoheterotrophy rather than photoheterotrophy lu et al 2013 2011a 2011b wang et al 2016 this was further supported by the generally lower biomass yields reported under aerobic conditions 0 19 0 51 g cod g codremoved 1 lu et al 2011b meng et al 2017 wu et al 2012 which are far from those achieved photoheterotrophically up to 1 0 g cod g codremoved 1 hülsen et al 2018b 2018a 2014 winkler and straka 2019 low yields point towards the consumption of cod for atp generation e g via oxidative phosphorylation in addition several studies have reported faster cod removal rates aerobically when compared to their anaerobically grown ppb both illuminated lu et al 2019a 2013 2011b meng et al 2020 2017 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2018b zhao and zhang 2014 this further points towards chemoheterotrophic growth under aerobic conditions not necessarily of ppb in mixed cultures as growth rates for common aerobic heterotrophs are higher when compared to those of ppb growing photoheterotrophically maximum specific growth rate for heterotrophic biomass of 6 0 d 1 at 20 c uptake rate of 8 95 d 1 assuming a yield of 0 67 g cod g cod 1 henze et al 1987 vs photoheterotrophic acetic acid specific uptake rate by ppb of 2 4 g cod g cod 1 d 1 20 c puyol et al 2017 the aerobic uptakes rates via chemoheterotrophy for ppb have been recently determined using different pure cultures i e rhodopseudomonas palustris rhodospirillum rubrum rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodobacter capsulatus obtaining values of 3 2 8 0 d 1 at 28 c with fructose as substrate growth rates of 1 6 4 4 d 1 which are also higher than those achieved photoheterotrophically alloul et al 2021 considering the information presented above it is unclear how anaerobic photoheterotrophy can be performed under aerobic conditions and whether anaerobic photoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy take place simultaneously or are mutually exclusive it is also unclear how the competition of ppb with aerobic heterotrophs would play out under aerobic non sterile conditions treating real wastewater under anaerobic nir illuminated conditions the faster growth rates compared to common anaerobic vfa degrading microbes provide a selective advantage for ppb particularly in the case of acetate consumption photoheterotrophically compared to methanogenesis this is not the case under aerobic conditions in fact ppb have been reported to grow slower via respiration than common aerobic heterotrophs izu et al 2001 and ppb are therefore likely to be outcompeted over time hülsen et al 2019 izu et al 2001 siefert et al 1978 this is indicated by the very low abundances of ppb in activated sludge systems siefert et al 1978 zhang et al 2003 it is noteworthy that most studies reporting positive effects of high do levels have never considered this competition as tests have mostly been carried out using pure isolated cultures fed with artificial sterile media liu et al 2016 2015 lu et al 2019a 2013 2011b wang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 2012 zhou et al 2014 this is exacerbated by the general absence of microbial data in most studies claiming a positive effect of oxygen on the ppb treatment performance particularly at the end in batch studies tend among the studies reporting the microbial communities batch tests with durations of 3 4 days have shown that aerobic heterotrophs e g pseudomonas or hyphomonas are present at considerable proportions at tend under illuminated aerated conditions yang et al 2018c 2018a zhou et al 2015 and that the ppb diversity is reduced zhao and zhang 2014 in addition the presence of strict anaerobes at the end of batches suggests that anaerobic regions might have existed in the reactors despite aeration peng et al 2018 yang et al 2018c none of the aforementioned studies reported high proportions of bacteria commonly found in ppb mediated reactors e g rhodobacter or rhodopseudomonas capson tojo et al 2020 which suggests that they are not dominant or cannot compete when oxygen is supplied interestingly none of these studies reported the presence of pigment producing aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs i e erythrobacter roseobacter roseovarius rubriomonas or roseivivax oren 2011 when oxygen was provided in addition to obvious scientific reasons this lack of agreement on the effect of oxygen on the performance of ppb mediated treatment systems and its importance for resource recovery is clearly relevant for practical application on one hand ppbs might be outcompeted in a matter of days on the other a non detrimental effect of do and oxidative conditions could expand the application spectrum of ppb e g for in situ aquaculture resource recovery or for recovery form high do streams in addition this is highly relevant when considering the growth of ppb in open pond systems with large surfaces for oxygen transfer as an excessive oxygen concentration e g due to diffusion or excessive mixing using paddle wheels might lead to oxidative environments if the organic matter concentration in the liquid cannot maintain reducing conditions this article aims to shed light on the effect of oxygen on the treatment performance of ppb based systems using enriched cultures and non sterile real wastewaters particular attention was paid to the competition between ppb and common aerobic heterotrophs a number of batch tests at different controlled do ranges were carried out to determine the oxygen uptake rates ours and the maximum do concentrations that would allow efficient photoheterotrophic growth a flat plate reactor was also used to study the effect of air supply at constant flow rates to determine the lowest air flows at which photoheterotrophic growth is suppressed the cod and nutrient recoveries the absorption spectra for carotenoids and bchls assessment and the microbial populations were studied to elucidate the prevalent metabolic routes in each condition 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewaters used and ppb enriched inoculum two different wastewater streams domestic and poultry processing wastewaters were used to further validate the applicability of the obtained results the wastewater characteristics are presented in table s1 in detail and briefly described here 2 1 1 domestic wastewater raw domestic

experiments were inoculated with a ppb enriched sludge 50 60 ppb relative abundance the inoculum was collected from an open outdoor demonstration scale flat plate photobioreactor treating poultry wastewater and transferred to a 1l schott bottle the bottle was stirred magnetically at 150 rpm rct basic kika labortechnik covered with uv vis absorbing foil nd 1 2 299 transformation tubes and illuminated with a 150 w fluorescence lamp nelson portable flood light at 100 w m 2 this procedure ensured that the inoculum would be active at the start of the experiments the average volatile solids vs concentration in the inoculum before using it was 1 2 0 4 g l 1 it must be mentioned that the authors attempted without success to enrich ppb acclimated to microaerobic aerobic conditions via several aerated batch experiments see appendix a also see figure a1 and a2 for the experimental setup and resulting microbial communities 2 2 batch experiments at different do levels 2 2 1 experimental setup based on data from the literature four different do ranges were tested using three open 250 ml schott bottles as batch reactors i e 0 mg l 1 0 0 25 mg l 1 0 0 5 mg l 1 and 0 4 5 mg

continuous illumination was provided by three one per bottle 150 w fluorescence lamps nelson portable flood light at an overall intensity of 120 130 w m 2 with a distribution of 17 below 700 nm 15 at

hülsen et al 2016 capson tojo et al 2020 do and temperature t were measured using a m200 transmitter and a easysense o2 21 probe mettler toledo limited port melbourne australia in a continuous recycle loop at a flow rate of 42 55 ml min 1 peristaltic pump stauff pumps richlands australia and data were recorded every 15 seconds each bottle the do was kept within the desired concentrations using an on off feedback control loop implemented in a programmable logic controller equipped with labview labview national instruments texas usa ersahin et al 2014 this allowed to modify the set points as desired simply by varying the upper do limits values when the air compressor would stop and the lower do limits values at which the compressor would start the air compressors were 12v dc permanent magnetic aerators hailea ltd china the air flow rates into the reactors were controlled at 0 3 0 8 l min 1 unless specified otherwise by three flow meters brooks instrument 0 1 0 l min 1 air usa this setup allowed not only to keep the do within the desired limits but also to experimentally determine the our a schematic of the batch setup including the control loop is presented in figure s1a the described setup was also used in triplicate as abiotic control with acetic acid and water to determine potential cod losses of the acetic acid due to stripping a similar setup but without aeration and do monitoring was used as anaerobic control also run in triplicate the bottles were closed and the headspace was extended with one empty 50 ml syringe triplicate the headspace of the control reactors was flushed with pure nitrogen gas 2 2 2 batch operation the 0 mg l 1 0 0 25 mg l 1 and 0 0 5 mg l 1 do tests were started with 250 ml of a 1 4 vol vol mixture of inoculum 1 2 0 4 g vs l 1 and domestic wastewater glacial acetic acid was spiked at 500 mg cod l 1 to provide a readily available source of organics and to optimise the cod n p ratio of the media maximizing the nutrient removal and allowing for an easier interpretation of the results hülsen et al 2016 acetic acid was selected as substrate because i it is the most common substrate used for ppb enrichment growing photoheterotrophically hülsen et al 2014 ormerod 1983 and ii it is the most common acid produced during fermentation of non synthetic wastewaters puyol et al 2017 the initial ph was adjusted to 6 8 0 2 with 1m naoh the system was slightly modified for two particular tests firstly in the experiment with do at 0 mg l 1 the headspace of the reactors with do control opened to the atmosphere was continuously flushed with nitrogen gas to ensure anaerobic conditions secondly in the experiment at the highest do level 0 4 5 mg l 1 air was not supplied by on off control of compressors instead natural air diffusion into the liquid via droplet formation using the recycle pump was used for oxygen supply the tube from the pump was placed slightly over the liquid level in the same experiment the inoculation ratio was lower than in the others 1 9 volume inoculum volume wastewater which caused a considerable lag phase and lower removal rates see figure 1 a and b 4 5 and table 1 to avoid this issue the inoculation ratio was increased to 1 4 in the other experiments samples were taken every 5 6 h to study the kinetics of the process measuring scod tcod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations the experiments were stopped when no further scod consumption was observed leading to a duration of 31 78 h the temperature ranged between 35 and 39 c the total solids ts vs tkn and tp contents and the absorption spectra were determined at the start and end of the experiments the microbial communities at the start and end of the tests for both the anaerobic controls and the aerated reactors were studied for one flask of the triplicate tests run at 0 mg do l 1 0 0 5 mg do l 1 and 0 4 5 mg do l 1 2 3 estimation of the kinetic parameters of ppb respiration the experimental setup described above

was used as inoculum with an initial ppb relative abundance of 63 figure s2 the enrichment was carried out under anaerobic illuminated conditions with uv vis filtering foil and using ormerod media as in hülsen et al 2014 a schott bottle with a working volume of 0 6 l total volume of 1 l was used the cycles lasted for 6 7 days and the serial dilutions were started with 10 of the total volume of the previous cycle a modified ormerod media with glucose as carbon and energy source instead of acetic acid was used as substrate for the aerobic test at an initial concentration of 500 mg cod l 1 glucose

four anaerobic batches at 0 ml air min 1 were run to establish a baseline the fifth cycle was aerated at 100 ml air min 1 and the sixth cycle at 10 ml air min 1 aiming to evaluate the effect of low and high air flow rates and to find the lowest flow rates at which photoheterotrophic growth would be suppressed all cycles were started with a 0 7 1 5 vol vol mixture of inoculum and poultry wastewater a different wastewater was used in these experiments to assess if the wastewater matrix affected the results poultry wastewater was more complex and concentrated than domestic wastewater

confidence intervals are presented for measured data these represent 95 confidence interval in mean from two tailed t test 5 significance threshold 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch experiments effect of different do levels on photoheterotrophic growth the cod and do concentrations as well as those of nutrients i e nh4 n and po4 3 p in the batch experiments are presented in figure 1 the evolution of the cod and nutrient concentrations in the anaerobic controls and aerated reactors at 0 mg do l 1 no aeration supplied and headspace continuously flushed with n2 were practically the same confirming that the unaerated setup was representative of anaerobic conditions thus enabling unbiased comparisons of both systems figure 1 the absorption spectra in the anaerobic tests confirmed the presence of absorbance peaks at 450 510 nm and 800 900 nm figure 2 characteristic of carotenoids and bchls oren 2011 the presence of lhc pigments and constant tcod levels with biomass yields close to 1 0 g cod g cod 1 evidenced the predominance of photoheterotrophic growth under anaerobic conditions table 1 and figure 1a the tcod conservation also demonstrates biological uptake rather than losses due to stripping in the open reactors photoheterotrophic growth was further confirmed by the cod n p removal ratios of 100 6 7 12 0 9 12 which are much higher compared to common chemoheterotrophic ratios e g 100 5 0 0 5 for aerobic heterotrophs tchobanoglous et al 2003 and are well in line with previous literature values for ppb growing photoheterotrophically under anaerobic illuminated conditions puyol et al 2017 increasing do levels had a substantial impact against both control and within the experiments including the 0 mg do l 1 experiment in all the aerated reactors no characteristics pigment peaks could be detected in the absorption spectra at the end of the experiments figure 2 and the colour was lost figure s7 at all levels above 0 mg l 1 at do concentrations between 0 0 25 mg do l 1 the scod removal efficiency was similar between the aerated and control reactors 63 vs 56 respectively but a considerable decrease in tcod was observed 57 reduction vs 8 4 to 3 8 in the controls table 1 this suggests cod consumption for atp production rather than assimilation for growth and a switch from anaerobic photoheterotrophy towards aerobic heterotrophic growth via respiration this is underlined by the substantially lower biomass yields in the aerated reactor 0 23 vs 1 2 g cod g codremoved 1 see table 1 reduced biomass yields resulted in less biomass growth which led to less n and p assimilation this resulted in lower cod n p ratios of 100 5 0 0 5 typical for aerobic heterotrophs tchobanoglous et al 2003 and a subsequent reduction in nh4 n and po4 3 p removal efficiencies 51 aerobically vs 81 anaerobically for nh4 n and 21 vs 48 for po4 3 p see table 1 similar behaviours were observed in the tests at 0 0 5 mg do l 1 and 0 4 5 mg do l 1 the biomass yields were reduced to 0 15 0 31 g cod g codremoved 1 compared to 0 9 1 0 g cod g codremoved 1 in the controls as described above this naturally decreased the tcod removal efficiencies 1 1 3 8 in the controls vs 45 54 aerobically as well as the removal of nh4 n 72 82 vs 50 58 and po4 3 p 52 44 vs 37 21 when compared to the controls while the scod removal efficiencies remained similar 56 59 vs 55 59 the prevalence of biological cod removal in the aerated tests was confirmed by the abiotic control figure s6 were cod stripping during the first 15 h was below 40 mg cod l 1 period when the cod consumption in the aerated reactors occurred see figure 1 this was also supported by cod balances closing at 80 85 in the 0 0 25 and 0 0 5 mg do l 1 tests the oxidized cod was estimated from the our barker and dold 1995 the removal rates of cod were also faster in aerated conditions when sufficient air was supplied i e 0 0 5 and 0 4 5 mg do l 1 aerobically maximum values up to 92 mg scod l 1 d 1 were achieved higher than the maximum anaerobic rates 58 mg scod l 1 d 1 this might be explained by the generally faster kinetics of aerobic metabolism when compared to photoheterotrophy e g maximum specific growth rate for heterotrophic biomass of 6 0 d 1 20 c henze et al 1987 vs 2 4 d 1 20 c for photoheterotrophic acetic acid uptake by ppb puyol et al 2017 to elucidate the main actors under aerobic conditions i e ppb growing heterotrophically or common heterotrophs the initial and final microbial communities in the batch reactors were analysed the results show that the relative abundance of ppb was reduced when oxygen was supplied as shown in figure 3 the relative abundance of ppb at the end of the batches generally dominated by allochromatium blastochloris and xanthobacteraceae ranged between 36 54 in the control reactors and the experiment at 0 mg do l 1 while the abundance was reduced to 22 in the experiment at 0 0 5 mg do l 1 and down to 3 3 in the experiment at 0 4 5 mg do l 1 similarly the abundances of anaerobic bacteria mainly belonging to bacteroidales or sphingobacteriales were also reduced instead the relative abundances of other non phototrophic aerobic organisms e g pseudomonadales chlamydiales or aerobic eukaryota increased indicating a strong competition and selective advantages for common aerobic heterotrophs under the tested conditions the high proportions of eukaryotes mainly aerobic protozoa such as intramacronucleata suggests that predation occurred under aerobic conditions which explains the low biomass yields found in the aerated reactors particularly significant in the experiment at 0 4 5 mg do l 1 due to the longer duration of the test the long duration of the batch tests limited the bioavailable cod particularly in the aerated experiments due to the faster cod uptake rates which resulted in decay and predation by aerobic grazers considering that the performances of the 0 0 25 and 0 0 5 mg do l 1 experiments were very similar see figures 1 and 2 only one sample was selected for microbial analysis regarding the oxidation reduction potential orp in the reactors the predominance of oxidative conditions can be confirmed by the measured do concentrations within common cod ranges in activated sludge plants treating wastewater such as those used in this study do concentrations of 0 1 0 mg do l 1 result in orps of 100 250 mv and do values over 1 0 mg do l 1 in orps of 250 370 mv which correspond to reducing conditions with orps well above the point at which crtj is oxidised madigan et al 2011 li and bishop 2001 in addition the presence of aerobic heterotrophs also evidences oxidative environments as they require positive orps to grow jay et al 2005 as mentioned above these oxidative conditions consequence of the continuous oxygen supply are responsible for the repression of photosynthetic gene expression 3 2 batch experiments evaluating the kinetics of ppb aerobic growth a dedicated batch experiment was carried out to evaluate the kinetics of ppb growth under aerobic conditions the resulting kinetic parameters corresponding to a monod kinetic function for substrate uptake see figure s3 were a maximum specific uptake rate kaer of 4 66 g cod g cod 1 d 1 and a half saturation constant ks aer of 0 4 mg cod l 1 at 32 36 c the measured biomass yield was 0 51 g cod g cod 1 resulting in a growth rate of 2 38 d 1 this assumes that glucose was mostly consumed for biomass growth as nutrients were not limiting and there was no excess of reducing power thus avoiding the accumulation of storage compounds such as polyhydroxyalkanoates or glycogen this value is lower than the typical growth rates reported for heterotrophic biomass maximum specific growth rate of 6 0 d 1 20 c henze et al 1987 which further explains why ppb were outcompeted by aerobes the faster removal kinetics in the aerated batch experiments see table 1 are in agreement with the obtained results recent yields and growth rates determined for pure ppb cultures i e rhodopseudomonas palustris rhodospirillum rubrum rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodobacter capsulatus on several organic substrates i e fructose succinate or acetic acid also agree with the obtained results with biomass yields of 0 50 0 76 g cod g cod 1 and growth rates of 2 4 3 9 d 1 at 28 c alloul et al 2021 3 3 flat plate batch tests effect of constant air supply on photoheterotrophic growth to determine the lowest oxygen supply that still allows photoheterotrophy and to confirm the results from the batch tests on another wastewater and also to obtain results free of grazers six batch cycles were carried out in a flat plate photobioreactor figure 4 due to the do sensor sensitivity of 0 2 mg do l 1 we decided to control the air flow rather than the do the average results from cycles 1 4 without air supply 0 ml min 1 show that an anaerobic operation baseline was achieved with removal efficiencies of 56 66 28 51 and 25 35 for scod soluble tkn and soluble p respectively as in the previous section photoheterotrophic growth could be confirmed via tcod conservation balances closed to 10 and by the presence of the characteristic carotenoid and bchl a absorption peaks at the end of the cycles figure 5 a note that the absorption peaks form the literature correspond to extracts which is why the correspoding peaks in our experiments do not match perfectly when oxygen was supplied at an air flow rate of 100 ml min 1 cycle 5 a similar situation to the one reported in the aerated batch reactors was observed specifically compared to the 0 4 5 mg do l 1 test a tcod loss of 48 confirmed cod consumption for atp synthesis respiration was confirmed by the do measurements figure 5b showing that a steep do decrease occurred during the first 10 h of the cycle period of the most significant cod consumption the colour loss figure s8 and the absence of absorbance peaks at the end of the cycle for both carotenoids and bchl a figure 5a also suggests that chemoheterotrophic growth by ppb heterotrophs or both was dominant it is important to note that very small bchl peaks are still observable figure 5a which might point to the presence of small amounts of pigments inside or outside the cells a similar behaviour was observed at an air flow rate of 10 ml min 1 cycle 6 which resulted in non detectable do concentrations 0 mg l 1 during the whole experimental period observing just a slight increase at the end interestingly even at effectively 0 mg do l 1 in the reactor pigmentation loss was still observed no absorbance peaks see figure 5b figure s8 the loss of photoheterotrophy and the predominance of chemoheterotrophy was again underlined by tcod losses of 44 these results suggest that even undetectable amounts of oxygen in several publications referred to as micro aerobic conditions can lead to oxidative conditions which in turn result in inhibition of pigment synthesis and eventually in colour loss in ppb enriched cultures the evolution of the cod and do concentrations and the ph during cycle 6 10 ml min 1 is shown in figure s9 analysis of the microbial communities confirmed the reduction in ppb abundance when oxygen was supplied figure 6 while the initial ppb abundance 48 dominated by blastochloris sp rhodobacter sp and rhodopseudomonas sp was maintained in the anaerobic baseline tests cycles 1 4 this was reduced to 33 34 in the aerated experiments in contrast to the previous batch results figure 3 in these experiments grazers were not found and therefore the ppb decrease can simply be attributed to the growth of aerobic microbes in fact while the presence of aerobes initially and during the anaerobic baseline was negligible 0 2 0 4 heterotrophs such as simkaniaceae planctomicrobium flavobacterium or caulobacter accounted for 14 28 of the total 16s copies at the end of the aerated experiments these results suggest that in long term experiments the slower aerobic kinetics of ppb compared to common heterotrophs will result in ppb outcompetition nevertheless the colour loss cannot be explained by ppb outcompetition as ppb were still present in considerable proportions at the end of the aerated cycles 33 34 therefore suppression of pigments synthesis and pigment oxidation occurred due to the presence of oxygen and the resulting oxidative conditions as previously confirmed by the growth of aerobes without a proportional loss of the ppb community we note that the slightly higher tkn and tp removal efficiencies in the aerated experiment are a consequence of an enhanced hydrolysis of the complex organic matter present in the wastewater e g vs particulate cod and tkn see table s1 under aerobic conditions nevertheless the removal ratios were still higher in the anaerobic experiment e g cod p removal ratios of 100 1 6 1 9 and 100 0 5 0 9 for anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively confirming the results obtained in the previous batch experiments the complex nature of the poultry wastewater is also the reason why the removal efficiencies presented in figure 4 are expressed as tkn and tp rather than nh4 n and po4 3 p which are constantly mobilised from particulate tkn and tp 3 4 overall impact of do on the behavior of ppb enriched systems the obtained results show that photoheterotrophic growth in ppb enriched systems is inhibited under the oxidative conditions resulting from the presence of oxygen in any of the tested conditions oxygen supply resulted in oxidative conditions and a consequent colour pigments loss this led to a metabolic switch from photoheterotrophy to aerobic chemoheterotrophy either with or without preservation of the ppb community depending on the do level but always with lower ppb abundance levels after aeration this resulted in wastewater treatment parameters in terms of removal efficiencies cod n p ratios and biomass yields similar to those achieved in common aerobic technologies rather than anaerobic phototrophic systems the pigmentation loss likely occurred due to repression of the genes involved in pigment production and the consequent ppb outcompetition pemberton et al 1998 yurkov and hughes 2017 the results also suggest that this occurs independently from the wastewater source we argue that even a pure ppb culture in a sterile media would behave as described above but the colour loss would simply take more time as indicated by the high abundances of ppb in the control reactors shown in section 3 1 this is simply explained by the dilution of the initial pigment concentration within the cells as aerobic grow occurs without further pigment production ppb enrichments cultivated anaerobically 80 ppb relative abundance and aerated after growth without external carbon or nutrients supply kept colour for 5 7 days figure s10 this reinforces the role of cell death division in the loss of coloration suggesting also that ppb can conserve pigments inside their cells under aerobic conditions for considerable periods of time provided that carbon sources allowing aerobic growth either of ppb or others are not present in the media the loss of photoheterotrophy resulted in the loss of the main competitive advantage of ppb therefore they were slowly outcompeted by aerobic organisms when oxygen was supplied which is underlined by the decreased ppb relative abundance at the end of the aerated experiments the aerobic growth rates for ppb estimated as 2 4 d 1 in our experiment at 32 36 c figure s3 are lower than the growth rates of common aerobic chemoheterotrophs 6 d 1 at 20 c henze et al 1987 which explains the observed outcompetition colour loss and ppb outcompetition under aerobic conditions were previously observed in an anaerobic enriched ppb reactor where accidental oxygen leaks in the compressor resulted in overgrow of ppb by aerobes mainly thalassospira hülsen et al 2019 izu et al 2001 observed a similar phenomenon and attributed the outcompetition of ppb to the lower growth kinetics of ppb compared to aerobes despite their reduced competitiveness the capability of ppb to grow aerobically via respiration gives them some resilience even if photoheterotrophic growth is suppressed at lower do concentrations 0 0 5 mg do l 1 ppb were still present at the end of the tests underlining a degree of resilience at these do levels ppb likely switched to chemoheterotrophy and this ability even if at lower rates compared with common aerobic heterotrophs allowed them to survive in the system therefore it is logical to assume that ppb contributed actively to the aerobic cod removal in the presented experiments although to what extent is difficult to assess quantitatively without competition especially of fast growing aerobes ppb might very well survive and even thrive under aerobic conditions however the data suggest a struggle of ppb in an aerobic system and certainly a loss of photoheterotrophic capability due to pigment loss looking at the differences in rates between ppb and common aerobes ppb might be washed out after 3 4 serial dilutions 7 days this explains the low ppb abundances in conventional activated sludge cas systems siefert et al 1978 zhang et al 2003 in reality ppb will be outcompeted in a short period of time by faster growing aerobic heterotrophs in any aerobic non axenic process overall the results clearly show that oxygen and the resulting oxidative conditions suppressed photoheterotrophic growth of ppb while the wastewater treatment behaviour resembled aerobic systems e g tcod removal efficiencies of 45 57 apparent biomass yields of 0 15 0 31 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 and scod n p removal ratios of 100 4 5 5 0 0 4 0 8 rather than anaerobic phototrophic systems e g no tcod removal biomass yields of 1 g codbiomass g codremoved 1 removal ratios of 100 6 7 12 0 9 1 2 slower removal kinetics and higher nutrient removal efficiencies mainly due to the establishment of typical aerobic heterotrophs which resulted in lower abundances of ppb at the end of the tests these findings contradict several recent publications using a pure culture of rhodopseudomonas and artificial wastewater meng et al 2017 obtained similar biomass yields at different do levels up to 8 mg do l 1 also reporting that do levels above 1 mg do l 1 could even increase the carotenoid bchl contents when compared to anaerobic conditions no colour loss was observed at do levels of 0 2 0 5 mg do l 1 during the treatment of artificial brewery wastewater with a mixture of pure ppb cultures ectothiorhodospira rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodopseudomonas capsulate reporting average carotenoid and bchl contents of 2 53 and 10 8 mg g vs 1 lu et al 2019a pigments were also found when treating synthetic wastewater using an isolated ppb mixture with ectothiorhodospira as predominant genus at a do of 2 4 mg do l 1 with contents of 3 3 and 1 4 mg g vs 1 for carotenoids and bchl respectively zhi et al 2020 yang et al 2018a reported 6 5 mg g vs 1 of carotenoids in psb grown under dark aerobic conditions no light supply and over 2 mg do l 1 these findings are in direct contradiction with our results a possible reason could be that in all the studies claiming a positive high do effect ppb could not be outcompeted as pure cultures and sterile media were mostly used nevertheless this explanation cannot justify the high pigment contents or even increases compared with anaerobic tests at high do levels and surely under oxidative environments as most of these experiments were carried out in short batch tests selection of do tolerant ppb species cannot explain this observation by itself either 3 5 implications for industrial application this study shows that anaerobic conditions are required for effective ppb selection at aerobic micro aerobic conditions and the resulting oxidative environments ppb cannot grow photoheterotrophically and are therefore outcompeted by aerobic organisms as their main competitive advantage is lost this limits the application of ppb based processes for nutrient recovery to systems with low oxygen contents and reductive conditions excluding systems where one may wish to generate ppb in a sidestream from an aerobic system e g sidestream generation from aquaculture though oxygen scavengers could be added to alleviate this nevertheless the aerobic capabilities of ppb allow them to grow in the presence of oxygen at lower rates compared to aerobic heterotrophs therefore longer term aeration is required to fully outcompete ppb this opens the door for the application of combined systems a combination of aerobic anaerobic intervals could be applied in outdoor systems illuminated by sunlight meng et al 2018 reported this approach in the material and methods but the results and discussion did not present any data about the actual effects on the performance and microbial competition recently alloul et al 2021 proposed a hybrid 2 stage system where ppb were enriched photoheterotrophically in the 1st stage and aerobic heterotrophs were aerobically co cultivated with the produced ppb in the 2nd stage via this approach the authors reported an improved nutritional quality of the biomass with higher protein contents and a more attractive amino acid profile when compared to single aerobic biomass production in agreement with our study they observed that the proportion of ppb decreased to 10 pnsb after aerobic co cultivation with aerobic heterotrophic bacteria from over 90 pnsb in the 1st stage open ponds with limited passive oxygen diffusion will also be affected by the growth of aerobes but again the aerobic capabilities of ppb will allow them to grow and if the concentration of organic matter is high enough to allow oxygen depletion ppb will be able to consume the remaining cod photoheterotrophically provided that the oxygen is supplied in amounts low enough to avoid oxidative conditions at the given cod concentrations we believe that a potential combined process could be based on i resource recovery with high biomass yields and cod n p ratios being efficiently provided under anaerobic conditions during daytime photoheterotrophy and ii limited air supply during night hours to provide aerobic wastewater treatment but with reduced biomass yields and cod n p uptake ratios due to chemoheterotrophic growth this would likely increase the cod removal efficiencies while reducing the n and p removal efficiencies at night overall the volumetric capacity of a ppb mediated system would be increased potentially more than doubled when compared to daytime photoheterotrophy only this would have effects on the overall size and volume of the photobioreactor thus reducing the capital costs while slightly increasing the operational costs due to aeration the effects on the microbial community might be either substantially increased ppb proportions or ppb loss with more non phototrophic facultative microbes higher ppb proportions might occur due to the selective growth during the day where the abundance of ppb would be relatively high just before darkness this means that ppb could still consume a significant fraction of the supplied oxygen albeit at lower growth rates while facultative organisms would consume relatively less due to the lack of oxygen during the day meaning that they would grow but to a lesser extent compared with ppb over time this might result in ppb dominance of some specialised genera however this will depend entirely on the adaptation of the facultative microbes their slower growth during daytime and the aerobic capabilities of ppb must be able to cope with the faster growth of facultative aerobes at night aerobic grazers would be supressed in such a system due to intermittent low do conditions instead we expect higher volumetric loading rates and productivities at reduced hrts for a combined aerobic anaerobic day night interval system this provides enhanced capability against a pure solar phototrophic system which can only be fed during the day when solar radiation is provided here we propose a solution to this major problem but more research is required to determine whether this approach is feasible long term interval studies on real wastewater ideally outdoors should be carried out this should include the effects of temperature variations during day and night as this will substantially affect the kinetics of the different microbial clades involved which might lead to microbial shifts 4 conclusions at any of the do concentrations 0 5 4 5 mg do l 1 and air flow rates tested 10 and 100 ml min 1 oxygen supply led to inhibition of pigment production and colour loss which suppressed the photoheterotrophic capabilities of ppb this resulted in wastewater treatment parameters similar to those of aerobic reactors rather than anaerobic phototrophic systems i e considerable tcod decrease 45 57 vs 10 lower cod n p ratios 100 4 5 5 0 4 0 8 vs 100 6 7 12 0 9 1 2 and lower biomass yields 0 15 0 31 vs 0 8 1 2 g cod g codremoved 1 analyses of the microbial communities showed that the proportions of ppb decreased in the aerated experiments while the abundances of aerobic heterotrophs increased this suggests that ppb were outcompeted in these short tests and will eventually disappear from a real treatment setup in a matter of days depending of the retention times this was confirmed by the lower aerobic ppb growth rates 2 4 d 1 at 32 36 c when compared to common growth

oxyhydroxide and oxides e g ferrihydrite hematite fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 goethite α feooh and lepidocrocite γ feooh have particularly unique strong and large capacities to accumulate as from water via

et al 2004 jia et al 2006 giménez et al 2007 sylvester et al 2007 jönsson and sherman 2008 müller et al 2010 this sets a basis for fe minerals based as removal water treatment processes including coagulation with fe iii salts and co removal with source drinking water fe u s epa 2000 given the strong affinity of fe oxyhydroxide and oxides to accumulate as it is likely that any as entering the drinking water distribution system would accumulate onto old fe pipe scale fe rich deposits released from the pipe scale fe complexes that were carried over into the distribution system from the source water or treatment plant and fe minerals deposited on premise plumbing approximately 28 of u s water main pipelines are comprised of aged cast fe pipe and up to 0 8 water main and premise plumbing materials are aged galvanized fe pipe folkman 2018 the corrosion by product scale in these pipes has a multi layer structure that is dominated by both ferrous fe ii and fe iii minerals such as fe3o4 α feooh γ feooh feco3 and ferrihydrite herro and port 1993 sarin et al 2004a and represents a potential as sink and source for some drinking water systems a few studies have shown that corrosion by product scale from water mains cast fe pipe and other deposits on distribution system pipes contain levels of as ranging from 10 13 650 µg as g solid almost all of which were closely associated with high fe content lytle et al 2004 copeland et al 2007 lytle et al 2010 triantafyllidou et al 2019 these as bound fe solids could release significant amounts of as into drinking water in dissolved and or particulate form causing both red water and potential health concerns following physical e g flushing and chemical disturbances e g water treatment changes reiber and dostal 2000 lytle et al 2004 friedman et al 2010 2016 triantafyllidou et al 2019 orthophosphate po4 has been a common drinking water corrosion inhibitor a 2001 survey indicated that up to 20 of the 264 responded utilities in the u s used po4 as corrosion control treatment mcneill and edwards 2002 po4 addition is commonly used to minimize total lead and copper levels in drinking water schock and clement 1998 which are often applied at two orders of magnitude greater in concentration than total as present in the water many researchers have reported the competitive adsorption between po4 and arsenate or as v as they have similar deprotonation constants in solution and share similar mechanisms and kinetics with fe oxyhydroxide and oxides puccia et al 2009 carabante et al 2010 giles et al 2011 the capacity of fe oxyhydroxide and oxides to accumulate as v and the release rate of as v with the presence of po4 are impacted by the water ph order of anion addition as v po4 molar ratio fe surface minerals and other factors copeland et al 2007 zeng et al 2008a mamindy pajany et al 2011 wang and giammar 2015 han and ro 2018 triantafyllidou et al 2019 for instance the accumulation capacity of both as v and po4 decreased with increasing water ph and was usually high at water ph of 8 0 liu et al 2001 zeng et al 2008a additionally when equal molar quantities of po4 and as v were added to the solution the presence of po4 inhibited the as v accumulation and was able to release as v from goethite ferrihydrite and synthesized fe oxides to a limited capacity at different water ph and vice versa liu et al 2001 puccia et al 2009 neupane et al 2014 tiberg et al 2020 when equal molar amount of po4 was added to water after addition of as v less as v was released by po4 than the released po4 by as v when equal molar amount of as v was added after addition of po4 liu et al 2001 neupane et al 2014 it is speculated that addition of po4 could cause undetected and temporary elevated levels of as at the consumer s tap for water systems that have as in the drinking pipe scale and the duration of the concern remains unknown this study was the first to examine the long term 7 5 years behaviors of as in drinking water when flowing through corroding fe pipe and explore how changes in po4 corrosion control treatment would influence the as mobility specifically the objectives of this work were to 1 understand the capacity of an old approximately 100 years corroded cast fe pipe section removed from the local distribution system to accumulate as from drinking water and 2 monitor how changes in as levels po4 levels and the initial as po4 molar ratio in the bulk drinking water impact the release of as from the same fe pipe section the outcomes of this study will give important new insights into the potential impact of po4 addition on as mobility and transport for water utilities who encounter as issues and have fe pipelines in service this information would also help facilitate proactive measures to prevent high as levels in tap water 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus experiments were performed over 7 5 years 2751 days with a conditioned 100 year old cast fe pipe section removed from the city of cincinnati ohio s distribution system and an in line water recirculation set up fig 1 the inner surface was not characterized as detailed characterization could cause disturbance and potentially destruction of pipe scale thus visual observation was conducted and showed the cast fe pipe section contained about 1 3 cm thick corrosion related tuberculation and the inner wall had heterogenous layers of red and black color corrosion by products the experimental apparatus had a 10 liter acrylic reservoir full of prepared test water connected to a 5 25 long 13 3 cm cast fe pipe section 5 or 12 7 cm outside diameter 4 75 or 12 1 cm inside diameter approximate volume 0 95 liter the pipe was set vertically and each end of the pipe section was fitted with two airtight clear acrylic plexi glass plates that were bolted to rings this was to support the pipe and to prevent air from contacting the inner pipe scale during the experiments the cast fe pipe scale remained intact and undisturbed by external forces or movement and was constantly in contact with test water the test water was pumped by an ac 3cp md march magnetic drive polypropylene pump with 1 15 hp 115v air cooled motor us plastic corp with a constant flow of 50 ml min or 0 71 cm min as indicated by a flow meter gilmont gf 1360 the flow was not reflective of the water distribution hydraulics and was selected based on our laboratory capacity the test water temperature was controlled at 22 9 1 6 c by submerging a section of circulation tubing in a water chiller to counter temperature increase associated with pumping the 10 liter reservoir was connected to a dual titrator system schott titronic universal model with a sensor interface sensolab ph controller jensen systems and multi t 2 2 software program jensen systems for a continuous ph adjustment to offset ph changes associated with corrosion and other chemical reactions the water ph was adjusted with 0 6 n hydrochloric acid and 0 6 n sodium hydroxide connecting tubing i e tygon teflon and valves i e pvc were plastic materials and their lengths were detailed in fig 1 the total volume of the connecting plastic materials was 0 32 liter an identical control test apparatus was constructed without the cast fe pipe section as a control to quantify non fe associated as sorption losses 2 2 synthetic drinking water chemistry arsenic v is assumed to be the most likely oxidation state in treated and disinfected drinking water and far more to accumulate in drinking water distribution systems lytle et al 2004 five water conditions a e were alternated during experimental operation by varying the initial target as v or as later and target po4 levels in the simulated drinking water sdw the as and po4 levels were reported as µg l as as and mg l as po4 throughout the study respectively conditions a e represented sdw 75 µg l as sdw 180 µg l as sdw 75 µg l as 3 mg l po4 sdw and sdw 3 mg l po4 respectively the actual initial as and po4 levels were reported in the results section the chosen elevated as levels relative to the regulation standards 10 µg l in this study represented observed high levels reported in a specific water utility from personal exchanges the chosen po4 concentration represented a commonly applied corrosion control level mcneill and edwards 2002 the sdw representing condition d had a ph of 7 6 and contained 25 mg l dissolved inorganic carbon as c 20 mg l chloride 10 mg l sulfate and 1 mg l free chlorine residual as cl2 this water chemistry reflected the water quality of the local cincinnati water utility where the cast fe pipe section was harvested the control test apparatus was operated under condition d for 6 days followed by condition a for 164 days back to condition d for another 58 days and lastly condition e for 25 days the experimental apparatus was exposed to 10 consecutive water events with the five water conditions the rationale for these 10 conducted water conditions was listed in table 1 briefly water events 1 3 examined the capacity of as accumulation into the harvested corroding fe pipe scale at elevated initial as levels 75 180 µg l event 4 examined the as mobility in water and scale after addition of po4 with existing as concerns events 5 8 examined as mobility in water and scale after stopping po4 addition with different initial as levels event 9 examined the as release from corroding fe pipe scale with previous as concerns and po4 addition and event 10 examined the as release with previous as concerns and no po4 addition the water in the 10 liter reservoir for both apparatuses was replaced with freshly prepared test water every monday wednesday and friday water samples in the reservoir were drawn by syringe from the center of the 10 liter reservoir after mixing manually for elemental e g as fe p s on site water temperature ph cl2 and other wet chemistry e g alkalinity chloride analyses the total as was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms thermo elemental model 6500 duo franklin ma per epa method 200 8 u s epa 1994 and the detection limit was 0 00035 mg l other elements including total fe total p and total s were analyzed on inductively coupled atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes per epa method 200 7 u s epa 1994 due to instrumental or laboratory maintenance the icp ms was occasionally unavailable for use therefore the icp aes was also sometimes used for total as analysis the icp aes detection limit for as fe p and s was 0 004 mg l 0 001 mg l 0 005 mg l and 0 003 mg l respectively other analytical details are included in supporting information si 1 the water samples were collected daily during monday through friday therefore samples collected on tuesday and thursday were after 24 hours of recirculation samples on wednesday and friday were after 48 hours of recirculation and samples on monday were after 72 hours of recirculation 2 3 solids analysis as the pipe section later was used in a different research capacity two solid samples were carefully scraped off from the interior scale at the end of the 7 5 year experiment for as fe and p composition analyses such that there was minimal disturbance to interior pipe scale the two solid samples were prepared and digested per epa sw846 method 3051a u s epa 2007 briefly the two solids were first acidified with 18 v v nitric acid trace metal grade 67 70 hno3 and 5 v v hydrochloric acid trace metal grade 34 37 hcl and then digested in a microwave cem mars 6 model for 10 mins before analysis on icp aes 2 4 statistical analysis all statistics were conducted in the sigmaplot 14 0 notebook an alpha value α of 0 05 was selected to determine the statistical significance dalgaard 2008 the normality of the data was determined using shapiro wilk test for parametric or normally distributed data shapiro wilk test p 0 05 t test or one way anova was used to compare the mean as fe and po4 concentrations among different water conditions for non parametric or non normally distributed data shapiro wilk test p 0 05 rank tests including dunn s kruskal wallis multiple comparison analyses and spearman s rank correlation were used to compare the ranking or the median of total as total fe and total po4 along with the associations between different parameters regression analysis was used to examine the kinetics of as accumulation the data below detection limit were represented by half of the detection limit values for figures and data analyses 3 results the control apparatus was conditioned with the sdw condition d for the first 6 days in which as fe and po4 were undetectable figure s1 the apparatus was then exposed to condition a water containing an average initial total as of 83 8 2 µg l for 164 days arsenic levels remaining in the water after 24 hour or longer recirculation were not statistically different from the initial total as kruskal wallis test p 0 19 during days of 170 228 with condition d and days of 233 253 with condition e containing initial 2 8 0 3 mg l po4 the total as released into water remained undetectable additionally the changes in total fe and po4 levels in water were also negligible throughout the control study therefore the changes in as fe and po4 levels in water due to the components of the control apparatus e g tubing plexiglass reservoir pump deemed trivial and could be neglected for the experimental apparatus the total as total po4 and total fe levels remaining in water results were presented as below along with the important water quality parameters the accumulation or release rate of as kas and po4 kpo4 was calculated and the interactions between as fe and po4 were also investigated 3 1 depletion of water oxidants due to iron corrosion important water quality parameters including water ph dissolved oxygen free chlorine and total chlorine were measured table 2 the average initial ph of freshly prepared water ranged from 7 1 7 6 the average final ph after 24 hour or longer recirculation ranged from 7 5 7 6 figure s2 additionally the average initial and final dissolved oxygen levels ranged between 7 6 8 9 mg l and 6 7 7 9 mg l reflecting a 0 4 1 5 mg l depletion during different recirculation time figure s3 the depletion of initially added 1 mg l cl2 was also observed as indicated by lower average free and total chlorine residual at 0 1 0 34 mg l and 0 13 0 41 mg l respectively figure s4 the depletion of water oxidants such as dissolved oxygen and chlorine was expected as a result of interactions with corroding fe and ferrous fe during water recirculation mcneill and edwards 2001 sarin et al 2004b no correlation was identified between the changes in water quality and changes in water treatment among events 3 2 accumulation and release of arsenic as a function of initial arsenic and orthophosphate concentrations as the water events were conducted in a chronological order the results in this section were presented in the same order events 1 3 tested the accumulation capacity for as by the cast fe pipe section the cast fe pipe section was first exposed to condition a containing an average initial as concentration of 78 12 µg l from days 0 226 event 1 table 3 figs 2 3 average as levels significantly decreased from initial levels to 60 11 µg l 53 26 µg l and further to 43 13 µg l after 24 48 and 72 hours of recirculation respectively kruskal wallis test p 0 001 table s1 this gradual decrease in as levels with recirculation time reflected increasing accumulation of as to fe corrosion by products on the pipe or in the experimental system specifically there was total accumulated as mass mas of 25 4 mg with an average accumulation rate kas of 0 11 mg as day during this event table 3 fig 4 the average po4 level in water increased from 0 034 0 13 mg l up to 0 095 0 22 mg l after 24 hour or longer recirculation time figs 2 5 the total released po4 mass mpo4 was 50 1 mg resulting in an average release rate kpo4 of 0 22 mg day negative designation refers to a po4 release table 3 the po4 source was the harvested cast fe pipe scale which likely accumulated po4 over time from cincinnati drinking water po4 is naturally present at low levels in the source water or from the addition of sodium hexametaphosphate used to prevent post precipitation in the distribution system while in service city of cincinnati 2020 there was a significant positive correlation between total fe and total po4 spearman s rho 0 36 p 0 001 suggesting that phosphate containing fe minerals in fe pipe scale were sometimes dislodged it is worth noting that the interior surfaces of the non cast fe pipe components in the experimental apparatus were gradually coated with fe corrosion by product deposits visually in the early stage of the study therefore both the cast fe pipe section and the mobilized fe minerals deposited on the other interior surfaces contributed to the accumulation and release of as fe and po4 throughout the study from here on we refer to both sources as the cast fe pipe section surface minerals in that the mobilized fe deposits also originated from the initial cast fe pipe section during days 226 275 condition b contained an average initial as of 183 4 6 µg l event 2 table 3 the initial average as level was significantly reduced down to an average of 107 18 µg l after 24 hour or longer stagnation kruskal wallis test p 0 002 with kas at 0 25 mg day table s1 figs 2 4 the increase in the kas 0 25 0 11 2 3 was proportional to the increase in the initial average as concentration 183 78 2 3 a very small increase in average po4 levels during recirculation resulted in kpo4 at 0 034 mg day with a weaker association between total fe and total po4 relative to event 1 spearman s rho 0 20 p 0 26 figs 2 5 condition a resumed event 3 between days 275 1122 similar to events 1 and 2 the average initial as level of 84 26 µg l significantly decreased down to 50 15 µg l after 24 hours or longer recirculation time kruskal wallis test p 0 018 resulting in kas of 0 11 mg day tables 3 s1 figs 2 4 the results again showed that the change in the kas 0 11 0 25 0 44 was proportional to the change in the initial average as concentration 84 183 0 46 even after 3 1 years of exposure to water with high as the accumulation capability of the fe scale did not diminish and still showed a relatively large accumulation and uptake capacity in contrast sporadic high po4 in water levels of up to 1 5 mg l were observed with kpo4 at 0 044 mg l figs 2 5 and total po4 levels had even weaker association with total fe relative to event 2 spearman s rho 0 16 p 0 001 between days 1122 1155 condition c contained an average initial as and po4 of 80 3 0 µg l and 3 3 0 08 mg l respectively event 4 this condition was to explore the as mobility in water and fe pipe scale when the water systems had po4 corrosion control treatment the simultaneous presence of as 1 1 µm and 30 times higher po4 34 µm i e molar ratio as po4 0 031 in water facilitated the release of as from the fe scale the total as remaining in water levels were significantly increased up to 130 37 µg l kruskal wallis test p 0 001 with kas at 0 20 mg day negative designation refers to an as release leading to 5 0 6 7 mg 134 mg of the total pre sorbed as in events 1 3 releasing back into water tables 3 s1 figs 2 4 this implied that spikes of as might occur when initiating po4 corrosion control treatment in water systems that contain as in the fe pipe scale while as was released from the scale the po4 was taken up by the scale with kpo4 at 3 5 mg day table 3 figs 4 5 during the same time no increase in fe release was observed indicating that desorption was the most likely as release mechanism fig 2 the desorption of as and uptake of po4 demonstrated the competitive adsorption between as and po4 which was also shown by a negative correlation between total as and total po4 in water during 24 hour or longer recirculation periods spearman s rho 0 63 p 0 001 between days 1155 1542 condition a was resumed to look into the as mobility in water and fe pipe scale after stopping po4 corrosion control treatment event 5 the average initial as level of 79 16 µg l in water significantly decreased down to 56 13 µg l with kas at 0 084 mg day kruskal wallis test p 0 001 tables 3 s1 and the average initial po4 of 0 010 0 020 mg l increased up to 0 060 0 091 mg l with kpo4 at 0 17 mg day during 24 hour or longer recirculation figs 2 5 the kas of event 5 0 084 mg day was slightly smaller relative to event 1 and event 3 0 11 mg day when the same condition a was tested table 3 although some of po4 that was previously incorporated in scale in event 4 was released a portion of the po4 sorbed sites in the fe scale during event 4 remained occupied and were likely unavailable for further uptake of as meanwhile a 48 hour sampling effort during event 5 was conducted to study kinetics of as accumulation by tracking changes in the as and po4 levels in water fig 6 a the initial as was 69 µg l and 0 42 was adsorbed to the cast fe pipe scale surfaces after half an hour of recirculation with 12 after 5 hours peak at 24 after 35 hours and 20 after 48 hours meanwhile the po4 levels in water were up to 0 029 mg l fig 6b showing that part of the po4 pre sorbed to the fe scale was released by the sequentially added as in water from days 1542 1673 the sdw condition d was run representing a scenario where the water system had historical as containing fe scale and did not use po4 as corrosion control treatment event 6 unsurprisingly the accumulated as in the fe pipe scale from events 1 5 was mobilized and released into water the average as levels were 9 9 11 µg l after 24 hour or longer recirculation leading to kas at 0 038 mg day tables 3 s1 figs 2 4 the pre adsorbed or deposited as in fe scale released elevated as levels into water relative to the epa regulation standard 10 µg l as a reference which would raise health concerns in such water systems as indicated in previous studies lytle et al 2010 triantafyllidou et al 2019 meanwhile the po4 levels were constantly below detectable levels 0 015 mg l indicating no further release of po4 from the scale table 3 figs 2 5 from days 1673 1919 condition a was resumed aiming at examining the continuing accumulation capacity of as in water event 7 table 3 in keeping with events 1 3 and 5 the average initial as level of 77 19 µg l was significantly reduced down to 49 15 µg l kruskal wallis test p 0 001 and the average initial po4 of 0 012 0 026 mg l increased up to 0 068 0 39 mg l after 24 hour or longer recirculation table s1 figs 2 3 5 while no po4 was released from the scale in event 6 the as addition in event 7 promoted release of po4 from scale table 3 fig 4 the kas of 0 11 mg day was higher than that 0 084 mg day in event 5 table 3 fig 4 it was likely that the release of as during event 6 might have yielded more available as uptake sites for event 7 from days 1919 2300 condition d was resumed to examine the as mobility in the scale event 8 with no added as and no added po4 average as levels of 6 6 7 2 µg l were released into water during 24 hour or longer recirculation table 3 figs 2 4 though the as levels were significantly reduced relative to event 6 when the same condition d was tested kruskal wallis test p 0 001 the as release for different recirculation times was mostly above 5 µg l which is the regulation standard for new jersey and new hampshire njdep 2004 nhdes 2018 the elevated levels of as in water could still raise public health concerns even with long exposure 1 year to the sdw between days 2300 2361 condition e with no added as and 3 2 0 90 mg l po4 was tested to examine the mobility of as pre existed in fe pipe scale while po4 corrosion control was applied event 9 elevated average levels of as at 15 24 µg l were released into water while 3 0 mg day po4 was incorporated in the scale during 24 hour or longer recirculation table 3 figs 2 4 this led to 3 3 times more released as at 0 080 mg as day compared to that 0 024 mg day for event 8 between days 2361 2751 when condition d was resumed the average as levels in water were reduced to 2 2 2 4 µg l during recirculation which reached below regulation levels and led to kas of 0 0047 mg day table 3 this rate was 2 8 3 3 times smaller compared to that during event 8 with condition d the alternation between condition d and condition e showed that for water systems with as containing fe pipe scale addition of po4 corrosion control treatment might cause high as levels in water in the short term due to mobilization and release of as from the fe scale however the amount of released as in water would be reduced in the long term once reaching equilibrium with bulk water in water distribution systems 3 3 stable total iron levels in water during different recirculation periods the average initial total fe levels remaining in water for all water events were relatively low ranging from below detection limit 0 001 mg l to 0 053 mg l table 2 figs 2 s5 detectable levels of initial fe could have been associated with random fe rust particles that had settled at the bottom of the 10 liter container during initial sample collection average total fe levels after 24 hours of recirculation increased to a range of 0 022 0 22 mg l kruskal wallis test p 0 14 for event 1 p 0 004 for other events table s2 increasing recirculation time did not significantly change the total fe levels for 9 of the 10 water treatment events kruskal wallis test p 0 06 1 the exception was for event 3 in which the fe level after 72 hours of recirculation was significantly lower than that after 48 hours of recirculation kruskal wallis test p 0 021 therefore the initial as or po4 added to the sdw did not seem to influence the overall fe solubility and stability in scale 3 4 presence of arsenic and phosphorus in iron scale solids both as and p were detected in both fe scale solids samples the as p and fe in one solid was measured at 422 µg g 2 806 µg g and 399 306 µg g respectively while the as p and fe in the other solid was at 1 338 µg g 3 383 µg g and 294 167 µg g the detected as p and fe in these two solids was within the ranges reported by lytle et al 2004 as our preliminary solids analyses only validates the presence of as and p in scale more in depth scale characterization is needed for better understanding of mechanistic interactions between as po4 and different types of fe minerals 4 discussion 4 1 large arsenic uptake capacity for cast iron pipe surface later serving as a reservoir for arsenic release large as uptake capacity was observed for this cast fe pipe section throughout this study during this 7 5 year study the water that was recirculating the simulated water system with the 5 25 long cast fe pipe section was equivalent to water volume 198 m3 in a 10 8 mile or 17 4 km long pipe with 4 75 inside diameter even with some as release due to competition from po4 addition in events 4 and 9 162 mg as 27 of the total added 600 mg as were accumulated into the fe scale other factors such as water quality water redox water temperature water hydraulics and pipe scale characteristics e g roughness structure morphology might also come to play a role in influencing the uptake capacity of as by the fe scale surface minerals in practice zeng et al 2008b gallegos garcia et al 2012 but the over simplistic calculation based on this long term study still showed that the aged cast fe pipe scale and associated deposited fe solids were capable of uptaking high levels of as 75 180 µg l in distribution water at a considerably large capacity the aged fe scale therefore is expected to accumulate the trace as levels 10 µg l in the distributed water at a similar or even larger capacity many water systems contain many miles of old cast fe pipes and or galvanized fe pipes in service these old and long fe pipes provided much larger interior fe surface area and therefore more abundant uptake sites over their normal service life of 50 100 years it was shown that the as was accumulated onto fe oxyhydroxide and oxides dominantly via a strong and stable bidentate corner sharing complex fe o 2 as though the less favorable bidentate edge sharing complex fe o2 as and monodentate complex fe o as were also reported at water ph of 8 0 sherman and randall 2003 müller et al 2010 jain et al 1999 the strong force through this inner complexation assisted the adsorbed as in staying and concentrating in the scale and served as a reservoir for as release later on this phenomenon was shown in events 6 8 and 10 where no as or po4 was added to the simulated test water the accumulated as in the scale was released into water over a combined 2 5 years at levels ranging from below detection level 0 35 µg l up to 44 µg l this observation was also reported previously that up to 299 µg l as was detected in the tap water due to release of as from the fe pipe scale in drinking water distribution systems copeland et al 2007 lytle et al 2010 our study and previous studies demonstrated that once the as is accumulated into fe scale the release of as is a slow continuous and sporadic process which could be challenging to mitigate and address 4 2 rapid kinetics for arsenic accumulation the 48 hour kinetics study in event 5 showed that as accumulation was fast throughout the 48 hour sampling and the initial as in water levels of 69 µg l appeared to decrease linearly resulting in an accumulation rate k of 0 27 hr y 65 4 0 27x r2 0 80 p 0 001 fig 6a the results from this study were consistent with previous batch scale studies that the uptake of as by fe iii oxyhydroxide is rapid initially sometimes within five minutes depending on water quality fuller et al 1993 raven et al 1998 neupane et al 2014 previous studies also showed that the as accumulation kinetics are highly influenced by the diffusion of as from the bulk solutions to the pore space of fe mineral structures fuller et al 1993 dai et al 2016 for the monotonous water condition in event 5 the as in water levels and fe scale porosity morphology and structure might play an important role 4 3 impact of orthophosphate on arsenic mobility during events 4 and 9 small initial as po4 molar ratios 1 by simultaneous or sequential addition of po4 consistently caused the release of as that was accumulated in the fe scale while po4 was accumulated on the fe scale additionally the released as was lower than the accumulated po4 on a molar basis specifically during event 4 when as and po4 as po4 0 031 were simultaneously added 0 089 mmol of as was released from the scale 7 3 of the accumulated po4 1 213 mmol on a molar basis during event 9 when po4 as po4 0 0001 was sequentially added followed by previous events 0 065 mm as was released 3 4 of the total accumulated po4 1 90 mm the results in events 4 and 9 could be explained by various surface complexation models which showed that the as and po4 were adsorbed to two types of surface sites manning and goldberg 1996 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 liu et al 2001 hongshao and stanforth 2001 zeng et al 2008a the first type are the similar surface sites that as and po4 compete over the second type are the as and po4 specific sites as a result the added po4 only displaced a small fraction 7 1 of the total accumulated as in fe scale in addition throughout the study at least 54 of the added po4 accumulated in the fe scale and remained bound within the fe scale i e was not displaced by as or desorbed to achieve equilibrium with exposed water given the potential impact of po4 on as mobility from corroding fe pipes water utilities who have as concerns may consider carefully evaluating the application and optimization of po4 4 4 environmental implications and limitations the results from this study have important implications for understanding accumulation and release of as in municipal water systems when there is a change in po4 corrosion control treatment our study showed that the fe scale in drinking water systems serves as a reservoir to concentrate the trace levels of as from upstream of in and or even downstream of water distribution systems that contain fe based water pipes including cast fe galvanized fe and other fe pipes the accumulation of as can take place for a prolonged time in these fe based pipes in addition to as the fe scale was previously shown to concentrate other trace metals such as lead and manganese and these accumulated lead and manganese can later be released from the fe scale little et al 2017 similarly our work revealed that the concentrated as in the fe scale would later be released into drinking water causing elevated as in water levels a recent study indicated that the patterns of as release in drinking water distribution systems were complicated and unpredictable and were a function of water hydraulics pipe materials sampling procedures changes in water treatment and other factors triantafyllidou et al 2019 with our finding that po4 addition was followed by an immediate increase in as levels in water due to release of the pre accumulated as in fe scale water systems should consider taking precautions when introducing po4 into their water such as pipe scale analyses and targeted distribution water quality monitoring for as while this study gives insight into understanding the mobility of as from aged cast fe pipe scale from distribution systems limitations inherent in this study need to be addressed in future studies first the impact of individual as and po4 parameters was not examined individually using parallel experimental apparatus therefore the results observed in each event was a cumulative effect posed from previous events secondly though the plastic components used in the experimental apparatus did not show much interactions with as and po4 the released fe deposits from the cast fe pipe scale coated almost all the exposed plastic surfaces observed visually it was reasonable to say that the accumulation and release of as was attributed to the fe solids from the cast fe pipe scale however we could not distinguish the contribution between the cast fe pipe section and the fe solids that coated the plastic components thirdly in depth characterization of cast fe pipe scale should be considered in the future to elucidate the interactions between as po4 and fe minerals in the scale water interface with wider range of initial as po4 molar ratios 5 conclusion the corroding cast fe pipe section scale in this simulated drinking water system showed large accumulation capability 27 of total amount as in water over the course of 7 5 years under the given test water chemistry conditions the as accumulation was kinetically fast with an accumulation rate of 0 27 hr when water contained an initial as of 69 µg l following changes in initial as and po4 concentrations in water elevated as levels up to 44 µg l was released into water po4 addition did not influence the total fe release and fe scale stability however po4 addition released the pre accumulated as in water that decreased in the long term while po4 was incorporated onto the scale the addition of po4 only displaced a small fraction of total accumulated as in fe scale and most accumulated po4 remained tightly bound to certain fe scale sites due to the potential impact of po4 on as mobility proactive sampling monitoring and communication measures should be taken when water utilities that are having or might have as problems consider po4 corrosion control treatment credit

water following the changes in the initial as and po4 concentrations in water addition of 3 mg l po4 caused a rapid increase in as release from iron scale that gradually dropped off with time while

as at the consumer s tap for water systems that have as in the drinking pipe scale and the duration of the concern remains unknown this study was the first to examine the long term 7 5 years behaviors of as in drinking water when flowing through corroding fe pipe and explore how changes in po4 corrosion control treatment would influence the as mobility specifically the objectives of this work were to 1 understand the capacity of an old approximately 100 years corroded cast fe pipe section removed from the local distribution system to accumulate as from drinking water and 2 monitor how changes in as levels po4 levels and the initial as po4 molar ratio in the bulk drinking water impact the release of as from the same fe pipe section the outcomes of this study will give important new insights into the potential impact of po4 addition on as mobility and transport for water utilities who encounter as issues and have fe pipelines in service this information would also help facilitate proactive measures to prevent high as levels in tap water 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus experiments were performed over 7 5 years 2751 days with a conditioned 100 year old cast fe pipe section removed from the city of cincinnati ohio s distribution system and an in line water recirculation set up fig 1 the inner surface was not characterized as detailed characterization could cause disturbance and potentially destruction of pipe scale thus visual observation was conducted and showed the cast fe pipe section contained about 1 3 cm thick corrosion related tuberculation and the inner wall had heterogenous layers of red and black color corrosion by products the experimental apparatus had a 10 liter acrylic reservoir full of prepared test water connected to a 5 25 long 13 3 cm cast fe pipe section 5 or 12 7 cm outside diameter 4 75 or 12 1 cm inside diameter approximate volume 0 95 liter the pipe was set vertically and each end of the pipe section was fitted with two airtight clear acrylic plexi glass plates that were bolted to rings this was to support the pipe and to prevent air from contacting the inner pipe scale during the experiments the cast fe pipe scale remained intact and undisturbed by external forces or movement and was constantly in contact with test water the test water was pumped by an ac 3cp md march magnetic drive polypropylene pump with 1 15 hp 115v air cooled motor us plastic corp with a constant flow of 50 ml min or 0 71 cm min as indicated by a flow meter gilmont gf 1360 the flow was not reflective of the water distribution hydraulics and was selected based on our laboratory capacity the test water temperature was controlled at 22 9 1 6 c by submerging a section of circulation tubing in a water chiller to counter temperature increase associated with pumping the 10 liter reservoir was connected to a dual titrator system schott titronic universal model with a sensor interface sensolab ph controller jensen systems and multi t 2 2 software program jensen systems for a continuous ph adjustment to offset ph changes associated with corrosion and other chemical reactions the water ph was adjusted with 0 6 n hydrochloric acid and 0 6 n sodium hydroxide connecting tubing i e tygon teflon and valves i e pvc were plastic materials and their lengths were detailed in fig 1 the total volume of the connecting plastic materials was 0 32 liter an identical control test apparatus was constructed without the cast fe pipe section as a control to quantify non fe associated as sorption losses 2 2 synthetic drinking water chemistry arsenic v is assumed to be the most likely oxidation state in treated and disinfected drinking water and far more to accumulate in drinking water distribution systems lytle et al 2004 five water conditions a e were alternated during experimental operation by varying the initial target as v or as later and target po4 levels in the simulated drinking water sdw the as and po4 levels were reported as µg l as as and mg l as po4 throughout the study respectively conditions a e represented sdw 75 µg l as sdw 180 µg l as sdw 75 µg l as 3 mg l po4 sdw and sdw 3 mg l po4 respectively the actual initial as and po4 levels were reported in the results section the chosen elevated as levels relative to the regulation standards 10 µg l in this study represented observed high levels reported in a specific water utility from personal exchanges the chosen po4 concentration represented a commonly applied corrosion control level mcneill and edwards 2002 the sdw representing condition d had a ph of 7 6 and contained 25 mg l dissolved inorganic carbon as c 20 mg l chloride 10 mg l sulfate and 1 mg l free chlorine residual as cl2 this water chemistry reflected the water quality of the local cincinnati water utility where the cast fe pipe section was harvested the control test apparatus was operated under condition d for 6 days followed by condition a for 164 days back to condition d for another 58 days and lastly condition e for 25 days the experimental apparatus was exposed to 10 consecutive water events with the five water conditions the rationale for these 10 conducted water conditions was listed in table 1 briefly water events 1 3 examined the capacity of as accumulation into the harvested corroding fe pipe scale at elevated initial as levels 75 180 µg l event 4 examined the as mobility in water and scale after addition of po4 with existing as concerns events 5 8 examined as mobility in water and scale after stopping po4 addition with different initial as levels event 9 examined the as release from corroding fe pipe scale with previous as concerns and po4 addition and event 10 examined the as release with previous as concerns and no po4 addition the water in the 10 liter reservoir for both apparatuses was replaced with freshly prepared test water every monday wednesday and friday water samples in the reservoir were drawn by syringe from the center of the 10 liter reservoir after mixing manually for elemental e g as fe p s on site water temperature ph cl2 and other wet chemistry e g alkalinity chloride analyses the total as was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms thermo elemental model 6500 duo franklin ma per epa method 200 8 u s epa 1994 and the detection limit was 0 00035 mg l other elements including total fe total p and total s were analyzed on inductively coupled atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes per epa method 200 7 u s epa 1994 due to instrumental or laboratory maintenance the icp ms was occasionally unavailable for use therefore the icp aes was also sometimes used for total as analysis the icp aes detection limit for as fe p and s was 0 004 mg l 0 001 mg l 0 005 mg l and 0 003 mg l respectively other analytical details are included in supporting information si 1 the water samples were collected daily during monday through friday therefore samples collected on tuesday and thursday were after 24 hours of recirculation samples on wednesday and friday were after 48 hours of recirculation and samples on monday were after 72 hours of recirculation 2 3 solids analysis as the pipe section later was used in a different research capacity two solid samples were carefully scraped off from the interior scale at the end of the 7 5 year experiment for as fe and p composition analyses such that there was minimal disturbance to interior pipe scale the two solid samples were prepared and digested per epa sw846 method 3051a u s epa 2007 briefly the two solids were first acidified with 18 v v nitric acid trace metal grade 67 70 hno3 and 5 v v hydrochloric acid trace metal grade 34 37 hcl and then digested in a microwave cem mars 6 model for 10 mins before analysis on icp aes 2 4 statistical analysis all statistics were conducted in the sigmaplot 14 0 notebook an alpha value α of 0 05 was selected to determine the statistical significance dalgaard 2008 the normality of the data was determined using shapiro wilk test for parametric or normally distributed data shapiro wilk test p 0 05 t test or one way anova was used to compare the mean as fe and po4 concentrations among different water conditions for non parametric or non normally distributed data shapiro wilk test p 0 05 rank tests including dunn s kruskal wallis multiple comparison analyses and spearman s rank correlation were used to compare the ranking or the median of total as total fe and total po4 along with the associations between different parameters regression analysis was used to examine the kinetics of as accumulation the data below detection limit were represented by half of the detection limit values for figures and data analyses 3 results the control apparatus was conditioned with the sdw condition d for the first 6 days in which as fe and po4 were undetectable figure s1 the apparatus was then exposed to condition a water containing an average initial total as of 83 8 2 µg l for 164 days arsenic levels remaining in the water after 24 hour or longer recirculation were not statistically different from the initial total as kruskal wallis test p 0 19 during days of 170 228 with condition d and days of 233 253 with condition e containing initial 2 8 0 3 mg l po4 the total as released into water remained undetectable additionally the changes in total fe and po4 levels in water were also negligible throughout the control study therefore the changes in as fe and po4 levels in water due to the components of the control apparatus e g tubing plexiglass reservoir pump deemed trivial and could be neglected for the experimental apparatus the total as total po4 and total fe levels remaining in water results were presented as below along with the important water quality parameters the accumulation or release rate of as kas and po4 kpo4 was calculated and the interactions between as fe and po4 were also investigated 3 1 depletion of water oxidants due to iron corrosion important water quality parameters including water ph dissolved oxygen free chlorine and total chlorine were measured table 2 the average initial ph of freshly prepared water ranged from 7 1 7 6 the average final ph after 24 hour or longer recirculation ranged from 7 5 7 6 figure s2 additionally the average initial and final dissolved oxygen levels ranged between 7 6 8 9 mg l and 6 7 7 9 mg l reflecting a 0 4 1 5 mg l depletion during different recirculation time figure s3 the depletion of initially added 1 mg l cl2 was also observed as indicated by lower average free and total chlorine residual at 0 1 0 34 mg l and 0 13 0 41 mg l respectively figure s4 the depletion of water oxidants such as dissolved oxygen and chlorine was expected as a result of interactions with corroding fe and ferrous fe during water recirculation mcneill and edwards 2001 sarin et al 2004b no correlation was identified between the changes in water quality and changes in water treatment among events 3 2 accumulation and release of arsenic as a function of initial arsenic and orthophosphate concentrations as the water events were conducted in a chronological order the results in this section were presented in the same order events 1 3 tested the accumulation capacity for as by the cast fe pipe section the cast fe pipe section was first exposed to condition a containing an average initial as concentration of 78 12 µg l from days 0 226 event 1 table 3 figs 2 3 average as levels significantly decreased from initial levels to 60 11 µg l 53 26 µg l and further to 43 13 µg l after 24 48 and 72 hours of recirculation respectively kruskal wallis test p 0 001 table s1 this gradual decrease in as levels with recirculation time reflected increasing accumulation of as to fe corrosion by products on the pipe or in the experimental system specifically there was total accumulated as mass mas of 25 4 mg with an average accumulation rate kas of 0 11 mg as day during this event table 3 fig 4 the average po4 level in water increased from 0 034 0 13 mg l up to 0 095 0 22 mg l after 24 hour or longer recirculation time figs 2 5 the total released po4 mass mpo4 was 50 1 mg resulting in an average release rate kpo4 of 0 22 mg day negative designation refers to a po4 release table 3 the po4 source was the harvested cast fe pipe scale which likely accumulated po4 over time from cincinnati drinking water po4 is naturally present at low levels in the source water or from the addition of sodium hexametaphosphate used to prevent post precipitation in the distribution system while in service city of cincinnati 2020 there was a significant positive correlation between total fe and total po4 spearman s rho 0 36 p 0 001 suggesting that phosphate containing fe minerals in fe pipe scale were sometimes dislodged it is worth noting that the interior surfaces of the non cast fe pipe components in the experimental apparatus were gradually coated with fe corrosion by product deposits visually in the early stage of the study therefore both the cast fe pipe section and the mobilized fe minerals deposited on the other interior surfaces contributed to the accumulation and release of as fe and po4 throughout the study from here on we refer to both sources as the cast fe pipe section surface minerals in that the mobilized fe deposits also originated from the initial cast fe pipe section during days 226 275 condition b contained an average initial as of 183 4 6 µg l event 2 table 3 the initial average as level was significantly reduced down to an average of 107 18 µg l after 24 hour or longer stagnation kruskal wallis test p 0 002 with kas at 0 25 mg day table s1 figs 2 4 the increase in the kas 0 25 0 11 2 3 was proportional to the increase in the initial average as concentration 183 78 2 3 a very small increase in average po4 levels during recirculation resulted in kpo4 at 0 034 mg day with a weaker association between total fe and total po4 relative to event 1 spearman s rho 0 20 p 0 26 figs 2 5 condition a resumed event 3 between days 275 1122 similar to events 1 and 2 the average initial as level of 84 26 µg l significantly decreased down to 50 15 µg l after 24 hours or longer recirculation time kruskal wallis test p 0 018 resulting in kas of 0 11 mg day tables 3 s1 figs 2 4 the results again showed that the change in the kas 0 11 0 25 0 44 was proportional to the change in the initial average as concentration 84 183 0 46 even after 3 1 years of exposure to water with high as the accumulation capability of the fe scale did not diminish and still showed a relatively large accumulation and uptake capacity in contrast sporadic high po4 in water levels of up to 1 5 mg l were observed with kpo4 at 0 044 mg l figs 2 5 and total po4 levels had even weaker association with total fe relative to event 2 spearman s rho 0 16 p 0 001 between days 1122 1155 condition c contained an average initial as and po4 of 80 3 0 µg l and 3 3 0 08 mg l respectively event 4 this condition was to explore the as mobility in water and fe pipe scale when the water systems had po4 corrosion control treatment the simultaneous presence of as 1 1 µm and 30 times higher po4 34 µm i e molar ratio as po4 0 031 in water facilitated the release of as from the fe scale the total as remaining in water levels were significantly increased up to 130 37 µg l kruskal wallis test p 0 001 with kas at 0 20 mg day negative designation refers to an as release leading to 5 0 6 7 mg 134 mg of the total pre sorbed as in events 1 3 releasing back into water tables 3 s1 figs 2 4 this implied that spikes of as might occur when initiating po4 corrosion control treatment in water systems that contain as in the fe pipe scale while as was released from the scale the po4 was taken up by the scale with kpo4 at 3 5 mg day table 3 figs 4 5 during the same time no increase in fe release was observed indicating that desorption was the most likely as release mechanism fig 2 the desorption of as and uptake of po4 demonstrated the competitive adsorption between as and po4 which was also shown by a negative correlation between total as and total po4 in water during 24 hour or longer recirculation periods spearman s rho 0 63 p 0 001 between days 1155 1542 condition a was resumed to look into the as mobility in water and fe pipe scale after stopping po4 corrosion control treatment event 5 the average initial as level of 79 16 µg l in water significantly decreased down to 56 13 µg l with kas at 0 084 mg day kruskal wallis test p 0 001 tables 3 s1 and the average initial po4 of 0 010 0 020 mg l increased up to 0 060 0 091 mg l with kpo4 at 0 17 mg day during 24 hour or longer recirculation figs 2 5 the kas of event 5 0 084 mg day was slightly smaller relative to event 1 and event 3 0 11 mg day when the same condition a was tested table 3 although some of po4 that was previously incorporated in scale in event 4 was released a portion of the po4 sorbed sites in the fe scale during event 4 remained occupied and were likely unavailable for further uptake of as meanwhile a 48 hour sampling effort during event 5 was conducted to study kinetics of as accumulation by tracking changes in the as and po4 levels in water fig 6 a the initial as was 69 µg l and 0 42 was adsorbed to the cast fe pipe scale surfaces after half an hour of recirculation with 12 after 5 hours peak at 24 after 35 hours and 20 after 48 hours meanwhile the po4 levels in water were up to 0 029 mg l fig 6b showing that part of the po4 pre sorbed to the fe scale was released by the sequentially added as in water from days 1542 1673 the sdw condition d was run representing a scenario where the water system had historical as containing fe scale and did not use po4 as corrosion control treatment event 6 unsurprisingly the accumulated as in the fe pipe scale from events 1 5 was mobilized and released into water the average as levels were 9 9 11 µg l after 24 hour or longer recirculation leading to kas at 0 038 mg day tables 3 s1 figs 2 4 the pre adsorbed or deposited as in fe scale released elevated as levels into water relative to the epa regulation standard 10 µg l as a reference which would raise health concerns in such water systems as indicated in previous studies lytle et al 2010 triantafyllidou et al 2019 meanwhile the po4 levels were constantly below detectable levels 0 015 mg l indicating no further release of po4 from the scale table 3 figs 2 5 from days 1673 1919 condition a was resumed aiming at examining the continuing accumulation capacity of as in water event 7 table 3 in keeping with events 1 3 and 5 the average initial as level of 77 19 µg l was significantly reduced down to 49 15 µg l kruskal wallis test p 0 001 and the average initial po4 of 0 012 0 026 mg l increased up to 0 068 0 39 mg l after 24 hour or longer recirculation table s1 figs 2 3 5 while no po4 was released from the scale in event 6 the as addition in event 7 promoted release of po4 from scale table 3 fig 4 the kas of 0 11 mg day was higher than that 0 084 mg day in event 5 table 3 fig 4 it was likely that the release of as during event 6 might have yielded more available as uptake sites for event 7 from days 1919 2300 condition d was resumed to examine the as mobility in the scale event 8 with no added as and no added po4 average as levels of 6 6 7 2 µg l were released into water during 24 hour or longer recirculation table 3 figs 2 4 though the as levels were significantly reduced relative to event 6 when the same condition d was tested kruskal wallis test p 0 001 the as release for different recirculation times was mostly above 5 µg l which is the regulation standard for new jersey and new hampshire njdep 2004 nhdes 2018 the elevated levels of as in water could still raise public health concerns even with long exposure 1 year to the sdw between days 2300 2361 condition e with no added as and 3 2 0 90 mg l po4 was tested to examine the mobility of as pre existed in fe pipe scale while po4 corrosion control was applied event 9 elevated average levels of as at 15 24 µg l were released into water while 3 0 mg day po4 was incorporated in the scale during 24 hour or longer recirculation table 3 figs 2 4 this led to 3 3 times more released as at 0 080 mg as day compared to that 0 024 mg day for event 8 between days 2361 2751 when condition d was resumed the average as levels in water were reduced to 2 2 2 4 µg l during recirculation which reached below regulation levels and led to kas of 0 0047 mg day table 3 this rate was 2 8 3 3 times smaller compared to that during event 8 with condition d the alternation between condition d and condition e showed that for water systems with as containing fe pipe scale addition of po4 corrosion control treatment might cause high as levels in water in the short term due to mobilization and release of as from the fe scale however the amount of released as in water would be reduced in the long term once reaching equilibrium with bulk water in water distribution systems 3 3 stable total iron levels in water during different recirculation periods the average initial total fe levels remaining in water for all water events were relatively low ranging from below detection limit 0 001 mg l to 0 053 mg l table 2 figs 2 s5 detectable levels of initial fe could have been associated with random fe rust particles that had settled at the bottom of the 10 liter container during initial sample collection average total fe levels after 24 hours of recirculation increased to a range of 0 022 0 22 mg l kruskal wallis test p 0 14 for event 1 p 0 004 for other events table s2 increasing recirculation time did not significantly change the total fe levels for 9 of the 10 water treatment events kruskal wallis test p 0 06 1 the exception was for event 3 in which the fe level after 72 hours of recirculation was significantly lower than that after 48 hours of recirculation kruskal wallis test p 0 021 therefore the initial as or po4 added to the sdw did not seem to influence the overall fe solubility and stability in scale 3 4 presence of arsenic and phosphorus in iron scale solids both as and p were detected in both fe scale solids samples the as p and fe in one solid was measured at 422 µg g 2 806 µg g and 399 306 µg g respectively while the as p and fe in the other solid was at 1 338 µg g 3 383 µg g and 294 167 µg g the detected as p and fe in these two solids was within the ranges reported by lytle et al 2004 as our preliminary solids analyses only validates the presence of as and p in scale more in depth scale characterization is needed for better understanding of mechanistic interactions between as po4 and different types of fe minerals 4 discussion 4 1 large arsenic uptake capacity for cast iron pipe surface later serving as a reservoir for arsenic release large as uptake capacity was observed for this cast fe pipe section throughout this study during this 7 5 year study the water that was recirculating the simulated water system with the 5 25 long cast fe pipe section was equivalent to water volume 198 m3 in a 10 8 mile or 17 4 km long pipe with 4 75 inside diameter even with some as release due to competition from po4 addition in events 4 and 9 162 mg as 27 of the total added 600 mg as were accumulated into the fe scale other factors such as water quality water redox water temperature water hydraulics and pipe scale characteristics e g roughness structure morphology might also come to play a role in influencing the uptake capacity of as by the fe scale surface minerals in practice zeng et al 2008b gallegos garcia et al 2012 but the over simplistic calculation based on this long term study still showed that the aged cast fe pipe scale and associated deposited fe solids were capable of uptaking high levels of as 75 180 µg l in distribution water at a considerably large capacity the aged fe scale therefore is expected to accumulate the trace as levels 10 µg l in the distributed water at a similar or even larger capacity many water systems contain many miles of old cast fe pipes and or galvanized fe pipes in service these old and long fe pipes provided much larger interior fe surface area and therefore more abundant uptake sites over their normal service life of 50 100 years it was shown that the as was accumulated onto fe oxyhydroxide and oxides dominantly via a strong and stable bidentate corner sharing complex fe o 2 as though the less favorable bidentate edge sharing complex fe o2 as and monodentate complex fe o as were also reported at water ph of 8 0 sherman and randall 2003 müller et al 2010 jain et al 1999 the strong force through this inner complexation assisted the adsorbed as in staying and concentrating in the scale and served as a reservoir for as release later on this phenomenon was shown in events 6 8 and 10 where no as or po4 was added to the simulated test water the accumulated as in the scale was released into water over a combined 2 5 years at levels ranging from below detection level 0 35 µg l up to 44 µg l this observation was also reported previously that up to 299 µg l as was detected in the tap water due to release of as from the fe pipe scale in drinking water distribution systems copeland et al 2007 lytle et al 2010 our study and previous studies demonstrated that once the as is accumulated into fe scale the release of as is a slow continuous and sporadic process which could be challenging to mitigate and address 4 2 rapid kinetics for arsenic accumulation the 48 hour kinetics study in event 5 showed that as accumulation was fast throughout the 48 hour sampling and the initial as in water levels of 69 µg l appeared to decrease linearly resulting in an accumulation rate k of 0 27 hr y 65 4 0 27x r2 0 80 p 0 001 fig 6a the results from this study were consistent with previous batch scale studies that the uptake of as by fe iii oxyhydroxide is rapid initially sometimes within five minutes depending on water quality fuller et al 1993 raven et al 1998 neupane et al 2014 previous studies also showed that the as accumulation kinetics are highly influenced by the diffusion of as from the bulk solutions to the pore space of fe mineral structures fuller et al 1993 dai et al 2016 for the monotonous water condition in event 5 the as in water levels and fe scale porosity morphology and structure might play an important role 4 3 impact of orthophosphate on arsenic mobility during events 4 and 9 small initial as po4 molar ratios 1 by simultaneous or sequential addition of po4 consistently caused the release of as that was accumulated in the fe scale while po4 was accumulated on the fe scale additionally the released as was lower than the accumulated po4 on a molar basis specifically during event 4 when as and po4 as po4 0 031 were simultaneously added 0 089 mmol of as was released from the scale 7 3 of the accumulated po4 1 213 mmol on a molar basis during event 9 when po4 as po4 0 0001 was sequentially added followed by previous events 0 065 mm as was released 3 4 of the total accumulated po4 1 90 mm the results in events 4 and 9 could be explained by various surface complexation models which showed that the as and po4 were adsorbed to two types of surface sites manning and goldberg 1996 hiemstra and van riemsdijk 1999 liu et al 2001 hongshao and stanforth 2001 zeng et al 2008a the first type are the similar surface sites that as and po4 compete over the second type are the as and po4 specific sites as a result the added po4 only displaced a small fraction 7 1 of the total accumulated as in fe scale in addition throughout the study at least 54 of the added po4 accumulated in the fe scale and remained bound within the fe scale i e was not displaced by as or desorbed to achieve equilibrium with exposed water given the potential impact of po4 on as mobility from corroding fe pipes water utilities who have as concerns may consider carefully evaluating the application and optimization of po4 4 4 environmental implications and limitations the results from this study have important implications for understanding accumulation and release of as in municipal water systems when there is a change in po4 corrosion control treatment our study showed that the fe scale in drinking water systems serves as a reservoir to concentrate the trace levels of as from upstream of in and or even downstream of water distribution systems that contain fe based water pipes including cast fe galvanized fe and other fe pipes the accumulation of as can take place for a prolonged time in these fe based pipes in addition to as the fe scale was previously shown to concentrate other trace metals such as lead and manganese and these accumulated lead and manganese can later be released from the fe scale little et al 2017 similarly our work revealed that the concentrated as in the fe scale would later be released into drinking water causing elevated as in water levels a recent study indicated that the patterns of as release in drinking water distribution systems were complicated and unpredictable and were a function of water hydraulics pipe materials sampling procedures changes in water treatment and other factors triantafyllidou et al 2019 with our finding that po4 addition was followed by an immediate increase in as levels in water due to release of the pre accumulated as in fe scale water systems should consider taking precautions when introducing po4 into their water such as pipe scale analyses and targeted distribution water quality monitoring for as while this study gives insight into understanding the mobility of as from aged cast fe pipe scale from distribution systems limitations inherent in this study need to be addressed in future studies first the impact of individual as and po4 parameters was not examined individually using parallel experimental apparatus therefore the results observed in each event was a cumulative effect posed from previous events secondly though the plastic components used in the experimental apparatus did not show much interactions with as and po4 the released fe deposits from the cast fe pipe scale coated almost all the exposed plastic surfaces observed visually it was reasonable to say that the accumulation and release of as was attributed to the fe solids from the cast fe pipe scale however we could not distinguish the contribution between the cast fe pipe section and the fe solids that coated the plastic components thirdly in depth characterization of cast fe pipe scale should be considered in the future to elucidate the interactions between as po4 and fe minerals in the scale water interface with wider range of initial as po4 molar ratios 5 conclusion the corroding cast fe pipe section scale in this simulated drinking water system showed large accumulation capability 27 of total amount as in water over the course of 7 5 years under the given test water chemistry conditions the as accumulation was kinetically fast with an accumulation rate of 0 27 hr when water contained an initial as of 69 µg l following changes in initial as and po4 concentrations in water elevated as levels up to 44 µg l was released into water po4 addition did not influence the total fe release and fe scale stability however po4 addition released the pre accumulated as in water that decreased in the long term while po4 was incorporated onto the scale the addition of po4 only displaced a small fraction of total accumulated as in fe scale and most accumulated po4 remained tightly bound to certain fe scale sites due to the potential impact of po4 on as mobility proactive sampling monitoring and communication measures should be taken when water utilities that are having or might have as problems consider po4 corrosion control treatment credit

17149,highly toxic iodinated phenolic by products were frequently detected in the oxidative treatment and disinfection of iodine containing water herein it was found that three model iodinated phenolic disinfection byproducts dbps 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol were reactive with hocl and the reaction rate constants at ph 7 0 and 25 were 1 86 102 1 62 102 and 7 5 101 m 1s

into stable and non toxic iodate io3 and iodinated and chlorinated aliphatic dbps besides io3 seven kinds of aromatic intermediate products including iodophenols chloroiodophenols iodoquinones chloroiodoquinones chloroquinones chlorophenols and coupling products were detected c i bond of iodophenols was cleaved in the reaction and the resulted aromatic products were further transformed into chlorinated aliphatic dbps trichloromethane tcm trichloroacetic acid tcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa and chloral hydrate ch mg l level and iodinated trihalomethanes μg l level hocl was effective for converting iodophenols into io3 and less toxic chlorinated aliphatic dbps considering that chlorine was widely used as disinfectant transformation and toxicity alteration of emerging dbps during chlorination booster chlorination warrant further investigations graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction disinfection is always the last defense for controlling waterborne diseases although other methods such as ozone oxidation and ultraviolet irradiation were effective for water disinfection chlorination was cheap and easy to use cantor 1994 mcguire 2006 more importantly the residual chlorine existing in treated water would maintain disinfection effect during water distribution process a main shortage of chlorine disinfection pre oxidation is the formation of disinfection by products dbps dong et al 2019 liu et al 2020a hocl is an electrophilic reagent and reactive with organics containing electron rich moieties as natural organic matter nom ubiquitously existed in natural waters formation of chlorinated dbps raised public concerns due to their toxicity and potential health impacts allard et al 2015 ashbolt 2004 accompanied with global warming and the rising of sea level saline water intrusion may greatly impact quality of source water in coastal area ferguson and gleeson 2012 background halogen ions such as bromide and iodide would react with hocl to generate active halogen species which could further react with nom with the formation of halogenated dbps criquet et al 2012 liu et al 2018 iodide exists in natural waters with concentration ranging from 0 4 µg l to 100 µg l plewa et al 2008 schwehr and santschi 2003 in the oxidative treatment of iodide containing water iodide would be oxidized into active iodine i e hoi and i2 the active iodine could further react with nom and other dissolved organics with the formation of iodinated dbps bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 criquet et al 2012 liu et al 2021 sayess et al 2020 ye et al 2013 recent study showed that odorous iodinated by products μg l level even formed in the coagulation of surface water in yangtze river delta china as fecl3 coagulant oxidized iodide into active iodine hoi and the hoi further reacted with nom in raw water with the formation of iodinated aliphatic and phenolic by products ding et al 2019 phenolic groups and aromatic rings are the basic structure of nom and iodinated phenolic dbps were more and more frequently detected during chlorination or chloramination of source water and wastewater gong et al 2017 liberatore et al 2017 liu et al 2020b liu and zhang 2014 pan et al 2016b w parsons 1983 yang and zhang 2013 yang et al 2019 for example 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol up to 3 9 ng l and 2 4 6 triiodophenol up to 0 43 ng l were detected in tap water which used hocl as disinfectant in yangtze river delta in 2016 pan et al 2016a 4 iodophenol up to 0 1 nm was detected in the chloramination of iodide containing source water gong et al 2017 both in the chloramination of iodide containing source water and in the chlorinated saline secondary sewage effluent 2 4 6 triiodophenol was detected with up to 330 3 ng l and 0 4 ng l of concentration respectively gong et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 moreover production of gas and oil through hydrofracturing raised concern about the pollution of source water with the subsurface injection of produced water containing halides enhanced formation of halogenated dbps was observed in downstream drinking water treatment plants burgos et al 2017 harkness et al 2015 and dozens of iodinated phenolic dbps including 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol and iodomethylphenols were detected in chloraminated oil and gas wastewaters liberatore et al 2017 i dbps were more genotoxic and cytotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues richardson et al 2008 while iodinated phenolic dbps were more toxic than iodinated aliphatic dbps hu et al 2018 liu and zhang 2014 pan et al 2016b cytotoxicity of 2 4 6 triiodophenol to human hepatoma cells hepg2 was 10 7 times higher than that of triiodomethane tim hu et al 2018 developmental toxicity of iodinated phenolic dbps to embryos of a polychaete p dumerilii was 50 200 times higher than that of iodinated aliphatic dbps pan et al 2016b toxicity of 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 4 iodophenol to a marine alga was as much as 76 3 and 16 2 times higher than that of iodoacetic acid respectively liu and zhang 2014 since the detection frequency of iodinated phenolic dbps increased in tap water and wastewater finding methods to eliminate their toxicity is important previous studies reported the transformation of brominated and chlorinated phenolic dbps during chlorination and the transformation of iodinated phenolic dbps during chloramination gong et al 2017 hu et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 nunez gaytan et al 2010 zhai and zhang 2011 chlorinated and brominated phenolic dbps formed in the chlorination of source water and these phenolic dbps acted as intermediate compounds to further react with hocl to generate trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 nunez gaytan et al 2010 zhai and zhang 2011 in order to control the formation of regulated dbps chloramine was used as disinfectant instead of hocl however study reported that 2 4 6 triiodophenol was finally converted into iodinated aliphatic dbps during chloramination treatment and cytotoxicity of the water sample increased significantly after chloramination hu et al 2018 in the chlorination of wastewater and source water iodinated phenolic dbps were often detected so far transformation of iodinated phenolic dbps during chlorination including products reaction pathways and the variation of toxicity had not been revealed exploring the underlying mechanism could provide useful information for optimizing chlorine disinfection and controlling its negative impacts 2 4 6 triiodophenol was one of the most frequently detected iodinated phenolic dbps and 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol may experience electrophilic substitution by active iodine hoi to be converted into 2 4 diiodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol meanwhile 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol were also frequently detected iodinated phenolic dbps gong et al 2017 liberatore et al 2017 herein 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol were selected as model compounds to study their transformation mechanism in the reaction with hocl in terms of reaction kinetics transformation pathways and variation of acute toxicity 2

and experiments of detecting intermediate products total organic iodine toi and io3 were conducted in 50 ml conical flasks with ground glass stopper under water bath at 25 1 with magnetic stirring in headspace free and dark conditions reaction kinetics were investigated under pseudo first order conditions with excess in hocl detailed information was shown in text s3 the kinetic experiments were carried out at initial hocl concentration of 50 80 and 120 μm at ph ranging from 5 to 10 and the initial concentration of iodophenol was 5 μm under different ph conditions the reaction rates of hocl with iodophenol were quite different therefore the contact time was different at different ph to ensure that most iodophenol was degraded within the contact time the experiments of detecting the evolution of intermediate products as a function of reaction time were carried out at initial hocl concentration of 200 μm and ph 7 0 with contact time of 10 s to 1 h and the initial concentration of iodophenol was 20 μm here a relatively high initial concentration of iodophenol was adopted to amplify the formation of intermediate products batch reactions were initiated by adding sodium

hocl was in excess hocl 10 iodophenol the reaction obeyed first order law in respect to hocl and iodophenol text s3 figure s1 and the reaction kinetic could be described as equation 1 1 d iodophenol dt k app iodophenol tot hocl tot where iodophenol tot represented the total exposure of iodophenol and hocl tot represented the total exposure of hocl the calculated second order rate constants are listed in fig 1 determined second order rate constants were ph dependent rate constant of hocl with 2 iodophenol increased from 6 2 m 1s 1 at ph 5 0 to 4 4 102 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 and then decreased to 2 3 101 m 1s 1 at ph 10 0 similar variation was observed in the chlorination of 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol this bell shaped profile of rate constants with solution ph could be fitted by the

iodophenol and 4 iodophenol rate constants of hocl with un dissociated iodophenols were much lower than that of hocl with dissociated iodophenols theoretically dissociation deprotonation of phenol would increase electron density of the whole conjugated system benzene ring and facilitate its nucleophilic substitution thus rate constant of hocl with dissociated iodophenol k2 was larger than that of hocl with un dissociated iodophenol k1 contribution of respective species specific reaction was compared in fig 1 contribution of hocl with un dissociated iodophenol decreased with the increase of solution ph and the reaction of hocl with dissociated iodophenol dominated the overall reaction as solution ph surpassed 8 0 fraction of hocl decreased and the overall reaction rate decreased this led to the bell shaped profiles of the determined rate constants the different pka values of three iodophenols and diverse reaction rate constants of hocl with three iodophenols led that the change of apparent rate constants of three iodophenols with the variation of ph was different 3 2 reaction pathways intermediate products formed in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6

2011 2 4 6 trichlorophenol figure s65 was detected in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol and it may form in the chlorine attack of ortho position iodine atom of tp 288 the active iodine 1 valent cleaved from 2 iodophenol may further attack its parent molecule with the formation of 2 4 diiodophenol figure s54 and 2 4 6 triiodophenol figure s50 simultaneously 2 iodophenol was attacked by hocl and active iodine to generate 2 chloro 4 6 diiodophenol and 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol tp 380 figure s55 4 hydroxyl 2 6 diiodophenol tp 362 figure s61 formed in the iodination and hydroxylation of 2 iodophenol tp 362 was further oxidized into 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone tp 360 figure s63 by hocl as similar reaction pathway had been reported in the reaction of hocl with brominated p hydroxyphenol zhai and zhang 2011 hydroxylation of tp 360 would result in the formation of 3 hydroxyl 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone tp 376 figure s73 hydroxylation and chlorination of 2 iodophenol resulted in the formation of 4 hydroxyl 2 6 dichlorophenol tp 178 figure s66 further oxidation of tp 178 by hocl generated 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone tp 176 figure s68 3 hydroxyl 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone tp 192 figure s70 would form in the further hydroxylation of tp 176 for the chlorination of 4 iodophenol the products were similar with those formed in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol please note that only the representative products were listed in fig 2 similar products also formed via the reaction pathways and were listed in figure s80 in addition to the oxidation products and substitution products coupling products were also detected possible reaction pathways were proposed in fig 3 firstly 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol were oxidized by hocl via one electron transfer with the formation of radicals these radicals had resonance forms and could react with each other via c c coupling or c o coupling chen et al 2019a sun et al 2019 with the formation of tp 312 figure s74 and tp 438 figure s75 mono chlorinated tp 438 tp 472 figure s78 and di chlorinated tp 438 tp 506 figure s79 may form in the chlorination of tp 438 in succession the deprived active iodine 1 may react with tp 438 to generate tp 564 figure s76 further chlorination of these coupling products may result in the formation of halogenated aliphatic dbps as illustrated in the following sections 3 2 2 chlorination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol ortho and para position of 2 4 6 triiodophenol were occupied by iodine atom thus electrophilic substitution of 2 4 6 triiodophenol was difficult since the reactivity of meta positions of benzene ring was weak chlorine substitution of iodine and oxidation of 2 4 6 triiodophenol were the main reactions in the reaction of hocl with 2 4 6 triiodophenol hydroxylation and substitution of iodine atom by hocl led to the formation of 4 hydroxyl 2 6 dichlorophenol tp 178 tp 178 may experience similar chlorination pathways which had been proposed in above section chlorination of 2 iodophenol with the formation of tp 192 continuous attacking of iodine atom by hocl led to the formation of 6 chloro 2 4 diiodophenol 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol tp 380 4 6 dichloro 2 iodophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 iodophenol tp 288 and tp 196 hydroxylation of 2 4 6 triiodophenol led to the formation of 4 hydroxyl 2 6 diiodophenol and 2 hydroxyl 3 5 diiodophenol tp 362 while they could be further oxidized to 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone and 3 5 diiodo 1 2 benzoquinone tp 360 respectively tp 376 formed in the further hydroxylation of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone no coupling product was detected in the chlorination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 3 variation of intermediate products chemical standard of 2 chloro 4 6 diiodophenol 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol 2 chloro 4 iodophenol 4 chloro 2 iodophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 iodophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 iodophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone 2 4 diiodophenol are used to confirm the formation of tp 380 tp 254 tp 288 tp 196 tp 360 tp 176 tp 346 in the above proposed reaction mechanism variation of these intermediate products was quantitatively analyzed by hplc esi qqqms under multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode as shown in fig 4 maximum concentration of tp 254 and tp 288 reached 2 84 μm and 6 5 μm in hocl 2 iodophenol system respectively furthermore maximum concentration of iodinated chlorinated product tp 380 also reached 0 99 μm and 0 58 μm in hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol system respectively a large amount of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tp 196 4 78 1 84 and 3 66 um respectively formed in the three systems and it may form in the chlorination of tp 254 tp 288 and tp 380 a small amount of iodinated product tp 346 less than 0 35 μm generated during chlorination of 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol was detected in both hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol systems and its max concentration was about 0 26 μm iodinated quinone product tp 360 and chlorinated quinone product tp 176 were all determined in three systems the concentration of tp 360 was less than 5 nm in hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol systems however tp 360 reached 0 24 μm in hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system different reaction pathways led to the different formation of tp 360 in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol compared with the chlorination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol fig 2 although quinone products tp 360 and tp 176 and iodinated products tp 346 and tp 471 formed in the chlorination of iodophenols amount of these products was much lower than that of chlorinated products tp 254 tp 288 tp 380 and tp 196 therefore chlorinated products were the main intermediate products in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol an obvious trend for the formation of these intermediate products was that they formed at high rate in the initial minutes and then gradually decreased in the following reaction degradation rate of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone was much lower than that of other products figure s81 evolution of intermediate products as a function of reaction time in the chlorination of three iodophenols in natural water sample was further investigated figure s82 profiles of the evolution of the intermediate products were similar to that in the synthetic water sample these results indicated that aromatic intermediate products formed in the chlorination of iodophenols could be further transformed by hocl moreover formation of intermediate products as a function of hocl iodophenol molar ratio with reaction time of 24 h was investigated fig 4 g h and i at molar ratio of 1 1 dosage of hocl was not enough to transform all the iodophenols and mono chlorinated iodophenol tp 254 and di chlorinated iodophenol tp 288 were the main products as the hocl iodophenol molar ratio increased to 5 1 more iodophenols were chlorinated tp 254 was fully transformed into tp 288 and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tp 196 while tp 346 was fully transformed into di iodinated mono chlorinated phenol tp 380 which could experience further chlorine substitution to form tp 288 and tp 196 when hocl iodophenol molar ratio was 20 1 nearly all of the intermediate products were further transformed detailed mechanism is presented in following paragraphs 3 4 formation of io3 chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps variation of intermediate products formed in the chlorination of iodophenols is presented in above section it was found that these intermediate products were further transformed and the evolution of iodophenols io3 and total organic iodine toi as a function of reaction time was investigated fig 5 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol were completely transformed within 2 min 10 min and 30 min respectively io3 formed in the reaction process indicating that hocl deprived iodine from iodophenols iodine containing intermediate products and oxidized it into io3 as the reaction time prolonged to 60 min concentration of io3 in hocl 2 iodophenol hocl 4 iodophenol and hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system was 13 8 11 8 and 34 7 μm respectively after 24 h of reaction this value could reach 15 3 13 8 and 40 3 μm respectively this indicated that most io3 generated within an hour meanwhile concentration of toi decreased with time indicating hocl could transform the highly toxic organic iodine into nontoxic io3 concentration of total iodine was calculated according to equation 11 and the evolution of total iodine was shown in fig 5 the concentration of total iodine kept stable during the reaction process indicating the whole system reached iodine balance 11 total iodine i o 3 toi formation of io3 as a function of hocl iodophenol molar ratio was also investigated as shown in fig 5d with the increase of hocl iodophenol molar ratio formation of io3 increased accordingly when the hocl iodophenol molar ratio reached 40 1 the iodine transformation percentage approached 100 for 2 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol and exceeded 80 for 4 iodophenol this indicated that most iodine was deprived from iodophenols and was finally oxidized to io3 by hocl for hocl 4 iodophenol system there may be some remaining organic iodine in above section the identified aromatic intermediate dbps were further converted and could not be detected by uplc esi qtof ms gas chromatography was utilized for further analyzing the transformation products formation of volatile chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps was examined in the chlorination of iodophenols fig 6 both chlorinated aliphatic dbps including trichloromethane tcm chloroform trichloroacetic acid tcaa chloral hydrate ch and dichloroacetic acid dcaa and iodinated aliphatic dbps including triiodomethane tim iodoform dichloroiodomethane dcim and diiodochloromethane dicm were detected for the chlorinated aliphatic dbps their formation increased with the elevation of hocl iodophenol molar ratio when the hocl iodophenol molar ratio reached 40 1 1810 1892 μg l of tcm 776 971 μg l of tcaa 49 63 6 μg l of ch and 24 3 43 6 μg l of dcaa formed in the chlorination of three iodophenols concentration of tcm and tcaa approached mg l level at the end of the reaction this phenomenon was in accordance with previous result that the formation of cl dbps increased with the increase of hocl dosage e et al 2016 different with the formation of chlorinated aliphatic dbps formation of iodinated aliphatic dbps initially increased and then decreased with the elevation of hocl iodophenol molar ratio fig 6g h and i for hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol systems the max concentration of tim dicm dcim was 21 6 59 7 117 6 μg l and 18 1 39 7 100 5 μg l respectively with the hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 5 1 for hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system tim dicm and dcim reached its max concentration at the molar ratio of 1 1 5 1 and 10 1 respectively previous study reported that miaa formed in the chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol hu et al 2018 in comparison no miaa was detected in the chlorination of the three iodophenols formation of halogenated aliphatic dbps as a function of hocl iodophenol molar ratio in natural water sample was investigated as well figure s89 and the variation of various chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps was similar with that of in the synthetic water sample formation mechanism of chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps in the chlorination of iodophenols was proposed fig 7 firstly iodophenol experienced chlorine substitution in succession with the formation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol would be attacked by hypochlorous acid with the cleavage of benzene ring between carbon containing hydroxyl and carbon containing chlorine the product would be dehydrated subsequently with the formation of aliphatic product tp 284 tp 284 was further hydrolyzed and the bond between double bond carbon and alkyl carbon containing three chlorine atoms would be cleaved with the formation of chloroform and tp 182 figure s90 the hydrogen atom closed to aldehyde group would be substituted by chlorine with the formation of tp 216 tp 216 would be further attacked with the formation of tp 122 and ch the hydrogen atom on α carbon was further substituted by chlorine to form tp 156 figure s91 then tp 156 was attacked by hypochlorous acid or hydrolyzed and the bond hoc ccl2 was cleaved with the formation of tcaa dcaa and formic acid similarly the intermediate product tp 288 could be attacked by hoi or hocl to form tim dicm and dcim tp 380 may be attacked by hocl continuously to generate tcm ch tcaa and dcaa six intermediate products tp 466 tp 366 tp 308 tp 214 tp 156 and tp 182 had been detected by uplc tof ms ms figures s90 to s95 this result confirmed the above proposed reaction pathways considering there were many intermediate products in the hocl iodophenol system the formation pathways of aliphatic dbps shown in fig 7 may represent some reaction pathways to form aliphatic dbps in the chlorination of iodophenols other intermediate products like coupling products and quinone products etc may experience similar reaction pathways to generate aliphatic dbps at low hocl iodophenol molar ratio 10 1 with the increase of hocl iodophenol molar ratio more iodine atoms on the benzene ring were substituted by chlorine the deprived active iodine would take part in the formation of tim dicm and dcim at high hocl iodophenol molar ratio 20 1 more hocl oxidized more active iodine to io3 to prevent active iodine to participate in the formation of iodinated aliphatic dbps therefore the concentration of iodinated aliphatic dbps first increased and then decreased with the increase of hocl iodophenol molar ratio obviously the generated amount of iodinated aliphatic dbps in hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system was higher than that in hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol system 2 4 6 triiodophenol contained three iodine atoms while 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol contained one iodine atom therefore more iodine could be substituted by chlorine and then acted as active iodine to take part in the formation of iodinated aliphatic dbps in the chlorination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol at hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 20 1 total concentration of iodinated aliphatic dbps tim dicm and dcim was 17 6 17 4 and 99 7 μg l for 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol respectively at the same molar ratio total concentration of chlorinated aliphatic dbps tcm ch dcaa and tcaa was 2144 1900 and 2279 μg l for 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol respectively when the molar ratio of hocl iodophenol increased to 40 1 the concentration difference of chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps continued to increase therefore at high hocl iodophenol molar ratio chlorinated aliphatic dbps were the main final products 3 5 variation of acute toxicity variation of acute toxicity of water samples containing 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chlorination as a function of reaction time was investigated fig 8 inhibition ratio of luminescent intensity of vibrio qinghaiensis q67 by 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol 20 μm was 33 52 and 94 respectively acute toxicity of the iodophenols followed the order of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 4 iodophenol 2 iodophenol when reacted with hocl molar ratio of hocl iodophenol 10 1 acute toxicity of water sample containing 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol increased to 80 around in the initial 3 min and then decreased to 23 5 and 16 respectively after 24 h of chlorination in comparison toxicity of the water sample containing 2 4 6 triiodophenol steadily decreased in the chlorination process and the inhibition ratio decreased to 34 1 after 24 h of chlorination these results showed that acute toxicity of 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol varied in reaction with hocl and finally abated this variation may correlate with the change of intermediate products acute toxicity of 10 intermediate products as a function of concentration was determined fig 9 and their half maximal effective concentration ec50 values were listed in table 2 acute toxicity of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone and 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone was lower than that of phenolic compounds except for 2 iodophenol for the phenolic compounds containing iodine acute toxicity of the compound with iodine atom on para position was greater than that on ortho position for example the acute toxicity was 4 iodophenol 2 iodophenol 2 chloro 4 iodophenol 4 chloro 2 iodophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 iodophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 iodophenol and 2 chloro 4 6 diiodophenol 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol furthermore addition of chlorine and iodine atoms onto the structure of 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol increased their acute toxicity and the order of acute toxicity of the following compounds was 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 iodophenol 4 chloro 2 iodophenol 2 iodophenol one exception was that 2 4 diiodophenol was more toxic than 2 4 6 triiodophenol a previous study reported that iodinated phenolic dbps possessed high cytotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cells and the cytotoxicity of 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol followed the order of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 4 iodophenol 2 iodophenol liberatore et al 2017 the order of the cytotoxicity of the three iodophenols was in consistent with the order of the acute toxicity of the three iodophenols obtained in this study for the hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol systems at the beginning of the reaction 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol experienced electrophilic substitution via hocl attack and active iodine attack to form chlorinated iodinated 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol the ec50 value of 2 iodophenol was 5 1 18 9 53 3 and 42 4 times higher than that of 4 chloro 2 iodophenol 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol 2 chloro 4 6 diiodophenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol which all were the intermediate products of 2 iodophenol acute toxicity of these intermediate products was higher than the parent compound and acute toxicity of the chlorinated water sample increased in the initial time however those intermediate products were further transformed in the chlorination treatment and acute toxicity of the water sample decreased previous studies demonstrated that halogenated aliphatic dbps were less toxic compared with halogenated phenolic dbps liu and zhang 2014 yang and zhang 2013 and toxicity of dbps followed the order of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol iodoacetic acid chloroform chloroacetic acid determined with marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii ec50 value of chloroform chloroacetic acid and iodoacetic acid was 1 57 104 4 8 104 and 1 8 103 times higher than that of 2 4 6 triiodophenol respectively yang and zhang 2013 formation of chlorinated aliphatic dbps as a function of reaction time at hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 10 1 was investigated figure s97 and the results showed that chlorinated aliphatic dbps gradually generated with extension of reaction time with the transformation of high toxic halogenated phenolic dbps to lower toxic halogenated aliphatic dbps acute toxicity of the system finally decreased for the hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system acute toxicity of 2 4 6 triiodophenol was higher than that of the intermediate products whether 2 4 6 triiodophenol was transformed to intermediate products or final products io3 and halogenated aliphatic dbps acute toxicity of the water sample decreased variation of acute toxicity of iodophenols after the reaction with different dosages of hocl was investigated fig 8d e and f when low level of hocl molar ratio of hocl iodophenol 5 1 reacted with 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol acute toxicity of the water sample increased fig 8d and 8e 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol were converted into highly toxic intermediate products which could not be further converted into low toxic halogenated aliphatic dbps due to the shortage of hocl fig 4g and 4h at the same time the transformation ratio from organic iodine to io3 was lower than 40 when the molar ratio of hocl to iodophenol was 5 1 fig 5d these results led to an increase in acute toxicity of water sample containing 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol at low hocl iodophenol molar ratio acute toxicity of the transformation products of 2 4 6 triiodophenol decreased with the increase of hocl dosage figure 8f 2 4 6 triiodophenol was transformed to lower toxic intermediate products halogenated aliphatic dbps and io3 leading a decrease in acute toxicity when the molar ratio of hocl iodophenol reached 10 1 acute toxicity of the transformation products of 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol decreased accordingly compared to the parent compounds when the molar ratio of hocl iodophenol increased to 20 1 and 40 1 the inhibition ratio decreased to 0 5 and 0 1 for 2 iodophenol 4 9 and 3 6 for 4 iodophenol 0 2 and 3 7 for 2 4 6 triiodophenol respectively acute toxicity of iodophenols was largely eliminated after chlorination reaction time 24 h at hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 20 1 and 40 1 most organic iodine was transformed into io3 io3 was stable and non toxic bürgi et al 2001 taurog et al 1966 the removal ratio of acute toxicity in 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol groups was 100 85 and 96 respectively with hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 40 1 figure 8 accordingly formation ratio of io3 in relevant groups was 99 81 and 96 respectively figure 5d deiodination of iodophenols is effective for the abatement of their acute toxicity 4 conclusion and implication the second order rate constant of the reaction of chlorine with iodide and hoi was 3 39 108 and 1 75 101 m 1s 1 at ph 7 respectively bichsel and von gunten 1999 the second order rate constant of the reaction of hoi with phenol was 2 59 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 wang et al 2020 these three rate constants indicated that iodide could be rapidly oxidized to hoi by hocl and then hoi was oxidized to iodate or reacted with phenol to generate iodophenols the rate constant of the reaction of chlorine with hoi was much lower than that of hoi with phenol and this difference led to the formation of iodinated phenols in water formation of transformation products in the chlorination of phenol in the presence of iodide at ph 7 was investigated figure s98 the initial concentration of chlorine phenol and iodide was 50 μm 5 μm and 5 μm respectively mono iodinated mono chlorinated phenol tp 254 di chlorinated mono iodinated phenol tp 288 and mono chlorinated di iodinated phenol tp 380 were detected in the system moreover mono iodinated phenol tp 220 was one of the main products the concentration of these transformation products first increased and then decreased with time indicating these products first formed in the system and then were degraded by chlorine therefore in the process of actual treatment of water containing iodide iodophenols may first form and then be transformed to halogenated aliphatic dbps and iodate when chlorine dosage was high enough if the chlorine dosage was insufficient the generated iodophenols may still exist in water previous study reported that 0 40 ng l of 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 1 13 ng l of 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were detected in the chlorinated saline secondary sewage effluent at hocl dosage of 6 mg l as cl2 yang and zhang 2013 however when the dosage of hocl increased to 10 mg l both 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were not detected this result was consistent with the conclusion in this study that increasing chlorine dosage could degrade the formed iodinated phenolic dbps and convert them into halogenated aliphatic dbps in this study it was found that iodophenols could be transformed into io3 chlorinated aliphatic dbps benzene ring cleaved products such as tcm tcaa dcaa and ch and iodinated aliphatic dbps such as tim dcim and dicm in reaction with hocl iodophenols were mainly transformed into chlorinated aliphatic dbps and io3 at high hocl dosage molar ratio of hocl iodophenol 20 1 and acute toxicity of the water samples containing iodophenols significantly decreased after chlorination with the elevation of sea level saline water intrusion was more and more frequently observed in coastal area ferguson and gleeson 2012 iodinated phenolic by products not only formed during disinfection but also formed in the pre oxidation using permanganate peroxymonosulfate and manganese dioxide etc as oxidants and coagulation using fecl3 as coagulant of source water containing iodide ding et al 2019 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b li et al 2018c chloramination has superiority for controlling the formation of traditional dbps compared with chlorination but nitrosamines would form in the chloramination of source water and there was a high risk of generating iodinated phenolic dbps during chloramination chen and valentine 2007 gong et al 2017 hocl could be added into water distribution system as booster chlorination after chloramination to transform detoxify iodinated phenolic dbps in coastal area potential of chlorination on the transformation of other emerging dbps including nitrosamines and halogenated aromatic dbps and abatement of their toxicity warrants

17149,highly toxic iodinated phenolic by products were frequently detected in the oxidative treatment and disinfection of iodine containing water herein it was found that three model iodinated phenolic disinfection byproducts dbps 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol were reactive with hocl and the reaction rate constants at ph 7 0 and 25 were 1 86 102 1 62 102 and 7 5 101 m 1s

into stable and non toxic iodate io3 and iodinated and chlorinated aliphatic dbps besides io3 seven kinds of aromatic intermediate products including iodophenols chloroiodophenols iodoquinones chloroiodoquinones chloroquinones chlorophenols and coupling products were detected c i bond of iodophenols was cleaved in the reaction and the resulted aromatic products were further transformed into chlorinated aliphatic dbps trichloromethane tcm trichloroacetic acid tcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa and chloral hydrate ch mg l level and iodinated trihalomethanes μg l level hocl was effective for converting iodophenols into io3 and less toxic chlorinated aliphatic dbps considering that chlorine was widely used as disinfectant transformation and toxicity alteration of emerging dbps during chlorination booster chlorination warrant further investigations graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction disinfection is always the last defense for controlling waterborne diseases although other methods such as ozone oxidation and ultraviolet irradiation were effective for water disinfection chlorination was cheap and easy to use cantor 1994 mcguire 2006 more importantly the residual chlorine existing in treated water would maintain disinfection effect during water distribution process a main shortage of chlorine disinfection pre oxidation is the formation of disinfection by products dbps dong et al 2019 liu et al 2020a hocl is an electrophilic reagent and reactive with organics containing electron rich moieties as natural organic matter nom ubiquitously existed in natural waters formation of chlorinated dbps raised public concerns due to their toxicity and potential health impacts allard et al 2015 ashbolt 2004 accompanied with global warming and the rising of sea level saline water intrusion may greatly impact quality of source water in coastal area ferguson and gleeson 2012 background halogen ions such as bromide and iodide would react with hocl to generate active halogen species which could further react with nom with the formation of halogenated dbps criquet et al 2012 liu et al 2018 iodide exists in natural waters with concentration ranging from 0 4 µg l to 100 µg l plewa et al 2008 schwehr and santschi 2003 in the oxidative treatment of iodide containing water iodide would be oxidized into active iodine i e hoi and i2 the active iodine could further react with nom and other dissolved organics with the formation of iodinated dbps bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 criquet et al 2012 liu et al 2021 sayess et al 2020 ye et al 2013 recent study showed that odorous iodinated by products μg l level even formed in the coagulation of surface water in yangtze river delta china as fecl3 coagulant oxidized iodide into active iodine hoi and the hoi further reacted with nom in raw water with the formation of iodinated aliphatic and phenolic by products ding et al 2019 phenolic groups and aromatic rings are the basic structure of nom and iodinated phenolic dbps were more and more frequently detected during chlorination or chloramination of source water and wastewater gong et al 2017 liberatore et al 2017 liu et al 2020b liu and zhang 2014 pan et al 2016b w parsons 1983 yang and zhang 2013 yang et al 2019 for example 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol up to 3 9 ng l and 2 4 6 triiodophenol up to 0 43 ng l were detected in tap water which used hocl as disinfectant in yangtze river delta in 2016 pan et al 2016a 4 iodophenol up to 0 1 nm was detected in the chloramination of iodide containing source water gong et al 2017 both in the chloramination of iodide containing source water and in the chlorinated saline secondary sewage effluent 2 4 6 triiodophenol was detected with up to 330 3 ng l and 0 4 ng l of concentration respectively gong et al 2017 yang and zhang 2013 moreover production of gas and oil through hydrofracturing raised concern about the pollution of source water with the subsurface injection of produced water containing halides enhanced formation of halogenated dbps was observed in downstream drinking water treatment plants burgos et al 2017 harkness et al 2015 and dozens of iodinated phenolic dbps including 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol and iodomethylphenols were detected in chloraminated oil and gas wastewaters liberatore et al 2017 i dbps were more genotoxic and cytotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues richardson et al 2008 while iodinated phenolic dbps were more toxic than iodinated aliphatic dbps hu et al 2018 liu and zhang 2014 pan et al 2016b cytotoxicity of 2 4 6 triiodophenol to human hepatoma cells hepg2 was 10 7 times higher than that of triiodomethane tim hu et al 2018 developmental toxicity of iodinated phenolic dbps to embryos of a polychaete p dumerilii was 50 200 times higher than that of iodinated aliphatic dbps pan et al 2016b toxicity of 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 4 iodophenol to a marine alga was as much as 76 3 and 16 2 times higher than that of iodoacetic acid respectively liu and zhang 2014 since the detection frequency of iodinated phenolic dbps increased in tap water and wastewater finding methods to eliminate their toxicity is important previous studies reported the transformation of brominated and chlorinated phenolic dbps during chlorination and the transformation of iodinated phenolic dbps during chloramination gong et al 2017 hu et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 nunez gaytan et al 2010 zhai and zhang 2011 chlorinated and brominated phenolic dbps formed in the chlorination of source water and these phenolic dbps acted as intermediate compounds to further react with hocl to generate trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids jiang et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 nunez gaytan et al 2010 zhai and zhang 2011 in order to control the formation of regulated dbps chloramine was used as disinfectant instead of hocl however study reported that 2 4 6 triiodophenol was finally converted into iodinated aliphatic dbps during chloramination treatment and cytotoxicity of the water sample increased significantly after chloramination hu et al 2018 in the chlorination of wastewater and source water iodinated phenolic dbps were often detected so far transformation of iodinated phenolic dbps during chlorination including products reaction pathways and the variation of toxicity had not been revealed exploring the underlying mechanism could provide useful information for optimizing chlorine disinfection and controlling its negative impacts 2 4 6 triiodophenol was one of the most

hocl was in excess hocl 10 iodophenol the reaction obeyed first order law in respect to hocl and iodophenol text s3 figure s1 and the reaction kinetic could be described as equation 1 1 d iodophenol dt k app iodophenol tot hocl tot where iodophenol tot represented the total exposure of iodophenol and hocl tot represented the total exposure of hocl the calculated second order rate constants are listed in fig 1 determined second order rate constants were ph dependent rate constant of hocl with 2 iodophenol increased from 6 2 m 1s 1 at ph 5 0 to 4 4 102 m 1s 1 at ph 8 0 and then decreased to 2 3 101 m 1s 1 at ph 10 0 similar variation was observed in the chlorination of 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol this bell shaped profile of rate constants with solution ph could be fitted by the

iodophenol and 4 iodophenol rate constants of hocl with un dissociated iodophenols were much lower than that of hocl with dissociated iodophenols theoretically dissociation deprotonation of phenol would increase electron density of the whole conjugated system benzene ring and facilitate its nucleophilic substitution thus rate constant of hocl with dissociated iodophenol k2 was larger than that of hocl with un dissociated iodophenol k1 contribution of respective species specific reaction was compared in fig 1 contribution of hocl with un dissociated iodophenol decreased with the increase of solution ph and the reaction of hocl with dissociated iodophenol dominated the overall reaction as solution ph surpassed 8 0 fraction of hocl decreased and the overall reaction rate decreased this led to the bell shaped profiles of the determined rate constants the different pka values of three iodophenols and diverse reaction rate constants of hocl with three iodophenols led that the change of apparent rate constants of three iodophenols with the variation of ph was different 3 2 reaction pathways intermediate products formed in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol were identified by uplc tof ms ms detailed information about the identified intermediate products is listed in table s4 the extracted ion chromatograms xic and molecular ion mass mass spectrograms of relevant products are shown in supplementary data based on the identified products the reaction pathways are proposed in fig 2 3 2 1 chlorination of 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol 4 chloro 2 iodophenol tp 254 figure s51 and 4 6 dichloro 2 iodophenol tp 288 figure s52 may form in the electrophilic substitution of 2 iodophenol by hocl previous study reported that in the chlorination of 2 4 6 tribromophenol bromine atoms were substituted by hocl with the formation of 4 chloro 2 6 dibromophenol and 4 6 dichloro 2 bromophenol zhai and zhang 2011 2 4 6 trichlorophenol figure s65 was detected in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol and it may form in the chlorine attack of ortho position iodine atom of tp 288 the active iodine 1 valent cleaved from 2 iodophenol may further attack its parent molecule with the formation of 2 4 diiodophenol figure s54 and 2 4 6 triiodophenol figure s50 simultaneously 2 iodophenol was attacked by hocl and active iodine to generate 2 chloro 4 6 diiodophenol and 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol tp 380 figure s55 4 hydroxyl 2 6 diiodophenol tp 362 figure s61 formed in the iodination and hydroxylation of 2 iodophenol tp 362 was further oxidized into 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone tp 360 figure s63 by hocl as similar reaction pathway had been reported in the reaction of hocl with brominated p hydroxyphenol zhai and zhang 2011 hydroxylation of tp 360 would result in the formation of 3 hydroxyl 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone tp 376 figure s73 hydroxylation and chlorination of 2 iodophenol resulted in the formation of 4 hydroxyl 2 6 dichlorophenol tp 178 figure s66 further oxidation of tp 178 by hocl generated 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone tp 176 figure s68 3 hydroxyl 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone tp 192 figure s70 would form in the further hydroxylation of tp 176 for the chlorination of 4 iodophenol the products were similar with those formed in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol please note that only the representative products were listed in fig 2 similar products also formed via the reaction pathways and were listed in figure s80 in addition to the oxidation products and substitution products coupling products were also detected possible reaction pathways were proposed in fig 3 firstly 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol were oxidized by hocl via one electron transfer with the formation of radicals these radicals had resonance forms and could react with each other via c c coupling or c o coupling chen et al 2019a sun et al 2019 with the formation of tp 312 figure s74 and tp 438 figure s75 mono chlorinated tp 438 tp 472 figure s78 and di chlorinated tp 438 tp 506 figure s79 may form in the chlorination of tp 438 in succession the deprived active iodine 1 may react with tp 438 to generate tp 564 figure s76 further chlorination of these coupling products may result in the formation of halogenated aliphatic dbps as illustrated in the following sections 3 2 2 chlorination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol ortho and para position of 2 4 6 triiodophenol were occupied by iodine atom thus electrophilic substitution of 2 4 6 triiodophenol was difficult since the reactivity of meta positions of benzene ring was weak chlorine substitution of iodine and oxidation of 2 4 6 triiodophenol were the main reactions in the reaction of hocl with 2 4 6 triiodophenol hydroxylation and substitution of iodine atom by hocl led to the formation of 4 hydroxyl 2 6 dichlorophenol tp 178 tp 178 may experience similar chlorination pathways which had been proposed in above section chlorination of 2 iodophenol with the formation of tp 192 continuous attacking of iodine atom by hocl led to the formation of 6 chloro 2 4 diiodophenol 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol tp 380 4 6 dichloro 2 iodophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 iodophenol tp 288 and tp 196 hydroxylation of 2 4 6 triiodophenol led to the formation of 4 hydroxyl 2 6 diiodophenol and 2 hydroxyl 3 5 diiodophenol tp 362 while they could be further oxidized to 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone and 3 5 diiodo 1 2 benzoquinone tp 360 respectively tp 376 formed in the further hydroxylation of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone no coupling product was detected in the chlorination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 3 3 variation of intermediate products chemical standard of 2 chloro 4 6 diiodophenol 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol 2 chloro 4 iodophenol 4 chloro 2 iodophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 iodophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 iodophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone 2 4 diiodophenol are used to confirm the formation of tp 380 tp 254 tp 288 tp 196 tp 360 tp 176 tp 346 in the above proposed reaction mechanism variation of these intermediate products was quantitatively analyzed by hplc esi qqqms under multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode as shown in fig 4 maximum concentration of tp 254 and tp 288 reached 2 84 μm and 6 5 μm in hocl 2 iodophenol system respectively furthermore maximum concentration of iodinated chlorinated product tp 380 also reached 0 99 μm and 0 58 μm in hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol system respectively a large amount of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tp 196 4 78 1 84 and 3 66 um respectively formed in the three systems and it may form in the chlorination of tp 254 tp 288 and tp 380 a small amount of iodinated product tp 346 less than 0 35 μm generated during chlorination of 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol 2 4 6 triiodophenol was detected in both hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol systems and its max concentration was about 0 26 μm iodinated quinone product tp 360 and chlorinated quinone product tp 176 were all determined in three systems the concentration of tp 360 was less than 5 nm in hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol systems however tp 360 reached 0 24 μm in hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system different reaction pathways led to the different formation of tp 360 in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol compared with the chlorination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol fig 2 although quinone products tp 360 and tp 176 and iodinated products tp 346 and tp 471 formed in the chlorination of iodophenols amount of these products was much lower than that of chlorinated products tp 254 tp 288 tp 380 and tp 196 therefore chlorinated products were the main intermediate products in the chlorination of 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol an obvious trend for the formation of these intermediate products was that they formed at high rate in the initial minutes and then gradually decreased in the following reaction degradation rate of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone was much lower than that of other products figure s81 evolution of intermediate products as a function of reaction time in the chlorination of three iodophenols in natural water sample was further investigated figure s82 profiles of the evolution of the intermediate products were similar to that in the synthetic water sample these results indicated that aromatic intermediate products formed in the chlorination of iodophenols could be further transformed by hocl moreover formation of intermediate products as a function of hocl iodophenol molar ratio with reaction time of 24 h was investigated fig 4 g h and i at molar ratio of 1 1 dosage of hocl was not enough to transform all the iodophenols and mono chlorinated iodophenol tp 254 and di chlorinated iodophenol tp 288 were the main products as the hocl iodophenol molar ratio increased to 5 1 more iodophenols were chlorinated tp 254 was fully transformed into tp 288 and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tp 196 while tp 346 was fully transformed into di iodinated mono chlorinated phenol tp 380 which could experience further chlorine substitution to form tp 288 and tp 196 when hocl iodophenol molar ratio was 20 1 nearly all of the intermediate products were further transformed detailed mechanism is presented in following paragraphs 3 4 formation of io3 chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps variation of intermediate products formed in the chlorination of iodophenols is presented in above section it was found that these intermediate products were further transformed and the evolution of iodophenols io3 and total organic iodine toi as a function of reaction time was investigated fig 5 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol were completely transformed within 2 min 10 min and 30 min respectively io3 formed in the reaction process indicating that hocl deprived iodine from iodophenols iodine containing intermediate products and oxidized it into io3 as the reaction time prolonged to 60 min concentration of io3 in hocl 2 iodophenol hocl 4 iodophenol and hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system was 13 8 11 8 and 34 7 μm respectively after 24 h of reaction this value could reach 15 3 13 8 and 40 3 μm respectively this indicated that most io3 generated within an hour meanwhile concentration of toi decreased with time indicating hocl could transform the highly toxic organic iodine into nontoxic io3 concentration of total iodine was calculated according to equation 11 and the evolution of total iodine was shown in fig 5 the concentration of total iodine kept stable during the reaction process indicating the whole system reached iodine balance 11 total iodine i o 3 toi formation of io3 as a function of hocl iodophenol molar ratio was also investigated as shown in fig 5d with the increase of hocl iodophenol molar ratio formation of io3 increased accordingly when the hocl iodophenol molar ratio reached 40 1 the iodine transformation percentage approached 100 for 2 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol and exceeded 80 for 4 iodophenol this indicated that most iodine was deprived from iodophenols and was finally oxidized to io3 by hocl for hocl 4 iodophenol system there may be some remaining organic iodine in above section the identified aromatic intermediate dbps were further converted and could not be detected by uplc esi qtof ms gas chromatography was utilized for further analyzing the transformation products formation of volatile chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps was examined in the chlorination of iodophenols fig 6 both chlorinated aliphatic dbps including trichloromethane tcm chloroform trichloroacetic acid tcaa chloral hydrate ch and dichloroacetic acid dcaa and iodinated aliphatic dbps including triiodomethane tim iodoform dichloroiodomethane dcim and diiodochloromethane dicm were detected for the chlorinated aliphatic dbps their formation increased with the elevation of hocl iodophenol molar ratio when the hocl iodophenol molar ratio reached 40 1 1810 1892 μg l of tcm 776 971 μg l of tcaa 49 63 6 μg l of ch and 24 3 43 6 μg l of dcaa formed in the chlorination of three iodophenols concentration of tcm and tcaa approached mg l level at the end of the reaction this phenomenon was in accordance with previous result that the formation of cl dbps increased with the increase of hocl dosage e et al 2016 different with the formation of chlorinated aliphatic dbps formation of iodinated aliphatic dbps initially increased and then decreased with the elevation of hocl iodophenol molar ratio fig 6g h and i for hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol systems the max concentration of tim dicm dcim was 21 6 59 7 117 6 μg l and 18 1 39 7 100 5 μg l respectively with the hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 5 1 for hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system tim dicm and dcim reached its max concentration at the molar ratio of 1 1 5 1 and 10 1 respectively previous study reported that miaa formed in the chloramination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol hu et al 2018 in comparison no miaa was detected in the chlorination of the three iodophenols formation of halogenated aliphatic dbps as a function of hocl iodophenol molar ratio in natural water sample was investigated as well figure s89 and the variation of various chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps was similar with that of in the synthetic water sample formation mechanism of chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps in the chlorination of iodophenols was proposed fig 7 firstly iodophenol experienced chlorine substitution in succession with the formation of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol and the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol would be attacked by hypochlorous acid with the cleavage of benzene ring between carbon containing hydroxyl and carbon containing chlorine the product would be dehydrated subsequently with the formation of aliphatic product tp 284 tp 284 was further hydrolyzed and the bond between double bond carbon and alkyl carbon containing three chlorine atoms would be cleaved with the formation of chloroform and tp 182 figure s90 the hydrogen atom closed to aldehyde group would be substituted by chlorine with the formation of tp 216 tp 216 would be further attacked with the formation of tp 122 and ch the hydrogen atom on α carbon was further substituted by chlorine to form tp 156 figure s91 then tp 156 was attacked by hypochlorous acid or hydrolyzed and the bond hoc ccl2 was cleaved with the formation of tcaa dcaa and formic acid similarly the intermediate product tp 288 could be attacked by hoi or hocl to form tim dicm and dcim tp 380 may be attacked by hocl continuously to generate tcm ch tcaa and dcaa six intermediate products tp 466 tp 366 tp 308 tp 214 tp 156 and tp 182 had been detected by uplc tof ms ms figures s90 to s95 this result confirmed the above proposed reaction pathways considering there were many intermediate products in the hocl iodophenol system the formation pathways of aliphatic dbps shown in fig 7 may represent some reaction pathways to form aliphatic dbps in the chlorination of iodophenols other intermediate products like coupling products and quinone products etc may experience similar reaction pathways to generate aliphatic dbps at low hocl iodophenol molar ratio 10 1 with the increase of hocl iodophenol molar ratio more iodine atoms on the benzene ring were substituted by chlorine the deprived active iodine would take part in the formation of tim dicm and dcim at high hocl iodophenol molar ratio 20 1 more hocl oxidized more active iodine to io3 to prevent active iodine to participate in the formation of iodinated aliphatic dbps therefore the concentration of iodinated aliphatic dbps first increased and then decreased with the increase of hocl iodophenol molar ratio obviously the generated amount of iodinated aliphatic dbps in hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system was higher than that in hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol system 2 4 6 triiodophenol contained three iodine atoms while 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol contained one iodine atom therefore more iodine could be substituted by chlorine and then acted as active iodine to take part in the formation of iodinated aliphatic dbps in the chlorination of 2 4 6 triiodophenol at hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 20 1 total concentration of iodinated aliphatic dbps tim dicm and dcim was 17 6 17 4 and 99 7 μg l for 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol respectively at the same molar ratio total concentration of chlorinated aliphatic dbps tcm ch dcaa and tcaa was 2144 1900 and 2279 μg l for 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol respectively when the molar ratio of hocl iodophenol increased to 40 1 the concentration difference of chlorinated and iodinated aliphatic dbps continued to increase therefore at high hocl iodophenol molar ratio chlorinated aliphatic dbps were the main final products 3 5 variation of acute toxicity variation of acute toxicity of water samples containing 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol during chlorination as a function of reaction time was investigated fig 8 inhibition ratio of luminescent intensity of vibrio qinghaiensis q67 by 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol 20 μm was 33 52 and 94 respectively acute toxicity of the iodophenols followed the order of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 4 iodophenol 2 iodophenol when reacted with hocl molar ratio of hocl iodophenol 10 1 acute toxicity of water sample containing 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol increased to 80 around in the initial 3 min and then decreased to 23 5 and 16 respectively after 24 h of chlorination in comparison toxicity of the water sample containing 2 4 6 triiodophenol steadily decreased in the chlorination process and the inhibition ratio decreased to 34 1 after 24 h of chlorination these results showed that acute toxicity of 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol varied in reaction with hocl and finally abated this variation may correlate with the change of intermediate products acute toxicity of 10 intermediate products as a function of concentration was determined fig 9 and their half maximal effective concentration ec50 values were listed in table 2 acute toxicity of 2 6 diiodo 1 4 benzoquinone and 2 6 dichloro 1 4 benzoquinone was lower than that of phenolic compounds except for 2 iodophenol for the phenolic compounds containing iodine acute toxicity of the compound with iodine atom on para position was greater than that on ortho position for example the acute toxicity was 4 iodophenol 2 iodophenol 2 chloro 4 iodophenol 4 chloro 2 iodophenol 2 6 dichloro 4 iodophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 iodophenol and 2 chloro 4 6 diiodophenol 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol furthermore addition of chlorine and iodine atoms onto the structure of 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol increased their acute toxicity and the order of acute toxicity of the following compounds was 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol 2 4 dichloro 6 iodophenol 4 chloro 2 iodophenol 2 iodophenol one exception was that 2 4 diiodophenol was more toxic than 2 4 6 triiodophenol a previous study reported that iodinated phenolic dbps possessed high cytotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cells and the cytotoxicity of 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol followed the order of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 4 iodophenol 2 iodophenol liberatore et al 2017 the order of the cytotoxicity of the three iodophenols was in consistent with the order of the acute toxicity of the three iodophenols obtained in this study for the hocl 2 iodophenol and hocl 4 iodophenol systems at the beginning of the reaction 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol experienced electrophilic substitution via hocl attack and active iodine attack to form chlorinated iodinated 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol the ec50 value of 2 iodophenol was 5 1 18 9 53 3 and 42 4 times higher than that of 4 chloro 2 iodophenol 4 chloro 2 6 diiodophenol 2 chloro 4 6 diiodophenol and 2 4 6 trichlorophenol which all were the intermediate products of 2 iodophenol acute toxicity of these intermediate products was higher than the parent compound and acute toxicity of the chlorinated water sample increased in the initial time however those intermediate products were further transformed in the chlorination treatment and acute toxicity of the water sample decreased previous studies demonstrated that halogenated aliphatic dbps were less toxic compared with halogenated phenolic dbps liu and zhang 2014 yang and zhang 2013 and toxicity of dbps followed the order of 2 4 6 triiodophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol iodoacetic acid chloroform chloroacetic acid determined with marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii ec50 value of chloroform chloroacetic acid and iodoacetic acid was 1 57 104 4 8 104 and 1 8 103 times higher than that of 2 4 6 triiodophenol respectively yang and zhang 2013 formation of chlorinated aliphatic dbps as a function of reaction time at hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 10 1 was investigated figure s97 and the results showed that chlorinated aliphatic dbps gradually generated with extension of reaction time with the transformation of high toxic halogenated phenolic dbps to lower toxic halogenated aliphatic dbps acute toxicity of the system finally decreased for the hocl 2 4 6 triiodophenol system acute toxicity of 2 4 6 triiodophenol was higher than that of the intermediate products whether 2 4 6 triiodophenol was transformed to intermediate products or final products io3 and halogenated aliphatic dbps acute toxicity of the water sample decreased variation of acute toxicity of iodophenols after the reaction with different dosages of hocl was investigated fig 8d e and f when low level of hocl molar ratio of hocl iodophenol 5 1 reacted with 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol acute toxicity of the water sample increased fig 8d and 8e 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol were converted into highly toxic intermediate products which could not be further converted into low toxic halogenated aliphatic dbps due to the shortage of hocl fig 4g and 4h at the same time the transformation ratio from organic iodine to io3 was lower than 40 when the molar ratio of hocl to iodophenol was 5 1 fig 5d these results led to an increase in acute toxicity of water sample containing 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol at low hocl iodophenol molar ratio acute toxicity of the transformation products of 2 4 6 triiodophenol decreased with the increase of hocl dosage figure 8f 2 4 6 triiodophenol was transformed to lower toxic intermediate products halogenated aliphatic dbps and io3 leading a decrease in acute toxicity when the molar ratio of hocl iodophenol reached 10 1 acute toxicity of the transformation products of 2 iodophenol and 4 iodophenol decreased accordingly compared to the parent compounds when the molar ratio of hocl iodophenol increased to 20 1 and 40 1 the inhibition ratio decreased to 0 5 and 0 1 for 2 iodophenol 4 9 and 3 6 for 4 iodophenol 0 2 and 3 7 for 2 4 6 triiodophenol respectively acute toxicity of iodophenols was largely eliminated after chlorination reaction time 24 h at hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 20 1 and 40 1 most organic iodine was transformed into io3 io3 was stable and non toxic bürgi et al 2001 taurog et al 1966 the removal ratio of acute toxicity in 2 iodophenol 4 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol groups was 100 85 and 96 respectively with hocl iodophenol molar ratio of 40 1 figure 8 accordingly formation ratio of io3 in relevant groups was 99 81 and 96 respectively figure 5d deiodination of iodophenols is effective for the abatement of their acute toxicity 4 conclusion and implication the second order rate constant of the reaction of chlorine with iodide and hoi was 3 39 108 and 1 75 101 m 1s 1 at ph 7 respectively bichsel and von gunten 1999 the second order rate constant of the reaction of hoi with phenol was 2 59 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 wang et al 2020 these three rate constants indicated that iodide could be rapidly oxidized to hoi by hocl and then hoi was oxidized to iodate or reacted with phenol to generate iodophenols the rate constant of the reaction of chlorine with hoi was much lower than that of hoi with phenol and this difference led to the formation of iodinated phenols in water formation of transformation products in the chlorination of phenol in the presence of iodide at ph 7 was investigated figure s98 the initial concentration of chlorine phenol and iodide was 50 μm 5 μm and 5 μm respectively mono iodinated mono chlorinated phenol tp 254 di chlorinated mono iodinated phenol tp 288 and mono chlorinated di iodinated phenol tp 380 were detected in the system moreover mono iodinated phenol tp 220 was one of the main products the concentration of these transformation products first increased and then decreased with time indicating these products first formed in the system and then were degraded by chlorine therefore in the process of actual treatment of water containing iodide iodophenols may first form and then be transformed to halogenated aliphatic dbps and iodate when chlorine dosage was high enough if the chlorine dosage was insufficient the generated iodophenols may still exist in water previous study reported that 0 40 ng l of 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 1 13 ng l of 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were detected in the chlorinated saline secondary sewage effluent at hocl dosage of 6 mg l as cl2 yang and zhang 2013 however when the dosage of hocl increased to 10 mg l both 2 4 6 triiodophenol and 2 6 diiodo 4 nitrophenol were not detected this result was consistent with the conclusion in this study that increasing chlorine dosage could degrade the formed iodinated phenolic dbps and convert them into halogenated aliphatic dbps in this study it was found that iodophenols could be transformed into io3 chlorinated aliphatic dbps benzene ring cleaved products such as tcm tcaa dcaa and ch and iodinated aliphatic dbps such as tim dcim and dicm in reaction with hocl iodophenols were mainly transformed into chlorinated aliphatic dbps and io3 at high hocl dosage molar ratio of hocl iodophenol 20 1 and acute toxicity of the water samples containing iodophenols significantly decreased after chlorination with the elevation of sea level saline water intrusion was more and more frequently observed in coastal area ferguson and gleeson 2012 iodinated phenolic by products not only formed during disinfection but also formed in the pre oxidation using permanganate peroxymonosulfate and manganese dioxide etc as oxidants and coagulation using fecl3 as coagulant of source water containing iodide ding et al 2019 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b li et al 2018c chloramination has superiority for controlling the formation of traditional dbps compared with chlorination but nitrosamines would form in the chloramination of source water and there was a high risk of generating iodinated phenolic dbps during chloramination chen and valentine 2007 gong et al 2017 hocl could be added into water distribution system as booster chlorination after chloramination to transform detoxify iodinated phenolic dbps in coastal area potential of chlorination on the transformation of other emerging dbps including nitrosamines and halogenated aromatic dbps and abatement of their toxicity warrants
