6500,analyzing the impacts of climate change on hydrology and future projections of water supplies is fundamental for the efficient management and planning of water resources in large river systems on the tibetan plateau tp which is known as the water tower of asia however large uncertainties remain in the projections of streamflow and glaciers in these cryospheric catchments due to great uncertainties in climate change projection and modeling processes in this work we developed an extended variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale hydrological model named vic cas which was coupled with glacier melting and glacier evolution schemes a two stage calibration procedure that used glacier inventory data and the observed streamflow was adopted to derive the model parameters the calibrated vic cas model was then used to assess the future change in glaciers and runoff using downscaled climate model data in the upstream regimes of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra rivers on the tp the results indicated that both temperature and precipitation were projected to increase resulting in a greater than 50 decline of the glacier area by the end of the 21st century in the five catchments glacier runoff was already beyond its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century with a greater than 20 loss of the glacier area except in the upstream of the yangtze river where glacier runoff was projected to decrease after the 2030 s annual streamflow was projected to increase significantly as a result of increased rainfall induced runoff compensating for the reduced glacier snow melt water in the five major upstream river basins the increasing rate of warm season streamflow was clearly less than that of annual runoff a negative trend in warm season streamflow was expected if precipitation did not sufficiently increase the annual hydrograph remained largely unchanged except in the upstream of the yellow river where peak streamflow was predicted to occur 1 month earlier because of the earlier snowmelt and greater rainfall precipitation ratio from may to june keywords climate change vic cas model glaciers streamflow tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is commonly known as earth s third pole because it possesses both the largest and highest plateaus and covers an area of 2 5 106 km2 with a mean elevation of 4500 m a s l above sea level due to the uniquely complex terrain and high altitude the tp is the largest permafrost region 1 5 106 km2 that exists at a mid low latitude ye et al 2013 and contains the largest number of glaciers approximately 4 9873 km2 outside of the polar regions liu et al 2015a the tp also called the asian water tower contains the headwaters of several major asian rivers which support nearly two billion people nearly 25 of the world s population huang et al 2012 over the last several decades the surface air temperature over the tp has increased at a faster rate than that on average in the northern hemisphere wang et al 2008 zhong et al 2011 guo and wang 2012 yang et al 2014 duan and xiao 2015 the cryosphere snow glaciers and permafrost on the tp is the most sensitive indicator of climate change lemke et al 2007 kang et al 2010 rising air temperatures are causing rapid changes in the cryosphere including glacier shrinkage decreased by 10 increasing negative glacier mass balance permafrost degradation and thickening of the active layer of permafrost zhang 2007 li et al 2008 wei et al 2014 the cryospheric change has also had considerable impacts on hydrological processes permafrost degradation increases infiltration enlarges subsurface water and leads to lower summer runoff and higher winter runoff ye et al 2009 niu et al 2011 with accelerated glacier melting river runoff will initially increase as a result of more meltwater but eventually decrease due to the loss of glacier area on the tp yao et al 2004 ye et al 2007 2008 gao et al 2012 immerzeel et al 2010 2012 shi et al 2016 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report ipccar5 the air temperature over the tp is expected to increase by 1 9 c and 4 3 c by the end of the 21st century under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios respectively su et al 2013 glaciers in the tp are likely to recede and the volume of glacier meltwater may dwindle in some watersheds immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 the near surface permafrost area is projected to decrease by 46 81 on the tp by the end of the 21st century nan et al 2005 lawrence and slater 2005 guo and wang 2012 therefore it is essential to quantify the potential effects of future climate changes on the discharges of major large rivers originating from the tp which will benefit from water resource management for sustainable development on the tp and in downstream regions numerous studies have been conducted to quantitatively investigate the impacts of climate change on hydrological processes on the tp in recent years rees and collins 2006 fujita et al 2007 li et al 2010 2013 2014 tahir et al 2011 gao et al 2012 2015 immerzeel et al 2010 2012 jeelani et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 among these studies several have focused on projecting future hydrological processes on the tp at the scale of large catchments or river basins using hydrological models determined by the output of global climate models gcms some of which are listed in table 1 additionally only a small number of studies have accounted for glacier melt and the response retreat and advance processes to climate change immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 and in others the glaciers were completely ignored lu et al 2018 liu et al 2011 2015b li et al 2013 2014 although these three studies provide important insights into the future changes in the streamflow and glaciers on the tp there has been a strong debate regarding the future trend of the streamflow due to inconsistently simulated contributions and trends of glacier meltwater immerzeel et al 2010 stated that the streamflow will likely decrease by the mid century due to reductions in glacier meltwater in the upper yangtze brahmaputra ganges and indus basins however they also highlighted a notable increase in runoff of the upper yellow basin which depends only marginally on glacier melt and increasing precipitation lutz et al 2014 projected an increase in runoff until at least 2050 due to the increasing precipitation at the expense of glacier runoff in the upper mekong salween brahmaputra and ganges basins and accelerated glacier melt in the upper indus basin su et al 2016 indicated that the discharge of six major upstream river basins yellow yangtze salween mekong brahmaputra and indus would remain moderately elevated in the near term 2011 2040 and increase by 2 7 22 4 in the long term 2041 2070 as a result of increasing precipitation and glacier meltwater and the accelerated glacier melt is considered to be the main cause for the increased runoff in the brahmaputra and indus basins large variability and uncertainty is clearly evident in the projections of runoff and glaciers obtained via different models and model parameters for the same study catchment on the tp a suitable hydrological model and an effective model parameter estimation approach are prerequisites for the successful projections of hydrological processes chen et al 2017a moradkhani et al 2005 hydrological models are a fundamental tool for quantitatively investigating and projecting hydrological processes and the model schemes for snow ice melt glacier response and soil freezingandthawing should be involved in simulating the hydrological conditions over the tp three hydrological models with glacier melt degree day method and glacier response volume area scaling law schemes namely the snowmelt runoff model srm the spatial processes in hydrology model sphy and the vic glacier model were applied to simulate and project hydrological processes at the large catchment scale on the tp immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 the specified relationship between glacier volume and glacier area was used to solve the changes in glacier area based on the simulated mean mass balance for glaciers in each size class lutz et al 2014 or in the basin immerzeel et al 2010 su et al 2016 the differentsensitivities to climate change among glaciers of different sizes have been ignored in simulations of the glacier area change at the basin scale larger glaciers have a smaller surface area to volume ratio so they are less sensitive to climate change than smaller glaciers van de wal and wild 2001 immerzeel et al 2012 another key issue is the oversight of thehydrologicaleffects offrozen soil in the srm and sphy models although the exclusion of the frozen soil hydrological processes could induce large errors in catchments on the tp due to the wide extent of frozen soil cuo et al 2015 hydrological models usually contain a large number of parameters that cannot be measured directly but instead are inferred by model calibration which adjusts the parameter values to fit the simulated runoff compared to the observations however a good model performance in streamflow simulations does not guarantee the reliable reproduction of other hydrological variables for example the underestimation of mountainous precipitation can be compensated by the overestimation of glacier meltwater and vice versa which has been called the effect of error compensation stahl et al 2008 schaefli and huss 2011 duethmann et al 2014 therefore more observed hydrological variables must be accounted for multi objective calibration especially for glacier snow fed catchments stahl et al 2008 shrestha et al 2014 chen et al 2017a b for hydrological simulations in glacierized catchments some recent studies have jointly used the observed glacier mass balances and in situ runoff for model calibration to provide more realistic results stahl et al 2008 huss et al 2008 konz and seibert 2010 duethmann et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2012 on the data scarce tp the degree day method has been widely adopted to simulate glacier melting the snow ice degree day factors ddfs are the most essential parameters and variations in these factors lead to significant changes in simulated glacier meltwater contributions to streamflow and trends in glacier runoff in the future zhao et al 2015 huss et al 2014 however glacier observations have not been considered for the model parameter calibration and validation in previous studies on hydrological projections at the large basin scale on the tp immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 in such a region with large uncertainties in precipitation data this oversight can lead to unrealistic or incorrect conclusions concerning glacier meltwater in this study a vic cas model coupled with glacier melting and glacier response schemes was developed within the framework of the vicmacroscale hydrologic model which is a well established distributed land surface hydrological model with frozen soil and snow schemes a two stage calibration strategy was adopted to calibrate the model parameters first the parameters of glacier melting were calibrated using the chinese glacier inventory cgi data and second the hydrological processes were optimized using the observed streamflow in the five major upstream river basins yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra on the tp the calibrated vic cas model was then forced with the downscaled gcm outputs to project future changes in runoff components and glaciers under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 global emission scenarios in the five study catchments 2 description of the study area the upstream regions of the yellow river uye yangtze river uya mekong river um salween river us and brahmaputra river ub on the tp were selected as the study area fig 1 the selected basin characteristics are listed in table 2 the five catchments cover an area of 5 97 104 km2 which is approximately a quarter of the area of the tp above 2000 m a s l the study basins are dominated by the asianmonsoon system during the summer tong et al 2014 nearly two thirds of the annual precipitation occurs during the warm season from april to september with increasing precipitation observed from northwest to southeast wang et al 2018 the topography of the basins is highly variable with the elevation gradually increasing from the southeast to northwest moreover the vegetation also exhibits clear horizontal variation characteristics with forests located in the southeastern areas and grasslands steppes presenting in both the northern and western areas song et al 2004 cui and graf 2009 which is caused by the topographical and climatic characteristics according to the first chinese glacier inventory fcgi the glacier coverage of the five study catchments is less than 3 the ub has the largest glacier area approximately 4261 km2 2 1 of the ub basin and the uye has the lowest glacier coverage approximately 129 km2 only 0 1 of the basin area previous studies zhang et al 2013 su et al 2016 have suggested that the contribution of glacier meltwater to stream runoff is small in the selected hydrological stations of the five catchments due to limited glacierization table 2 however the role of glacier meltwater is very important to the upstream tributaries of the study catchments where glacier meltwater accounts for 32 of the river runoff in the tuotuo river basin a tributary of the yangtze river zhang et al 2008 it should also be noted that permafrost occurs across an area of 29 60 104 km2 and accounts for approximately half of the surface area of our study catchments even in the lowest permafrost watershed ub the permafrost area reaches up to 6 7 104 km2 accounting for 32 7 of the basin area thus the frozen soil hydrological processes should not be neglected in the hydrological simulation of the catchments 3 data and methodology 3 1 vic cas model description the degree day method and glacier volume area scaling law were coupled to the vic model version 4 2 d to simulate glacier melt and glacier area change based on our previous studies zhao et al 2013 2015 zhang et al 2012 gao et al 2017a b the glacier mass balance was calculated on a daily time step while the glacier area was updated on an annual time step 3 1 1 brief description of the vic model the vic model is a physically based large scale distributed land surface hydrological model liang et al 1996 and it is used to calculate full energy and water budgets within each grid cell at daily or sub daily time steps considering the snow accumulation snow melt and soil freeze and thaw processes liang et al 1996 nijssen et al 2001 cherkauer and lettenmaier 2003 elsner et al 2010 gao et al 2009 the model has been widely applied in regional and global hydrological studies at a spatial resolution between 1 8 and 2 nijssen et al 2001 dan et al 2012 hidalgo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 elsner et al 2014 su et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 2015 the vic model can be forced by either daily or sub daily meteorological data daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and daily average windspeed data are required to run the model so that the vic model can be used for discharge simulations in the data scarce mountain watersheds 3 1 2 glacier schemes 3 1 2 1 setting model calculated unit the vic model usually adopts the rectangular grid as a calculated cell and runs within each cell independently the model settings may place a glacier in two different cells making it difficult to obtain each glacier mass balance and thus calculate the glacier area change because the volume area scaling relation is only suitable for individual or several glaciers and not for a part of a glacier considering the ridge lines are usually boundaries of glaciers and sub basins we adopted the sub basin as a model calculated unit to localize each glacier in a separate calculated unit fig 2 3 1 2 2 fraction of glacier coverage to account for mountain glacier melt and its influence on hydrology a new land cover type designated glacier was introduced into the calculated unit mosaic of the vic model in addition to ice free land glaciers usually form in higher elevation zones with lower air temperatures and higher relative humidity for accurate estimation of glacier melting glaciers were subdivided into intervals of 100 m by sets of elevation bands called glacier bands within a model calculated unit the mean elevation of each glacier band was generated from high resolution digital elevation model dem data the fraction of the calculated unit covered by each glacier at each glacier band was calculated based on glacier outlines and dem data fig 3 to consider the impact of the surface aspect on glacier melt the mean cosine of the surface aspect for each glacier within each elevation band was calculated fig 3 3 1 2 3 atmospheric sub grid variability for glaciers in this study the mean elevation of each glacier band was used to lapse the ice free zone mean temperature and precipitation in the calculated unit to obtain more accurate local estimates according to the following algorithm 1 t band t 0 t alt m e band e 0 2 p band p 0 1 p alt m e band e 0 p 0 m where tband and pband are the daily mean air temperature c and precipitation mm in the glacier elevation band respectively t0 and p0 are the daily mean air temperature c and precipitation mm of ice free land in the calculated unit respectively eband and e0 are the mean elevations m of the glacier band and the ice free land in the calculated unit respectively talt m and palt m are the respective corresponding monthly temperature lapse rate c m 1 and precipitation gradient mm m 1 p0 m is the mean corresponding monthly precipitation mm of ice free land in the calculated unit within the historical time period when we calculated the precipitation gradient and the subscript m represents the month if the calculated pband is less than zero then the value of pband is set to zero 3 1 2 4 glacier melting and area evolution model during the past several decades energy balance and temperature index methods have been developed and widely used to simulate glacier melt around the world hock 2005 hock and holmgren 2005 zhang et al 2012 although the energy balance models have a solid physical basis they are often difficult to apply in data scarce mountain catchments where the data required for the model are not always available the simple temperature index or degree day approaches are widely used to estimate snow ice melt with sufficient accuracy for most purposes due to the readily availability of air temperature data and computational simplicity huss et al 2008 carenzo et al 2009 macdougall et al 2011 gao et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 in this study we adopted the extended degree day algorithms to calculate glacier melt in each glacier band considering the exposure dependence of the degree day factor on the surface aspect konz et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 3 m i b a n d ddf snow i c e 1 r exp cosasp i b a n d t band t band 0 0 0 t band 0 0 where mi band is the total melt of snow ice mm for glacier i in the bandth glacier band ddfsnow ice is the degree day factor for snow ice mm c 1 day 1 rexp is the factor quantifying the aspect dependence of ddfsnow ice and cosaspi band is the mean cosine of the surface aspect for glacier i within the elevation band the key element of the glacier scheme is the simulation of glacier retreat or advance there are two main approaches for simulating the glacier area evolution themost physicallyrigorousmethod is the numerical ice flow models however this approach requires detailed information on the glacier surface and bed geometry therefore is not well suited for extensive data scarce regions hence the simple volume area scaling approach has been widely applied to simulate changes in glacier area based on the simulated mass balance radić et al 2007 stahl et al 2008 raper and braithwaite 2006 immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 in this study the glacier area evolution was simulated by combining the simulated mass balance with the volume area scaling law which was derived from the measured size of alpine glaciers around the globe liu et al 2003 raper and braithwaite 2005 kotlarski et al 2010 grinsted 2013 4 v c a γ 5 a v c 1 γ where v and a are the glacier volume km3 and area km2 of each glacier in the model calculated unit respectively and the constant c 0 0365 and dimensionless scaling coefficient γ 1 375 were obtained from radić and hock 2010 the initial glacier volume and average glacier thickness were estimated from the initial glacier area using eqs 4 and 5 the volume of each glacier was updated by adding the calculated change in volume which was determined from the annual mass balance on september 30 the end date of the hydrological year every year the new glacier area anew was computed using the volume area scaling law eq 5 the area change of each glacier δ a was computed as follows 6 δ a a new a old then the area fraction of each glacier in the elevation bands was adjusted followed by the change in glacier area we assume that the glacier advances or retreats in the lowest glacier elevation band first which has been shown to be reasonable by analyses of the spatial changes in glaciers from 1999 and 2004 in the western himalaya berthier et al 2007 when the glacier retreats the glacier area of the lowest band shrinks if the calculated shrinking area of the glacier is greater than that of the glacier in the lowest elevation band then the glacier area of the lowest band will be set to zero and the glacier area in the neighboring upper elevation band will be decreased to the remaining area in contrast when the glacier advances the glacier area of the lowest glacierized band will be increased however the increasing glacier area in the lowest glacierized elevation band is limited by the maximum capacity which is set to the initial input glacier area except for the initial lowest elevation band if the calculated increasing glacier area is sufficiently great the neighboring lower elevation band will need to be included we adopted a glacier adjusted method similar to that used by möller and schneider 2010 and zhang et al 2012 3 1 3 routing scheme the separate lohmann routing module lohmann et al 1996 1998 was used as a postprocessor in the vic model package for the routing of streamflow from the land surface simulation of grid cells in this study the land surface simulation was modified on a sub basin scale to use the lohmann routing model to calculate streamflow some modifications in code and input data were necessary first sub basins were identified using the pfafstetter coding system which determines the routing order of the sub basins and contains topographic information of the river network within a given sub basin geographic informationsystem softwarewas used to calculate the area and downstream distance to the outlet of the sub basin along the flow direction finally the modified lohmann routing model was used to calculate the water recharge from each sub basin to the outlet of the river basin from the land surface simulation area routing order and routing distance of the sub basins 3 2 data description 3 2 1 glacier data the fcgi and second chinese glacier inventory scgi have been completed and released by the cold and arid region environmental and engineering research institute of the chinese academy of sciences careeri the fcgi was completed based on topographical maps and aerial photographs acquired from the 1960s to 1980s shi et al 2009 among which the most photographs were acquired in the 1970s the scgi was compiled based on remote sensing images after 2004 including landsat tm etm and aster images and srtm digital elevation models liu et al 2015a guo et al 2015 the scgi covers 86 of the glacierized area of china the remaining regions are mainly located on the southeastern tp which covers part of the southern region of the upstream part of the salween river and brahmaputra river the spatial distribution of glaciers from the fcgi was used to calculate the initial glacier input data the updated glacier distribution datasets of scgi were used to calibrate and validate the glacier model parameters including degree day factors ddfsnow ice and the factor quantifying the aspect dependence rexp of the ddfsnow ice 3 2 2 interpolation of meteorological forcing data daily atmospheric data maximum minimum and mean temperatures precipitation as well as wind speed are required to force the vic cas model the observed meteorological dataset of 54 national meteorological stations inside or around our study catchments fig 1 was used for the daily spatial interpolation these weather stations lie between latitudes 27 44 n and 36 47 n and longitudes 81 15 e and 102 58 e with a wide elevation range spanning from 2085 m to 4800 m the data were collected from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration and consisted of daily values from january 1961 to december 2010 the dataset was created from in situobservations applying firm quality control including internal temporal and spatial consistency checks homogeneity tests and potential outlier detection feng et al 2004 ding et al 2008 the dataset was also regarded as the most credible meteorological dataset in china all selected stations have records longer than 30 years and 43 stations have acquired continuous daily data over the 40 year period from 1971 to 2010 temperature and precipitation have considerable spatial variations due to the effects of geographical factors different water vapor sources and the climate dominated area in these large scale catchments on tp su et al 2016 in this study the gradient plus inverse distance squared gids algorithm was employed to interpolate the air temperature and precipitation data considering the different effects of geographical factors latitude longitude and elevation price et al 2000 7 t 0 i 1 n 1 d i 2 1 i 1 n 1 d i 2 t i t alt m e 0 e i t lat m lat 0 lat i t lon m lon 0 lon i 8 p 0 i 1 n 1 d i 2 1

inverse distance squared method 9 w 0 i 1 n 1 d i 2 1 i 1 n 1 d i 2 w i where w 0 is the daily wind speed at the model calculated unit m s and wi is the daily observed wind speed at a neighboring weather station i m s considering the remarkable differences in water vapor transport among the five catchments cuo et al 2013 gao et al 2014 guo et al 2016 the air temperature and precipitation gradients were computed individually for each catchment a multiple linear regression analysis was used to calculate the gradients from the observations and geographical factors of meteorological stations inside and adjacent to the catchment table 3 summarizes the monthly precipitation gradients in response to elevation longitude and latitude the spatial distribution of our calculated precipitation vertical gradients is similar to that from previous studies guo et al 2016 cuo and zhang 2017 previous studies revealed that precipitation vertical gradients during the wet season may september ranged from 1 9 to 26 1 mm 100 m over the tp the gradients in our study 0 82 to 13 5 mm 100 m are within this range the differences in values may reflect that previous studies only considered the effects of elevation on precipitation guo et al 2016 cuo and zhang 2017 3 2 3 gcm data and downscaling the latest generation of gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 was used as climate change forcing data for our hydrological model the performance of gcms is not uniformly consistent within a given large geographical region due to differences in parameterization and physical processes miao et al 2012 liu et al 2015b we selected nineteen gcms with better performance over the tp based on previous studies li et al 2014 su et al 2013 hu et al 2014 and analyzed the mean projected changes in annual air temperature and precipitation between 1971 2006 and 2041 2070 from these gcms for the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios not shown then five gcms that were closest to the mean value were selected for our studies table 4 the daily historical and future temperature precipitation and wind speed simulations of the five gcms were obtained from the centre for environmental data analysis however the spatial resolutions of the gcms outputs were too coarse to directly drive the hydrological model thus requiring them to be downscaled the dc v method bouwer et al 2004 immerzeel et al 2012 is a statistically downscaled method in which the gcm data are corrected not only against the average observed climate but also for the observed variance in this study the dc v statistically downscaled method was adopted to yield the daily future meteorological data for each meteorological station based on the historical station observations and simulations of gcms during the baseline period 1971 2005 the future monthly values for each meteorological station from 2011 to 2100 were first calculated from the simulated value of gcm according to the following equation 10 α station m α gcm m α gcm m σ obs m σ gcm m α obs m where α station m is the future corrected climate parameter total precipitation or average temperature in a particular month m for each meteorological station α gcm m is the uncorrected simulated climate parameter from gcm α gcm m and σ g c m m are the average and standard deviation of the simulated climate parameter over the baseline period respectively and α obs m and σ obs m are the average and standard deviation of the observed climate parameter over the baseline period respectively the monthly future climate data of each meteorological station were subsequently disaggregated into daily values using the distribution of the daily output of the gcm from 2011 to 2100 and eq 11 11 α station d α gcm d α station m α gcm m for precipitation and windspeed α gcm d α station m α gcm m for air temperature where α station d is the future daily climate parameter of each meteorological station α gcm d is the daily simulated climate parameter of gcm and the subscript d represents the day the daily future climate parameters temperature precipitation and wind speed of the meteorological stations were interpolated into each model calculated cell to form the model forcing data according to the above interpolating algorithms 3 2 4 other data the land surface data and parameters are also required by the vic cas model including soil parameters e g soil field capacity saturated hydrologic conductivity and bulk density land use data e g vegetation types monthly albedo and leaf area index and topography the soil parameters were derived from the international geosphere biosphere program data and information system igbp dis which contains global data for soil properties and global maps of soil distributions global soil data task 2014 the vegetation types and parameters were obtained from a 1 km global land cover map provided by the university of maryland hansen et al 2000 the topography data for our study catchments were obtained from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model version 2 aster gdem v2 resolution 10 arc second which was used to classify the snow glacier elevation bands and digital river network monthly observed streamflow data at control stations of the selected study basins see table 2 for data periods were collected from the qinghai and tibetan hydrological bureau these discharge data were utilized to calibrate and validate the model 3 3 model calibration and assessment criteria the vic cas model was calibrated against the updated glacier distribution of the scgi and observed monthly discharge following a 2 step procedure i glacier simulation calibration and ii runoff generation calibration in this study all glaciers of each catchment were divided into four size classes 1 km2 1 5 km2 5 10 km2 and 10 km2 model calibration and validation were conducted in each glacier size class we used glacier data from the fcgi as the starting point of the simulation the glacier data from scgi were randomly separated into two parts in each size class half was used for model parameters ddfsnow ice rexp calibration and the other half was used for model validation in each catchment the ddfsnow ice and rexp were calibrated to minimize the objective function objg li et al 2014 liu et al 2015b 12 obj g 1 ns g 5 l n

soil layers d 1 d 2 d 3 and parameters related to baseflow ds dsmax and ws were calibrated against the observed monthly discharges from 1980 to 1985 for the us and from 1971 to 1990 for others based on data availability a similar objective function objr that is minimized during calibration was used as follows 15 obj r 1 ns r 5 l n 1 er r 2 where nsr and err are the nash sutcliffe efficiency and

area changes using the vic cas model forced by the downscaled outputs of gcms under two emission scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 we further compare our projected results with previous studies and discuss the uncertainties 4 1 vic cas model performance in our study to accurately estimate glacier and snow melt the glaciers were split into a number of glacier elevation bands with 100 m intervals while ice free land was divided into six snow elevation bands in each calculated unit to achieve a full modeling spin up the simulated period was started in 1961 and the simulated results after 1971 were used to calibrate and validate the model the vic cas model was successfully calibrated to reproduce the observed glacier area and monthly streamflow the values of theoptimized parameters are presented in table 5 comparisons between the simulated and observed glacier area from the scgi for calibration and validation sets during the same time period are shown in fig 4 the model achieved reasonably satisfactory results in terms of the mean ns r2 and er which were 0 77 0 81 and 0 4 for the calibration set and 0 76 0 81 and 1 7 for the validation set respectively table 6 the model overestimated the area of small glaciers 1 km2 with a larger relative bias 15 1 and 16 7 for the calibration and validation periods respectively but underestimated the area of larger glaciers with a smaller relative bias this phenomenon might be a consequence of the parameters of the glacier volume area scaling law which were obtained from the observations of worldwide glaciers with sizes ranging from 0 1 km2 to 1000 km2 grinsted 2013 previous studies bahr et al 2009 bahr 2011 have suggested that the estimated total volume from many glaciers is more accurate and the simulation accuracy depends on the amount of sampling data as well as sampling biases such as preferentially choosing larger glaciers over smaller glaciers in our study errors that overestimated small glaciers were offset by errors that underestimated large glaciers therefore the simulated error for the total area of glaciers was very low er 2 in our study catchment fig 5 shows the multi year average monthly observed and simulated discharge and table 7 summarizes the model performance for the five study catchments the model shows reasonably satisfactory simulated discharge with ns ranging from 0 82 to 0 94 r2 ranging from 0 82 to 0 94 and er ranging from 0 3 to 5 4 during the calibration period the calibrated model reproduced the observed streamflow satisfactorily during the validation period as indicated by the high mean ns and r2 and the low mean er values of 0 86 0 87 and 1 7 respectively hence the vic cas model is able to realistically simulate the glacier area change and discharge with relatively high accuracy given the large scale data scarcity heterogeneity and complexity of the five major upstream river basins on the tp 4 2 evaluation of the downscaling method in this study the dc v statistical downscaling method bouwer et al 2004 immerzeel et al 2012 was applied to bias correct raw gcm meteorological elements at the closest grid point to a given station so that climatological distribution of meteorological elements matched the observed distribution precipitation is the most important driver in hydrological models fig 6 a d compares the annual total precipitation time series and mean monthly precipitation of the raw gcm outputs bias corrected gcm results and meteorological station observations over 1980 2005 during which all stations have a continuous record the raw gcm results did not reproduce the observed pattern of the monthly cycle and significantly overestimated the magnitude of precipitation fig 6a and b after bias correction the accuracy of monthly mean precipitation was significantly improved fig 6d note that the bias corrected annual results are not expected to reproduce the actual annual time series fig 6c since the gcms did not use actual boundary conditions in the simulations hwang and graham 2013 to further evaluate the performance of the downscaling method a comparison was performed between the observed and simulated runoff using bias corrected gcm data from 1971 to 1999 in the ub and the results are shown in fig 6e f the simulated results using bias corrected data exactly reproduced the observed mean monthly runoff with er ranging from 0 4 to 6 2 fig 6f the observed annual time series of runoff could not be reproduced by simulation fig 6e overall the dc v downscaling method is feasible for bias correcting theraw gcm output for hydrological simulation and projection 4 3 historical and future climate change over the previous 40 years the annual average air temperaturehas showna significantincreasing trend in all five catchments the annual average air temperature across the entire study region has increased at an averagerateof0 42 cperdecade the model projections indicate that warming will continue through the late 21st century as expected scenario rcp4 5 is generally warmer than scenario rcp2 6 for all study basins fig 7 the multi model mean projects that the annual average temperature will increase by 2 0 2 5 c in the 2050 s 2051 2060 and 1 9 3 2 c in the 2090 s 2091 2100 in comparison to 1971 2010 under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 global emissions scenarios these values are equivalent to approximately 0 11 c for rcp2 6 and 0 31 c for rcp4 5 of warming per decade the precipitation showed different patterns for the five major upstream river basins over the past several decades due to different moisture sources overall the precipitationshowed a non apparent increasing trend except for the uye the annual precipitation showed increasing trends of 11 6 12 1 17 2 and 22 4 mm per decade in the uya um us and ub respectively however a decreasing trend of 1 7 mm per decade was found for the precipitation in the uye fig 7 the averages of the five gcms under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 for the 2050 s and 2090 s suggested that the five study catchments will experience an increasing annual precipitation fig 6 the mean precipitation across the five catchments is projected to increase by 6 6 14 3 mm per decade under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenarios compared to the baseline of 1971 2010 the multi model average annual precipitation is projected to increase by 12 1 25 3 13 1 25 4 in the 2050 s and 13 5 23 4 19 9 40 9 in the 2090 s for the five major upstream river basins under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenarios 4 4 hydrology responses to climate changes 4 4 1 fate of glaciers the glacier area revealed a significant decreasing trend in the uye 20 3 uya 15 6 um 34 4 us 37 3 and ub 32 7 over the past 40 years in general the glaciers shrank more rapidly in the western catchments of the tp the mean values of glacier area loss in the studied catchments uye uya um us and ub under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 between 2010 and 2060 were determined to be 39 6 45 6 53 8 57 6 82 5 84 8 67 2 69 9 and 52 3 58 3 respectively fig 8 and by the end of the 21st century the glacier area is projected to decline by 46 6 62 1 70 8 80 9 88 2 95 6 71 8 79 6 and 60 0 75 8 in the five catchments respectively the glacier retreat during thefirst halfof the21st century will be much faster than that during the latterhalfof the21st century the glaciers are located at a higher altitude region during the latterhalfof the21st century due to former shrinkage therefore the glacier area change is less sensitive to climate change in addition the annual mean air temperature is projected to reach a peak in the 2050 s under the rcp2 6 emission scenario fig 7 4 4 2 stream flow projections fig 9 displays the runoff projections with the five downscaled gcms according to the runoff separation results the total runoff depends marginally on the glacier melt in the uye 0 35 uya 3 7 um 1 3 us 4 4 and ub 5 5 due to limited glacier coverage fig 8 and table 2 our study shows that glacier runoff will increase in the uya at least until the 2020 s 2021 2030 and will begin to decrease after the 2030 s 2031 2040 fig 9 however glacier runoff in the uye um us and ub had exceeded its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century and more than 20 of glacier area loss occurred from 1971 to 2010 when the increasing melt rate due to higher air temperatures cannot compensate for the negative effect of glacier area loss on melt water glacier runoff will start to decline the multi model median results show that glacier runoff in the 2050 s will decline by 37 5 26 1 19 8 16 9 80 3 79 6 69 1 67 7 and 48 9 46 0 compared with the historical reference period 1971 2100 for the five catchments uye uya um us and ub respectively under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 global emission scenarios by the end of the century 2090 s the glacier runoff is predicted to decrease within each basin by up to 51 3 61 3 62 2 65 4 91 0 95 7 77 2 80 1 and 59 1 71 6 compared with the reference period respectively snowmelt runoff is an important component of the total runoff the historical simulation showed that the contribution of snowmelt runoff to the total runoff was 15 3 12 2 28 8 28 3 and 23 1 for the uye uya um us and ub respectively the snowmelt runoff is projected to increase in the five catchments until the 2020 s and to start to decrease after the 2030 s potentially owing to a decrease in the snowfall due to smaller snow precipitation ratio with the warming climate fig 9 in comparison to 1971 2010 a consistent increase in total runoff is projected for all the basins in the two periods 2050 s and 2090 s for which the increasing rainfall runoff that compensates for the loss of snow ice melt water is the major cause the total runoff in the 2050 s is projected to increase by 7 1 6 5 for the uye 26 4 12 2 for the uya 19 7 21 1 for the um 11 8 12 6 for the us and 21 8 16 8 for the ub under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenarios by the end of the 21st century 2090 s the total runoff will increase by 8 8 11 9 19 2 14 0 15 8 32 4 9 9 21 5 and 16 9 30 7 in the five respective basins same order as previous sentence for the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenarios respectively 4 4 3 seasonality of future runoff the seasonal cycle changes for each simulated runoff component from historical records and future predictions are shown in fig 10 by the end of this century the contribution of glacier runoff to total runoff will be negligible due to a large decrease in glacier area figs 8 and 10 positive snowmelt runoff changes are projected during the spring march may and late autumn october november for the uye uya us and ub indicating an earlier spring snow melt and delayed fall freeze up obvious negative snowmelt changes are observed during the summer june august for the five major upstream river basins which can be explained by decreased precipitation in the form of snowfall with the warming climate the rainfall runoff is predicted to increase during may june because of the increasing rainfall precipitation ratio the pattern of runoff is similar to that of precipitation for the five basins with 60 80 of the annual streamflow occurring from june september the annual hydrograph remains practically unchanged except for the uye where the total runoff peak is anticipated to occur 1 month earlier july june the shift can be explained by an earlier onset of spring snowmelt and an increase in the rainfall precipitation ratio in may june fig 10b and c the large positive total runoff changes are generally projected during the cold season january march and november december for the five major basins additionally the increased total runoff in the cold season is a major cause of the increase in total runoff the increasing rate of warm season may october streamflow was clearly less than that of the annual and cold seasons and a negative trend in warm season streamflow was even found with a slight increase in annual streamflow in the uye and uya fig 10 and table 8 the differences in streamflow change in the warm and cold season were most likely related to the degradation of permafrost soil which results in an increased infiltration during the warm season and greater water release during the cold season 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other models water resource management of glacierized catchments largely relies on glacio hydrological models that can estimate glacier meltwater contribution to streamflow and project future streamflow change however few current macroscale watershedmodels incorporate glacier modeling in macroscale applications radić and hock 2014 several studies have tried to couple the temperature index immerzeel et al 2010 luo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 su et al 2016 or energy balance kotlarski et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 glacier melt model to existing macroscale hydrological models such as the vic model soil and water assessment tool swat and snowmelt runoff model srm although the energy balance melt method more properly describes the physical processes determining melt the temperature index method is the most widely used approach to simulate snow ice melt the temperature index method often achieves better model performance than the energy balance method at the catchment scale because temperature is the least uncertain available climate variable hock 2003 2005 essery et al 2013 pellicciotti et al 2013 hence the temperature index method is most common and will retain its foremost position in snow ice melt estimating due to low data requirements and good performance in this study the extended degree day method considering the impact of the surface aspect on melt was coupled to vic model for both the current climate and future climate scenarios simulations of glacier area evolution are indispensable few studies at the local scales have incorporated simple area evolution schemes volume area scaling approach into hydrological models stahl et al 2008 luo et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 most previous studies luo et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 2015 consider all glaciers as whole to be simulated in a calculated unit and neglect the differences in mass balance and area change among different glaciers especially for glaciers of different sizes it is difficult to directly calibrate and validate models using glacier outlines derived from remote sensing data collected during several different time periods and the observed mass balance of individual glaciers which is necessary to reduce the uncertainty in hydrological simulations of larger glacierized catchments stahl et al 2008 huss et al 2008 konz and seibert 2010 duethmann et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2012 the vic cas model presented here attempts to incorporate these advances the model includes a representation of individual glaciers on the sub basin scale and simulates mass balance and area evolution for an individual glacier 5 2 necessity of model calibration using glacier change data most recent studies suggest that the main driver of future runoff change is the change in precipitation in the upstream regions of large river systems on the tp which is consistent with our findings table 1 however there is debate about the contributions and future trends of glacier melt water across three previous studies immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 which accounted for glacier hydrological processes using the degree day method ddfs are key parameters in the degree day melt model and differences among ddfs lead to different simulated contributions and future trends of glacier melt water however there are significant differences in the values of ddfs ddfsnow ranging from 4 0 to 4 8 mm c day 1 and ddfice ranging from 7 0 to 13 8 mm c day 1 among the previous studies which were obtained from limited observations of several glaciers su et al 2016 and calibration by comparing the simulated streamflow with observed records immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 ddfs from these limited observations maynotaccuratelyrepresent the average conditions of the large scale catchments because of the high spatial and temporal heterogeneities of ddfs ramanathan and carmichael 2008 furthermore it is difficult to obtain reliable ddfs through model calibration only based on streamflow due to inaccurate precipitation input fig 11 shows the vic cas model sensitivity to the ddf parameters in terms of the objective function of evaluating the performance of streamflow simulation objr and glacier runoff contribution during the calibration period the objr was less sensitive to ddfs than the glacier melt water contribution with an approximate change of 0 03 0 14 0 03 0 58 and 0 97 in objr for every 10 change in ddfs for the uye uya um us and ub respectively a 10 increase in ddfs will increase the glacier runoff contribution to streamflow by 2 3 4 6 1 2 1 8 and 1 6 for the five catchments respectively as shown in fig 11 the optimized value of ddfs calibrated only by in situ observed streamflow was 0 5 times ddfs0 the value of ddfs from the calibration by glacier area for the uye 1 0 times ddfs0 for the uya and 1 5 times ddfs0 for the um us and ub the differences between optimized values of ddfs through in situ observed streamflow and glacier area data were excluding the uya greater than 50 the uncertainties in total runoff simulation from ddfs were minimal because of the limited glacier melt water contribution in contrast the uncertainties in the glacier area and glacier runoff simulations associated with ddfs were considerably larger fig 12 illustrates the simulated and projected glacier area and glacier runoff change when ddfs increased or decreased by 50 increasing ddfs led to accelerated glacier area loss and decreased glacier meltwater in the 2050 s and 2090 s the ranges of simulated glacier runoff and glacier area change informed by different ddfs 0 5 ddfs 1 0 ddfs and 1 5 ddfs were also found to be very large a 50 change in degree day factors caused 35 0 169 1 37 1 172 5 and 36 3 217 5 43 1 332 2 differences in glacier area and 30 6 146 9 26 8 145 0 and 34 4 223 0 42 5 335 7 differences in glacier runoff for the five study catchments in the 2050 s and 2090 s under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenario respectively additionally glacier runoff reached a tipping point 10 30 years earlier or later when the ddfs increased or decreased by 50 thus observed glacier information must be used for model calibration to obtain more realistic ddfs the complex topography and observed data scarcity on the tp substantially limit melt model calibration via glacier mass balance which has usually been adopted in previous studies stahl et al 2008 huss et al 2008 konz and seibert 2010 immerzeel et al 2012 duethmann et al 2015 remote sensing glacier area data represent valuable alternatives to ground based observations for calibration on the tp because their spatially distributed patterns spatial resolution and availability are not significantly impacted by terrain 5 3 uncertainties in projections uncertainties in projections are attributable to the following 1 different model parameters and 2 the adopted global climate models global emission scenarios and downscaling approaches huss et al 2014 chiew et al 2010 the uncertainties in runoff simulations of the same catchments in our study generated by the vic hydrological model soil parameters have been discussed and analyzed by zhang et al 2013 and su et al 2016 their studies indicated that the uncertainties associated with model soil parameters are much smaller than those from climate change projections the uncertainties in the parameters c and γ of the volume area scaling law which is typically adopted to simulate glacier advance or retreat in a large scale catchment may represent an additional contribution except ddfs to uncertaintiesin glacier simulation there are many empirical parameters of the volume area scaling law grinsted 2013 the parameters of the scaling law from radić and hock 2010 were used by immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 and in our study while the parameters from liu et al 2003 were adopted by su et al 2016 we also compared the glacier area and glacier runoff simulations by adopting four recognized volume area scaling laws table 9 we found that huss s scaling law shows a relatively poor performance for glacier area compared with the other three methods which achieved a similarly effective model performance not shown our results reveal that the uncertainties in simulations of glacier runoff and glacier area change from the four volume area scaling laws are small with mean uncertainties of less than 4 0 and 5 0 respectively fig 13 additionally there isalmost no difference between the simulationsthat adopt grinsted s radić s and liu s scaling laws the uncertainties in ddfs are considered to be the major source of uncertainties in the glacier area and glacier melt water projections generally the spread in gcms results accounts for the high percentage of overall uncertainty in the projected results teng et al 2012 immerzeel et al 2013 huss et al 2014 barria et al 2015a b peel et al 2015 although 5 gcms with projections closest to the mean values of 19 gcms were selected the ranges in future annual precipitation and mean air temperature projections downscaled from the selected gcms were found to be very large the changes in projected mean annual precipitation range from 10 3 to 29 6 8 3 32 9 and 3 8 to 33 0 16 2 43 2 and the temperature vary from 1 7 to 2 4 2 0 3 1 c and 1 2 to 2 4 2 5 3 8 c in comparison to the reference period for our study basins in the 2050 s and 2090sunder the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenario respectively fig 6 the ranges of the projected annual total runoffs informed by the 5 gcms were considerably large with an average relativestandard deviation standard deviation divided by the mean of 4 9 9 9 and 11 1 10 1 for the uye 21 0 21 4 and 17 6 23 8 for the uya 14 2 9 4 and 15 8 15 9 for the um 5 6 13 3 and 14 8 16 7 for the us and 8 3 10 8 and 17 3 15 0 for the ub in the 2050 s and 2090 s under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenario respectively fig 9 the spread of future climate and runoff projected results was even larger for certain seasons the uncertainties in glacier projections with different climate changes from the five gcms were also very apparent with an average relative standard deviation of 15 8 14 0 for glacier runoff and 13 0 12 6 for glacier area across our study catchments under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenario the choice of downscaling method is also an important source of uncertainty in hydrological projections schmidli et al 2007 segui et al 2010 the delta change dc and dc v statistical downscaling methods are widely used in streamflow projections immerzeel et al 2010 2012 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 almost no differences were observed between the modeled mean climate data of the metrological stations over the baseline period 1971 2005 using the two downscaling methods in addition the modeled data matched the measured values well not shown the average annual hydrographs of streamflow simulated using downscaled historical gcm data adopting the dc v and dc methods from 1971 to 1999 in the ub are shown in fig 14 a the simulation results using the two downscaled data are clearly close to the observations thus supporting the reasonability of the downscaled historical and projected downscaled series it is also difficult to judge which downscaling method can provide more realistic future climate projections because there is very little bias between the simulated historical streamflow sets there are only small differences between the projected climate series from the two downscaled methods with an average bias of 0 27 0 39 c for annual mean air temperature and 16 7 20 5 mm for annual precipitation under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 scenario across our study catchments fig 14b the differences in two projected future climate sets resulted in a mean bias of 7 5 9 8 6 1 6 1 and 3 2 3 7 for projected mean streamflow glacier runoff and glacier area under the two emission scenarios respectively fig 14c and d overall gcms are the dominantsourceofuncertaintyfor projecting the streamflow while ddfs are considered to be the largest source of uncertainty for glacier area and glacier meltwater projections therefore glacier information must be used for model parameters calibration to effectively reduce the uncertainty in glacier projections although the uncertainties in glacier and stream projections are very apparent the future runoff will likely increase due to increased precipitation while glacier runoff is likely to reach its tipping point as a result of the rapid shrinkageofglacierswith climatewarming 5 4 consequences of changes in the cryosphere and streamflow glaciers are expectedto keepshrinking because of increasing air temperature although the contributions of glacier meltwater to streamflow are very limited in our study catchments the role of glaciers in the regulation of streamflow should not be neglected especially during the warm season representing the peak period of water demand as shown in fig 15 an obvious negative relationship occurred between glacier runoff and streamflow in the warm season for the five catchments which indicates less glacier meltwater during wet years and more glacier meltwater during arid years this phenomenon is commonly referred to as the glacier compensation effect zhao et al 2015 in the extreme dry warm season the glacier runoff contribution can reach 9 15 in the uya us and ub where the contribution of glacier meltwater to the annual streamflow is less than 6 fig 15b d and e with the retreating glaciers the role of glaciers in streamflow regulation will diminishor even completelydisappear which will increase the risk of drought to hamper downstream agricultural activities over the next century the permafrost is expected to degrade as the thawing depth continues to increase because of the increasing air temperature during the warm season fig 16 a and c a significantnegative relationship was observed between the runoff coefficient and thawing depth of the permafrost area fig 16b and d in the uye thus the permafrost degradation and increase in thawing depth will allow for greater infiltration and water storage during the warm season leading to a subsequent reduction of the runoff coefficient fig 16a and c warming of the soil temperature will also lead to the formation of unfrozen zones within the permafrost thus providing more baseflow in the cold season fig 9 this phenomenon has also been reported by niu et al 2011 for rivers on the tp and ye et al 2009 for arctic rivers cold season discharge is expected to substantially increase due to the permafrost soil degradation and earlier snow ice melt whereas the warm season discharge may decrease if increases inprecipitationarenot sufficientto offset the decrease in the runoff coefficient and reduced snow ice meltwater fig 10c and f in general the water demand for agriculture is expected to increase due to higher temperatures such changes in streamflow may reduce the water supply for warm season downstream agriculture which will have a considerable effect on food security thus even more balanced water resource management will be required 6 conclusions in this work we coupled glacier melting enhanced degree day and glacier evolution volume area scaling law schemes to the macroscale vic hydrological model the extended hydrological model named vic cas can explicitly simulate glacier retreat or advance and all major cryospheric hydrological processes therefore it is suitable for hydrological simulation on the tp to reduce uncertainties in simulations from model parameters a progressive two stage calibration strategy that jointly uses the remotely sensed glacier area and in situ observed streamflow data was adopted to acquire more reliable model parameters this model was applied to assess the climate change impacts on hydrology and project future change in the upstream regimes of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra rivers on the tp the following major conclusions are drawn 1 the extended vic cas model allows an accurate simulation of both river flow and glacier evolution in the five large cryospheric catchments on the tp through the two stage calibration strategy 2 the climate change analysis based on downscaled data from the five different gcms suggests that the annual mean air temperature is projected to increase by 0 11 0 31 c per decade and precipitation by 6 6 14 3 mm per decade under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 global emission scenarios 3 with climate warming glaciers are projected to retreat steadily the results show that relative to 2010 the glacier area in 2100 will decline by 46 6 62 1 70 8 80 9 88 2 95 6 71 8 79 6 and 60 0 75 8 for the uye uya um us and ub respectively glacier runoff is projected to start to decline in the uya after the 2030 s while glacier runoff was already beyond its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century in uye um us and ub with the occurrence of greater than 20 glacier area loss from 1971 to 2010 4 although large uncertainties are observed in the projections due to a high degree of uncertainty in future climate change from gcms annual streamflow is expected to increase due to an increase in rainfall runoff which compensates for the expected decrease in glacier and snow melt water the annual hydrograph remains unchanged except for the uye where the peak streamflow will occur 1 month earlier because of earlier snowmelt and increased the rainfall precipitation ratios due to the increase in thawing depth and earlier snow ice melt the cold season streamflow is projected to substantially increase however the warm season streamflow may decrease if the increases inprecipitationarenot sufficientto offset the reduced warm season

6500,analyzing the impacts of climate change on hydrology and future projections of water supplies is fundamental for the efficient management and planning of water resources in large river systems on the tibetan plateau tp which is known as the water tower of asia however large uncertainties remain in the projections of streamflow and glaciers in these cryospheric catchments due to great uncertainties in climate change projection and modeling processes in this work we developed an extended variable infiltration capacity vic macroscale hydrological model named vic cas which was coupled with glacier melting and glacier evolution schemes a two stage calibration procedure that used glacier inventory data and the observed streamflow was adopted to derive the model parameters the calibrated vic cas model was then used to assess the future change in glaciers and runoff using downscaled climate model data in the upstream regimes of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra rivers on the tp the results indicated that both temperature and precipitation were projected to increase resulting in a greater than 50 decline of the glacier area by the end of the 21st century in the five catchments glacier runoff was already beyond its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century with a greater than 20 loss of the glacier area except in the upstream of the yangtze river where glacier runoff was projected to decrease after the 2030 s annual streamflow was projected to increase significantly as a result of increased rainfall induced runoff compensating for the reduced glacier snow melt water in the five major upstream river basins the increasing rate of warm season streamflow was clearly less than that of annual runoff a negative trend in warm season streamflow was expected if precipitation did not sufficiently increase the annual hydrograph remained largely unchanged except in the upstream of the yellow river where peak streamflow was predicted to occur 1 month earlier because of the earlier snowmelt and greater rainfall precipitation ratio from may to june keywords climate change vic cas model glaciers streamflow tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp is commonly known as earth s third pole because it possesses both the largest and highest plateaus and covers an area of 2 5 106 km2 with a mean elevation of 4500 m a s l above sea level due to the uniquely complex terrain and high altitude the tp is the largest permafrost region 1 5 106 km2 that exists at a mid low latitude ye et al 2013 and contains the largest number of glaciers approximately 4 9873 km2 outside of the polar regions liu et al 2015a the tp also called the asian water tower contains the headwaters of several major asian rivers which support nearly two billion people nearly 25 of the world s population huang et al 2012 over the last several decades the surface air temperature over the tp has increased at a faster rate than that on average

melting river runoff will initially increase as a result of more meltwater but eventually decrease due to the loss of glacier area on the tp yao et al 2004 ye et al 2007 2008 gao et al 2012 immerzeel et al 2010 2012 shi et al 2016 according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report ipccar5 the air temperature over the tp is expected to increase by 1 9 c and 4 3 c by the end of the 21st century under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios respectively su et al 2013 glaciers in the tp are likely to recede and the volume of glacier meltwater may dwindle in some watersheds immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 the near surface permafrost area is projected to decrease by 46 81 on the tp by the end of the 21st century nan et al 2005 lawrence and slater 2005 guo and wang 2012 therefore it is essential to quantify the potential effects of future climate changes on the discharges of major large rivers originating from the tp which will benefit from water resource management for sustainable development on the tp and in downstream regions numerous studies have been conducted to quantitatively investigate the impacts of climate change on hydrological processes on the tp in recent years rees and collins 2006 fujita et al 2007 li et al 2010 2013 2014 tahir et al 2011 gao et al 2012 2015 immerzeel et al 2010 2012 jeelani et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 among these studies several have focused on projecting future hydrological processes on the tp at the scale of large catchments or river basins using hydrological models determined by the output of global climate models gcms some of which are listed in table 1 additionally only a small number of studies have accounted for glacier melt and the response retreat and advance processes to climate change immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 and in others the glaciers were completely ignored lu et al 2018 liu et al 2011 2015b li et al 2013 2014 although these three studies provide important insights into the future changes in the streamflow and glaciers on the tp there has been a strong debate regarding the future trend of the streamflow due to inconsistently simulated contributions and trends of glacier meltwater immerzeel et al 2010 stated that the streamflow will likely decrease by the mid century due to reductions in glacier meltwater in the upper yangtze brahmaputra ganges and indus basins however they also highlighted a notable increase in runoff of the upper yellow basin which depends only marginally on glacier melt and increasing precipitation lutz et al 2014 projected an increase in runoff until at least 2050 due to the increasing precipitation at the expense of glacier runoff in the upper mekong salween brahmaputra and ganges basins and accelerated glacier melt in the upper indus basin su et al 2016 indicated that the discharge of six major upstream river basins yellow yangtze salween mekong brahmaputra and indus would remain moderately elevated in the near term 2011 2040 and increase by 2 7 22 4 in the long term 2041 2070 as a result of increasing precipitation and glacier meltwater and the accelerated glacier melt is considered to be the main cause for the increased runoff in the brahmaputra and indus basins large variability and uncertainty is clearly evident in the projections of runoff and glaciers obtained via different models and model parameters for the same study catchment on the tp a suitable hydrological model and an effective model parameter estimation approach are prerequisites for the successful projections of hydrological processes chen et al 2017a moradkhani et al 2005 hydrological models are a fundamental tool for quantitatively investigating and projecting hydrological processes and the model schemes for snow ice melt glacier response and soil freezingandthawing should be involved in simulating the hydrological conditions over the tp three hydrological models with glacier melt degree day method and glacier response volume area scaling law schemes namely the snowmelt runoff model srm the spatial processes in hydrology model sphy and the vic glacier model were applied to simulate and project hydrological processes at the large catchment scale on the tp immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 the specified relationship between glacier volume and glacier area was used to solve the changes in glacier area based on the simulated mean mass balance for glaciers in each size class lutz et al 2014 or in the basin immerzeel et al 2010 su et al 2016 the differentsensitivities to climate change among glaciers of different sizes have been ignored in simulations of the glacier area change at the basin scale larger glaciers have a smaller surface area to volume ratio so they are less sensitive to climate change than smaller glaciers van de wal and wild 2001 immerzeel et al 2012 another key issue is the oversight of thehydrologicaleffects offrozen soil in the srm and sphy models although the exclusion of the frozen soil hydrological processes could induce large errors in catchments on the tp due to the wide extent of frozen soil cuo et al 2015 hydrological models usually contain a large number of parameters that cannot be measured directly but instead are inferred by model calibration which adjusts the parameter values to fit the simulated runoff compared to the observations however a good model performance in streamflow simulations does not guarantee the reliable reproduction of other hydrological variables for example the underestimation of mountainous precipitation can be compensated by the overestimation of glacier meltwater and vice versa which has been called the effect of error compensation stahl et al 2008 schaefli and huss 2011 duethmann et al 2014 therefore more observed hydrological variables must be accounted for multi objective calibration especially for glacier snow fed catchments stahl et al 2008 shrestha et al 2014 chen et al 2017a b for hydrological simulations in glacierized catchments some recent studies have jointly used the observed glacier mass balances and in situ runoff for model calibration to provide more realistic results stahl et al 2008 huss et al 2008 konz and seibert 2010 duethmann et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2012 on the data scarce tp the degree day method has been widely adopted to simulate glacier melting the snow ice degree day factors ddfs are the most essential parameters and variations in these factors lead to significant changes in simulated glacier meltwater contributions to streamflow and trends in glacier runoff in the future zhao et al 2015 huss et al 2014 however glacier observations have not been considered for the model parameter calibration and validation in previous studies on hydrological projections at the large basin scale on the tp immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 in such a region with large uncertainties in precipitation data this oversight can lead to unrealistic or incorrect conclusions concerning glacier meltwater in this study a vic cas model coupled with glacier melting and glacier response schemes was developed within the framework of the vicmacroscale hydrologic model which is a well established distributed land surface hydrological model with frozen soil and snow schemes a two stage calibration strategy was adopted to calibrate the model parameters first the parameters of glacier melting were calibrated using the chinese glacier inventory cgi data and second the hydrological processes were optimized using the observed streamflow in the five major upstream river basins yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra on the tp the calibrated vic cas model was then forced with the downscaled gcm outputs to project future changes in runoff components and glaciers under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 global emission scenarios in the five study catchments 2 description of the study area the upstream regions of the yellow river uye yangtze river uya mekong river um salween river us and brahmaputra river ub on the tp were selected as the study area fig 1 the selected basin characteristics are listed in table 2 the five catchments cover an area of 5 97 104 km2 which is approximately a quarter of the area of the tp above 2000 m a s l the study basins are dominated by the asianmonsoon system during the summer tong et al 2014 nearly two thirds of the annual precipitation occurs during the warm season from april to september with increasing precipitation observed from northwest to southeast wang et al 2018 the topography of the basins is highly variable with the elevation gradually increasing from the southeast to northwest moreover the vegetation also exhibits clear horizontal variation characteristics with forests located in the southeastern areas and grasslands steppes presenting in both the northern and western areas song et al 2004 cui and graf 2009 which is caused by the topographical and climatic characteristics according to the first chinese glacier inventory fcgi the glacier coverage of the five study catchments is less than 3 the ub has the largest glacier area approximately 4261 km2 2 1 of the ub basin and the uye has the lowest glacier coverage approximately 129 km2 only 0 1 of the basin area previous studies zhang et al 2013 su et al 2016 have suggested that the contribution of glacier meltwater to stream runoff is small in the selected hydrological stations of the five catchments due to limited glacierization table 2 however the role of glacier meltwater is very important to the upstream tributaries of the study catchments where glacier meltwater accounts for 32 of the river runoff in the tuotuo river basin a tributary of the yangtze river zhang et al 2008 it should also be noted that permafrost occurs across an area of 29 60 104 km2 and accounts for approximately half of the surface area of our study catchments even in the lowest permafrost watershed ub the permafrost area reaches up to 6 7 104 km2 accounting for 32 7 of the basin area thus the frozen soil hydrological processes should not be neglected in the hydrological simulation of the catchments 3 data and methodology 3 1 vic cas model description the degree day method and glacier volume area scaling law were coupled to the vic model version 4 2 d to simulate glacier melt and glacier area change based on our previous studies zhao et al 2013 2015 zhang et al 2012 gao et al 2017a b the glacier mass balance was calculated on a daily time step while the glacier area was updated on an annual time step 3 1 1 brief description of the vic model the vic model is a physically based large scale distributed land surface hydrological model liang et al 1996 and it is used to calculate full energy and water budgets within each grid cell at daily or sub daily time steps considering the snow accumulation snow melt and soil freeze and thaw processes liang et al 1996 nijssen et al 2001 cherkauer and lettenmaier 2003 elsner et al 2010 gao et al 2009 the model has been widely applied in regional and global hydrological studies at a spatial resolution between 1 8 and 2 nijssen et al 2001 dan et al 2012 hidalgo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 elsner et al 2014 su et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 2015 the vic model can be forced by either daily or sub daily meteorological data daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and daily average windspeed data are required to run the model so that the vic model can be used for discharge simulations in the data scarce mountain watersheds 3 1 2 glacier schemes 3 1 2 1 setting model calculated unit the vic model usually adopts the rectangular grid as a calculated cell and runs within each cell independently the model settings may place a glacier in two different cells making it difficult to obtain each glacier mass balance and thus calculate the glacier area change because the volume area scaling relation is only suitable for individual or several glaciers and not for a part of a glacier considering the ridge lines are usually boundaries of glaciers and sub basins we adopted the sub basin as a model calculated unit to localize each glacier in a separate calculated unit fig 2 3 1 2 2 fraction of glacier coverage to account for mountain glacier melt and its influence on hydrology a new land cover type designated glacier was introduced into the calculated unit mosaic of the vic model in addition to ice free land glaciers usually form in higher elevation zones with lower air temperatures and higher relative humidity for accurate estimation of glacier melting glaciers were subdivided into intervals of 100 m by sets of elevation bands called glacier bands within a model calculated unit the mean elevation of each glacier band was generated from high resolution digital elevation model dem data the fraction of the calculated unit covered by each glacier at each glacier band was calculated based on glacier outlines and dem data fig 3 to consider the impact of the surface aspect on glacier melt the mean cosine of the surface aspect for each glacier within each elevation band was calculated fig 3 3 1 2 3 atmospheric sub grid variability for glaciers in this study the mean elevation of each glacier band was used to lapse the ice free zone mean temperature and precipitation in the calculated unit to obtain more accurate local estimates according to the following algorithm 1 t band t 0 t alt m e band e 0 2 p band p 0 1 p alt m e band e 0 p 0 m where tband and pband are the daily mean air temperature c and precipitation mm in the glacier elevation band respectively t0 and p0 are the daily mean air temperature c and precipitation mm of ice free land in the calculated unit respectively eband and e0 are the mean elevations m of the glacier band and the ice free land in the calculated unit respectively talt m and palt m are the respective corresponding monthly temperature lapse rate c m 1 and precipitation gradient mm m 1 p0 m is the mean corresponding monthly precipitation mm of ice free land in the calculated unit within the historical time period when we calculated the precipitation gradient and the subscript m represents the month if the calculated pband is less than zero then the value of pband is set to zero 3 1 2 4 glacier melting and area evolution model during the past several decades energy balance and temperature index methods have been developed and widely used to simulate glacier melt around the world hock 2005 hock and holmgren 2005 zhang et al 2012 although the energy balance models have a solid physical basis they are often difficult to apply in data scarce mountain catchments where the data required for the model are not always available the simple temperature index or degree day approaches are widely used to estimate snow ice melt with sufficient accuracy for most purposes due to the readily availability of air temperature data and computational simplicity huss et al 2008 carenzo et al 2009 macdougall et al 2011 gao et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 in this study we adopted the extended degree day algorithms to calculate glacier melt in each glacier band considering the exposure dependence of the degree day factor on the surface aspect konz et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 3 m i b a n d ddf snow i c e 1 r exp cosasp i b a n d t band t band 0 0 0 t band 0 0 where mi band is the total melt of snow ice mm for glacier i in the bandth glacier band ddfsnow ice is the degree day factor for snow ice mm c 1 day 1 rexp is the factor quantifying the aspect dependence of ddfsnow ice and cosaspi band is the mean cosine of the surface aspect for glacier i within the elevation band the key element of the glacier scheme is the simulation of glacier retreat or advance there are two main approaches for simulating the glacier area evolution themost physicallyrigorousmethod is the numerical ice flow models however this approach requires detailed information on the glacier surface and bed geometry therefore is not well suited for extensive data scarce regions hence the simple volume area scaling approach has been widely applied to simulate changes in glacier area based on the simulated mass balance radić et al 2007 stahl et al 2008 raper and braithwaite 2006 immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 in this study the glacier area evolution was simulated by combining the simulated mass balance with the volume area scaling law which was derived from the measured size of alpine glaciers around the globe liu et al 2003 raper and braithwaite 2005 kotlarski et al 2010 grinsted 2013 4 v c a γ 5 a v c 1 γ where v and a are the glacier volume km3 and area km2 of each glacier in the model calculated unit respectively and the constant c 0 0365 and dimensionless scaling coefficient γ 1 375 were obtained from radić and hock 2010 the initial glacier volume and average glacier thickness were estimated from the initial glacier area using eqs 4 and 5 the volume of each glacier was updated by adding the calculated change in volume which was determined from the annual mass balance on september 30 the end date of the hydrological year every year the new glacier area anew was computed using the volume area scaling law eq 5 the area change of each glacier δ a was computed as follows 6 δ a a new a old then the area fraction of each glacier in the elevation bands was adjusted followed by the change in glacier area we assume that the glacier advances or retreats in the lowest glacier elevation band first which has been shown to be reasonable by analyses of the spatial changes in glaciers from 1999 and 2004 in the western himalaya berthier et al 2007 when the glacier retreats the glacier area of the lowest band shrinks if the calculated shrinking area of the glacier is greater than that of the glacier in the lowest elevation band then the glacier area of the lowest band will be set to zero and the glacier area in the neighboring upper elevation band will be decreased to the remaining area in contrast when the glacier advances the glacier area of the lowest glacierized band will be increased however the increasing glacier area in the lowest glacierized elevation band is limited by the maximum capacity which is set to the initial input glacier area except for the initial lowest elevation band if the calculated increasing glacier area is sufficiently great the neighboring lower elevation band will need to be included we adopted a glacier adjusted method similar to that used by möller and schneider 2010 and zhang et al 2012 3 1 3 routing scheme the separate lohmann routing module lohmann et al 1996 1998 was used as a postprocessor in the vic model package for the routing of streamflow from the land surface simulation of grid cells in this study the land surface simulation was modified on a sub basin scale to use the lohmann routing model to calculate streamflow some modifications in code and input data were necessary first sub basins were identified using the pfafstetter coding system which determines the routing order of the sub basins and contains topographic information of the river network within a given sub basin geographic informationsystem softwarewas used to calculate the area and downstream distance to the outlet of the sub basin along the flow direction finally the modified lohmann routing model was used to calculate the water recharge from each sub basin to the outlet of the river basin from the land surface simulation area routing order and routing distance of the sub basins 3 2 data description 3 2 1 glacier data the fcgi and second chinese glacier inventory scgi have been completed and released by the cold and arid region environmental and engineering research institute of the chinese academy of sciences careeri the fcgi was completed based on topographical maps and aerial photographs acquired from the 1960s to 1980s shi et al 2009 among which the most photographs were acquired in the 1970s the scgi was compiled based on remote sensing images after 2004 including landsat tm etm and aster images and srtm digital elevation models liu et al 2015a guo et al 2015 the scgi covers 86 of the glacierized area of china the remaining regions are mainly located on the southeastern tp which covers part of the southern region of the upstream part of the salween river and brahmaputra river the spatial distribution of glaciers from the fcgi was used to calculate the initial glacier input data the updated glacier distribution datasets of scgi were used to calibrate and validate the glacier model parameters including degree day factors ddfsnow ice and the factor quantifying the aspect dependence rexp of the ddfsnow ice 3 2 2 interpolation of meteorological forcing data daily atmospheric data maximum minimum and mean temperatures precipitation as well as wind speed are required to force the vic cas model the observed meteorological dataset of 54 national meteorological stations inside or around our study catchments fig 1 was used for the daily spatial interpolation these weather stations lie between latitudes 27 44 n and 36 47 n and longitudes 81 15 e and 102 58 e with a wide elevation range spanning from 2085 m to 4800 m the data were collected from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration and consisted of daily values from january 1961 to december 2010 the dataset was created from in situobservations applying firm quality control including internal temporal and spatial consistency checks homogeneity tests and potential outlier detection feng et al 2004 ding et al 2008 the dataset was also regarded as the most credible meteorological dataset in china all selected stations have records longer than 30 years and 43 stations have acquired continuous daily data over the 40 year period from 1971 to 2010 temperature and precipitation have considerable spatial variations due to the effects of geographical factors different water vapor sources and the climate dominated area in these large scale catchments on tp su et al 2016 in this study the gradient plus inverse distance squared gids algorithm was employed to interpolate the air temperature and precipitation data considering the different effects of geographical factors latitude longitude and elevation price et al 2000 7 t 0 i 1 n 1 d i 2 1 i 1 n 1 d i 2 t i t alt m e 0 e i t lat m lat 0 lat i t lon m lon 0 lon i 8 p 0 i 1 n 1 d i 2 1

inverse distance squared method 9 w 0 i 1 n 1 d i 2 1 i 1 n 1 d i 2 w i where w 0 is the daily wind speed at the model calculated unit m s and wi is the daily observed wind speed at a neighboring weather station i m s considering the remarkable differences in water vapor transport among the five catchments cuo et al 2013 gao et al 2014 guo et al 2016 the air temperature and precipitation gradients were computed individually for each catchment a multiple linear regression analysis was used to calculate the gradients from the observations and geographical factors of meteorological stations inside and adjacent to the catchment table 3 summarizes the monthly precipitation gradients in response to elevation longitude and latitude the spatial distribution of our calculated precipitation vertical gradients is similar to that from previous studies guo et al 2016 cuo and zhang 2017 previous studies revealed that precipitation vertical gradients during the wet season may september ranged from 1 9 to 26 1 mm 100 m over the tp the gradients in our study 0 82 to 13 5 mm 100 m are within this range the differences in values may reflect that previous studies only considered the effects of elevation on precipitation guo et al 2016 cuo and zhang 2017 3 2 3 gcm data and downscaling the latest generation of gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 was used as climate change forcing data for our hydrological model the performance of gcms is not uniformly consistent within a given large geographical region due to differences in parameterization and physical processes miao et al 2012 liu et al 2015b we selected nineteen gcms with better performance over the tp based on previous studies li et al 2014 su et al 2013 hu et al 2014 and analyzed the mean projected changes in annual air temperature and precipitation between 1971 2006 and 2041 2070 from these gcms for the rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios not shown then five gcms that were closest to the mean value were selected for our studies table 4 the daily historical and future temperature precipitation and wind speed simulations of the five gcms were obtained from the centre for environmental data analysis however the spatial resolutions of the gcms outputs were too coarse to directly drive the hydrological model thus requiring them to be downscaled the dc v method bouwer et al 2004 immerzeel et al 2012 is a statistically downscaled method in which the gcm data are corrected not only against the average observed climate but also for the observed variance in this study the dc v statistically downscaled method was adopted to yield the daily future meteorological data for each meteorological station based on the historical station observations and simulations of gcms during the baseline period 1971 2005 the future monthly values for each meteorological station from 2011 to 2100 were first calculated from the simulated value of gcm according to the following equation 10 α station m α gcm m α gcm m σ obs m σ gcm m α obs m where α station m is the future corrected climate parameter total precipitation or average temperature in a particular month m for each meteorological station α gcm m is the uncorrected simulated climate parameter from gcm α gcm m and σ g c m m are the average and standard deviation of the simulated climate parameter over the baseline period respectively and α obs m and σ obs m are the average and standard deviation of the observed climate parameter over the baseline period respectively the monthly future climate data of each meteorological station were subsequently disaggregated into daily values using the distribution of the daily output of the gcm from 2011 to 2100 and eq 11 11 α station d α gcm d α station m α gcm m for precipitation and windspeed α gcm d α station m α gcm m for air temperature where α station d is the future daily climate parameter of each meteorological station α gcm d is the daily simulated climate parameter of gcm and the subscript d represents the day the daily future climate parameters temperature precipitation and wind speed of the meteorological stations were interpolated into each model calculated cell to form the model forcing data according to the above interpolating algorithms 3 2 4 other data the land surface data and parameters are also required by the vic cas model including soil parameters e g soil field capacity saturated hydrologic conductivity and bulk density land use data e g vegetation types monthly albedo and leaf area index and topography the soil parameters were derived from the international geosphere biosphere program data and information system igbp dis which contains global data for soil properties and global maps of soil distributions global soil data task 2014 the vegetation types and parameters were obtained from a 1 km global land cover map provided by the university of maryland hansen et al 2000 the topography data for our study catchments were obtained from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model version 2 aster gdem v2 resolution 10 arc second which was used to classify the snow glacier elevation bands and digital river network monthly observed streamflow data at control stations of the selected study basins see table 2 for data periods were collected from the qinghai and tibetan hydrological bureau these discharge data were utilized to calibrate and validate the model 3 3 model calibration and assessment criteria the vic cas model was calibrated against the updated glacier distribution of the scgi and observed monthly discharge following a 2 step procedure i glacier simulation calibration and ii runoff generation calibration in this study all glaciers of each catchment were divided into four size classes 1 km2 1 5 km2 5 10 km2 and 10 km2 model calibration and validation were conducted in each glacier size class we used glacier data from the fcgi as the starting point of the simulation the glacier data from scgi were randomly separated into two parts in each size class half was used for model parameters ddfsnow ice rexp calibration and the other half was used for model validation in each catchment the ddfsnow ice and rexp were calibrated to minimize the objective function objg li et al 2014 liu et al 2015b 12 obj g 1 ns g 5 l n

efficiency and relative bias of four glacier size classes respectively in the second stage the key soil parameters related to runoff i e variable infiltration curve parameter b thickness of the three soil layers d 1 d 2 d 3 and parameters related to baseflow ds dsmax and ws were calibrated against the observed monthly discharges from 1980 to 1985 for the us and from 1971 to 1990 for others based on data availability a similar objective function objr that is minimized during calibration was used as follows 15 obj r 1 ns r 5 l n 1 er r 2 where nsr and err are the nash sutcliffe efficiency and

area changes using the vic cas model forced by the downscaled outputs of gcms under two emission scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 we further compare our projected results with previous studies and discuss the uncertainties 4 1 vic cas model performance in our study to accurately estimate glacier and snow melt the glaciers were split into a number of glacier elevation bands with 100 m intervals while ice free land was divided into six snow elevation bands in each calculated unit to achieve a full modeling spin up the simulated period was started in 1961 and the simulated results after 1971 were used to calibrate and validate the model the vic cas model was successfully calibrated to reproduce the observed glacier area and monthly streamflow the values of theoptimized parameters are presented in table 5 comparisons between the simulated and observed glacier area from the scgi for calibration and validation sets during the same time period are shown in fig 4 the model achieved reasonably satisfactory results in terms of the mean ns r2 and er which were 0 77 0 81 and 0 4 for the calibration set and 0 76 0 81 and 1 7 for the validation set respectively table 6 the model overestimated the area of small glaciers 1 km2 with a larger relative bias 15 1 and 16 7 for the calibration and validation periods respectively but underestimated the area of larger glaciers with a smaller relative bias this phenomenon might be a consequence of the parameters of the glacier volume area scaling law which were obtained from the observations of worldwide glaciers with sizes ranging from 0 1 km2 to 1000 km2 grinsted 2013 previous studies bahr et al 2009 bahr 2011 have suggested that the estimated total volume from many glaciers is more accurate and the simulation accuracy depends on the amount of sampling data as well as sampling biases such as preferentially choosing larger glaciers over smaller glaciers in our study errors that overestimated small glaciers were offset by errors that underestimated large glaciers therefore the simulated error for the total area of glaciers was very low er 2 in our study catchment fig 5 shows the multi year average monthly observed and simulated discharge and table 7 summarizes the model performance for the five study catchments the model shows reasonably satisfactory simulated discharge with ns ranging from 0 82 to 0 94 r2 ranging from 0 82 to 0 94 and er ranging from 0 3 to 5 4 during the calibration period the calibrated model reproduced the observed streamflow satisfactorily during the validation period as indicated by the high mean ns and r2 and the low mean er values of 0 86 0 87 and 1 7 respectively hence the vic cas model is able to realistically simulate the glacier area change and discharge with relatively high accuracy given the large scale data scarcity heterogeneity and complexity of the five major upstream river basins on the tp 4 2 evaluation of the downscaling method in this study the dc v statistical downscaling method bouwer et al 2004 immerzeel et al 2012 was applied to bias correct raw gcm meteorological elements at the closest grid point to a given station so that climatological distribution of meteorological elements matched the observed distribution precipitation is the most important driver in hydrological models fig 6 a d compares the annual total precipitation time series and mean monthly precipitation of the raw gcm outputs bias corrected gcm results and meteorological station observations over 1980 2005 during which all stations have a continuous record the raw gcm results did not reproduce the observed pattern of the monthly cycle and significantly overestimated the magnitude of precipitation fig 6a and b after bias correction the accuracy of monthly mean precipitation was significantly improved fig 6d note that the bias corrected annual results are not expected to reproduce the actual annual time series fig 6c since the gcms did not use actual boundary conditions in the simulations hwang and graham 2013 to further evaluate the performance of the downscaling method a comparison was performed between the observed and simulated runoff using bias corrected gcm data from 1971 to 1999 in the ub and the results are shown in fig 6e f the simulated results using bias corrected data exactly reproduced the observed mean monthly runoff with er ranging from 0 4 to 6 2 fig 6f the observed annual time series of runoff could not be reproduced by simulation fig 6e overall the dc v downscaling method is feasible for bias correcting theraw gcm output for hydrological simulation and projection 4 3 historical and future climate change over the previous 40 years the annual average air temperaturehas showna significantincreasing trend in all five catchments the annual average air temperature across the entire study region has increased at an averagerateof0 42 cperdecade the model projections indicate that warming will continue through the late 21st century as expected scenario rcp4 5 is generally warmer than scenario rcp2 6 for all study basins fig 7 the multi model mean projects that the annual average temperature will increase by 2 0 2 5 c in the 2050 s 2051 2060 and 1 9 3 2 c in the 2090 s 2091 2100 in comparison to 1971 2010 under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 global emissions scenarios these values are equivalent to approximately 0 11 c for rcp2 6 and 0 31 c for rcp4 5 of warming per decade the precipitation showed different patterns for the five major upstream river basins over the past several decades due to different moisture sources overall the precipitationshowed a non apparent increasing trend except for the uye the annual precipitation showed increasing trends of 11 6 12 1 17 2 and 22 4 mm per decade in the uya um us and ub respectively however a decreasing trend of 1 7 mm per decade was found for the precipitation in the uye fig 7 the averages of the five gcms under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 for the 2050 s and 2090 s suggested that the five study catchments will experience an increasing annual precipitation fig 6 the mean precipitation across the five catchments is projected to increase by 6 6 14 3 mm per decade under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenarios compared to the baseline of 1971 2010 the multi model average annual precipitation is projected to increase by 12 1 25 3 13 1 25 4 in the 2050 s and 13 5 23 4 19 9 40 9 in the 2090 s for the five major upstream river basins under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenarios 4 4 hydrology responses to climate changes 4 4 1 fate of glaciers the glacier area revealed a significant decreasing trend in the uye 20 3 uya 15 6 um 34 4 us 37 3 and ub 32 7 over the past 40 years in general the glaciers shrank more rapidly in the western catchments of the tp the mean values of glacier area loss in the studied catchments uye uya um us and ub under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 between 2010 and 2060 were determined to be 39 6 45 6 53 8 57 6 82 5 84 8 67 2 69 9 and 52 3 58 3 respectively fig 8 and by the end of the 21st century the glacier area is projected to decline by 46 6 62 1 70 8 80 9 88 2 95 6 71 8 79 6 and 60 0 75 8 in the five catchments respectively the glacier retreat during thefirst halfof the21st century will be much faster than that during the latterhalfof the21st century the glaciers are located at a higher altitude region during the latterhalfof the21st century due to former shrinkage therefore the glacier area change is less sensitive to climate change in addition the annual mean air temperature is projected to reach a peak in the 2050 s under the rcp2 6 emission scenario fig 7 4 4 2 stream flow projections fig 9 displays the runoff projections with the five downscaled gcms according to the runoff separation results the total runoff depends marginally on the glacier melt in the uye 0 35 uya 3 7 um 1 3 us 4 4 and ub 5 5 due to limited glacier coverage fig 8 and table 2 our study shows that glacier runoff will increase in the uya at least until the 2020 s 2021 2030 and will begin to decrease after the 2030 s 2031 2040 fig 9 however glacier runoff in the uye um us and ub had exceeded its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century and more than 20 of glacier area loss occurred from 1971 to 2010 when the increasing melt rate due to higher air temperatures cannot compensate for the negative effect of glacier area loss on melt water glacier runoff will start to decline the multi model median results show that glacier runoff in the 2050 s will decline by 37 5 26 1 19 8 16 9 80 3 79 6 69 1 67 7 and 48 9 46 0 compared with the historical reference period 1971 2100 for the five catchments uye uya um us and ub respectively under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 global emission scenarios by the end of the century 2090 s the glacier runoff is predicted to decrease within each basin by up to 51 3 61 3 62 2 65 4 91 0 95 7 77 2 80 1 and 59 1 71 6 compared with the reference period respectively snowmelt runoff is an important component of the total runoff the historical simulation showed that the contribution of snowmelt runoff to the total runoff was 15 3 12 2 28 8 28 3 and 23 1 for the uye uya um us and ub respectively the snowmelt runoff is projected to increase in the five catchments until the 2020 s and to start to decrease after the 2030 s potentially owing to a decrease in the snowfall due to smaller snow precipitation ratio with the warming climate fig 9 in comparison to 1971 2010 a consistent increase in total runoff is projected for all the basins in the two periods 2050 s and 2090 s for which the increasing rainfall runoff that compensates for the loss of snow ice melt water is the major cause the total runoff in the 2050 s is projected to increase by 7 1 6 5 for the uye 26 4 12 2 for the uya 19 7 21 1 for the um 11 8 12 6 for the us and 21 8 16 8 for the ub under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenarios by the end of the 21st century 2090 s the total runoff will increase by 8 8 11 9 19 2 14 0 15 8 32 4 9 9 21 5 and 16 9 30 7 in the five respective basins same order as previous sentence for the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenarios respectively 4 4 3 seasonality of future runoff the seasonal cycle changes for each simulated runoff component from historical records and future predictions are shown in fig 10 by the end of this century the contribution of glacier runoff to total runoff will be negligible due to a large decrease in glacier area figs 8 and 10 positive snowmelt runoff changes are projected during the spring march may and late autumn october november for the uye uya us and ub indicating an earlier spring snow melt and delayed fall freeze up obvious negative snowmelt changes are observed during the summer june august for the five major upstream river basins which can be explained by decreased precipitation in the form of snowfall with the warming climate the rainfall runoff is predicted to increase during may june because of the increasing rainfall precipitation ratio the pattern of runoff is similar to that of precipitation for the five basins with 60 80 of the annual streamflow occurring from june september the annual hydrograph remains practically unchanged except for the uye where the total runoff peak is anticipated to occur 1 month earlier july june the shift can be explained by an earlier onset of spring snowmelt and an increase in the rainfall precipitation ratio in may june fig 10b and c the large positive total runoff changes are generally projected during the cold season january march and november december for the five major basins additionally the increased total runoff in the cold season is a major cause of the increase in total runoff the increasing rate of warm season may october streamflow was clearly less than that of the annual and cold seasons and a negative trend in warm season streamflow was even found with a slight increase in annual streamflow in the uye and uya fig 10 and table 8 the differences in streamflow change in the warm and cold season were most likely related to the degradation of permafrost soil which results in an increased infiltration during the warm season and greater water release during the cold season 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other models water resource management of glacierized catchments largely relies on glacio hydrological models that can estimate glacier meltwater contribution to streamflow and project future streamflow change however few current macroscale watershedmodels incorporate glacier modeling in macroscale applications radić and hock 2014 several studies have tried to couple the temperature index immerzeel et al 2010 luo et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 su et al 2016 or energy balance kotlarski et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 glacier melt model to existing macroscale hydrological models such as the vic model soil and water assessment tool swat and snowmelt runoff model srm although the energy balance melt method more properly describes the physical processes determining melt the temperature index method is the most widely used approach to simulate snow ice melt the temperature index method often achieves better model performance than the energy balance method at the catchment scale because temperature is the least uncertain available climate variable hock 2003 2005 essery et al 2013 pellicciotti et al 2013 hence the temperature index method is most common and will retain its foremost position in snow ice melt estimating due to low data requirements and good performance in this study the extended degree day method considering the impact of the surface aspect on melt was coupled to vic model for both the current climate and future climate scenarios simulations of glacier area evolution are indispensable few studies at the local scales have incorporated simple area evolution schemes volume area scaling approach into hydrological models stahl et al 2008 luo et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 most previous studies luo et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 2015 consider all glaciers as whole to be simulated in a calculated unit and neglect the differences in mass balance and area change among different glaciers especially for glaciers of different sizes it is difficult to directly calibrate and validate models using glacier outlines derived from remote sensing data collected during several different time periods and the observed mass balance of individual glaciers which is necessary to reduce the uncertainty in hydrological simulations of larger glacierized catchments stahl et al 2008 huss et al 2008 konz and seibert 2010 duethmann et al 2015 immerzeel et al 2012 the vic cas model presented here attempts to incorporate these advances the model includes a representation of individual glaciers on the sub basin scale and simulates mass balance and area evolution for an individual glacier 5 2 necessity of model calibration using glacier change data most recent studies suggest that the main driver of future runoff change is the change in precipitation in the upstream regions of large river systems on the tp which is consistent with our findings table 1 however there is debate about the contributions and future trends of glacier melt water across three previous studies immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 which accounted for glacier hydrological processes using the degree day method ddfs are key parameters in the degree day melt model and differences among ddfs lead to different simulated contributions and future trends of glacier melt water however there are significant differences in the values of ddfs ddfsnow ranging from 4 0 to 4 8 mm c day 1 and ddfice ranging from 7 0 to 13 8 mm c day 1 among the previous studies which were obtained from limited observations of several glaciers su et al 2016 and calibration by comparing the simulated streamflow with observed records immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 ddfs from these limited observations maynotaccuratelyrepresent the average conditions of the large scale catchments because of the high spatial and temporal heterogeneities of ddfs ramanathan and carmichael 2008 furthermore it is difficult to obtain reliable ddfs through model calibration only based on streamflow due to inaccurate precipitation input fig 11 shows the vic cas model sensitivity to the ddf parameters in terms of the objective function of evaluating the performance of streamflow simulation objr and glacier runoff contribution during the calibration period the objr was less sensitive to ddfs than the glacier melt water contribution with an approximate change of 0 03 0 14 0 03 0 58 and 0 97 in objr for every 10 change in ddfs for the uye uya um us and ub respectively a 10 increase in ddfs will increase the glacier runoff contribution to streamflow by 2 3 4 6 1 2 1 8 and 1 6 for the five catchments respectively as shown in fig 11 the optimized value of ddfs calibrated only by in situ observed streamflow was 0 5 times ddfs0 the value of ddfs from the calibration by glacier area for the uye 1 0 times ddfs0 for the uya and 1 5 times ddfs0 for the um us and ub the differences between optimized values of ddfs through in situ observed streamflow and glacier area data were excluding the uya greater than 50 the uncertainties in total runoff simulation from ddfs were minimal because of the limited glacier melt water contribution in contrast the uncertainties in the glacier area and glacier runoff simulations associated with ddfs were considerably larger fig 12 illustrates the simulated and projected glacier area and glacier runoff change when ddfs increased or decreased by 50 increasing ddfs led to accelerated glacier area loss and decreased glacier meltwater in the 2050 s and 2090 s the ranges of simulated glacier runoff and glacier area change informed by different ddfs 0 5 ddfs 1 0 ddfs and 1 5 ddfs were also found to be very large a 50 change in degree day factors caused 35 0 169 1 37 1 172 5 and 36 3 217 5 43 1 332 2 differences in glacier area and 30 6 146 9 26 8 145 0 and 34 4 223 0 42 5 335 7 differences in glacier runoff for the five study catchments in the 2050 s and 2090 s under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenario respectively additionally glacier runoff reached a tipping point 10 30 years earlier or later when the ddfs increased or decreased by 50 thus observed glacier information must be used for model calibration to obtain more realistic ddfs the complex topography and observed data scarcity on the tp substantially limit melt model calibration via glacier mass balance which has usually been adopted in previous studies stahl et al 2008 huss et al 2008 konz and seibert 2010 immerzeel et al 2012 duethmann et al 2015 remote sensing glacier area data represent valuable alternatives to ground based observations for calibration on the tp because their spatially distributed patterns spatial resolution and availability are not significantly impacted by terrain 5 3 uncertainties in projections uncertainties in projections are attributable to the following 1 different model parameters and 2 the adopted global climate models global emission scenarios and downscaling approaches huss et al 2014 chiew et al 2010 the uncertainties in runoff simulations of the same catchments in our study generated by the vic hydrological model soil parameters have been discussed and analyzed by zhang et al 2013 and su et al 2016 their studies indicated that the uncertainties associated with model soil parameters are much smaller than those from climate change projections the uncertainties in the parameters c and γ of the volume area scaling law which is typically adopted to simulate glacier advance or retreat in a large scale catchment may represent an additional contribution except ddfs to uncertaintiesin glacier simulation there are many empirical parameters of the volume area scaling law grinsted 2013 the parameters of the scaling law from radić and hock 2010 were used by immerzeel et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 and in our study while the parameters from liu et al 2003 were adopted by su et al 2016 we also compared the glacier area and glacier runoff simulations by adopting four recognized volume area scaling laws table 9 we found that huss s scaling law shows a relatively poor performance for glacier area compared with the other three methods which achieved a similarly effective model performance not shown our results reveal that the uncertainties in simulations of glacier runoff and glacier area change from the four volume area scaling laws are small with mean uncertainties of less than 4 0 and 5 0 respectively fig 13 additionally there isalmost no difference between the simulationsthat adopt grinsted s radić s and liu s scaling laws the uncertainties in ddfs are considered to be the major source of uncertainties in the glacier area and glacier melt water projections generally the spread in gcms results accounts for the high percentage of overall uncertainty in the projected results teng et al 2012 immerzeel et al 2013 huss et al 2014 barria et al 2015a b peel et al 2015 although 5 gcms with projections closest to the mean values of 19 gcms were selected the ranges in future annual precipitation and mean air temperature projections downscaled from the selected gcms were found to be very large the changes in projected mean annual precipitation range from 10 3 to 29 6 8 3 32 9 and 3 8 to 33 0 16 2 43 2 and the temperature vary from 1 7 to 2 4 2 0 3 1 c and 1 2 to 2 4 2 5 3 8 c in comparison to the reference period for our study basins in the 2050 s and 2090sunder the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenario respectively fig 6 the ranges of the projected annual total runoffs informed by the 5 gcms were considerably large with an average relativestandard deviation standard deviation divided by the mean of 4 9 9 9 and 11 1 10 1 for the uye 21 0 21 4 and 17 6 23 8 for the uya 14 2 9 4 and 15 8 15 9 for the um 5 6 13 3 and 14 8 16 7 for the us and 8 3 10 8 and 17 3 15 0 for the ub in the 2050 s and 2090 s under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenario respectively fig 9 the spread of future climate and runoff projected results was even larger for certain seasons the uncertainties in glacier projections with different climate changes from the five gcms were also very apparent with an average relative standard deviation of 15 8 14 0 for glacier runoff and 13 0 12 6 for glacier area across our study catchments under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 emission scenario the choice of downscaling method is also an important source of uncertainty in hydrological projections schmidli et al 2007 segui et al 2010 the delta change dc and dc v statistical downscaling methods are widely used in streamflow projections immerzeel et al 2010 2012 2013 lutz et al 2014 su et al 2016 almost no differences were observed between the modeled mean climate data of the metrological stations over the baseline period 1971 2005 using the two downscaling methods in addition the modeled data matched the measured values well not shown the average annual hydrographs of streamflow simulated using downscaled historical gcm data adopting the dc v and dc methods from 1971 to 1999 in the ub are shown in fig 14 a the simulation results using the two downscaled data are clearly close to the observations thus supporting the reasonability of the downscaled historical and projected downscaled series it is also difficult to judge which downscaling method can provide more realistic future climate projections because there is very little bias between the simulated historical streamflow sets there are only small differences between the projected climate series from the two downscaled methods with an average bias of 0 27 0 39 c for annual mean air temperature and 16 7 20 5 mm for annual precipitation under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 scenario across our study catchments fig 14b the differences in two projected future climate sets resulted in a mean bias of 7 5 9 8 6 1 6 1 and 3 2 3 7 for projected mean streamflow glacier runoff and glacier area under the two emission scenarios respectively fig 14c and d overall gcms are the dominantsourceofuncertaintyfor projecting the streamflow while ddfs are considered to be the largest source of uncertainty for glacier area and glacier meltwater projections therefore glacier information must be used for model parameters calibration to effectively reduce the uncertainty in glacier projections although the uncertainties in glacier and stream projections are very apparent the future runoff will likely increase due to increased precipitation while glacier runoff is likely to reach its tipping point as a result of the rapid shrinkageofglacierswith climatewarming 5 4 consequences of changes in the cryosphere and streamflow glaciers are expectedto keepshrinking because of increasing air temperature although the contributions of glacier meltwater to streamflow are very limited in our study catchments the role of glaciers in the regulation of streamflow should not be neglected especially during the warm season representing the peak period of water demand as shown in fig 15 an obvious negative relationship occurred between glacier runoff and streamflow in the warm season for the five catchments which indicates less glacier meltwater during wet years and more glacier meltwater during arid years this phenomenon is commonly referred to as the glacier compensation effect zhao et al 2015 in the extreme dry warm season the glacier runoff contribution can reach 9 15 in the uya us and ub where the contribution of glacier meltwater to the annual streamflow is less than 6 fig 15b d and e with the retreating glaciers the role of glaciers in streamflow regulation will diminishor even completelydisappear which will increase the risk of drought to hamper downstream agricultural activities over the next century the permafrost is expected to degrade as the thawing depth continues to increase because of the increasing air temperature during the warm season fig 16 a and c a significantnegative relationship was observed between the runoff coefficient and thawing depth of the permafrost area fig 16b and d in the uye thus the permafrost degradation and increase in thawing depth will allow for greater infiltration and water storage during the warm season leading to a subsequent reduction of the runoff coefficient fig 16a and c warming of the soil temperature will also lead to the formation of unfrozen zones within the permafrost thus providing more baseflow in the cold season fig 9 this phenomenon has also been reported by niu et al 2011 for rivers on the tp and ye et al 2009 for arctic rivers cold season discharge is expected to substantially increase due to the permafrost soil degradation and earlier snow ice melt whereas the warm season discharge may decrease if increases inprecipitationarenot sufficientto offset the decrease in the runoff coefficient and reduced snow ice meltwater fig 10c and f in general the water demand for agriculture is expected to increase due to higher temperatures such changes in streamflow may reduce the water supply for warm season downstream agriculture which will have a considerable effect on food security thus even more balanced water resource management will be required 6 conclusions in this work we coupled glacier melting enhanced degree day and glacier evolution volume area scaling law schemes to the macroscale vic hydrological model the extended hydrological model named vic cas can explicitly simulate glacier retreat or advance and all major cryospheric hydrological processes therefore it is suitable for hydrological simulation on the tp to reduce uncertainties in simulations from model parameters a progressive two stage calibration strategy that jointly uses the remotely sensed glacier area and in situ observed streamflow data was adopted to acquire more reliable model parameters this model was applied to assess the climate change impacts on hydrology and project future change in the upstream regimes of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra rivers on the tp the following major conclusions are drawn 1 the extended vic cas model allows an accurate simulation of both river flow and glacier evolution in the five large cryospheric catchments on the tp through the two stage calibration strategy 2 the climate change analysis based on downscaled data from the five different gcms suggests that the annual mean air temperature is projected to increase by 0 11 0 31 c per decade and precipitation by 6 6 14 3 mm per decade under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 global emission scenarios 3 with climate warming glaciers are projected to retreat steadily the results show that relative to 2010 the glacier area in 2100 will decline by 46 6 62 1 70 8 80 9 88 2 95 6 71 8 79 6 and 60 0 75 8 for the uye uya um us and ub respectively glacier runoff is projected to start to decline in the uya after the 2030 s while glacier runoff was already beyond its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century in uye um us and ub with the occurrence of greater than 20 glacier area loss from 1971 to 2010 4 although large uncertainties are observed in the projections due to a high degree of uncertainty in future climate change from gcms annual streamflow is expected to increase due to an increase in rainfall runoff which compensates for the expected decrease in glacier and snow melt water the annual hydrograph remains unchanged except for the uye where the peak streamflow will occur 1 month earlier because of earlier snowmelt and increased the rainfall precipitation ratios due to the increase in thawing depth and earlier snow ice melt the cold season streamflow is projected to substantially increase however the warm season streamflow may decrease if the increases inprecipitationarenot sufficientto offset the reduced warm season

6501,although hydrological processes are generally nonlinear linear time series models are commonly adopted in the field of water sciences nonlinear approaches such as threshold time series and conditional heteroscedasticity models are still seldom used in this study first two and three regime self exciting threshold autoregressive setar models are used to model the mean behavior of daily streamflows the residual time series computed from the difference between observations and lag one time ahead best estimates of the fitted models are also obtained second the conditional variance behavior of the residual series obtained from the two and three regime setar models is modeled using the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity garch model the garch model is hence used to capture the time varying variance behavior of residuals as a nonlinear phenomenon and thus it removes the existence of autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity so called arch effect finally the performance of setar models and their combination with the garch model are evaluated six deseasonalized daily streamflow series from upstream watershed rivers of zarrineh rood dam in the southern part of lake urmia in iran are used to illustrate and test the procedure the mcleod li test a formal test for demonstrating the arch effect indicates that the arch effect exists in all residual series which means that the residuals of streamflow time series are nonstationary in terms of the variance results indicate that the hybrid setar garch models performed better than the models without garch component results demonstrate also that the use of nonlinear setar and garch improves streamflow modeling efficiency by capturing the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of nonlinear threshold time series keywords two and three regime setar models garch model nonlinearity daily streamflows lake urmia 1 introduction in general two different groups of hydrologic models can be defined physically based and mathematically based models the physically based models are sophisticated models that consider a number of parameters and hydro meteorological variables that affect hydrologic phenomena on the other hand mathematical methods represent data driven models that simulate hydrologic variations based on previously recorded observations the second group models are simpler to apply in practice due to the easiness of their implementation modarres and ouarda 2013b a large number of data driven techniques can be identified such as artificial neural networks ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis genetic programming gp wavelet transforms wt machine learning ml m5 model tree m5t and time series analysis tsa models which have been receiving increasing attention in the field of water resources engineering wang et al 2006 ouachani et al 2011 wang et al 2017a b among the above mentioned data driven models tsa models along with the development of their new approaches have always been a major topic in hydrology and water resources engineering for modeling hydrological data mohammadi et al 2006 fathian et al 2018 time series modeling is considered as a useful tool to generate simulate forecast and complete hydrological data such data enables managers and policy makers in the water sector to make appropriate decisions salas et al 1980 one of the most important hydrological variables that is considered as an important source of hydrological information and is used in a number of water resources engineering applications is streamflow this variable represents a nonlinear process xie et al 2016 and has a dynamic and complex spatial and temporal structure which requires more sophisticated tools to model the complexity involved modarres and ouarda 2013b in this regard one of the main issues in modeling streamflow process is whether to use a linear or nonlinear approach the present work aims to demonstrate the ability of nonlinear time series approaches to provide adequate modeling of streamflows the complete review and application of other techniques are beyond the scope of this paper linear time series models are widely applied for modeling hydroclimatic variables such as rainfall and temperature kaushik and singh 2008 helman 2011 farajzadeh et al 2014 curceac et al 2018 streamflow kisi 2005 mohammadi et al 2006 can et al 2012 floods shiiba et al 2000 zhang and govindaraju 2000 droughts yurekli and kurunc 2004 modarres 2007 and water temperature ahmadi nedushan et al 2007 benyahya et al 2008 traditional linear models such as the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model mainly focus on modeling the mean behavior first order moment of the hydrological time series these linear models are often inadequate because of the variation in residuals which is not constant in practice it is commonly assumed that the residual series is an independent identically distributed i i d normal error modarres and ouarda 2014a linear time series methods are hence usually not able to capture the nonlinear properties of processes governing the temporal variation of streamflow processes other more complicated models that are able to capture the dynamics of time series more accurately have therefore been considered modarres and ouarda 2013c 2014b recently there has been a growing interest in the application of nonlinear time series models in hydrology threshold autoregressive tar and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity garch methods are commonly used in modeling the mean first order moment and the variance second order moment of financial and economic time series respectively mohammadi and su 2010 the nonlinear tar approach which is commonly referred to as piecewise linear or regime switching model can model the mean behavior of hydrologic time series tong 1983 however the garch approach can model the time varying variance behavior in the residual series from tar approach fitted to hydrologic time series there is usually an arch or garch effect in a time series when the time series exhibits autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity the conditional heteroscedasticity means the time varying variance i e volatility or the second order moment of the residual time series in the volatility behavior of the residuals large changes tend to follow large changes and small changes tend to follow small changes wang et al 2005 for this reason this behavior is called conditional heteroscedasticity that can be captured using arch type models because the conditional heteroscedasticity of the residual time series exhibits autoregressive structure wang et al 2005 these models include the arch and garch methods which were respectively proposed by engle 1982 and bollerslev 1986 and allow to eliminate the arch effect these types of models have not yet received considerable attention from the hydrological community the tar and garch approaches have been slowly gaining popularity to model hydro meteorological variables nowadays amendola and storti 1999 used the tar approach to model the switching between different regimes using the antecedent precipitation index amendola 2003 compared the performance of a number of tar models for river flow forecasting komorník et al 2006 evaluated the performance of nonlinear two regime tar models for mean monthly streamflow data in a mountain region in slovakia a new type of tar model was proposed by them and tested and the results showed its superior predictive performance romilly 2005 applied a seasonal arima approach to model the mean behavior of global mean monthly temperature and a garch approach to capture the temporal variability of the variance of residual series the results of this study indicated that the hybrid seasonal arima garch model leads to improved performances in comparison to the seasonal arima model wang et al 2005 used an arma garch model to capture the arch effects in the daily streamflow time series of the upper yellow river in china modarres and ouarda 2013a used hybrid seasonal arima garch to model the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of the seasonal arima model for two monthly rainfall time series from humid and arid regions their results showed that the garch approach gives a better performance and that the modelling procedure can stabilize the heteroscedasticity of rainfall time series modarres and ouarda 2013c introduced three types of garch models in streamflow time series modeling and their results suggested that using garch type models allows capturing the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of arima models and improving the modeling efficiency previous studies have mainly focused on linear time series models for modeling the mean behavior of streamflow time series whereas this process does not exhibit a linear behavior in this regard streamflow processes cannot be well fitted by the popular linear models such as arima compared to nonlinear models such as tar komorník et al 2006 järas and gishani 2010 amiri 2015 therefore potential improvement may result from modeling the mean and the variance behavior of streamflow time series using nonlinear tar and garch models as far as the authors are aware the use and performance evaluation of nonlinear two regime and three regime multiple regime tar models and their combination with the garch approach tar garch error model have not yet been explored for modeling streamflow time series the present study aims to test and evaluate the performance of self exciting threshold autoregressive setar models and their combination with the garch approach in modeling daily streamflow time series setar models represent a special case and the main type of tar models and were first introduced by tong 1983 the data used is the daily streamflow time series from six upstream watershed rivers of zarrineh rood dam in the southern part of lake urmia in iran the paper also examines the performance of setar models with without garch approach using various criteria developed to handle nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity the paper is organized as follows the case study is described in section 2 of the document the methodology of the study and the theoretical presentation of the approaches considered in this research are illustrated in section 3 a description and discussion of the results are illustrated in section 5 finally the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 study area and data the case study deals with the headwaters of the zarrineh rood river located upstream of the zarrineh rood dam the study basin represents one the biggest sub basins of lake urmia this basin is located in the southern part of lake urmia in northwestern iran with an area of 7081 km2 fig 1 the length of the zarrineh rood river is approximately 230 km the river discharges into lake urmia and represents the source of the majority of the lake s water budget unep 2012 ahmadzadeh et al 2016 the elevation of the study area varies between 1746 and 2121 m a s l the headwaters of this river along with all its main tributaries arise from the mountains of the kurdistan and west azarbaijan provinces the region receives substantial amounts of snow during the winter season ahmadzadeh et al 2016 the study area is constituted of four sub basins namely saghez chai jighato chai khorkhoreh chai and sarogh chai from west to east respectively which discharge water into the zarrineh rood dam reservoir fig 1 in the present study the available daily average streamflow records of six streamflow gauging stations were used continuous 15 years of daily observations from the 1st of january 1997 to the 31st of december 2011 were used to compare the modeling capabilities of different setar garch models in terms of the mean and conditional heteroscedasticity of streamflow time series the geographical distributions of the hydrometric stations and their important characteristics are shown in fig 1 and in table 1 respectively the abbreviations of the hydrometric stations presented in table 1 were used instead of their names in the rest of the paper before building the setar model the original streamflow time series are transformed to a deseasonalized time series this transformation is performed in order to 1 avoid the effect of seasonality on the conditional heteroscedasticity because according to wang et al 2005 the arch effect can be partly caused by seasonal variations seasonality of daily streamflows 2 develop a better fit of the applied models 3 normalize the time series in respect to the variance make it more homoscedastic and to 4 reduce the scale effect i e increase the importance of smaller values and reduce the impact of larger values salas et al 1980 järas and gishani 2010 the deseasonalized standardized procedure includes two steps first a logarithmic transformation is applied to the daily streamflows second the logarithmically transformed series is standardized by subtracting the seasonal daily mean values from the data and dividing the resulting values by their own seasonal standard deviations wang et al 2005 however before standardization streamflow time series are smoothed using fourier harmonics to alleviate the stochastic fluctuations of the daily means and standard deviations according to the procedure proposed by salas et al 1980 and applied by fathian et al 2018 for the streamflow data used in this study the procedure is illustrated by two time series plots fig 2 a and b corresponding to the discharge series at the upstream site gh station and the downstream site d station as well as their corresponding deseasonalized series fig 2c and d no trends are detected in fig 2a and b however the annual seasonality is obvious within these data series a strong correlation can also be observed between the series corresponding to the two sites 3 methods in this section the methodology for building the nonlinear setar garch models for streamflow time series is explained the flow chart fig 3 provides more details concerning the different stages of the streamflow modeling process 3 1 testing procedures for stationarity and threshold nonlinearity before building the nonlinear setar model the stationarity and nonlinearity of the deseasonalized streamflow series were tested using the augmented dickey fuller adf test and the likelihood ratio test tlrt respectively dickey and fuller 1979 chan 1991 the adf test allows testing the presence of a unit root in intended time series based on considering an autoregressive ar 1 model if the autoregressive parameter i e unit root of the ar 1 model is equal to one the intended time series is considered a non stationary process null hypothesis otherwise it is considered stationary the tlrt test is useful to detect threshold nonlinearity based on considering an ar p and a multiple regime tar model of order p the null hypothesis of the tlrt approach for threshold nonlinearity is that the fitted model to the time series is an ar p model the alternative hypothesis is that the fitted model to the time series is a tar model with an order p autoregressive process for each regime cryer and chan 2008 for more details about the formulations of these tests the reader is referred to modarres and ouarda 2013b and cryer and chan 2008 3 2 nonlinear tar model the tar model belongs to a group of nonlinear regime switching models the basic idea of these nonlinear time series models is that certain properties of the time series such as its mean variance and autocorrelation are different in various regimes of the modeled process cryer and chan 2008 tsay 2010 the self exciting threshold autoregressive setar model is a special case of the tar model tong 1983 according to the assumptions of tar type models the movements between regimes are controlled by a parameter called threshold in the case of the setar model the threshold parameter is a certain lagged value of the intended time series itself or an endogenous parameter komorník et al 2006 suppose that the intended time series data set is y1 yn where n is the length of the time series then a two regime setar model denoted as setar 2 p r can be written as follows 1 y t φ 0 1 i 1 p φ i 1 y t i ε t 1 i f y t d τ φ 0 2 i 1 r φ i 2 y t i ε t 2 i f y t d τ where φ i j i 1 2 p i 1 2 r j 1 2 are the coefficients of the ar models p and r are the orders of the ar models for lower and upper regimes in a two regime setar model ε t is the residual value at time t i e the difference between observation yt and lag one time ahead best estimate of the fitted model y t at time t that ε t ñ 0 σ 2 d is a lag time and τ is the threshold value transition parameter using eq 1 a three regime setar model denoted as setar 3 p r q can be developed and represented as follows 2 y t φ 0 1 i 1 p φ i 1 y t i ε t 1 i f y t d τ 1 φ 0 2 i 1 r φ i 2 y t i ε t 2 i f τ 1 y t d τ 2 φ 0 3 i 1 q φ i 3 y t i ε t 3 i f y t d τ 2 where φ i j i 1 2 p i 1 2 r i 1 2 p j 1 2 3 are the coefficients of the ar models p r and q are the orders of the ar models for lower middle and upper regimes in a three regime setar model and τ 1 and τ 2 are the threshold values cryer and chan 2008 tsay 2010 in order to estimate a time series with a fitted two regime setar model for example it is essential to know the threshold parameter τ and the delay parameter d then the data sets can be split into two parts according to whether or not y t d τ in this regard the data larger and smaller than the threshold values are identified and each regime can be estimated as a common ar model the appropriate orders of the ar model can then be estimated by minimizing the akaike information criterion aic for a fixed τ and d as cryer and chan 2008 3 aic p r τ d 2 l τ d 2 p r 2 l τ d n p 2 1 log 2 π n 1 τ d 2 log σ 1 τ d 2 n 2 τ d 2 log σ 2 τ d 2 where l τ d is the log likelihood function to maximize in order to estimate τ and d n 1 and n 2 are the numbers of data observations in each regime and σ 1 and σ 2 are the noise or error variances in the lower and upper regimes respectively it should be noted that the ar orders in setar models do not need to be identical in two and three regime models cryer and chan 2008 to test the sufficiency of the fitted setar model two formal statistical methods based on the analysis of residuals are discussed in this study in the first method the autocorrelation function acf of the obtained residual series from the fitted setar model is investigated the sufficiency of the fitted setar model is accepted if all acf coefficients are located within the confidence intervals in the second method the ljung box test is used to check the sufficiency of the setar model modarres and ouarda 2013a cryer and chan 2008 this test leads to a value q which follows a chi square distribution and is given by 4 q n n 2 k 1 l r k 2 ε n k where n is the length of the residual series l is the number of autocorrelations of residuals between 15 and 25 and r k is the acf of the residuals ε at the lag k if the q statistic is less than the tabulated value at the considered significance level then the residual series are uncorrelated and time independent and the fitted model is acceptable modarres and ouarda 2013a 3 3 the garch modeling approach the garch model is a privileged approach for modeling volatility in the literature this model was developed by bollerslev 1986 to generalize the arch model as proposed by engle 1982 when a setar model is fitted to a deseasonalized time series the obtained residuals from the fitted model may show sufficient fitting but the squared residual series may still show significant autocorrelation in other words while the residuals seem statistically uncorrelated according to the two methods mentioned in the previous subsection they are not identically distributed that is the residuals are not independent and identically distributed i i d through time wang et al 2005 therefore the heteroscedasticity behavior the arch effect or conditional time variant variance may be observed in the residual series this behavior can be generalized and modeled by a garch approach the resulting model is then named setar garch the garch model for a process ε t is defined as follows if its first two conditional moments exist and satisfy francq and zakoian 2011 5 σ t 2 v a r ε t ε u u t ω i 1 v α i ε t i 2 j 1 m β j σ t j 2 6 ε t σ t e t e t n o r m a l 0 1 ε t ψ t 1 n o r m a l 0 σ t 2 where σ t 2 var ε t ε u u t is the conditional time variant variance of the residual series ω is a constant α 1 α v and β 1 β m are the coefficients of the garch v m approach and v and m are the orders of the coefficients based on the garch v m model the conditional variance of ε t i e σ t 2 depends on the v past squared residuals and the m lagged conditional variance the order of the garch model is determined by the aic technique and the parameters of the model can be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method cryer and chan 2008 in order to identify and check the existence of heteroscedasticity in the residual series bollerslev 1986 relied on the acf of standardized squared residuals ssrs this technique is helpful for identifying and checking garch behavior in ssrs wang et al 2005 the mcleod li test mcleod and li 1983 is used in this study for the arch effect similar to equation 4 for the ljung box test q statistic the mcleod li q statistic is given by 7 q n n 2 k 1 l r k 2 ε 2 n k the assumption of no garch effect as null hypothesis for the residual series is accepted if the calculated q statistic is lower than the tabulated value at a given significance level modarres and ouarda 2013a 3 4 comparative evaluation methods evaluation methods can give important guidance in order to choose the appropriate models the performance of alternative models can be examined by means of a set of evaluation metrics the evaluation metrics used in the present study are absolute maximum error 8 ame max q i q i peak difference 9 pdiff max q i max q i mean absolute error 10 mae 1 n i 1 n q i q i root mean squared error 11 rmse i 1 n q i q i 2 n relative absolute error 12 rae i 1 n q i q i i 1 n q i q coefficient of determination r squared 13 r 2 i 1 n q i q q i q i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n q i q 2 the metrics selected are in three categories namely metrics that calculate absolute errors such as ame pdiff mae and rmse metrics that calculate relative errors such as rae and dimensionless metrics such as r2 in the above equations q i and q i are the observed and estimated time series and q and q are their means respectively modarres and ouarda 2013a b the statistics software r was used in all statistical computations in this study r core and team 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 nonlinear setar models before discussing the results of the setar models it is important to carry out the hypothesis testing the results of the adf and tlrt tests table 2 showed that all series are stationary and that threshold nonlinearity exists at a specified significance level therefore the setar models can be fitted to the daily streamflow time series as indicated for the two and three regime setar models the threshold and delay parameters are first estimated then the orders of the ar model are determined for each regime finally the most appropriate models are selected as an illustration for the gh station the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models are selected through the examination of the acf and partial acf pacf of the deseasonalized streamflow series fig 4 and comparison of aic values the segments of the two residual series obtained from the two setar models are shown in fig 5 the acfs of two residual series and p value plots of the ljung box test are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 they indicate that the fitted two and three regime setar models are sufficient and valid for daily streamflows at gh gauging station therefore the null hypothesis of these two statistical methods i e no autocorrelation structure in the residuals or verification of model sufficiency is accepted at the 5 significance level and the residual series are time independent this modeling procedure is repeated for each hydrometric station and the most appropriate multiple regime setar models are determined 4 2 tests for nonlinear garch model when the mean behavior of a time series is modeled using a nonlinear setar model it is assumed that the residuals follow a time i i d behavior according to wang et al 2005 the residual series may indeed represent statistically uncorrelated behavior fig 6 but they are not identically distributed from a visual point of view fig 5 this means that the residual series do not have an i i d behavior through time this can be observed during several periods of residual behavior fig 5 where large variations of residuals tend to follow large variations and small variations of residuals tend to follow small variations therefore we can infer the existence of a common behavior of garch processes the so called conditional heteroscedasticity or volatility in daily streamflow series wang et al 2005 the garch behavior was identified by examining the acf of squared residual series as an example fig 8 illustrates the acfs structure of squared residual series from the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models for daily streamflows at gh station it can be observed that the two squared residual series are autocorrelated and this indicates that the variances of residual series are time dependent therefore the existence of an arch effect can be confirmed in the residual series furthermore according to wang et al 2005 there may be seasonal variations in the variance structure of residual series and this can be removed by standardization of the residual series obtained from setar models seasonally standardized residual series are calculated by dividing the residual series from the setar models for daily streamflows by the daily standard deviations then the existence of the arch effect can be checked in the squared seasonally standardized residual series of daily streamflows as an example fig 9 illustrates the acfs structure of squared seasonally standardized residual series from the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models at gh station as observed after seasonal standardization of the residual series the acf s structure of squared seasonally standardized residual series is still significant at 5 level the standardization in residuals series could partly affect the seasonal variance variations in the squared residual series but the arch effect still exists in addition the mcleod li test confirms the existence of the arch effect in the squared seasonally standardized residual series from the two and three regime models for daily streamflows at gh station fig 10 as it can be observed all p values of the mcleod li test are 5 significance level therefore the null hypothesis of this test is rejected there are other reasons to show the arch effect in daily streamflows such as including temperature fluctuations as an effective factor for snowmelt and evapotranspiration and precipitation variations as an important factor for streamflow behavior wang et al 2005 4 3 nonlinear hybrid setar garch model the most appropriate two and three setar models are fitted to the daily deseasonalized streamflow series at gh station as an example the acfs and pacfs structure in the two squared seasonally standardized residual series from the fitted setar models are depicted in figs 9 and 11 respectively based on choosing the smallest aic values and acf and pacf structure the garch 5 0 and garch 7 0 models or in other words arch 5 and arch 7 models respectively are fitted to the two seasonally standardized residual series from the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models at gh station therefore the hybrid two and three regime setar garch models are detected as sufficient models for modeling conditional mean and conditional variance behaviors of streamflow series fig 12 presents the acfs of standardized residuals et fig 12a and c and their squared series fig 12b and d for the hybrid setar 2 4 5 arch 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 arch 7 models at gh station fig 12b d indicate that there is no autocorrelation structure in the squared standardized residuals from the hybrid setar arch models thus the arch effect was removed however there is a significant autocorrelation structure in the non squared standardized residuals from these hybrid daily streamflow models fig 12a and c the significant autocorrelation structure in fig 12a and c originates from the seasonally standardized residuals established from the building procedure of hybrid setar garch models fig 13 presents that the acf and pacf analyses from the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models for gh station these are significant wang et al 2005 indicated that the distinct mechanism of such significant autocorrelation was not clear similar analyses to the one shown in figs 12 and 13 are also carried out for all other stations located in this study area to address the significant correlation fig 13 the mean behavior in the non squared seasonally standardized residuals is modelled using an arma model the analysis of the acfs and pacfs in fig 13 lead to an arma model therefore it is considered as an additional model for the mean behavior in the daily standardized residuals then a garch model is fitted to the residuals from this additional arma model to address the volatility in the arma model according to fig 13 an additional arma 5 1 was the most appropriate model fitted to the daily standardized residuals from the two and three regime setar models based on the aic the acf structure plots of the second residual series and its squared series from the hybrid setar 2 4 5 arma 5 1 and setar 3 5 1 3 arma 5 1 models are developed and depicted in fig 14 the meaning of the second residual series is the residual series obtained from the additional arma model as a second model fitted to the daily standardized residuals from the two setar models according to fig 14a and c there is no autocorrelation structure in the second residual series but a significant autocorrelation structure exists in the squared second residual series as shown in fig 14b and d which indicates an arch effect in the second residuals therefore based on the acf and pacf structures of the squared second residual series and the aic value an arch 5 model was fitted to the second residual series at gh station finally the hybrid setar 2 4 5 arma 5 1 arch 5 model for the two regime case and setar 3 5 1 3 arma 5 1 arch 5 model for the three regime case were fitted to daily streamflow series at gh station this includes a setar 2 4 5 model and a setar 3 5 1 3 model fitted to standardized daily time series an arma 5 1 model fitted to the seasonally standardized residual series obtained from the two and three regime setar models and an arch 5 model fitted to the second residual time series obtained from the arma 5 1 model such a model building process of the hybrid setar arma garch model is carried out for all other stations fig 15 shows the acfs structure of standardized second residual series et and the squared standardized second residual series obtained from the arch 5 model of hybrid setar 2 4 5 arma 5 1 arch 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 arma 5 1 arch 5 models the results show that the significant autocorrelation structures have been basically eliminated in the non squared and squared second residuals in comparison to fig 12 furthermore the mcleod li test confirms that the arch 5 model as illustrated for the gh station provides a good fit to the second residual series fig 16 at this point all p values are noted to be greater than the critical level 5 significance level and the null hypothesis of no arch effect is accepted for the newly created hybrid two and three regime setar arma arch models table 3 shows also the results of the fitted nonlinear two and three regime setar models and their combination with the arch approach for all daily streamflow time series at 6 hydrometric stations located in the study area 4 4 evaluation of fitted setar and setar arch models in this section we discuss the performance of the two and three regime setar and hybrid setar arch models fitted to daily streamflow time series by applying the evaluation criteria as discussed in the methods section before illustrating the evaluation criteria we first show the scatter plots and time series plots of the observed against estimated streamflow series at gh station in figs 17 and 18 respectively fig 17 indicates that the setar arch models are better than the setar models in estimating high streamflows whereas the performance of all models is good for the estimation of low streamflows the analysis of high flows shows that the performance of the setar arch models is slightly better than the simple setar models according to the results of amiri 2015 none of the models are able to adequately capture the high flow dynamics of the streamflows another indication that the setar arch models lead to a better performance is provided by the distribution of observations around the best fit line this distribution is the closest for the setar arch models the time series plots of the observed and estimated streamflows at gh and d stations are illustrated in fig 18 and further confirm the above explanations the numerical evaluation criteria are also applied and presented in table 4 to compare the performance of the fitted two and three regime setar and setar arch models for all stations see table 3 the setar arch models show a better performance than the setar models based on the evaluation criteria the performances of the hybrid models improved as shown by the rmse and r2 87 92 percent for each station furthermore ame and pdiff values indicate that the two regime setar arch models are more efficient in estimating the peak flows than the three regime setar arch models therefore the combined setar models with arch based on the model efficiency classification given by dawson et al 2007 can be considered as good to very satisfactory in a comparative study of the setar model for daily river flow forecasting amiri 2015 showed that the setar model performs better than other tar models including the arma linear model and presents the best forecasting performance these results are consistent with those of astatkie 2006 and komorník et al 2006 the comparative assessment of the results of this study with soft computing methods as applied by wang et al 2006 ouachani et al 2011 and wang et al 2017a b requires further research to understand the performance of the data driven models figs 17 and 18 confirm that the general agreement between observed and estimated high streamflows is better in the two regime setar arch model than the three regime model the main advantage of the arch model is the capacity to capture the conditional heteroscedastic variances from the residual series of nonlinear setar models furthermore the reduction of the variation of the model output as well as the reduction of the uncertainty of model estimation confirms the advantages of the garch approach the results of this study are in line with the results of chen et al 2008 and modarres and ouarda 2013c which modelled conditional heteroscedasticity for daily streamflow time series using different types of garch models romilly 2005 confirmed that the garch model is able to capture the heteroscedasticity to present the better performance of the model in the case of temperature time series 5 conclusions the objective of the present study is to model the daily streamflows of the zarrineh rood basin rivers located in the south of lake urmia by applying two and three regime setar models and their combination with the arch approach relatively little attention has been paid to these two approaches in hydrology and water resources engineering the proposed approaches are applied to six streamflow time series and their performances are evaluated using various criteria the results can be summarized as follows the hybrid setar arch models consist of two parts the first part considers the two and three regime setar models for modeling the mean behavior conditional mean of streamflow series the second part considers the arch approach for modeling the variance behavior conditional heteroscedasticity of the residual series gained from the setar models the evaluation criteria show that the setar arch models lead to better performances when compared with the setar models moreover the performance of the two regime setar model is slightly better than the performance of the three regime setar one hybrid setar models are shown to improve over classical models and can be appropriate for modeling and analyzing streamflows the results of the mcleod li test show the existence of conditional heteroscedasticity in the residual series from setar models according to the performance evaluation of the fitted models it is possible to conclude that the hybrid setar arch models improve over the setar models without arch approach and their outputs can be considered as very satisfactory the results of this research have direct applications whenever it is important to capture the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of the nonlinear threshold time series future research efforts should attempt to apply the arch modeling approach and the setar models and their combination with soft computing methods to streamflow time series from different parts of the world the application of nonlinear multivariate time series regression models with exogenous data such as climate variables for modeling streamflows is also proposed for future efforts the application of multivariate arch models for modeling the effects of climate variability and change on streamflow fluctuations is also an interesting topic for future research few studied have applied either nonlinear setar and garch models or their combinations future work can focus on the application of these models to other hydrologic and climatic variables at different time scales using different types of tar and garch models acknowledgments the authors wish to thank the university of tabriz and the iran water resources management company for having provided the data used in the present study

6501,although hydrological processes are generally nonlinear linear time series models are commonly adopted in the field of water sciences nonlinear approaches such as threshold time series and conditional heteroscedasticity models are still seldom used in this study first two and three regime self exciting threshold autoregressive setar models are used to model the mean behavior of daily streamflows the residual time series computed from the difference between observations and lag one time ahead best estimates of the fitted models are also obtained second the conditional variance behavior of the residual series obtained from the two and three regime setar models is modeled using the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity garch model the garch model is hence used to capture the time varying variance behavior of residuals as a nonlinear phenomenon and thus it removes the existence of autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity so called arch effect finally the performance of setar models and their combination with the garch model are evaluated six deseasonalized daily streamflow series from upstream watershed rivers of zarrineh rood dam in the southern part of lake urmia in iran are used to illustrate and test the procedure the mcleod li test a formal test for demonstrating the arch effect indicates that the arch effect exists in all residual series which means that the residuals of streamflow time series are nonstationary in terms of the variance results indicate that the hybrid setar garch models performed better than the models without garch component results demonstrate also that the use of nonlinear setar and garch improves streamflow modeling efficiency by capturing the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of nonlinear threshold time series keywords two and three regime setar models garch model nonlinearity daily streamflows lake urmia 1 introduction in general two different groups of hydrologic models can be defined physically based and mathematically based models the physically based models are sophisticated models that consider a number of parameters and hydro meteorological variables that affect hydrologic phenomena on the other hand mathematical methods represent data driven models that simulate hydrologic variations based on previously recorded observations the second group models are simpler to apply in practice due to the easiness of their implementation modarres and ouarda 2013b a large number of data driven techniques can be identified such as artificial neural networks ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis genetic programming gp wavelet transforms wt machine learning ml m5 model tree m5t and time series analysis tsa models which have been receiving increasing attention in the field of water resources engineering wang et al 2006 ouachani et al 2011 wang et al 2017a b among the above mentioned data driven models tsa models along with the development of their new approaches have always been a major topic in hydrology and water resources engineering for modeling hydrological data mohammadi et al 2006 fathian et al 2018 time series modeling is considered as a useful tool to generate simulate forecast and complete hydrological data such data enables managers and policy makers in the water sector to make appropriate decisions salas et al 1980 one of the most important hydrological variables that is considered as an important source of hydrological information and is used in a number of water resources engineering applications is streamflow this variable represents a nonlinear process xie et al 2016 and has a dynamic and complex spatial and temporal structure which requires more sophisticated tools to model the complexity involved modarres and ouarda 2013b in this regard one of the main issues in modeling streamflow process is whether to use a linear or nonlinear approach the present work aims to demonstrate the ability of nonlinear time series approaches to provide adequate modeling of streamflows the complete review and application of other techniques are beyond the scope of this paper linear time series models are widely applied for modeling hydroclimatic variables such as rainfall and temperature kaushik and singh 2008 helman 2011 farajzadeh et al 2014 curceac et al 2018 streamflow kisi 2005 mohammadi et al 2006 can et al 2012 floods shiiba et al 2000 zhang and govindaraju 2000 droughts yurekli and kurunc 2004 modarres 2007 and water temperature ahmadi nedushan et al 2007 benyahya et al 2008 traditional linear models such as the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model mainly focus on modeling the mean behavior first order moment of the hydrological time series these linear models are often inadequate because of the variation in residuals which is not constant in practice it is commonly assumed that the residual series is an independent identically distributed i i d normal error modarres and ouarda 2014a linear time series methods are hence usually not able to capture the nonlinear properties of processes governing the temporal variation of streamflow processes other more complicated models that are able to capture the dynamics of time series more accurately have therefore been considered modarres and ouarda 2013c 2014b recently there has been a growing interest in the application of nonlinear time series models in hydrology threshold autoregressive tar and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity garch methods are commonly used in modeling the mean first order moment and the variance second order moment of financial and economic time series respectively mohammadi and su 2010 the nonlinear tar approach which is commonly referred to as piecewise linear or regime switching model can model the mean behavior of hydrologic time series tong 1983 however the garch approach can model the time varying variance behavior in the residual series from tar approach fitted to hydrologic time series there is usually an arch or garch effect in a time series when the time series exhibits autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity the conditional heteroscedasticity means the time varying variance i e volatility or the second order moment of the residual time series in the volatility behavior of the residuals large changes tend to follow large changes and small changes tend to follow small changes wang et al 2005 for this reason this behavior is called conditional heteroscedasticity that can be captured using arch type models because the conditional heteroscedasticity of the residual time series exhibits autoregressive structure wang et al 2005 these models include the arch and garch methods which were respectively proposed by engle 1982 and bollerslev 1986 and allow to eliminate the arch effect these types of models have not yet received considerable attention from the hydrological community the tar and garch approaches have been slowly gaining popularity to model hydro meteorological variables nowadays amendola and storti 1999 used the tar approach to model the switching between different regimes using the antecedent precipitation index amendola 2003 compared the performance of a number of tar models for river flow forecasting komorník et al 2006 evaluated the performance of nonlinear two regime tar models for mean monthly streamflow data in a mountain region in slovakia a new type of tar model was proposed by them and tested and the results showed its superior predictive performance romilly 2005 applied a seasonal arima approach to model the mean behavior of global mean monthly temperature and a garch approach to capture the temporal variability of the variance of residual series the results of this study indicated that the hybrid seasonal arima garch model leads to improved performances in comparison to the seasonal arima model wang et al 2005 used an arma garch model to capture the arch effects in the daily streamflow time series of the upper yellow river in china modarres and ouarda 2013a used hybrid seasonal arima garch to model the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of the seasonal arima model for two monthly rainfall time series from humid and arid regions their results showed that the garch approach gives a better performance and that the modelling procedure can stabilize the heteroscedasticity of rainfall time series modarres and ouarda 2013c introduced three types of garch models in streamflow time series modeling and their results suggested that using garch type models allows capturing the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of arima models and improving the modeling efficiency previous studies have mainly focused on linear time series models for modeling the mean behavior of streamflow time series whereas this process does not exhibit a linear behavior in this regard streamflow processes cannot be well fitted by the popular linear models such as arima compared to nonlinear models such as tar komorník et al 2006 järas and gishani 2010 amiri 2015 therefore potential improvement may result from modeling the mean and the variance behavior of streamflow time series using nonlinear tar and garch models as far as the authors are aware the use and performance evaluation of nonlinear two regime and three regime multiple regime tar models and their combination with the garch approach tar garch error model have not yet been explored for modeling streamflow time series the present study aims to test and evaluate the performance of self exciting threshold autoregressive setar models and their combination with the garch approach in modeling daily streamflow time series setar models represent a special case and the main type of tar models and were first introduced by tong 1983 the data used is the daily streamflow time series from six upstream watershed rivers of zarrineh rood dam in the southern part of lake urmia in iran the paper also examines the performance of setar models with without garch approach using various criteria developed to handle nonlinearity and heteroscedasticity the paper is organized as follows the case study is described in section 2 of the document the methodology of the study and the theoretical presentation of the approaches considered in this research are illustrated in section 3 a description and discussion of the results are illustrated in section 5 finally the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 study area and data the case study deals with the headwaters of the zarrineh rood river located upstream of the zarrineh rood dam the study basin represents one the biggest sub basins of lake urmia this basin is located in the southern part of lake urmia in northwestern iran with an area of 7081 km2 fig 1 the length of the zarrineh rood river is approximately 230 km the river discharges into lake urmia and represents the source of the majority of the lake s water budget unep 2012 ahmadzadeh et al 2016 the elevation of the study area varies between 1746 and 2121 m a s l the headwaters of this river along with all its main tributaries arise from the mountains of the kurdistan and west azarbaijan provinces the region receives substantial amounts of snow during the winter season ahmadzadeh et al 2016 the study area is constituted of four sub basins namely saghez chai jighato chai khorkhoreh chai and sarogh chai from west to east respectively which discharge water into the zarrineh rood dam reservoir fig 1 in the present study the available daily average streamflow records of six streamflow gauging stations were used continuous 15 years of daily observations from the 1st of january 1997 to the 31st of december 2011 were used to compare the modeling capabilities of different setar garch models in terms of the mean and conditional heteroscedasticity of streamflow time series the geographical distributions of the hydrometric stations and their important characteristics are shown in fig 1 and in table 1 respectively the abbreviations of the hydrometric stations presented in table 1 were used instead of their names in the rest of the paper before building the setar model the original streamflow time series are transformed to a deseasonalized time series this transformation is performed in order to 1 avoid the effect of seasonality on the conditional heteroscedasticity because according to wang et al 2005 the arch effect can be partly caused by seasonal variations seasonality of daily streamflows 2 develop a better fit of the applied models 3 normalize the time series in respect to the variance make it more homoscedastic and to 4 reduce the scale effect i e increase the importance of smaller values and reduce the impact of larger values salas et al 1980 järas and gishani 2010 the deseasonalized standardized procedure includes two steps first a logarithmic transformation is applied to the daily streamflows second the logarithmically transformed series is standardized by subtracting the seasonal daily mean values from the data and dividing the resulting values by their own seasonal standard deviations wang et al 2005 however before standardization streamflow time series are smoothed using fourier harmonics to alleviate the stochastic fluctuations of the daily means and standard deviations according to the procedure proposed by salas et al 1980 and applied by fathian et al 2018 for the streamflow data used in this study the procedure is illustrated by two time series plots fig 2 a and b corresponding to the discharge series at the upstream site gh station and the downstream site d station as well as their corresponding deseasonalized series fig 2c and d no trends are detected in fig 2a and b however the annual seasonality is obvious within these data series a strong correlation can also be observed between the series corresponding to the two sites 3 methods in this section the methodology for building the nonlinear setar garch models for streamflow time series is explained the flow chart fig 3 provides more details concerning the different stages of the streamflow modeling process 3 1 testing procedures for stationarity and threshold nonlinearity before building the nonlinear setar model the stationarity and nonlinearity of the deseasonalized streamflow series were tested using the augmented dickey fuller adf test and the likelihood ratio test tlrt respectively dickey and fuller 1979 chan 1991 the adf test allows testing the presence of a unit root in intended time series based on considering an autoregressive ar 1 model if the autoregressive parameter i e unit root of the ar 1 model is equal to one the intended time series is considered a non stationary process null hypothesis otherwise it is considered stationary the tlrt test is useful to detect threshold nonlinearity based on considering an ar p and a multiple regime tar model of order p the null hypothesis of the tlrt approach for threshold nonlinearity is that the fitted model to the time series is an ar p model the alternative hypothesis is that the fitted model to the time series is a tar model with an order p autoregressive process for each regime cryer and chan 2008 for more details about the formulations of these tests the reader is referred to modarres and ouarda 2013b and cryer and chan 2008 3 2 nonlinear tar model the tar model belongs to a group of nonlinear regime switching models the basic idea of these nonlinear time series models is that certain properties of the time series such as its mean variance and autocorrelation are different in various regimes of the modeled process cryer and chan 2008 tsay 2010 the self exciting threshold autoregressive setar model is a special case of the tar model tong 1983 according to the assumptions of tar type models the movements between regimes are controlled by a parameter called threshold in the case of the setar model the threshold parameter is a certain lagged value of the intended time series itself or an endogenous parameter komorník et al 2006 suppose that the intended time series data set is y1 yn where n is the length of the time series then a two regime setar model denoted as setar 2 p r can be written as follows 1 y t φ 0 1 i 1 p φ i 1 y t i ε t 1 i f y t d τ φ 0 2 i 1 r φ i 2 y t i ε t 2 i f y t d τ where φ i j i 1 2 p i 1 2 r j 1 2 are the coefficients of the ar models p and r are the orders of the ar models for lower and upper regimes in a two regime setar model ε t is the residual value at time t i e the difference between observation yt and lag one time ahead best estimate of the fitted model y t at time t that ε t ñ 0 σ 2 d is a lag time and τ is the threshold value transition parameter using eq 1 a three regime setar model denoted as setar 3 p r q can be developed and represented as follows 2 y t φ 0 1 i 1 p φ i 1 y t i ε t 1 i f y t d τ 1 φ 0 2 i 1 r φ i 2 y t i ε t 2 i f τ 1 y t d τ 2 φ 0 3 i 1 q φ i 3 y t i ε t 3 i f y t d τ 2 where φ i j i 1 2 p i 1 2 r i 1 2 p j 1 2 3 are the coefficients of the ar models p r and q are the orders of the ar models for lower middle and upper regimes in a three regime setar model and τ 1 and τ 2 are the threshold values cryer and chan 2008 tsay 2010 in order to estimate a time series with a fitted two regime setar model for example it is essential to know the threshold parameter τ and the delay parameter d then the data sets can be split into two parts according to whether or not y t d τ in this regard the data larger and smaller than the threshold values are identified and each regime can be estimated as a common ar model the appropriate orders of the ar model can then be estimated by minimizing the akaike information criterion aic for a fixed τ and d as cryer and chan 2008 3 aic p r τ d 2 l τ d 2 p r 2 l τ d n p 2 1 log 2 π n 1 τ d 2 log σ 1 τ d 2 n 2 τ d 2 log σ 2 τ d 2 where l τ d is the log likelihood function to maximize in order to estimate τ and d n 1 and n 2 are the numbers of data observations in each regime and σ 1 and σ 2 are the noise or error variances in the lower and upper regimes respectively it should be noted that the ar orders in setar models do not need to be identical in two and three regime models cryer and chan 2008 to test the sufficiency of the fitted setar model two formal statistical methods based on the analysis of residuals are discussed in this study in the first method the autocorrelation function acf of the obtained residual series from the fitted setar model is investigated the sufficiency of the fitted setar model is accepted if all acf coefficients are located within the confidence intervals in the second method the ljung box test is used to check the sufficiency of the setar model modarres and ouarda 2013a cryer and chan 2008 this test leads to a value q which follows a chi square distribution and is given by 4 q n n 2 k 1 l r k 2 ε n k where n is the length of the residual series l is the number of autocorrelations of residuals between 15 and 25 and r k is the acf of the residuals ε at the lag k if the q statistic is less than the tabulated value at the considered significance level then the residual series are uncorrelated and time independent and the fitted model is acceptable modarres and ouarda 2013a 3 3 the garch modeling approach the garch model is a privileged approach for modeling volatility in the literature this model was developed by bollerslev 1986 to generalize the arch model as proposed by engle 1982 when a setar model is fitted to a deseasonalized time series the obtained residuals from the fitted model may show sufficient fitting but the squared residual series may still show significant autocorrelation in other words while the residuals seem statistically uncorrelated according to the two methods mentioned in the previous subsection they are not identically distributed that is the residuals are not independent and identically distributed i i d through time wang et al 2005 therefore the heteroscedasticity behavior the arch effect or conditional time variant variance may be observed in the residual series this behavior can be generalized and modeled by a garch approach the resulting model is then named setar garch the garch model for a process ε t is defined as follows if its first two conditional moments exist and satisfy francq and zakoian 2011 5 σ t 2 v a r ε t ε u u t ω i 1 v α i ε t i 2 j 1 m β j σ t j 2 6 ε t σ t e t e t n o r m a l 0 1 ε t ψ t 1 n o r m a l 0 σ t 2 where σ t 2 var ε t ε u u t is the conditional time variant variance of the residual series ω is a constant α 1 α v and β 1 β m are the coefficients of the garch v m approach and v and m are the orders of the coefficients based on the garch v m model the conditional variance of ε t i e σ t 2 depends on the v past squared residuals and the m lagged conditional variance the order of the garch model is determined by the aic technique and the parameters of the model can be estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method cryer and chan 2008 in order to identify and check the existence of heteroscedasticity in the residual series bollerslev 1986 relied on the acf of standardized squared residuals ssrs this technique is helpful for identifying and checking garch behavior in ssrs wang et al 2005 the mcleod li test mcleod and li 1983 is used in this study for the arch effect similar to equation 4 for the ljung box test q statistic the mcleod li q statistic is given by 7 q n n 2 k 1 l r k 2 ε 2 n k the assumption of no garch effect as null hypothesis for the residual series is accepted if the calculated q statistic is lower than the tabulated value at a given significance level modarres and ouarda 2013a 3 4 comparative evaluation methods evaluation methods can give important guidance in order to choose the appropriate models the performance of alternative models can be examined by means of a set of evaluation metrics the evaluation metrics used in the present study are absolute maximum error 8 ame max q i q i peak difference 9 pdiff max q i max q i mean absolute error 10 mae 1 n i 1 n q i q i root mean squared error 11 rmse i 1 n q i q i 2 n relative absolute error 12 rae i 1 n q i q i i 1 n q i q coefficient of determination r squared 13 r 2 i 1 n q i q q i q i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n q i q 2 the metrics selected are in three categories namely metrics that calculate absolute errors such as ame pdiff mae and rmse metrics that calculate relative errors such as rae and dimensionless metrics such as r2 in the above equations q i and q i are the observed and estimated time series and q and q are their means respectively modarres and ouarda 2013a b the statistics software r was used in all statistical computations in this study r core and team 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 nonlinear setar models before discussing the results of the setar models it is important to carry out the hypothesis testing the results of the adf and tlrt tests table 2 showed that all series are stationary and that threshold nonlinearity exists at a specified significance level therefore the setar models can be fitted to the daily streamflow time series as indicated for the two and three regime setar models the threshold and delay parameters are first estimated then the orders of the ar model are determined for each regime finally the most appropriate models are selected as an illustration for the gh station the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models are selected through the examination of the acf and partial acf pacf of the deseasonalized streamflow series fig 4 and comparison of aic values the segments of the two residual series obtained from the two setar models are shown in fig 5 the acfs of two residual series and p value plots of the ljung box test are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 they indicate that the fitted two and three regime setar models are sufficient and valid for daily streamflows at gh gauging station therefore the null hypothesis of these two statistical methods i e no autocorrelation structure in the residuals or verification of model sufficiency is accepted at the 5 significance level and the residual series are time independent this modeling procedure is repeated for each hydrometric station and the most appropriate multiple regime setar models are determined 4 2 tests for nonlinear garch model when the mean behavior of a time series is modeled using a nonlinear setar model it is assumed that the residuals follow a time i i d behavior according to wang et al 2005 the residual series may indeed represent statistically uncorrelated behavior fig 6 but they are not identically distributed from a visual point of view fig 5 this means that the residual series do not have an i i d behavior through time this can be observed during several periods of residual behavior fig 5 where large variations of residuals tend to follow large variations and small variations of residuals tend to follow small variations therefore we can infer the existence of a common behavior of garch processes the so called conditional heteroscedasticity or volatility in daily streamflow series wang et al 2005 the garch behavior was identified by examining the acf of squared residual series as an example fig 8 illustrates the acfs structure of squared residual series from the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models for daily streamflows at gh station it can be observed that the two squared residual series are autocorrelated and this indicates that the variances of residual series are time dependent therefore the existence of an arch effect can be confirmed in the residual series furthermore according to wang et al 2005 there may be seasonal variations in the variance structure of residual series and this can be removed by standardization of the residual series obtained from setar models seasonally standardized residual series are calculated by dividing the residual series from the setar models for daily streamflows by the daily standard deviations then the existence of the arch effect can be checked in the squared seasonally standardized residual series of daily streamflows as an example fig 9 illustrates the acfs structure of squared seasonally standardized residual series from the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models at gh station as observed after seasonal standardization of the residual series the acf s structure of squared seasonally standardized residual series is still significant at 5 level the standardization in residuals series could partly affect the seasonal variance variations in the squared residual series but the arch effect still exists in addition the mcleod li test confirms the existence of the arch effect in the squared seasonally standardized residual series from the two and three regime models for daily streamflows at gh station fig 10 as it can be observed all p values of the mcleod li test are 5 significance level therefore the null hypothesis of this test is rejected there are other reasons to show the arch effect in daily streamflows such as including temperature fluctuations as an effective factor for snowmelt and evapotranspiration and precipitation variations as an important factor for streamflow behavior wang et al 2005 4 3 nonlinear hybrid setar garch model the most appropriate two and three setar models are fitted to the daily deseasonalized streamflow series at gh station as an example the acfs and pacfs structure in the two squared seasonally standardized residual series from the fitted setar models are depicted in figs 9 and 11 respectively based on choosing the smallest aic values and acf and pacf structure the garch 5 0 and garch 7 0 models or in other words arch 5 and arch 7 models respectively are fitted to the two seasonally standardized residual series from the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models at gh station therefore the hybrid two and three regime setar garch models are detected as sufficient models for modeling conditional mean and conditional variance behaviors of streamflow series fig 12 presents the acfs of standardized residuals et fig 12a and c and their squared series fig 12b and d for the hybrid setar 2 4 5 arch 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 arch 7 models at gh station fig 12b d indicate that there is no autocorrelation structure in the squared standardized residuals from the hybrid setar arch models thus the arch effect was removed however there is a significant autocorrelation structure in the non squared standardized residuals from these hybrid daily streamflow models fig 12a and c the significant autocorrelation structure in fig 12a and c originates from the seasonally standardized residuals established from the building procedure of hybrid setar garch models fig 13 presents that the acf and pacf analyses from the setar 2 4 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 models for gh station these are significant wang et al 2005 indicated that the distinct mechanism of such significant autocorrelation was not clear similar analyses to the one shown in figs 12 and 13 are also carried out for all other stations located in this study area to address the significant correlation fig 13 the mean behavior in the non squared seasonally standardized residuals is modelled using an arma model the analysis of the acfs and pacfs in fig 13 lead to an arma model therefore it is considered as an additional model for the mean behavior in the daily standardized residuals then a garch model is fitted to the residuals from this additional arma model to address the volatility in the arma model according to fig 13 an additional arma 5 1 was the most appropriate model fitted to the daily standardized residuals from the two and three regime setar models based on the aic the acf structure plots of the second residual series and its squared series from the hybrid setar 2 4 5 arma 5 1 and setar 3 5 1 3 arma 5 1 models are developed and depicted in fig 14 the meaning of the second residual series is the residual series obtained from the additional arma model as a second model fitted to the daily standardized residuals from the two setar models according to fig 14a and c there is no autocorrelation structure in the second residual series but a significant autocorrelation structure exists in the squared second residual series as shown in fig 14b and d which indicates an arch effect in the second residuals therefore based on the acf and pacf structures of the squared second residual series and the aic value an arch 5 model was fitted to the second residual series at gh station finally the hybrid setar 2 4 5 arma 5 1 arch 5 model for the two regime case and setar 3 5 1 3 arma 5 1 arch 5 model for the three regime case were fitted to daily streamflow series at gh station this includes a setar 2 4 5 model and a setar 3 5 1 3 model fitted to standardized daily time series an arma 5 1 model fitted to the seasonally standardized residual series obtained from the two and three regime setar models and an arch 5 model fitted to the second residual time series obtained from the arma 5 1 model such a model building process of the hybrid setar arma garch model is carried out for all other stations fig 15 shows the acfs structure of standardized second residual series et and the squared standardized second residual series obtained from the arch 5 model of hybrid setar 2 4 5 arma 5 1 arch 5 and setar 3 5 1 3 arma 5 1 arch 5 models the results show that the significant autocorrelation structures have been basically eliminated in the non squared and squared second residuals in comparison to fig 12 furthermore the mcleod li test confirms that the arch 5 model as illustrated for the gh station provides a good fit to the second residual series fig 16 at this point all p values are noted to be greater than the critical level 5 significance level and the null hypothesis of no arch effect is accepted for the newly created hybrid two and three regime setar arma arch models table 3 shows also the results of the fitted nonlinear two and three regime setar models and their combination with the arch approach for all daily streamflow time series at 6 hydrometric stations located in the study area 4 4 evaluation of fitted setar and setar arch models in this section we discuss the performance of the two and three regime setar and hybrid setar arch models fitted to daily streamflow time series by applying the evaluation criteria as discussed in the methods section before illustrating the evaluation criteria we first show the scatter plots and time series plots of the observed against estimated streamflow series at gh station in figs 17 and 18 respectively fig 17 indicates that the setar arch models are better than the setar models in estimating high streamflows whereas the performance of all models is good for the estimation of low streamflows the analysis of high flows shows that the performance of the setar arch models is slightly better than the simple setar models according to the results of amiri 2015 none of the models are able to adequately capture the high flow dynamics of the streamflows another indication that the setar arch models lead to a better performance is provided by the distribution of observations around the best fit line this distribution is the closest for the setar arch models the time series plots of the observed and estimated streamflows at gh and d stations are illustrated in fig 18 and further confirm the above explanations the numerical evaluation criteria are also applied and presented in table 4 to compare the performance of the fitted two and three regime setar and setar arch models for all stations see table 3 the setar arch models show a better performance than the setar models based on the evaluation criteria the performances of the hybrid models improved as shown by the rmse and r2 87 92 percent for each station furthermore ame and pdiff values indicate that the two regime setar arch models are more efficient in estimating the peak flows than the three regime setar arch models therefore the combined setar models with arch based on the model efficiency classification given by dawson et al 2007 can be considered as good to very satisfactory in a comparative study of the setar model for daily river flow forecasting amiri 2015 showed that the setar model performs better than other tar models including the arma linear model and presents the best forecasting performance these results are consistent with those of astatkie 2006 and komorník et al 2006 the comparative assessment of the results of this study with soft computing methods as applied by wang et al 2006 ouachani et al 2011 and wang et al 2017a b requires further research to understand the performance of the data driven models figs 17 and 18 confirm that the general agreement between observed and estimated high streamflows is better in the two regime setar arch model than the three regime model the main advantage of the arch model is the capacity to capture the conditional heteroscedastic variances from the residual series of nonlinear setar models furthermore the reduction of the variation of the model output as well as the reduction of the uncertainty of model estimation confirms the advantages of the garch approach the results of this study are in line with the results of chen et al 2008 and modarres and ouarda 2013c which modelled conditional heteroscedasticity for daily streamflow time series using different types of garch models romilly 2005 confirmed that the garch model is able to capture the heteroscedasticity to present the better performance of the model in the case of temperature time series 5 conclusions the objective of the present study is to model the daily streamflows of the zarrineh rood basin rivers located in the south of lake urmia by applying two and three regime setar models and their combination with the arch approach relatively little attention has been paid to these two approaches in hydrology and water resources engineering the proposed approaches are applied to six streamflow time series and their performances are evaluated using various criteria the results can be summarized as follows the hybrid setar arch models consist of two parts the first part considers the two and three regime setar models for modeling the mean behavior conditional mean of streamflow series the second part considers the arch approach for modeling the variance behavior conditional heteroscedasticity of the residual series gained from the setar models the evaluation criteria show that the setar arch models lead to better performances when compared with the setar models moreover the performance of the two regime setar model is slightly better than the performance of the three regime setar one hybrid setar models are shown to improve over classical models and can be appropriate for modeling and analyzing streamflows the results of the mcleod li test show the existence of conditional heteroscedasticity in the residual series from setar models according to the performance evaluation of the fitted models it is possible to conclude that the hybrid setar arch models improve over the setar models without arch approach and their outputs can be considered as very satisfactory the results of this research have direct applications whenever it is important to capture the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of the nonlinear threshold time series future research efforts should attempt to apply the arch modeling approach and the setar models and their combination with soft computing methods to streamflow time series from different parts of the world the application of nonlinear multivariate time series regression models with exogenous data such as climate variables for modeling streamflows is also proposed for future efforts the application of multivariate arch models for modeling the effects of climate variability and change on streamflow fluctuations is also an interesting topic for future research few studied have applied either nonlinear setar and garch models or their combinations future work can focus on the application of these models to other hydrologic and climatic variables at different time scales using different types of tar and garch models acknowledgments the authors wish to thank the university of tabriz and the iran water resources management company for having provided the data used in the present study

adaptation options in the miyun reservoir watershed mrw climate change had significant impacts on water balance components such as precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration et and on water quality components such as sediment and nutrient loads a substantial decreasing trend of runoff indicated that the miyun reservoir faced a more acute challenge of insufficient water supply capacity compared

spatial and temporal scales arnold et al 1998 hashemi et al 2016 volk et al 2017 furthermore the swat model has been proven effective for evaluating bmps under complex terrains and varying climatic conditions in agriculture dominant watersheds jayakody et al 2014 panagopoulos et al 2015 this study used the swat model to assess the impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality and evaluate the impacts of bmps on developing adaptation strategies at sub basin scale in the mrw bmps can be implemented individually or designed as a management system in which case individual practices are linked together or distributed as a spatial network achieving complete control at source field path watershed and regional scales these practices can also be used in mitigating and adapting to climate change by regulating climate intercepting runoff trapping sediment and sequestering nutrients charlesworth 2010 the negative impacts of climate change are strengthening resulting in changes in hydrology increasing pollutant loads pressure on drinking water security and a significant economic cost for revitalizing degraded environments it is therefore imperative to understand and quantify the impacts of climate change to develop an effective management plan for water resources kiedrzynska et al 2015 saraswat et al 2016 valcu lisman et al 2017 a number of approaches are provided to develop sustainable watershed management systems accounting for both environmental and economic benefits haas et al 2017 liu et al 2017 valcu lisman et al 2017 the simulation optimization framework proposed by qiu et al 2018 serves as a multi objective optimization tool based on the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii for exploring tradeoffs among economic costs water quality improvements and decision makers concerns regarding bmp design by coordination across sub watersheds nsga ii is often used to optimize bmp selection and placement at watershed scale due to its global optimization ability to address multi objective and high dimensional problems with the crowded comparison operator and to find true pareto optimal solutions with a limited number of simulation runs deb et al 2002 this framework used the nsga ii expanded with an auto adaptive control parameter adjustment algorithm to generate spatial bmp configurations at sub basin scale hence this approach was used here to explore optimal bmps considering water quality responses to climate change the future climate change scenarios were driven by multiple representative concentration pathways rcps that depend on specific greenhouse gas concentrations to reach a particular radiative forcing in the year 2100 future climate variability can be predicted by general circulation models gcms based on rcp scenarios the outputs of which should be downscaled and bias corrected across a dense grid overlaid on the study area the bias correction algorithm with spatial disaggregation helps correct the future climate data by the transfer factors constructed between gcms and actual historical observations hempel et al 2013 leng and tang 2014 the future time series of climate variables are added into the watershed models e g swat to evaluate long term changes in surface runoff streamflow and water quality to develop adaptation strategies for the climate variability that are site specific to sub basins this paper evaluates the impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality and the efficiency of bmps in mitigating these impacts in an agriculture dominated watershed specifically the mrw will be taken as the study area to explore potential adaptation strategies through bmp configurations at sub basin scale in near middle and far future periods the objectives of the study are to 1 simulate

description the mrw 40 19 41 36 n and 115 27 117 35 e is located across beijing and hebei province it consists of two sub watersheds the chao river sub watershed and the bai river sub watershed which are the upstream catchments of the miyun reservoir and cover an area of 5892 97 km2 and 9030 98 km2 respectively the miyun reservoir is the largest reservoir in northern china and the most important potable water source for beijing many studies have stated that climate variations contributed to large decreases in runoff in the historical period and seriously affected beijing s water supply ma et al 2010 zheng et al 2016 changes in hydrology strongly influence water quality processes in a watershed system especially nps pollution driven by precipitation and runoff geng et al 2015 geographical information including topography land use and soil type was used to set up the swat model topographic data were represented by a 90 m spatial resolution digital elevation model dem obtained from the national geomatics center of china land use data referred to a 1 100 000 digital land use map fig s1 in the in the supplementary material obtained from the institute of geographical and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences soil type information was extracted from a 1 1 000 000 digital soil map of china which was provided by the fao harmonized world soil database soil properties were obtained from the soil research institute of the chinese academy of sciences or calculated by the spaw soil plant air water model saxton and rawls 2006 historic hydrological and water quality data from the survey stations located at the outlets of the two upstream sub watersheds were used to develop a calibrated model observed daily weather data were provided by gauges scattered throughout the watershed future climate variability projections separately generated by five gcms were used to assess climate effects for the period 2020 2099 table s1 in the supplementary material gives a description of the database for the swat setup 2 2 model description the swat model was developed by the usda agricultural research service usda ars and texas a m university and is continuously upgraded with interfaces in combination with arcgis arnold et al 2012a it is a process based model that simulates water quantity and pollutant transport and predicts the impacts of land surface characteristics climate change and management practices at watershed scale arnold et al 1998 in the swat model a watershed is divided into multiple sub basins based on topographic information and sub basins are further subdivided into small units called hydrologic response units hrus which are homogeneous areas processing unique land cover soil type slope and landscape characteristics for simulations of the hydrological cycle and pollutant transport through the land phase and the channel network arnold et al 2012a in this study the swat model was calibrated and validated with observed historical climate data for periods of 1990 1998 and 1999 2010 respectively more details of parameter sensitivity tables s2 and s3 and model calibration and validation were given in the supplementary material following calibration the baseline 1980 2004 and future climate data 2020 2099 from the five gcms were input into the model to identify the impacts of climate change on water balance water quality and bmp efficiency in the mrw and to avoid the potential bias that was caused by running a present day model with future climate inputs driven by the downscaled gcms swat accounts for a wide array of land nutrient and structural management practices to assess the efficiencies of bmps in controlling the amount of runoff and pollutant losses entering channels in watersheds by calculating changes in water quantity and quality with and without bmp waidler et al 2011 table s4 in the supplementary material shows the modules and key parameters for bmp assessment 2 3 climate change scenarios bias corrected future climate data at daily time step including precipitation air temperature maximum and minimum solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were provided at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution from five gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipslcm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m that are recommended in the framework of the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip table s5 in supplementary material the gcms were driven by the four representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 very low greenhouse gas concentrations van vuuren et al 2007 rcp 4 5 medium low greenhouse gas concentrations smith and wigley 2006 rcp 6 0 medium high greenhouse gas concentrations hijioka et al 2008 and rcp 8 5 high greenhouse gas concentrations riahi et al 2007 a distribution based bias correction algorithm was used to correct the climate data from gcms which were used to ensure that gcm data matched the climatology of the wfd water and global change watch forcing data over the reference period of 1960 1999 leng and tang 2014 in this method the derived correction factors linearly regressed between gcm and wfd were used to correct the projected gcm data for future periods details of the bias correction algorithm are given in hempel et al 2013 the rcps are consistent with certain socio economic assumptions and possible changes in future greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic activities and aim to represent the atmospheric concentrations that drive possible changes in temperature and precipitation in future periods van vuuren et al 2011 rcp 2 6 assumes that the concentrations peak during 2010 2020 and then substantially decline which contributes to the lowest possibility of climate change rcp 4 5 assumes that greenhouse gases peak around 2040 then decline which contributes to a low possibility of climate change rcp 6 0 assumes that the concentrations peak around 2080 then decline this process contributes to a large possibility of climate change rcp 8 5 assumes that greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise throughout the 21st century this scenario exhibits the highest levels of forcing and the largest possibility of climate change this study focused on climate variability driven by rcp 8 5 to assess the impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality in the mrw 2 4 bmp optimization method this study used a bmp optimization approach to determine potential bmp configurations at sub basin scale to achieve the water quality improvement targets at the minimum economic cost details of this approach are available in qiu et al 2018 which proposed a systematic optimization framework combining a watershed model swat model an economic module farm level economic model fem a markov chain method and a modified non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii the swat model was used to evaluate the pollution reduction effects of candidate bmps the fem was used to evaluate the economic costs of bmps including construction cost maintenance cost and economic benefits the nsga ii algorithm expanded with an auto adaptive control parameter adjustment method chen et al 2015 was used to generate pareto optimal spatial bmp configurations to ensure that water quality improvement targets were met at multiple assessment points through coordinated optimization of the two upstream sub watersheds the markov chain method was used to calculate pollutant loads at the assessment points with various bmp configurations or no bmp scenario based on upstream and downstream information about the watershed chen et al 2016 fig s2 in the supplementary material illustrates this simulation optimization framework 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate variability the nonparametric mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was used to determine the significance of trends in mean annual precipitation prec annual rainfall days in different rain patterns annual maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and mean temperature t from 2020 to 2099 table 1 shows the long term annual trend test results at the 5 significance level evaluated by the mk test from the time series of climate variables in the mrw that were predicted by the five gcms there was an uptrend in annual precipitation under rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 scenarios but not a significant one with mean annual change of 0 732 0 625 and 0 602 mm year respectively and a significant upward trend with 0 881 mm year for rcp 8 5 which can be attributed to the increase in the frequency of rainfall events especially extremes such as heavy rain and rainstorms the mean changes in annual days of heavy rain were 0 039 0 036 0 039 and 0 047 days year for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 respectively and the mean changes of rainstorm events were 0 011 0 011 0 014 and 0 019 days year for these four rcp scenarios respectively which indicated an uptrend in the frequencies of heavy rain and rainstorm events these results were consistent with other applications in similar regions pan et al 2016 a remarkable increase in frequency of rainstorm and heavy rain events would cause increased soil erosion and water quality problems in the future fig 1 as shown in table 1 and fig 2 monthly temperatures significantly increased in all future scenarios compared with the baseline period and rcp 8 5 led to a most remarkable increase due to the highest greenhouse gas concentrations july and august were the warmest months in the baseline period but in future climate the warmest months will extend over a long period from june to september as shown in fig 3 a substantial increase in the rate of change of tmin prompted a substantial increase in average temperature in rcp 8 5 and the amounts of precipitation showed a critical increasing trend significant variations in precipitation and temperature driven by rcp 8 5 scenario will have substantial impacts on watershed hydrology and pollutant transport and transformation processes through soil erosion runoff and washoff therefore this study focused on the impacts of climate change driven by rcp 8 5 3 2 water balance under the impacts of climate variability the calibration and validation of monthly hydrological and pollutant simulations were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency ens which are listed in table 2 the majority of the statistics satisfied the judging criteria for model performance although sediment results were distinctly weaker mainly affected by the paucity of observed sediment data and the shorter simulation periods for both calibration 2006 2008 and validation 2009 2010 these results indicate that swat could accurately simulate the hydrology and contaminants in the mrw the calibrated swat model was used to simulate the water balance under the various climate change scenarios table 3 shows mean annual simulated water balance components integrated from all the simulated results based on future climate data from the five gcms on average annual precipitation in future climate ranged from a minimum of 582 44 mm to a maximum of 701 97 mm this corresponds to changes of 3 64 24 91 relative to baseline climate precipitation increased during the colder period of the year fig 4 which was clearly caused by a consistent increase in temperature across all the gcms given the fact that precipitation increased in all the cold months when snowfall can occur this contributed to a reduction in snowfall within the cold period of the year table 3 implies substantial increases in et and pet with changes of 9 74 and 3 02 this result occurred because all the gcms predicted high temperature and net radiation increases in future periods which have a direct impact on et and pet in the mrw the greater increase in et fig 4 in winter and spring was primarily driven by the significantly increased temperature during this period which was consistent with the great increase in tmin noted in section 3 1 yielding large changes in annual et the small et increase in summer and autumn compared to spring and winter is also worth noting this can be explained by the observation that almost all gcms predicted greater temperature increases within the cooler part of the year with direct impact on snowfall but lesser temperature increases in the warmer part of the year which in combination do not result in considerably altered et values in this period these results were consistent with other studies panagopoulos et al 2015 on the other hand the small increase in et can also be attributed to the small increase in precipitation water inputs within the warmer period rather than to increased temperatures mean annual runoff in different sub basins predicted by the gcms manifested a greater deviation compared to the baseline climate ranging from a 53 48 decrease to a 55 36 increase in the sub basins fig 5 runoff decreased by 18 83 on average in all sub basins under the future climate with average change rates of 30 14 22 17 and 3 97 in the near middle and far future periods respectively which was inconsistent with the increase of precipitation although runoff tended to rise throughout the future period along with the continued increase of precipitation this shows that runoff production is driven not only by water inputs into the basin following the precipitation predicted by different gcms but also by other hydrological factors such as the frequencies of different rain patterns throughout the year gao et al 2018 rainfall intensity aguilar et al 2016 et amount milly and dunne 2016 soil properties infiltration rate grillakis et al 2016 and surface characteristics sofia et al 2019 this study analyzed changes in water balance components to explain the decrease in runoff the decrease in generated runoff during june september was driven by a small increase in precipitation and a relatively large increase in et which was caused by a consistent increase in temperature across the future periods predicted by all gcms fig 6 a shows a substantial mean increase of 4 10 in et under unit increasing temperature but a small increase of 1 79 in precipitation volume increasing water input less than water loss was bound to cause a decrease of 9 01 in runoff yields for a unit increase in temperature fig 6 a this result further implied that climate warming plays a crucial role in significantly reducing streamflow zheng et al 2016 the substantially higher temperatures in the coldest months contributed to more precipitation falling as rain than as snow this result caused a small decrease in runoff in winter however the low frequency of snowfall caused snowmelt runoff in spring to decrease which was characterized as a substantial decrease in runoff fig 4 in addition reductions in water yield were likely exacerbated by increased water consumption for domestic and industrial uses in this watershed zheng et al 2016 a significant decreasing streamflow trend indicated that the miyun reservoir would face further challenges of insufficient water supply capacity to meet water demands for the ecosystem agriculture and domestic and industrial use the change trends implied that climate change must be considered in watershed management strategies to ensure sufficient water supply capacity of the miyun reservoir to meet increasing future water demands generally the spatial distribution of runoff fig 5 was in agreement with the spatial distributions of land uses fig s1 in the supplementary material forestland in the upstream sub basins had an important function in water conservation and effectively reduced runoff due to the high vegetation coverage and the areas with high runoff were concentrated in the downstream sub basins where land uses were dominated by cropland with poor water retaining capacity due to frequent agricultural activities and low vegetation coverage 3 3 pollutant losses under impacts of climate variability the calibrated swat model was used to evaluate pollutant losses under the baseline climate in gcm reference period of 1980 2004 sediment losses ranged from 0 69 to 199 26 t ha and came mainly from agricultural land tn and tp losses in the baseline period were predicted to range from 1 23 to 24 04 kg ha and from 0 08 to 6 88 kg ha respectively the sediment and nutrient losses were higher in the sub basins where agricultural land accounted for a large area the contributions of different land covers were ranked as follows cropland barren land pastureland forestland residential areas fig s4 in the supplementary material shows the spatial distributions of pollution loadings in the baseline climate fig 7 shows the distribution of mean annual sediment yields in the mrw for the predicted climates compared to the results for the baseline climate the mean annual rates of change at sub basin scale were 10 41 4 73 and 44 52 in the near middle and far future periods respectively sediment loads at sub basin scale were significantly increased by 12 95 under future climate variability compared to the distribution of land cover fig s1 in the supplementary material the areas with high load intensity were distributed in the sub basins with large areas of agricultural land where soil erosion was prone to occur due to low vegetation coverage and increased frequency of heavy rain and rainstorms in future periods this result played an important role in the spatial configuration of bmp the spatial distribution of sediment load intensity was similar to that of precipitation fig s3 in the supplementary material in the three periods although runoff shows a downward trend and has substantial effects on the decrease of sediment load in the near future period the increasing trend of sediment load is consistent with that of precipitation coefficient of determination r2 0 605 which indicates that swift erosion of topsoil by rain was the main reason for the aggravation of soil erosion in future periods the impact of millions of raindrops directly hitting the bare soil surface can be incredibly strong as they dislodge and splash soil particles into runoff and streams this finding is similar to other future predictions that reported that increasing precipitation amount and intensity would increase sediment load in the future kim et al 2015 yasarer et al 2017 on the other hand it cannot be ignored that temperature has a strong influence on sediment yields and nutrient losses by altering soil parameters such as soil water content and soil temperature klik and eitzinger 2010 in this study a unit increase in temperature was found to lead to a 10 11 increase in sediment load in the future period fig 6 b figs 8 and 9 present the mean annual tn and tp losses to waters for the various sub basins the results indicated that the spatial distributions of nutrient loads in the three future periods were consistent with those in the baseline period fig s4 which were determined by surface characteristics land covers soil properties and the watershed hydrodynamic network in combination with agricultural activities and land management practices the highly polluted sub basins were dominated by cropland and barren land related to lower vegetation coverage high soil disturbance intensity and extensive application of fertilizers and manures these results determined the spatial variation of bmp configuration the mean change rates of annual tn and tp load intensities for all sub basins were 6 52 and 5 67 respectively in the near future 11 63 and 16 82 respectively in the middle future and 3 63 and 6 19 in the far future their mean rates of change over the entire future period were 7 26 and 9 56 respectively the distributions of nutrient load intensities were similar to those of sediment yields which indicates that nutrient losses are closely related to soil degradation with nutrients either adsorbed on soil particles or in the soluble form comino et al 2016 in this study the coefficients of determination r2 between precipitation volumes and tn and tp loads were 0 704 and 0 657 respectively which indicates that the effects of precipitation amount on nutrient losses are strong but that they are not the only influencing factor for nutrient loads the frequency of extremely dry and wet events will increase in the future which may be another factor that increases the decomposition and flushing of organic matter and pollutants to surface runoff and may lead to increased nutrient loads in streams jayakody et al 2014 high intensity rainfall after a long dry period will increase pollutant loads into streams as the first flush occurs after long term accumulation this process will lead to immediate high concentrations of pollutants in surface water generally climate change represented by increasing precipitation volume and intensity and increasing temperature will lead to higher sediment yield and more nutrient losses into surface runoff because high intensity rainfall and extremely high temperatures will primarily occur in summer tn and tp loads will significantly increase during this period fig 4 the increase in temperature due to climate change will contribute to nutrient transformation among different forms especially the mineralization processes that are directly related to soil temperature and the nutrient releases related to organic matter transport in this study tn and tp loads increased by 3 77 and 4 51 for each unit increase in temperature fig 6 b this illustrates that changes in nutrient loads not only depend critically on precipitation but also significantly on changes in temperature in the mrw this result was supported by other studies kim et al 2015 klik and eitzinger 2010 panagopoulos et al 2015 under warmer and wetter conditions plant and microbial biomass utilize dissolved nutrients rapidly which coupled with reduced mineralization and nitrification from fresh organic nutrient dudula and randhir 2016 zessner et al 2017 whereas organic nutrients were the main pattern of nutrient losses in the mrw rainfall instead of snowfall will be the main form of precipitation in winter as temperature increases which will contribute to an increase in runoff and then lead to an increase in nutrient loads in winter although nutrient concentrations will remain stable compared to the baseline period 3 4 impacts of climate change on bmp efficiency because watershed hydrology and water quality will be impacted by climate variability future climate change must be a factor in designing watershed management strategies to protect water quantity and quality in the miyun reservoir to meet the increasing water supply demands of beijing quantifying the influence of climate change on bmp performance is important for managing water resources and developing cost effective bmp scenarios to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water quality in the future on the basis of local surface and pollution characteristics stakeholders preferences for bmps and socio economic conditions we selected several potentially feasible watershed management practices to evaluate their efficiencies in reducing sediment and nutrient loads under future climate conditions including land management practices such as conservation tillage ct residue management rm converting farmland to forestland over slopes of 15 and 25 cff15 and cff25 contour farming cf strip cropping ac nutrient management practices such as reducing fertilizer use by 20 and 30 fr20 and fr30 and structural bmps such as filter strips with widths of 5 m 10 m and 15 m fs5m fs10m and fs15m grassed waterways gw constructed wetlands cw and detention basins db bmp efficiency was simulated using the bmp representation tool or module in the calibrated swat model arnold et al 2012b renkenberger et al 2017 as shown in fig s6 in the supplementary material and table 4 the efficiency of each bmp varied over a wide range depending on climatic conditions compared to the results for baseline climate fig s5 in the supplementary material bmp efficiencies tended to decrease under climate variability especially those of structural bmps because these practices control water quality components by intercepting runoff which will decrease in the future a filter strip is a vegetated strip established in the vicinity of farmland or on both sides of a stream to remove sediment and contaminants from surface runoff usda nrcs 2016 as shown in table 4 the efficiency of filter strips in reducing pollutant loads decreased in the future for example a fs5m had mean removal rates of 15 22 15 64 and 13 49 for sediment load in the three future periods but a rate of 17 64 under baseline climate however when the width was increased filter strip efficiencies in the future approached to that of the baseline case for example a fs15m had mean removal rates of 35 28 35 69 and 31 30 for sediment load in the three periods compared to a rate of 35 96 in the baseline climate and the decrease in efficiencies for tn and tp loads was negligible the efficiency of filter strips decreased as the number of rainfall and runoff events increased this result was supported by previous studies jayakody et al 2014 magette et al 1989 gws are channels constructed with covering vegetation to slow water velocity and reduce gully erosion usda nrcs 2016 according to table 4 although gws were effective in reducing sediment and nutrient losses their efficiency decreased with higher rainfall intensity under future climate change with decreases of 5 89 and 9 67 respectively in tn and tp removal this result was consistent with other studies wallace et al 2017 dbs are an important component that increases water self purification capacity by retaining runoff sediments nutrients and other pollutants usda nrcs 2016 according to the results in table 4 db has an excellent pollutant reduction effect especially for sediment load with mean removal rates of 41 52 41 99 and 36 82 in the three future periods respectively a db constructed to collect and store storm water sediment or debris to preserve ditches streams and reservoirs in this process nutrients are removed by filtering through soils and vegetation and their microbial processes with mean removal rates of 38 85 33 41 and 36 60 for tn load and 28 22 27 89 and 27 56 for tp load in the three future periods respectively compared to the baseline results nutrient removal rates were decreased due to short retention time caused by high rainfall intensity and high flow velocity given the future climate in the mrw similar results in assessments of other structural bmps such as cws and dbs were obtained in other studies forsee and ahmad 2011 liu et al 2017 filter strips cws gws and dbs yielded significant lag times and significant reductions in peak flow which encouraged infiltration and retention and resulted in substantial reductions in sediment and nutrient loads charlesworth 2010 liu et al 2017 however an increase in precipitation intensity leads to a rapid runoff on slopes and this process shortens residence time of runoff flowing across these structures which is not conducive for their effectiveness therefore the increasing frequency of rainfall events especially extreme rainfall events in future climate may decrease the efficiency of these bmps in the mrw nevertheless the structural bmps produced substantial positive consequences by increasing water sediment and nutrient retention in the watershed systems and preventing degradation of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems the swat model was set up using the same geographical information such as dem land use and soil type data and the same crop management schemes in the baseline and future climates which was expected to determine similar sources of pollutants and soil disturbance in current and future periods non structural bmps such as land management and nutrient management practices specialize in controlling pollution loadings by preventing soil erosion limiting soil disturbing activities controlling pollutant sources such as fertilizers and manures and increasing the efficiency of use of soil nutrients therefore these practices have equivalent efficiency in reducing sediment and nutrient loads under future climate conditions compared to baseline climate however decreasing runoff availability for practices relying on runoff management leads to a decrease in their efficiencies results indicate that applying ct to all crops in the mrw reduces sediment tn and tp loads by 9 85 7 64 and 7 54 on average in future periods similar sediment and nutrient load reductions were achieved when rm practices were implemented several studies have shown similar results in terms of percent reduction in sediment and nutrient losses due to the application of no tillage conservation tillage or residue management at watershed scale chen et al 2016 dechmi and skhiri 2013 wagena and easton 2018 the increase in sediment and nutrient losses was attributed to higher rainfall intensity related to changing climate use of a conservation tillage system increased residue cover which contributed to more infiltration and nutrient transport in the subsurface soil reforestation has potentially positive implications for climate change mitigation related to reduced greenhouse gas or carbon emissions mbow et al 2014 it also reduces topsoil erosion reduces fertilizer input facilitates nutrient cycling and enhances soil fertility in the mrw cff25 reduced average annual sediment yields by 11 32 11 77 and 10 02 respectively in the three future periods at sub basin scale tn loads by 7 68 7 29 and 7 46 and tp loads by 6 70 7 11 and 6 15 with respect to the scenario without any bmps cff25 as shown in table 4 cff15 achieved higher reductions due to the larger reforested land area with mean annual reductions of 14 42 15 01 and 12 76 for sediment yields respectively in the three future periods 11 76 8 17 and 7 62 for tn loads and 7 18 8 21 and 6 29 for tp loads cff15 as shown in table 4 these results were supported by other studies huang et al 2017 mbow et al 2014 generally the efficiency of reforestation practices decreased compared to baseline results because of an increase in overall pollutant loads and a decrease in infiltration and adsorption due to the short residence times of runoff flowing through forestland which was caused by significantly higher rainfall intensity and flow velocity compared to structural bmps ct and conversion to forestland were the sustainable soil land management systems under future climatic conditions with small adaptations these results were supported by other studies klik and eitzinger 2010 cf and ac are very effective in reducing sheet and rill erosion from water and wind these two practices can be used to control nps pollution by reducing transport of sediment other solids the contaminants attached to them and other water borne contaminants as shown in table 4 10 82 of sediment 9 27 of tn and 10 24 of tp reductions were achieved by cf in the future climate and ac was able to reduce 10 80 of sediment 13 83 of tn and 11 90 of tp loads compared to baseline climate the efficiency of these two practices would be decreased under future climates extreme heavy rainfall events may decrease effectiveness with the number of runoff events increasing in the future this can be explained by turbulent runoff that is not conducive to water infiltration rao et al 2015 at present large amounts of urea and manures are being applied to corn walnuts and chestnuts in the mrw at annual rates of 200 475 kg ha based on the field survey for this reason nutrient management practices with a reduced application rate of 20 or 30 are recommended according to table 4 nutrient management practices had no dominant impact on sediment loss however their efficiency was evident in that 12 89 13 87 and 14 85 of tn removal and 14 66 14 23 and 13 80 of tp removal could be achieved by fr20 in the three future periods respectively moreover comparing the results of the three periods we found that efficiency of tn removal by fr20 was increased in mid period whereas efficiency of tp removal was reduced in both mid and late periods these results were similar to those in other studies dechmi and skhiri 2013 jayakody et al 2014 rocha et al 2015 in this study with an increase in sediment and nutrient loads under climate variability non structural bmps alone will not be sufficient for watershed management and water quality improvement targets although they were effective as sustainable management systems under both current and future climate conditions however there were uncertainties associated with conservation practice performance land cover and soil fertility are compounded by changes in future climate and therefore bmp efficiency in this study was inconsistent with other studies wallace et al 2017 the effects of climate change on conservation practices are not fully understood despite many efforts to model climate analogs and future climate impacts mbow et al 2014 yang et al 2018 the uncertainties of assessing bmp efficiency in reducing sediment and nutrient losses were not accounted for in this study 3 5 potential bmp configurations for adaptation to climate change no single solution or practice meets all future challenges especially under changing climate the best strategy is to integrate adaptation options for different situations by combining different practices this study used a bmp optimization framework to determine potential bmp configurations at sub basin scale to achieve water quality improvement targets while minimizing economic cost fig 10 a shows the costs associated with pareto optimality front solutions and the various pollutant loads obtained by implementing these solutions the tn load was linearly correlated with tp load the non structural bmps were first selected in the evolutionary process because of their low cost characteristics after which structural bmps were included in the bmp combinations as the pollutant removal targets increased due to their high efficiencies in controlling nutrient losses however structural bmps can contribute to high total cost of the optimized results according to the water quality improvement targets in the near middle and far future periods three feasible solutions with minimum costs were selected as the bmp combinations to configure within the mrw at sub basin scale fig 10 b c and d non structural bmps were extensively used in all sub basins and two or more of them were implemented in critical source areas as increases in pollutant removal were required more structural bmps were involved in the solutions resulting in higher implementation costs of the bmp combinations these results indicated that effective watershed management could first be achieved through a combination of non structural bmps to reach further tn and tp reductions a combination of structural bmps was suggested for the entire catchment almost all sub basins implemented more than two non structural bmps such as rf20 or fr30 and ct which were always included in each optimal solution even from an early evolutionary point expensive practices including db fs of 5 m and 10 m and cw were suggested for inclusion in sub basins that were identified as critical source areas or priority control areas to achieve control targets for nps pollution generally the spatial distributions of non structural bmps differed in the three future periods whereas the distributions of structural bmps were similar in areas identified as the highly polluted sub basins this result was supported by other studies chen et al 2016 qiu et al 2018 due to strict water quality targets in the middle future more structural bmps such as dbs fs15m and cws were configured in highly polluted areas especially in the chao river sub watershed and many non structural bmps were replaced by structural ones that achieved higher removal rates fig 10 c which further contributed to higher implementation cost the implementation cost of bmp schemes for the middle century increased by 13 47 and 7 83 respectively compared to those for the baseline period and the early century 4 conclusions the gcms for climate variability prediction and the swat model for simulations of watershed hydrology and water quality were used to assess the impacts of climate change on hydrology diffuse pollution and bmp efficiency in the mrw during 2020 2099 in this study under rcp 8 5 water balance and water quality components were impacted by the extent of climate change which was reflected in significant increases in precipitation amount and temperature in the future average change rates of annual runoff for all sub basins were 30 14 22 17 and 3 97 during the near middle and far future periods respectively the decrease in runoff was driven by a large increase in et due to significantly increasing temperature rather than by the small increase in precipitation sediment tn and tp loads at sub basin scale were increased on average by 12 95 7 26 and 9 56 respectively under future climate variability which was consistent with precipitation trends these results indicated a strong effect of precipitation on sediment and nutrient losses by the substantial impact of raindrops that directly dislodge and splash soil particles and the contaminants attached to them into runoff and streams in addition it was concluded that a unit increase in temperature will lead to 10 11 3 77 and 4 51 increases in sediment tn and tp loads respectively temperature affects sediment yields and nutrient losses by altering soil structure and soil water content and contributing to transformation of various forms of nutrients under different soil temperatures with respect to climate change effects on bmp scenarios the projected changes in future climate resulted in only slight variations in bmp efficiency relative to baseline climate implementing non structural bmps individually such as ct cff15 cff25 cf ac rm and fr20 fr30 had substantial effects on water quality in surface runoff at the watershed outlet however structural bmps were more effective dbs were the most effective in reducing sediment loss and fss had the greatest effect on reducing nutrient losses extreme runoff events caused by high intensity rainfall in the future could potentially decrease bmp effectiveness the simulated efficiencies were used to optimize bmp configurations for adaptation to climate change more bmps especially structural ones were identified in critical source areas the number of bmps implemented increased as the targeted reductions of nutrient loads increased filter strips of 15 m were added in the optimized scenarios that achieved high levels of improvement almost all sub basins needed two or more non structural bmps to achieve water quality targets in the three future periods this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on nps pollution and bmp efficiency at sub basin level simulated bmps were effective in reducing sediment and nutrient losses simultaneously under baseline and future climate scenarios however implementation of conservation practices may not be as effective in mitigating the loads of unintended pollutants that could impair water quality further research will focus on reducing the loads of these pollutants such as fecal coliform pesticides heavy metals and pahs declaration of interests none acknowledgements this project was supported by the

6502,climate change in terms of changes in temperature and patterns of precipitation has significant impacts on water resources and watershed ecosystems adapting to climate change is becoming an important strategy for watershed management the goal of this study was to quantify the impacts of climate change on watershed hydrological processes and water quality to evaluate the efficiency of best management practices bmps and the possible effects of a changing climate and to configure cost effective bmps at sub basin scale using a multi objective optimization method to mitigate climate effects on water resource the soil and water assessment tool swat model was used to simulate the possible effects of changing climate on watershed hydrological and water quality processes and adaptation options in the miyun reservoir watershed mrw climate change had significant impacts on water balance components such as precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration et and on water quality components such as sediment and nutrient loads a substantial decreasing trend of runoff indicated that the miyun reservoir faced a more acute challenge of insufficient water supply capacity compared with baseline climate climate change represented by precipitation and temperature regimes resulted in substantial increases in sediment load 12 95 and nutrient losses 7 26 for tn and 9 56 for tp on average all sub basins climate variability had significant effects on bmp efficiency through effects on watershed hydrology soil erosion and nutrient losses results highlight the importance of optimal configuration of site specific bmps at sub basin scale for adaptation to climate change the methods and findings presented here hold promise to enhance the resilience of the watershed system to current and future climate change keywords climate change nonpoint source pollution bmp efficiency bmp optimization miyun reservoir watershed 1 introduction in recent years water resources at global scale have come under considerable stress from altered hydrological and diffused pollution conditions resulting from climate change changes in streamflow water temperature and water quality due to climate change will contribute to uncertainties in water supply and ecosystem health the miyun reservoir watershed mrw is the water protection area of the miyun reservoir which supplies clean drinking water for a population of 21 75 million and is used to support rapid economic development in china s capital beijing diffused pollution from the upstream catchment by climate forcing such as precipitation and temperature including soil erosion nutrient releases from fields casual wastewater discharges and pollution washed out by rainfall and runoff is the major threat to the water resources in the miyun reservoir because it potentially causes eutrophication lv et al 2016 water supply shortages and gradual deterioration in water quality in the miyun reservoir have further threatened beijing s drinking water security ma et al 2010 reported that climate variability contributed to 55 of the decrease in inflow into the miyun reservoir during 1956 2005 the impacts of climate change on water quality in the miyun reservoir have been understudied the advent of climate change has affected precipitation patterns with regard to frequency strength spatial range and duration which will have substantial effects on hydrology and water quality including surface runoff soil erosion and contaminant transport and deposition processes increased temperatures may affect the interactions among biological physical and chemical components and cause shifts in the timing of runoff peaks by changing the timing of snowmelt especially in specific watersheds where precipitation is winter dominant and stored in snowpack dudula and randhir 2016 kim et al 2015 adapting to climate change is becoming an important concern or strategy to manage runoff and nonpoint source nps pollution in watershed systems the configuration of effective best management practices bmps at sub basin level can help mitigate the impact of climate change on watershed hydrology and water quality climate change is involved in evaluating of hydrological and water quality processes at catchment to regional scale and even the continental scale based on process based models and statistical methods derived from long term historical data sun et al 2016 the soil and water assessment tool swat model is an integrated assessment tool that couples climate forcing land surface characteristics and point source pollution inputs which are important for representing watershed hydrological cycle and sediment pesticide nitrogen and phosphorus transport processes at a variety of spatial and temporal scales arnold et al 1998 hashemi et al 2016 volk et al 2017 furthermore the swat model has been proven effective for evaluating bmps under complex terrains and varying climatic conditions in agriculture dominant watersheds jayakody et al 2014 panagopoulos et al 2015 this study used the swat model to assess the impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality and evaluate the impacts of bmps on developing adaptation strategies at sub basin scale in the mrw bmps can be implemented individually or designed as a management system in which case individual practices are linked together or distributed as a spatial network achieving complete control at source field path watershed and regional scales these practices can also be used in mitigating and adapting to climate change by regulating climate intercepting runoff trapping sediment and sequestering nutrients charlesworth 2010 the negative impacts of climate change are strengthening resulting in changes in hydrology increasing pollutant loads pressure on drinking water security and a significant economic cost for revitalizing degraded environments it is therefore imperative to understand and quantify the impacts of climate change to develop an effective management plan for water resources kiedrzynska et al 2015 saraswat et al 2016 valcu lisman et al 2017 a number of approaches are provided to develop sustainable watershed management systems accounting for both environmental and economic benefits haas et al 2017 liu et al 2017 valcu lisman et al 2017 the simulation optimization framework proposed by qiu et al 2018 serves as a multi objective optimization tool based on the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii for exploring tradeoffs among economic costs water quality improvements and decision makers concerns regarding bmp design by coordination across sub watersheds nsga ii is often used to optimize bmp selection and placement at watershed scale due to its global optimization ability to address multi objective and high dimensional problems with the crowded comparison operator and to find true pareto optimal solutions with a limited number of simulation runs deb et al 2002 this framework used the nsga ii expanded with an auto adaptive control parameter adjustment algorithm to generate spatial bmp configurations at sub basin scale hence this approach was used here to explore optimal bmps considering water quality responses to climate change the future climate change scenarios were driven by multiple representative concentration pathways rcps that depend on specific greenhouse gas concentrations to reach a particular radiative forcing in the year 2100 future climate variability can be predicted by general circulation models gcms based on rcp scenarios the outputs of which should be downscaled and bias corrected across a dense grid overlaid on the study area the bias correction algorithm with spatial disaggregation helps correct the future climate data by the transfer factors constructed between gcms and actual historical observations hempel et al 2013 leng and tang 2014 the future time series of climate variables are added into the watershed models e g swat to evaluate long term changes in surface runoff streamflow and water quality to develop adaptation strategies for the climate variability that are site specific to sub basins this paper evaluates the impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality and the efficiency of bmps in mitigating these impacts in an agriculture dominated watershed specifically the mrw will be taken as the study area to explore potential adaptation strategies through bmp configurations at sub basin scale in near middle and far future periods the objectives of the study are to 1 simulate

description the mrw 40 19 41 36 n and 115 27 117 35 e is located across beijing and hebei province it consists of two sub watersheds the chao river sub watershed and the bai river sub watershed which are the upstream catchments of the miyun reservoir and cover an area of 5892 97 km2 and 9030 98 km2 respectively the miyun reservoir is the largest reservoir in northern china and the most important potable water source for beijing many studies have stated that climate variations contributed to large decreases in runoff in the historical period and seriously affected beijing s water supply ma et al 2010 zheng et al 2016 changes in hydrology strongly influence water quality processes in a watershed system especially nps pollution driven by precipitation and runoff geng et al 2015 geographical information including topography land use and soil type was used to set up the swat model topographic data were represented by a 90 m spatial resolution digital elevation model dem obtained from the national geomatics center of china land use data referred to a 1 100 000 digital land use map fig s1 in the in the supplementary material obtained from the institute of geographical and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences soil type information was extracted from a 1 1 000 000 digital soil map of china which was provided by the fao harmonized world soil database soil properties were obtained from the soil research institute of the chinese academy of sciences or calculated by the spaw soil plant air water model saxton and rawls 2006 historic hydrological and water quality data from the survey stations located at the outlets of the two upstream sub watersheds were used to develop a calibrated model observed daily weather data were provided by gauges scattered throughout the watershed future climate variability projections separately generated by five gcms were used to assess climate effects for the period 2020 2099 table s1 in the supplementary material gives a description of the database for the swat setup 2 2 model description the swat model was developed by the usda agricultural research service usda ars and texas a m university and is continuously upgraded with interfaces in combination with arcgis arnold et al 2012a it is a process based model that simulates water quantity and pollutant transport and predicts the impacts of land surface characteristics climate change and management practices at watershed scale arnold et al 1998 in the swat model a watershed is divided into multiple sub basins based on topographic information and sub basins are further subdivided into small units called hydrologic response units hrus which are homogeneous areas processing unique land cover soil type slope and landscape characteristics for simulations of the hydrological cycle and pollutant transport through the land phase and the channel network arnold et al 2012a in this study the swat model was calibrated and validated with observed historical climate data for periods of 1990 1998 and 1999 2010 respectively more details of parameter sensitivity tables s2 and s3 and model calibration and validation were given in the supplementary material following calibration the baseline 1980 2004 and future climate data 2020 2099 from the five gcms were input into the model to identify the impacts of climate change on water balance water quality and bmp efficiency in the mrw and to avoid the potential bias that was caused by running a present day model with future climate inputs driven by the downscaled gcms swat accounts for a wide array of land nutrient and structural management practices to assess the efficiencies of bmps in controlling the amount of runoff and pollutant losses entering channels in watersheds by calculating changes in water quantity and quality with and without bmp waidler et al 2011 table s4 in the supplementary material shows the modules and key parameters for bmp assessment 2 3 climate change scenarios bias corrected future climate data at daily time step including precipitation air temperature maximum and minimum solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were provided at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution from five gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipslcm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m that are recommended in the framework of the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip table s5 in supplementary material the gcms were driven by the four representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 very low greenhouse gas concentrations van vuuren et al 2007 rcp 4 5 medium low greenhouse gas concentrations smith and wigley 2006 rcp 6 0 medium high greenhouse gas concentrations hijioka et al 2008 and rcp 8 5 high greenhouse gas concentrations riahi et al 2007 a distribution based bias correction algorithm was used to correct the climate data from gcms which were used to ensure that gcm data matched the climatology of the wfd water and global change watch forcing data over the reference period of 1960 1999 leng and tang 2014 in this method the derived correction factors linearly regressed between gcm and wfd were used to correct the projected gcm data for future periods details of the bias correction algorithm are given in hempel et al 2013 the rcps are consistent with certain socio economic assumptions and possible changes in future greenhouse gas emissions from anthropogenic activities and aim to represent the atmospheric concentrations that drive possible changes in temperature and precipitation in future periods van vuuren et al 2011 rcp 2 6 assumes that the concentrations peak during 2010 2020 and then substantially decline which contributes to the lowest possibility of climate change rcp 4 5 assumes that greenhouse gases peak around 2040 then decline which contributes to a low possibility of climate change rcp 6 0 assumes that the concentrations peak around 2080 then decline this process contributes to a large possibility of climate change rcp 8 5 assumes that greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise throughout the 21st century this scenario exhibits the highest levels of forcing and the largest possibility of climate change this study focused on climate variability driven by rcp 8 5 to assess the impacts of climate change on hydrology and water quality in the mrw 2 4 bmp optimization method this study used a bmp optimization approach to determine potential bmp configurations at sub basin scale to achieve the water quality improvement targets at the minimum economic cost details of this approach are available in qiu et al 2018 which proposed a systematic optimization framework combining a watershed model swat model an economic module farm level economic model fem a markov chain method and a modified non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii the swat model was used to evaluate the pollution reduction effects of candidate bmps the fem was used to evaluate the economic costs of bmps including construction cost maintenance cost and economic benefits the nsga ii algorithm expanded with an auto adaptive control parameter adjustment method chen et al 2015 was used to generate pareto optimal spatial bmp configurations to ensure that water quality improvement targets were met at multiple assessment points through coordinated optimization of the two upstream sub watersheds the markov chain method was used to calculate pollutant loads at the assessment points with various bmp configurations or no bmp scenario based on upstream and downstream information about the watershed chen et al 2016 fig s2 in the supplementary material illustrates this simulation optimization framework 3 results and discussion 3 1 future climate variability the nonparametric mann kendall mk test kendall 1975 mann 1945 was used to determine the significance of trends in mean annual precipitation prec annual rainfall days in different rain patterns annual maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and mean temperature t from 2020 to 2099 table 1 shows the long term annual trend test results at the 5 significance level evaluated by the mk test from the time series of climate variables in the mrw that were predicted by the five gcms there was an uptrend in annual precipitation under rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 scenarios but not a significant one with mean annual change of 0 732 0 625 and 0 602 mm year respectively and a significant upward trend with 0 881 mm year for rcp 8 5 which can be attributed to the increase in the frequency of rainfall events especially extremes such as heavy rain and rainstorms the mean changes in annual days of heavy rain were 0 039 0 036 0 039 and 0 047 days year for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 respectively and the mean changes of rainstorm events were 0 011 0 011 0 014 and 0 019 days year for these four rcp scenarios respectively which indicated an uptrend in the frequencies of heavy rain and rainstorm events these results were consistent with other applications in similar regions pan et al 2016 a remarkable increase in frequency of rainstorm and heavy rain events would cause increased soil erosion and water quality problems in the future fig 1 as shown in table 1 and fig 2 monthly temperatures significantly increased in all future scenarios compared with the baseline period and rcp 8 5 led to a most remarkable increase due to the highest greenhouse gas concentrations july and august were the warmest months in the baseline period but in future climate the warmest months will extend over a long period from june to september as shown in fig 3 a substantial increase in the rate of change of tmin prompted a substantial increase in average temperature in rcp 8 5 and the amounts of precipitation showed a critical increasing trend significant variations in precipitation and temperature driven by rcp 8 5 scenario will have substantial impacts on watershed hydrology and pollutant transport and transformation processes through soil erosion runoff and washoff therefore this study focused on the impacts of climate change driven by rcp 8 5 3 2 water balance under the impacts of climate variability the calibration and validation of monthly hydrological and pollutant simulations were evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency ens which are listed in table 2 the majority of the statistics satisfied the judging criteria for model performance although sediment results were distinctly weaker mainly affected by the paucity of observed sediment data and the shorter simulation periods for both calibration 2006 2008 and validation 2009 2010 these results indicate that swat could accurately simulate the hydrology and contaminants in the mrw the calibrated swat model was used to simulate the water balance under the various climate change scenarios table 3 shows mean annual simulated water balance components integrated from all the simulated results based on future climate data from the five gcms on average annual precipitation in future climate ranged from a minimum of 582 44 mm to a maximum of 701 97 mm this corresponds to changes of 3 64 24 91 relative to baseline climate precipitation increased during the colder period of the year fig 4 which was clearly caused by a consistent increase in temperature across all the gcms given the fact that precipitation increased in all the cold months when snowfall can occur this contributed to a reduction in snowfall within the cold period of the year table 3 implies substantial increases in et and pet with changes of 9 74 and 3 02 this result occurred because all the gcms predicted high temperature and net radiation increases in future periods which have a direct impact on et and pet in the mrw the greater increase in et fig 4 in winter and spring was primarily driven by the significantly increased temperature during this period which was consistent with the great increase in tmin noted in section 3 1 yielding large changes in annual et the small et increase in summer and autumn compared to spring and winter is also worth noting this can be explained by the observation that almost all gcms predicted greater temperature increases within the cooler part of the year with direct impact on snowfall but lesser temperature increases in the warmer part of the year which in combination do not result in considerably altered et values in this period these results were consistent with other studies panagopoulos et al 2015 on the other hand the small increase in et can also be attributed to the small increase in precipitation water inputs within the warmer period rather than to increased temperatures mean annual runoff in different sub basins predicted by the gcms manifested a greater deviation compared to the baseline climate ranging from a 53 48 decrease to a 55 36 increase in the sub basins fig 5 runoff decreased by 18 83 on average in all sub basins under the future climate with average change rates of 30 14 22 17 and 3 97 in the near middle and far future periods respectively which was inconsistent with the increase of precipitation although runoff tended to rise throughout the future period along with the continued increase of precipitation this shows that runoff production is driven not only by water inputs into the basin following the precipitation predicted by different gcms but also by other hydrological factors such as the frequencies of different rain patterns throughout the year gao et al 2018 rainfall intensity aguilar et al 2016 et amount milly and dunne 2016 soil properties infiltration rate grillakis et al 2016 and surface characteristics sofia et al 2019 this study analyzed changes in water balance components to explain the decrease in runoff the decrease in generated runoff during june september was driven by a small increase in precipitation and a relatively large increase in et which was caused by a consistent increase in temperature across the future periods predicted by all gcms fig 6 a shows a substantial mean increase of 4 10 in et under unit increasing temperature but a small increase of 1 79 in precipitation volume increasing water input less than water loss was bound to cause a decrease of 9 01 in runoff yields for a unit increase in temperature fig 6 a this result further implied that climate warming plays a crucial role in significantly reducing streamflow zheng et al 2016 the substantially higher temperatures in the coldest months contributed to more precipitation falling as rain than as snow this result caused a small decrease in runoff in winter however the low frequency of snowfall caused snowmelt runoff in spring to decrease which was characterized as a substantial decrease in runoff fig 4 in addition reductions in water yield were likely exacerbated by increased water consumption for domestic and industrial uses in this watershed zheng et al 2016 a significant decreasing streamflow trend indicated that the miyun reservoir would face further challenges of insufficient water supply capacity to meet water demands for the ecosystem agriculture and domestic and industrial use the change trends implied that climate change must be considered in watershed management strategies to ensure sufficient water supply capacity of the miyun reservoir to meet increasing future water demands generally the spatial distribution of runoff fig 5 was in agreement with the spatial distributions of land uses fig s1 in the supplementary material forestland in the upstream sub basins had an important function in water conservation and effectively reduced runoff due to the high vegetation coverage and the areas with high runoff were concentrated in the downstream sub basins where land uses were dominated by cropland with poor water retaining capacity due to frequent agricultural activities and low vegetation coverage 3 3 pollutant losses under impacts of climate variability the calibrated swat model was used to evaluate pollutant losses under the baseline climate in gcm reference period of 1980 2004 sediment losses ranged from 0 69 to 199 26 t ha and came mainly from agricultural land tn and tp losses in the baseline period were predicted to range from 1 23 to 24 04 kg ha and from 0 08 to 6 88 kg ha respectively the sediment and nutrient losses were higher in the sub basins where agricultural land accounted for a large area the contributions of different land covers were ranked as follows cropland barren land pastureland forestland residential areas fig s4 in the supplementary material shows the spatial distributions of pollution loadings in the baseline climate fig 7 shows the distribution of mean annual sediment yields in the mrw for the predicted climates compared to the results for the baseline climate the mean annual rates of change at sub basin scale were 10 41 4 73 and 44 52 in the near middle and far future periods respectively sediment loads at sub basin scale were significantly increased by 12 95 under future climate variability compared to the distribution of land cover fig s1 in the supplementary material the areas with high load intensity were distributed in the sub basins with large areas of agricultural land where soil erosion was prone to occur due to low vegetation coverage and increased frequency of heavy rain and rainstorms in future periods this result played an important role in the spatial configuration of bmp the spatial distribution of sediment load intensity was similar to that of precipitation fig s3 in the supplementary material in the three periods although runoff shows a downward trend and has substantial effects on the decrease of sediment load in the near future period the increasing trend of sediment load is consistent with that of precipitation coefficient of determination r2 0 605 which indicates that swift erosion of topsoil by rain was the main reason for the aggravation of soil erosion in future periods the impact of millions of raindrops directly hitting the bare soil surface can be incredibly strong as they dislodge and splash soil particles into runoff and streams this finding is similar to other future predictions that reported that increasing precipitation amount and intensity would increase sediment load in the future kim et al 2015 yasarer et al 2017 on the other hand it cannot be ignored that temperature has a strong influence on sediment yields and nutrient losses by altering soil parameters such as soil water content and soil temperature klik and eitzinger 2010 in this study a unit increase in temperature was found to lead to a 10 11 increase in sediment load in the future period fig 6 b figs 8 and 9 present the mean annual tn and tp losses to waters for the various sub basins the results indicated that the spatial distributions of nutrient loads in the three future periods were consistent with those in the baseline period fig s4 which were determined by surface characteristics land covers soil properties and the watershed hydrodynamic network in combination with agricultural activities and land management practices the highly polluted sub basins were dominated by cropland and barren land related to lower vegetation coverage high soil disturbance intensity and extensive application of fertilizers and manures these results determined the spatial variation of bmp configuration the mean change rates of annual tn and tp load intensities for all sub basins were 6 52 and 5 67 respectively in the near future 11 63 and 16 82 respectively in the middle future and 3 63 and 6 19 in the far future their mean rates of change over the entire future period were 7 26 and 9 56 respectively the distributions of nutrient load intensities were similar to those of sediment yields which indicates that nutrient losses are closely related to soil degradation with nutrients either adsorbed on soil particles or in the soluble form comino et al 2016 in this study the coefficients of determination r2 between precipitation volumes and tn and tp loads were 0 704 and 0 657 respectively which indicates that the effects of precipitation amount on nutrient losses are strong but that they are not the only influencing factor for nutrient loads the frequency of extremely dry and wet events will increase in the future which may be another factor that increases the decomposition and flushing of organic matter and pollutants to surface runoff and may lead to increased nutrient loads in streams jayakody et al 2014 high intensity rainfall after a long dry period will increase pollutant loads into streams as the first flush occurs after long term accumulation this process will lead to immediate high concentrations of pollutants in surface water generally climate change represented by increasing precipitation volume and intensity and increasing temperature will lead to higher sediment yield and more nutrient losses into surface runoff because high intensity rainfall and extremely high temperatures will primarily occur in summer tn and tp loads will significantly increase during this period fig 4 the increase in temperature due to climate change will contribute to nutrient transformation among different forms especially the mineralization processes that are directly related to soil temperature and the nutrient releases related to organic matter transport in this study tn and tp loads increased by 3 77 and 4 51 for each unit increase in temperature fig 6 b this illustrates that changes in nutrient loads not only depend critically on precipitation but also significantly on changes in temperature in the mrw this result was supported by other studies kim et al 2015 klik and eitzinger 2010 panagopoulos et al 2015 under warmer and wetter conditions plant and microbial biomass utilize dissolved nutrients rapidly which coupled with reduced mineralization and nitrification from fresh organic nutrient dudula and randhir 2016 zessner et al 2017 whereas organic nutrients were the main pattern of nutrient losses in the mrw rainfall instead of snowfall will be the main form of precipitation in winter as temperature increases which will contribute to an increase in runoff and then lead to an increase in nutrient loads in winter although nutrient concentrations will remain stable compared to the baseline period 3 4 impacts of climate change on bmp efficiency because watershed hydrology and water quality will be impacted by climate variability future climate change must be a factor in designing watershed management strategies to protect water quantity and quality in the miyun reservoir to meet the increasing water supply demands of beijing quantifying the influence of climate change on bmp performance is important for managing water resources and developing cost effective bmp scenarios to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water quality in the future on the basis of local surface and pollution characteristics stakeholders preferences for bmps and socio economic conditions we selected several potentially feasible watershed management practices to evaluate their efficiencies in reducing sediment and nutrient loads under future climate conditions including land management practices such as conservation tillage ct residue management rm converting farmland to forestland over slopes of 15 and 25 cff15 and cff25 contour farming cf strip cropping ac nutrient management practices such as reducing fertilizer use by 20 and 30 fr20 and fr30 and structural bmps such as filter strips with widths of 5 m 10 m and 15 m fs5m fs10m and fs15m grassed waterways gw constructed wetlands cw and detention basins db bmp efficiency was simulated using the bmp representation tool or module in the calibrated swat model arnold et al 2012b renkenberger et al 2017 as shown in fig s6 in the supplementary material and table 4 the efficiency of each bmp varied over a wide range depending on climatic conditions compared to the results for baseline climate fig s5 in the supplementary material bmp efficiencies tended to decrease under climate variability especially those of structural bmps because these practices control water quality components by intercepting runoff which will decrease in the future a filter strip is a vegetated strip established in the vicinity of farmland or on both sides of a stream to remove sediment and contaminants from surface runoff usda nrcs 2016 as shown in table 4 the efficiency of filter strips in reducing pollutant loads decreased in the future for example a fs5m had mean removal rates of 15 22 15 64 and 13 49 for sediment load in the three future periods but a rate of 17 64 under baseline climate however when the width was increased filter strip efficiencies in the future approached to that of the baseline case for example a fs15m had mean removal rates of 35 28 35 69 and 31 30 for sediment load in the three periods compared to a rate of 35 96 in the baseline climate and the decrease in efficiencies for tn and tp loads was negligible the efficiency of filter strips decreased as the number of rainfall and runoff events increased this result was supported by previous studies jayakody et al 2014 magette et al 1989 gws are channels constructed with covering vegetation to slow water velocity and reduce gully erosion usda nrcs 2016 according to table 4 although gws were effective in reducing sediment and nutrient losses their efficiency decreased with higher rainfall intensity under future climate change with decreases of 5 89 and 9 67 respectively in tn and tp removal this result was consistent with other studies wallace et al 2017 dbs are an important component that increases water self purification capacity by retaining runoff sediments nutrients and other pollutants usda nrcs 2016 according to the results in table 4 db has an excellent pollutant reduction effect especially for sediment load with mean removal rates of 41 52 41 99 and 36 82 in the three future periods respectively a db constructed to collect and store storm water sediment or debris to preserve ditches streams and reservoirs in this process nutrients are removed by filtering through soils and vegetation and their microbial processes with mean removal rates of 38 85 33 41 and 36 60 for tn load and 28 22 27 89 and 27 56 for tp load in the three future periods respectively compared to the baseline results nutrient removal rates were decreased due to short retention time caused by high rainfall intensity and high flow velocity given the future climate in the mrw similar results in assessments of other structural bmps such as cws and dbs were obtained in other studies forsee and ahmad 2011 liu et al 2017 filter strips cws gws and dbs yielded significant lag times and significant reductions in peak flow which encouraged infiltration and retention and resulted in substantial reductions in sediment and nutrient loads charlesworth 2010 liu et al 2017 however an increase in precipitation intensity leads to a rapid runoff on slopes and this process shortens residence time of runoff flowing across these structures which is not conducive for their effectiveness therefore the increasing frequency of rainfall events especially extreme rainfall events in future climate may decrease the efficiency of these bmps in the mrw nevertheless the structural bmps produced substantial positive consequences by increasing water sediment and nutrient retention in the watershed systems and preventing degradation of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems the swat model was set up using the same geographical information such as dem land use and soil type data and the same crop management schemes in the baseline and future climates which was expected to determine similar sources of pollutants and soil disturbance in current and future periods non structural bmps such as land management and nutrient management practices specialize in controlling pollution loadings by preventing soil erosion limiting soil disturbing activities controlling pollutant sources such as fertilizers and manures and increasing the efficiency of use of soil nutrients therefore these practices have equivalent efficiency in reducing sediment and nutrient loads under future climate conditions compared to baseline climate however decreasing runoff availability for practices relying on runoff management leads to a decrease in their efficiencies results indicate that applying ct to all crops in the mrw reduces sediment tn and tp loads by 9 85 7 64 and 7 54 on average in future periods similar sediment and nutrient load reductions were achieved when rm practices were implemented several studies have shown similar results in terms of percent reduction in sediment and nutrient losses due to the application of no tillage conservation tillage or residue management at watershed scale chen et al 2016 dechmi and skhiri 2013 wagena and easton 2018 the increase in sediment and nutrient losses was attributed to higher rainfall intensity related to changing climate use of a conservation tillage system increased residue cover which contributed to more infiltration and nutrient transport in the subsurface soil reforestation has potentially positive implications for climate change mitigation related to reduced greenhouse gas or carbon emissions mbow et al 2014 it also reduces topsoil erosion reduces fertilizer input facilitates nutrient cycling and enhances soil fertility in the mrw cff25 reduced average annual sediment yields by 11 32 11 77 and 10 02 respectively in the three future periods at sub basin scale tn loads by 7 68 7 29 and 7 46 and tp loads by 6 70 7 11 and 6 15 with respect to the scenario without any bmps cff25 as shown in table 4 cff15 achieved higher reductions due to the larger reforested land area with mean annual reductions of 14 42 15 01 and 12 76 for sediment yields respectively in the three future periods 11 76 8 17 and 7 62 for tn loads and 7 18 8 21 and 6 29 for tp loads cff15 as shown in table 4 these results were supported by other studies huang et al 2017 mbow et al 2014 generally the efficiency of reforestation practices decreased compared to baseline results because of an increase in overall pollutant loads and a decrease in infiltration and adsorption due to the short residence times of runoff flowing through forestland which was caused by significantly higher rainfall intensity and flow velocity compared to structural bmps ct and conversion to forestland were the sustainable soil land management systems under future climatic conditions with small adaptations these results were supported by other studies klik and eitzinger 2010 cf and ac are very effective in reducing sheet and rill erosion from water and wind these two practices can be used to control nps pollution by reducing transport of sediment other solids the contaminants attached to them and other water borne contaminants as shown in table 4 10 82 of sediment 9 27 of tn and 10 24 of tp reductions were achieved by cf in the future climate and ac was able to reduce 10 80 of sediment 13 83 of tn and 11 90 of tp loads compared to baseline climate the efficiency of these two practices would be decreased under future climates extreme heavy rainfall events may decrease effectiveness with the number of runoff events increasing in the future this can be explained by turbulent runoff that is not conducive to water infiltration rao et al 2015 at present large amounts of urea and manures are being applied to corn walnuts and chestnuts in the mrw at annual rates of 200 475 kg ha based on the field survey for this reason nutrient management practices with a reduced application rate of 20 or 30 are recommended according to table 4 nutrient management practices had no dominant impact on sediment loss however their efficiency was evident in that 12 89 13 87 and 14 85 of tn removal and 14 66 14 23 and 13 80 of tp removal could be achieved by fr20 in the three future periods respectively moreover comparing the results of the three periods we found that efficiency of tn removal by fr20 was increased in mid period whereas efficiency of tp removal was reduced in both mid and late periods these results were similar to those in other studies dechmi and skhiri 2013 jayakody et al 2014 rocha et al 2015 in this study with an increase in sediment and nutrient loads under climate variability non structural bmps alone will not be sufficient for watershed management and water quality improvement targets although they were effective as sustainable management systems under both current and future climate conditions however there were uncertainties associated with conservation practice performance land cover and soil fertility are compounded by changes in future climate and therefore bmp efficiency in this study was inconsistent with other studies wallace et al 2017 the effects of climate change on conservation practices are not fully understood despite many efforts to model climate analogs and future climate impacts mbow et al 2014 yang et al 2018 the uncertainties of assessing bmp efficiency in reducing sediment and nutrient losses were not accounted for in this study 3 5 potential bmp configurations for adaptation to climate change no single solution or practice meets all future challenges especially under changing climate the best strategy is to integrate adaptation options for different situations by combining different practices this study used a bmp optimization framework to determine potential bmp configurations at sub basin scale to achieve water quality improvement targets while minimizing economic cost fig 10 a shows the costs associated with pareto optimality front solutions and the various pollutant loads obtained by implementing these solutions the tn load was linearly correlated with tp load the non structural bmps were first selected in the evolutionary process because of their low cost characteristics after which structural bmps were included in the bmp combinations as the pollutant removal targets increased due to their high efficiencies in controlling nutrient losses however structural bmps can contribute to high total cost of the optimized results according to the water quality improvement targets in the near middle and far future periods three feasible solutions with minimum costs were selected as the bmp combinations to configure within the mrw at sub basin scale fig 10 b c and d non structural bmps were extensively used in all sub basins and two or more of them were implemented in critical source areas as increases in pollutant removal were required more structural bmps were involved in the solutions resulting in higher implementation costs of the bmp combinations these results indicated that effective watershed management could first be achieved through a combination of non structural bmps to reach further tn and tp reductions a combination of structural bmps was suggested for the entire catchment almost all sub basins implemented more than two non structural bmps such as rf20 or fr30 and ct which were always included in each optimal solution even from an early evolutionary point expensive practices including db fs of 5 m and 10 m and cw were suggested for inclusion in sub basins that were identified as critical source areas or priority control areas to achieve control targets for nps pollution generally the spatial distributions of non structural bmps differed in the three future periods whereas the distributions of structural bmps were similar in areas identified as the highly polluted sub basins this result was supported by other studies chen et al 2016 qiu et al 2018 due to strict water quality targets in the middle future more structural bmps such as dbs fs15m and cws were configured in highly polluted areas especially in the chao river sub watershed and many non structural bmps were replaced by structural ones that achieved higher removal rates fig 10 c which further contributed to higher implementation cost the implementation cost of bmp schemes for the middle century increased by 13 47 and 7 83 respectively compared to those for the baseline period and the early century 4 conclusions the gcms for climate variability prediction and the swat model for simulations of watershed hydrology and water quality were used to assess the impacts of climate change on hydrology diffuse pollution and bmp efficiency in the mrw during 2020 2099 in this study under rcp 8 5 water balance and water quality components were impacted by the extent of climate change which was reflected in significant increases in precipitation amount and temperature in the future average change rates of annual runoff for all sub basins were 30 14 22 17 and 3 97 during the near middle and far future periods respectively the decrease in runoff was driven by a large increase in et due to significantly increasing temperature rather than by the small increase in precipitation sediment tn and tp loads at sub basin scale were increased on average by 12 95 7 26 and 9 56 respectively under future climate variability which was consistent with precipitation trends these results indicated a strong effect of precipitation on sediment and nutrient losses by the substantial impact of raindrops that directly dislodge and splash soil particles and the contaminants attached to them into runoff and streams in addition it was concluded that a unit increase in temperature will lead to 10 11 3 77 and 4 51 increases in sediment tn and tp loads respectively temperature affects sediment yields and nutrient losses by altering soil structure and soil water content and contributing to transformation of various forms of nutrients under different soil temperatures with respect to climate change effects on bmp scenarios the projected changes in future climate resulted in only slight variations in bmp efficiency relative to baseline climate implementing non structural bmps individually such as ct cff15 cff25 cf ac rm and fr20 fr30 had substantial effects on water quality in surface runoff at the watershed outlet however structural bmps were more effective dbs were the most effective in reducing sediment loss and fss had the greatest effect on reducing nutrient losses extreme runoff events caused by high intensity rainfall in the future could potentially decrease bmp effectiveness the simulated efficiencies were used to optimize bmp configurations for adaptation to climate change more bmps especially structural ones were identified in critical source areas the number of bmps implemented increased as the targeted reductions of nutrient loads increased filter strips of 15 m were added in the optimized scenarios that achieved high levels of improvement almost all sub basins needed two or more non structural bmps to achieve water quality targets in the three future periods this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on nps pollution and bmp efficiency at sub basin level simulated bmps were effective in reducing sediment and nutrient losses simultaneously under baseline and future climate scenarios however implementation of conservation practices may not be as effective in mitigating the loads of unintended pollutants that could impair water quality further research will focus on reducing the loads of these pollutants such as fecal coliform pesticides heavy metals and pahs declaration of interests none acknowledgements this project was supported by the

6503,crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and subsurface flow paths these lateral flow paths create zones of saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath the root zone despite its clear importance a spatially explicit representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from site specific crop and fertilizer management plans this work uses the grid based water balance model smr soil moisture routing to adapt an established method of hydrologic classification the budyko framework for small agricultural watersheds the model was evaluated with spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern palouse region of the inland pacific northwest the budyko framework modified to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow was combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a dual threshold classification scheme for variable rate fertilizer management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss potentials which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution respectively results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed within individual fields and between fields the greatest variability was observed in the two eastern most fields where the wettest zone of each had water supply 172 and 137 that of the dry zone depth to a hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary landscape controls on the water supply precipitation plus net lateral flow minus change in water storage in these fields moreover the steep climate gradient in the region created field to field variability in water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation ranging from 91 in the western most field to approximately 70 in each of the fields to the east the clearest choice is for growers to apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is minimal less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water storage capacity that frequently saturate areas with high storage capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting fertilizer application to avoid excessive over winter leaching losses even though remote sensing and variable rate applicators are at the frontiers of precision agriculture landscape hydrology underlies all dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for inspiration in the design of cropping systems keywords subfield scale hydrologic classification budyko framework lateral water redistribution site specific crop management spatially explicit model assessment 1 introduction strategies to improve site specific crop and fertilizer management in dryland cropping systems are often limited by the difficulty of capturing water flux and storage with sufficient spatial and temporal detail ibrahim and huggins 2011 from an agronomic perspective spatial variability in plant available water influences crop selection and crop yield response both of which dictate required amount and efficiency of applied fertilizer pan et al 2007 in complex landscapes with consistent yield variability growers can increase overall profit by adopting variable rate fertilizer strategies that vary fertilizer amount and potentially the timing of fertilizer application by zone within a field ward et al 2017 these strategies can also benefit the environment for example cutting application rates in zones most prone to fertilizer loss through runoff and leaching reduces nitrate loading to surface and groundwater receiving streams basso et al 2011 the management strategy of reducing fertilizer waste by matching inputs to crop yield patterns shares goals with the watershed management approach that targets hydrologically sensitive areas to minimize overall pollutant loading walter et al 2000 in fact the underlying mechanism that drives temporal and spatial patterns of crop yield in dryland ecosystems namely spatial structure of stored soil water also drives surface runoff patterns of landscapes dominated by variable source area hydrology hewlett and hibbert 1967 dunne and black 1970 dunne et al 1975 therefore classification systems used to assess best management practices in watershed management studies can potentially contribute to development of fertilizer management strategies great emphasis has been placed on hydrologic classification in the field of hydrology see sivakumar et al 2015 with most approaches focused on classifying basins rather than smaller field or hillslope scale units a well known classification scheme for describing ecosystem functioning at the basin scale was developed by budyko 1974 the budyko framework groups basins according to their partition of precipitation into evapotranspiration et and runoff under equilibrium conditions annual et is described as a function of water and energy supplies either one of which limits et depending on climate although this simple framework has been used to classify large geographic regions and river basins its use at smaller spatial scales and time scales has been limited in part because of the assumptions undergirding its formulation the budyko framework assumes i steady state conditions negligible change in water storage and ii closed system boundaries i e that precipitation is the only source of water assumption i is violated at short time scales where the dynamic relationship between soil moisture and vegetation plays an increasingly important role in the water cycle donohue et al 2007 an example is the cyclical pattern of water uptake by annual crops during the growing season followed by soil water recharge during the non growing season assumption ii is violated if attempting to apply the budyko framework to any specific point hillslope or sub basin where there is net inflow from surface runoff subsurface flow or groundwater flow du et al 2016 have demonstrated both assumptions can be relaxed if additional inflows and changes in storage are quantified they applied the budyko framework over six arid sub basins in china replacing the mean precipitation in budyko s equations with an equivalent precipitation p e which accounts for channel inflow q i n and change in soil water storage δ s 1 p e p q i n δ s du et al 2016 applied their modified budyko framework to each of the six sub basins at annual and monthly time scales a similar approach could be applied to points or zones within a field if net lateral fluxes and changes in seasonal water storage were quantified the classification of unique ecosystems or hydrologic zones within a field using the budyko framework could provide useful information to assist site specific agronomic management since the technology required to routinely measure net lateral water flux within a landscape does not exist to our knowledge the budyko approach has never been used to identify unique hydrologic zones within annually cropped fields spatially explicit process based hydrology models that use governing equations of flow and mass balance to simulate lateral redistribution of water within complex landscapes provide an opportunity to apply the budyko framework at site specific management scales despite clear benefits from a site specific agricultural management perspective of capturing subfield scale soil moisture storage and fluxes few distributed hydrologic models have been developed or applied to production agricultural fields these models must simulate lateral subsurface flow pathways if the hydrology of steep landscapes is to be adequately represented walter et al 2000 mehta et al 2004 brooks et al 2007 two distributed hydrologic models well suited for simulating lateral flow are the dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 and smr frankenberger et al 1999 models dhsvm has been primarily applied to forested mountainous regions while smr has been used in both the catskill mountains of new york frankenberger et al 1999 and in the gently rolling landscape of the palouse region brooks et al 2007 dijksma et al 2011 however neither model was developed for simulating subfield scale hydrologic variability of agricultural land under cereal grain production in this study we develop a subfield scale classification system that combines the budyko framework with spatially distributed hydrologic modeling our use of subfield scale encapsulates both the 10 10 m2 grid scale at which the water balance is modeled and the hydrologically similar groupings of these grid cells within a field occurring below the field scale the classification system delineates fields into unique management zones based on their characteristic hydrologic and agronomic response we discuss how this classification system can provide growers with insight into management approaches to increase overall profitability and minimize off site environmental impact the specific objectives of this study were to i assess the ability of a modified version of the smr model to capture subfield scale soil water storage and fluxes in a semi arid cereal grain production region ii develop an approach to apply the budyko framework at the subfield scale and iii demonstrate a classification scheme to support development and assessment of site specific management strategies in complex agroecosystems these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussion sections 2 background 2 1 budyko framework in his seminal work budyko 1974 developed and validated a framework in which the proportion of precipitation that evaporates and that becomes runoff is strongly a result of climate by using long term averages 1 year he assumed change in water storage to be a negligible part of the water balance so that mean precipitation p is the sum of mean evapotranspiration et and mean streamflow q 2 p et q the fraction of p that evaporates from earth s surface is called evaporative index et p this quantity is related to climate through the radiative index of dryness ϕ which budyko defined to be net radiation converted to water units r n λ divided by p the term r n λ represents the maximum possible et under given climatic conditions and is one representation of the more broadly used term potential evapotranspiration e t 0 in conditions of abundant moisture ϕ becomes very small and nearly all net radiation is consumed by evaporation this condition describes the energy limit of et eq 3 which is illustrated by line a of fig 1 3 et e t 0 as ϕ 0 under dry conditions ϕ becomes very large and nearly all precipitation evaporates this condition describes the water limit shown as line b of fig 1 and eq 4 4 et p as ϕ the vertical distance between line b and curve c i e 1 represents runoff loss or excess water in describing the mean annual water balance budyko 1974 sought an equation of relationship of the form f ϕ leading him to the hyperbolic relationship now known as the budyko curve studies have documented considerable deviations from budyko s curve due to the influences of climate seasonality milly 1994 potter et al 2005 yokoo et al 2008 shao et al 2012 soil properties milly 1994 jothityangkoon and sivapalan 2009 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 topography yang et al 2007 yokoo et al 2008 vegetation cover zhang et al 2001 donohue et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 and rainfall intensity koster and suarez 1999 porporato et al 2004 liu et al 2016 multiple studies have posited alternative mathematic relationships to the budyko curve based on analytical solutions to the coupled water energy balance e g fu 1981 yang et al 2008 each of which includes an additional shaping parameter the ability of these latter equations to predict the long term and annual water balances has generally been improved through studies that link the shaping parameter to landscape and climate controls zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2007 oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2009 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 found that precipitation seasonality the ratio of soil water holding capacity to precipitation topographic slope and the fraction of precipitation falling as snow explained 81 of the variability in the shaping parameter used to partition precipitation across the continental u s with the budyko framework vegetation plays a moderating role in et by tapping into water in the unsaturated zone soil plant interactions grow increasingly important at shorter time scales donohue et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 liu et al 2016 and at smaller spatial scales oudin et al 2008 donohue et al 2012 2 2 smr model overview smr is a distributed grid based water balance model well adapted to regions with steep sloping land and shallow soils it was developed as a spatially explicit management tool to inform management decisions addressing nonpoint source pollution from dairy farms in the catskill mountains of new york frankenberger et al 1999 walter et al 2000 as a management tool it was developed to be a relatively simple model with few parameters and requiring minimal calibration brooks et al 2007 frankenberger et al 1999 this 3d model simulates both vertical water fluxes within a grid cell e g rainfall snow accumulation and melt evapotranspiration deep percolation below the root zone as well as net lateral subsurface flow between cells surface runoff occurs in the landscape whenever the accumulated volume of soil water in a grid cell exceeds available pore space i e saturation excess runoff surface runoff is not explicitly routed overland to the outlet of the catchment but rather is assumed to reach the watershed outlet within the model timestep infiltration excess runoff is not directly simulated by the model which makes the model best suited to regions where the soil infiltration capacity is greater than the typical rainfall intensity boll et al 1998 frankenberger et al 1999 mehta et al 2004 subsurface lateral flow out of a grid cell is simulated using darcy s equation with hydraulic gradient equal to the land slope and routed to up to eight neighboring cells following the approach described in brooks et al 2007 variability in soil characteristics with depth e g bulk density and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity are represented by explicit functions the soil water balance in smr for each grid cell eq 5 consists of positive fluxes

al 1999 brooks and boll 2005 brooks et al 2007 3 study site and experimental measurements 3 1 study site the palouse the palouse region of the inland pacific northwest usa is famous for its rolling loess formed hills that support remarkable yields of soft white winter wheat washington wheat commission 2009 the moisture regime of the palouse region is dominated by low intensity storms klages 1942 distributed evenly between the fall winter and spring months united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service 2006 very little rain falls during the summer months when evaporative demand is greatest leading to a distinct wet and dry season mean annual precipitation map ranges from 450 mm in the western part of whitman county donaldson 1980 to more than 800 mm in the eastern part of latah county barker 1981 four small 30 ha fields in the dryland cropping region of eastern washington and northern idaho were selected for intensive hydrologic monitoring in cooperation with four private growers located near the towns of colfax wa genesee id troy id and leland id fig 2 each field comprises a distinct catchment so that the two terms field and catchment are used interchangeably throughout this paper the colfax and genesee fields are managed with no till practices in a continuous cereal wheat dominated crop rotation while the troy and leland fields are managed with minimal tillage in a wheat pulse crop rotation study sites capture a climate gradient across the southeastern part of the palouse river basin and its immediate vicinity from the drier lower elevation western part to the wetter higher elevation and slightly cooler eastern part an important feature of soils and hydrology of the eastern palouse is the presence of hydraulic restricting layers that form perched water tables in wet months perched water on sloping land drains into convergent downslope areas and subsequently generates saturation excess runoff hammermeister et al 1982 needelman et al 2004 gburek et al 2006 mcdaniel et al 2008 fig 2 shows 30 year map normals estimated from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism climate group 2012 for the region the field sites have highly variable terrain with slopes up to 45 observed at the colfax site 3 2 soil hydrological and meteorological measurements the ssurgo soil survey geographic database soil survey staff is of limited value for small scale applications where soil characteristics may change considerably over short distances therefore site specific measurements of bulk density bd and texture were acquired for each field and used to create input maps hydrological measurements for model validation were made within the field soil moisture depth to water table and at the catchment outlet surface runoff artificial drainage volumetric water content was measured at 12 instrumented sites per field microsites at 30 cm intervals to a depth of 150 cm we found that the accuracy of the 5te and 5tm soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa using the factory calibration was poor and improved the accuracy through site specific calibration with in season soil sampling depth to water table dtw was measured in shallow monitoring wells at microsites above hydraulically restrictive horizons the frequency of near surface saturation defined as dtw 30 cm was approximated as the percentage of time the moisture sensors installed at 30 cm read a saturated water content approximations were validated with periodic manual water table measurements surface runoff was measured at the catchment outlet of troy by a single 9 inch h flume and at genesee and leland catchments using a 6 inch parshall flume all four fields were equipped with a weather station which collected hourly precipitation air temperature wind speed and wind direction missing solar radiation humidity and temperature data were interpolated from several nearby stations whose data were accessed from washington state university s automated weather station network agweathernet or from ncdc national climatic data center managed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for a more comprehensive description of measurements undertaken at these fields sites refer to yourek 2016 a summary of measurements is provided in table 1 4 methodology 4 1 development and assessment of smr model for cropping systems 4 1 1 model modifications to improve simulation of et flux from a growing crop canopy the single layer approach of brooks et al 2007 was replaced by a two layer model the upper layer is a dynamic root zone that increases with depth as the crop matures a lower soil layer extends from the bottom of the root zone to the top of the hydraulically restrictive layer root zone depth increases linearly with time after planting to a maximum rooting depth at maturity during periods with no crop the root zone is fixed at 30 cm as with brooks et al 2007 percolation dp begins as soon as perched water just begins to form on the restricting layer upward redistribution of water into the root zone from the deep soil layer is not simulated subsurface lateral flow is calculated for the entire soil profile above the restricting layer following brooks et al 2007 and is apportioned among the two soil layers based on root zone depth and height of the perched water table vertical drainage q v e r t from the root zone to the deep soil layer occurs whenever the soil water storage in the root zone exceeds field capacity in the absence of snow cover e t a is calculated by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 using the single crop coefficient k c and the short grass reference et e t r once the soil water in the root zone drops below field capacity e t a is further reduced to account for water stress through the stress coefficient k s which is determined according to campbell and norman 1998 e t a is the product of k s k c and e t r 6 e t a k s k c e t r a thin top soil layer of 15 cm thickness controls evaporation from the soil surface during the period between harvest and planting of next season s crop non growing season the rate of e t a for non growing periods is determined according to eq 6 with k s based on the thresholds of allen et al 1998 after planting the thin top soil layer is removed from the model and all e t a occurs from the root zone when the surface is covered by snow evaporation condensation from the snow surface is calculated using a snowpack water and energy balance brooks and boll 2005 condensation is subtracted from e t a to preserve the mass balance the potential et e t 0 from the fao penman monteith method is 1 2 times e t r for snow free conditions while e t 0 from a snow covered surface is 1 2 times the e t r calculated using snow albedo allen et al 1998 7 e t 0 1 2 e t r combining the vertical water fluxes into and out of the root zone and deep soil layers with lateral flow q i n r z q o u t r z to from neighboring grid cells the mass balance for the root zone over timestep δ t becomes 8 δ s r z δ t p θ d δ z δ t q i n r z e t a q o u t r z q v e r t r o where the additional term δ z δ t θ d accounts for water added to root zone storage δ s r z as the roots grow by length δ z over time δ t into the deep layer at moisture content θ d cm cm 1 similarly the mass balance for the deep soil layer is 9 δ s d δ t q v e r t q i n d θ d δ z δ t q o u t d d p 4 1 2 model calibration the smr model was manually calibrated at each of the catchments for the combined 2012 2014 water years yourek 2016 the three calibration parameters were depth to restricting layer d maximum effective rooting depth z e m a x and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restricting layer k s a t r a restrictive soil layer was identified by a bd greater than 1 65 g cm3 according to natural resources conservation service 2008 for silt loam soils any soil lacking a well defined restrictive layer was assigned a soil depth of 150 cm corresponding with the deepest soil measurement and approximately equal to z e m a x of winter wheat we assumed that roots do not penetrate the restrictive layer the calibrated b d c z e m a x and k s a t r values are reported in section 3 1 4 1 3 model assessment the model was assessed based on its ability to simulate site specific hydrologic response e g soil moisture and dtw as well as the integrated response of surface runoff we adopted the criteria of moriasi et al 2007 where a model provides satisfactory predictions if the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for surface runoff is greater than 0 5 agreement between simulated and observed root zone water content was assessed using root mean square error rmse the spatial pattern of saturation frequency was assessed using both rmse and percent bias pbias as defined by equation 10 where x represents frequency in d yr 1 and the subscripts obs and sim are for observed and simulated respectively 10 pbias 100 x sim x obs x obs 4 2 budyko framework at the subfield scale the budyko framework was applied within individual catchments by replacing p with equivalent precipitation p e q which accounts for additional sources of water from net lateral subsurface flow q n e t and change in soil water storage with time δ s δ t annual fluxes for any grid cell location within a catchment were determined from the cumulative hourly fluxes simulated by the smr model by combining the water balance eq 5 and substituting excess water p e x for dp r o to represent the loss term we define p e q as total influx of water from p q n e t and δ s δ t 11 p e q p q n e t δ s δ t e t a p e x as seen in eq 11 p e q is the sum of crop water consumption e t a representing agronomic benefit and water lost to the environment p e x representing potential water quality impact we refer to the characteristic partitioning of p e q into these two quantities as the specific location s hydrologic function the soil snow evaporation portion of e t a is assumed to be neutral with respect to both the agronomic and environmental interests while the remaining evaporative flux crop transpiration t is closely related to dry matter production and grain yield de wit 1958 since the single crop coefficient approach used in calculating e t a does not separate soil evaporation from t we use e t a over the growing season as a surrogate for t acknowledging that evaporation can be considerable during the early stages of crop growth given that grain yield has been shown to vary with growing season e t a in an approximately linear fashion novak and van genuchten 2008 we do not feel this is a significant limitation while precipitation is assumed uniform over the catchment p e q explicitly considers the effects of crop rotation on soil water storage and net lateral redistribution of water within a landscape on an annual time scale δ s can be positive or negative depending on whether the previous year s crop was deep rooting relative to the current year s crop for instance assuming the soil is sufficiently deep to allow root extension there will be a large negative δ s after a deep rooting crop e g winter wheat if the field was seeded to a shallow rooting crop e g garbanzo beans the previous year after incorporating p e q into the budyko framework the modified evaporative index runoff ratio 1 and dryness index ϕ are defined as 12 e t a p e q 1 p e x p e q ϕ e t 0 p e q the assumption of uniform precipitation is not valid for snowfall for which wind and topography play large roles in the distributions of snow accumulation and melt rate this is acknowledged as a limitation the main affect would be less et from snowdrifts since the surface is protected for a longer time from soil evaporation since the extra water input from snowmelt does not typically correspond with the timing of high crop water demand the plant available water would be minimally affected the main impact would be an increase in p e x 4 3 hydrologic classification for production agriculture although the budyko framework provides a classification system to identify unique ecosystems based on available energy and water we propose a slightly modified classification framework where crop yield variability is more directly represented in production agriculture site specific management of fertilizer should balance agronomic benefit i e yield profit with environmental impact i e nitrate leaching runoff and n2o emissions this concept is illustrated in fig 3 with yield potential on the horizontal axis and nitrogen n loss potential on the y axis a yield threshold and water quality threshold divide the plot into four quadrants representing four management zones characterized by the following 1 high yield high n loss 2 low yield high n loss 3 low yield low n loss and 4 high yield low n loss using this as a guiding framework we link yield potential and n loss potential based on hydrologic function and classify a field into four unique hydrologic zones crop water uptake t is used as a surrogate for crop yield on the horizontal axis while the potential for waterborne n loss is represented by 1 on the vertical axis for practical purposes the annual t threshold which defines whether a region is producing a high or low crop yield should be defined by a specific grower in this case we opted to use the median simulated t to demonstrate the utility of this approach furthermore to compare multiple crops on the same plot we use relative transpiration t r e l defined as the actual t at a particular location divided by median t t m e d for the field rather than absolute t the 1 threshold delineates regions of a field with high n loss from low n loss and like the t threshold it should be fixed based on the environmental sensitivity of the ecosystem or the price of fertilizer the 1 threshold in this study was set to 0 31 corresponding with the runoff ratio at ϕ 1 0 in the budyko 1974 curve finally to better understand the controlling factors that distinguish one hydrologic zone from another we compare the landscape d twi climate ϕ and water balance p e q p e x t characteristics by class the topographic wetness index twi used is that of beven and kirkby 1979 5 results 5 1 development and assessment of smr model 5 1 1 model calibration the model was manually calibrated in all four catchments by adjusting the parameters z e m a x and k s a t r although the model was sensitive to depth to a restrictive layer using a b d c of 1 65 g cm 3 in agreement with the natural resources conservation service 2008 recommendations produced reasonable estimations of soil depth the colfax field lacks a true restrictive horizon therefore a bottom boundary layer was defined at 150 cm uniformly across the catchment in the remaining three catchments the calibrated k s a t r were 0 051 mm h 1 0 031 mm h 1 and 0 013 mm h 1 for genesee leland and troy field sites respectively this is similar in magnitude to the k s a t r used by brooks et al 2007 when applying the model to similar soils the z e m a x for winter wheat spring barley canola and garbanzo were 150 cm 115 cm 115 cm and 75 cm respectively all z e m a x values were within the ranges given by allen et al 1998 5 1 2 model assessment the timing and magnitude of daily runoff simulated by smr generally agreed well with observations over the three year time series with nse values all above 0 63 fig 4 and table 2 the poorest agreement occurred during the driest years 2013 and 2014 at leland the agreement improved considerably when weekly rather than daily totals were analyzed see table 2 surface runoff was only observed in 2012 at the genesee site 1 24 mm total and was not observed at the colfax site the model tended to over predict peak flows and to simulate runoff later into the season than observed this over prediction can be partly attributed to the fact that surface runoff is not explicitly routed in the model and that these surface water storage release dynamics are particularly important during low flow conditions simulated surface runoff patterns late in the spring were often patchy and hydrologically disconnected this disconnectedness could prevent or greatly limit channel flow to the catchment outlet liang and uchida 2014 soil moisture patterns were captured well by the model with slightly better agreement occurring during the winter non growing seasons the rmse of simulated volumetric water content validated against water content determined from extracted soil cores during the non growing season for all fields and all years was 0 040 cm cm 1 n 294 which was approximately equal to the calibrated moisture sensor accuracy table 3 the rmse increased to 0 046 cm cm 1 n 103 for growing season predictions table 3 fig 5 the time series plots of simulated water content and calibrated sensor water content show generally good agreement in the rate of wetting up over winter and drying down late in the growing season fig 6 an exception was the 2012 season at both leland planted to garbanzos and colfax planted to winter wheat in which the simulated root zone water depletion occurred more rapidly than reported by sensors the modest decline in dry season soil moisture at the troy catchment in the 2014 crop year was the result of crop failure due to excessive weed pressure which was not simulated in the model the smr model was able to match the frequency and spatial patterns of shallow perched water within each field reasonably well saturation frequency maps are shown in fig 7 for genesee leland and troy the wettest site was a toe slope location at troy where the perched water table was within 30 cm of the soil surface for over 125 d yr 1 only three of twelve microsites at genesee had perched water within 30 cm of the surface during the three year observation period two of these microsites were located in the main draw while the third was situated on a s facing slope with a restrictive horizon at 90 120 cm overall seasonal saturation was over predicted at genesee pbias 3 2 rmse 4 d yr 1 n 12 and under predicted at leland pbias 22 rmse 24 d yr 1 n 12 and troy pbias 13 rmse 23 d yr 1 n 12 the model tended to under predict saturation on backslopes and over predict saturation on toeslopes and in draws which may suggest that actual k s a t is less than that set in the model although the smr model does not simulate grain yield explicitly there was a reasonable correlation between simulated e t a and crop yield at the three field sites located in the higher precipitation zones the model s ability to reproduce yield patterns based on growing season e t a was assessed for winter wheat ww and spring wheat sw crops using hand harvested yield samples obtained at the 12 microsites the plot of observed yield bu ac 1 vs growing season e t a is shown in fig 8 a for all locations and fig 8b for all locations other than colfax when all fields and crops were taken together the simulated e t a explained 37 of the variability in observed yield r2 0 37 p 0 01 the explanatory power improved to 57 when the driest field site colfax was removed from the analysis r2 0 57 p 0 01 the relative predictive power increased even further when relationships for specific years were evaluated interestingly there was no correlation between simulated e t a and wheat yield at the colfax field site r2 0 00 for ww and r2 0 13 for sw suggesting the model was unable to capture available water patterns in this dry catchment 5 2 budyko framework at the subfield scale the modified budyko classification revealed strong gradients in hydrologic function and response both across the region and within individual field sites the 3 year average verse ϕ for all 10 10 m grid cells in all four fields is plotted in fig 9 along with the modified budyko 1974 curve f ϕ and zhang et al 2001 curve f ϕ w 0 5 the points in fig 9 lie generally below the curves of budyko 1974 and zhang et al 2001 the plot is split into three regions using the thresholds of mcvicar et al 2012 water limited ϕ 1 35 energy limited ϕ 0 76 and equitant 0 76 ϕ 1 35 equitant areas are an intermediate case where the environment fluctuates seasonally and or in wet vs dry years between an energy limited and water limited state mcvicar et al 2012 based on average annual fluxes nearly every grid cell was classified as water limited 97 however there were specific points within the troy catchment that were classified as energy limited we also explored classification by wet season november 1 april 30 and dry season may 1 october 31 during the wet season nearly 14 of the grid cells were energy limited 56 equitant and 30 water limited while 100 were water limited in the dry season equitant grid cells fluctuated seasonally between an energy limiting state characterized by soil water recharge and high p e x and a water limiting state characterized by soil water depletion and crop water stress the mean annual 2012 2014 water balance table 4 indicated that the amount of p e x increased from the driest catchment in colfax wa in the west where 91 of precipitation evaporated or was taken up by crops to the wetter eastern catchments in genesee troy and leland where only 67 67 and 71 of the precipitation evaporated respectively the budyko variables and ϕ reflect how different points in a landscape function hydrologically in terms of water storage and lateral subsurface movement of water spatial variability of and ϕ was greatest in the steeper wetter fields suggesting high variability in soil water storage and excessive water at these sites for example table 5 shows that the standard deviations σ of and ϕ were 0 37 and 0 11 at the troy catchment and only 0 14 and 0 02 at the drier colfax catchment as seen in fig 10 effective rooting depth and soil depth control water storage which in turn affects the amount of et and runoff occurring in these landscapes there is generally a distinct drop in i e increase in runoff with shallow rooted crops and shallower soils 5 3 hydrologic classification for production agriculture using the hydrologic classification for production agriculture based on t r e l and 1 each 10 10 m grid cell in each field was assigned to one of the four classes see figs 11 and 12 like patterns in the budyko analysis the spatial variability in classified zones was greater in fields with a wetter climate the greatest range in t r e l 0 77 1 41 and 1 0 14 0 84 occurred at the troy field site the delineation of hydrologic classes fig 12a closely matches the distribution of soil depth fig 12b classes 1 and 2 each representing landscape positions having high runoff potential and a low dryness index ϕ 1 1 52 ϕ 2 1 96 occur in convergent toe slope or on long backslope landscape positions having a relatively large twi particularly in the cooler wetter fields in reporting class wide statistics the subscript denotes class and the overbar signifies the average of all grid cells in that class class 1 landscape positions typically consist of deep soils d 1 132 cm which despite having relatively large amounts of saturation excess runoff during the wet season provide the most plant available water for the dry season resulting in relatively high crop yields the soils of class 2 are characteristically shallow d 2 105 cm with high incoming lateral flow these soil profiles recharge and saturate sooner than class 1 landscape positions and are therefore first to generate subsurface flow and surface runoff but may also experience high water stress in the dry season because of their limited storage capacity classes 3 and 4 are in the drier locations of the field ϕ 3 2 40 ϕ 4 2 37 having the least excess water p e x 3 95 mm yr 1 p e x 4 99 mm yr 1 and therefore the lowest potential for leaching and runoff losses of n they are concentrated in topographically divergent locations as indicated by a low twi where q n e t is either small or negative class 3 includes shallow to moderate depth soils in divergent landscape positions acting as net sources of lateral flow class 4 contains deep soils that can store large amounts of water for crop uptake and have low potential for n loss these areas are found mainly on upper and mid hillslopes the driest field colfax field wide ϕ 2 91 has no class 1 or class 2 landscapes 6 discussion 6 1 development and assessment of the smr model the spatial patterns of soil moisture and saturation excess runoff in these no till and minimum tillage wheat based cropping systems of the palouse are very similar to the variable source area runoff patterns observed in perennial grassland systems by brooks et al 2007 and mcdaniel et al 2008 with relatively high soil infiltration capacity at the soil surface when compared to typical rainfall rates soil moisture and runoff patterns are heavily influenced by lateral drainage of perched water above restrictive layers mcdaniel et al 2008 brooks et al 2004 the surface runoff patterns within a landscape depend largely on landscape position beven and kirkby 1979 o loughlin 1986 as well as local soil depth liang and uchida 2014 the saturation maps of fig 7 especially 7a show patterns that are generally consistent with variable source area hydrology the more frequently saturated areas yield the most water and have potential to become critical source areas of nitrogen if excessive fertilizer is applied in addition to leaching nitrogen these areas of high p e x are also more prone to agrichemical runoff and create the anoxic soil conditions that promote n2o emissions from an agronomic viewpoint the deep toe slope soils which may generate relatively large amounts of surface runoff can be some of the most productive parts of the field due to the relatively large amount of plant available water classifying a field based both on plant available water i e t and p e x can provide valuable spatial information to growers to help them adjust fertilizer strategies to meet crop performance goals while minimizing the loss in revenue due to excessive fertilizer loss these alternative strategies then become a win win from both a grower profit perspective and environmental impact perspective pan et al 2017 despite not simulating crop growth the correlation between observed wheat yield and simulated t suggests that simulated t using smr can provide a rough approximation of the site specific yields obtained in a field the colfax field site was a clear exception where no correlation was found our soil and yield data suggest data not shown that yield variability is caused by heterogeneous soil organic carbon at this dry field site where subsurface lateral flow is minimal this field experienced excessive erosion due to intensive tillage during the early 20th century prior to its conversion to no till management we speculate that soil organic carbon is causing differences in water holding capacity and soil fertility that perpetuate low yields on some hilltops ridges and s facing slopes for the remaining catchments soil depth drives variability in plant available water and yield 6 2 budyko framework at the subfield scale this unique application of the budyko framework within fields of the palouse region highlights the extreme challenges many growers face when trying to manage spatial variability within a single field while the conventional budyko framework uses long term water and energy budgets to integrate hydrologic behavior across the whole catchment our grid based formulation brings the same water and energy balance calculations to bear on the constituent subunits that together make the catchment response since all inflows outflows and changes in water storage are modeled explicitly mass is conserved within each grid cell thus enabling calculations of and ϕ over arbitrary time periods site specific management is fundamentally concerned with how different parts of a field respond to inputs and local hydrology plays a key role in this response it is clear from our analysis that the hydrology can vary a great amount within the same field as can be seen from fig 9 a single field may contain landscape positions that effectively function like a humid ecosystem while neighboring locations in the same field are behaving as a semi arid ecosystem the subfield scale budyko analysis indicates that hydrologic functioning of each landscape varies with climate soil characteristics and topography the deep soils of the colfax field site generally allow full root extension so that plant available water is determined by crop type spatially uniform and hydraulic properties nearly uniform rather than soil depth the relatively warm dry climate and deep soils at colfax do not favor lateral redistribution despite the site s extreme topography as a result budyko analysis reveals little variability in hydrologic function the only point dispersion at colfax indicated in fig 9 is due to variability in direct net solar radiation however for the wetter cooler field sites the topographic redistribution of water by lateral flow leads to seasonal saturation and runoff in convergent and lowland areas and extreme variability along the budyko curve the steeper divergent landscape positions typically have a negative q n e t i e a net loss of subsurface lateral flow with relatively large ϕ and values the poor drainage in these hydraulically restrictive argillic soil horizons within the troy leland and to a limited extent the genesee catchments create extensive perched water conditions which distribute water laterally downslope to toeslope positions with low ϕ and values since these shallow soils also have a relatively low amount of plant available water the e t a is generally lower leading to increased runoff and greater variability in compared to the dry colfax catchment table 5 the variability in ϕ and likewise stems from both landscape and climate factors operating on multiple scales this is illustrated by the linked arrows in the bottom right corner of fig 9 within individual fields lateral redistribution and local net radiation cause micro climatological differences and dispersion in ϕ and while between different fields differences in p and e t 0 cause the observed variability in ϕ and therefore the site specific climate signal represented by ϕ integrates these local and mean controls on climate landscape controls on and ϕ in the smr model include topography effective rooting depth z e and k s a t topography drives lateral redistribution of subsurface water into areas of convergence and lower elevation resulting in greater p e q while aspect influences available energy from shortwave radiation the remaining local controls z e and k s a t affect primarily and hence the vertical dispersion of points we simulated higher and e t a for deeper rooting crops and in deeper soils that do not inhibit root growth this result underscores the fact that z e controls the volume of water potentially available for transpiration donohue et al 2007 and is consistent with other studies that have investigated the effect rooting depth has on partitioning the water balance zhang et al 2001 porporato et al 2004 donohue et al 2010 liu et al 2016 the permeability of a soil influences through its partitioning of vertical water fluxes into groundwater recharge and e t a yokoo et al 2008 accordingly we observed soils with higher k s a t r promote greater percolation and lower e t a for example the lower for the genesee catchment in fig 9 can be attributed to a higher vertical k s a t r in the subsoil and artificial drainage through a tile line as trancoso et al 2016 have shown with a catchment classification system based on streamflow signature the landscape and climate variables used to describe streamflow mechanisms in the dunne diagram likewise drive the long term water and energy balances of the budyko framework at a much smaller scale we similarly found that the dominant form of runoff varied by hydrologic classification within catchments the greatest subsurface discharge q out according to the model occurred in deep soils on steep slopes with large negative q n e t class 3 while saturation excess runoff occurred predominately on shallow slopes in shallow to deep soils with large positive q n e t classes 1 and 2 by comparing fig 12 with fig 7 one can see that these two classes were the most frequently saturated these results are generally consistent with the dunne diagram dunne 1983 which predicts the hydrograph of catchments in sub humid climates with characteristically steep slopes and deep soils will be dominated by saturation excess overland flow trancoso et al 2016 have shown that energy limited catchments where saturation excess tends to be the dominant runoff mechanism have streamflow regimes that are ephemeral and less sensitive to changes in precipitation whereas arid catchments have ephemeral streams that are very sensitive to changes in precipitation at our field sites the situation is somewhat different all these fields are located in a semi arid mediterranean climate where streamflow is ephemeral typically running december through may and highly sensitive to precipitation i e the hydrograph is peaky while the dunne diagram predicts infiltration excess runoff in this type of climate this form is rarely if ever observed due to the low rainfall intensities and the high infiltration capacities of the soil instead runoff usually forms due to soil layers of low conductivity greatly restricting vertical drainage leading to a gradual filling of the root zone and formation of perched water tables 6 3 hydrologic zones for site specific management the classification approach that delineates a field into unique hydrologic zones based on crop water uptake and excess water has practical applications for efficient site specific management a grower is concerned primarily about profit rather than environmental impact however n losses have important financial ramifications since n fertilizer is the greatest operating cost of wheat production in the unites states vocke and ali 2013 the fate of applied fertilizer is therefore of concern to the grower and likewise the hydrologic function of the landscape should be of interest in as much as water influences yields and nitrogen use efficiency fiez et al 1995 basso et al 2013 many growers are now following variable rate fertilizer strategies that involve dividing a field into zones based on crop yield alone however these yield centric zones do not consider water redistribution in the landscape and with it the potential for runoff and leaching losses of applied fertilizer the utility of the proposed hydrologic classification system is that it provides spatially explicit information on both crop yield and nutrient loss potentials a common strategy used in the pacific northwest to avoid over winter nitrogen loss with a fall seeded crop is to apply less fertilizer in the fall at planting and more in the spring this strategy would be most effective in class 2 landscape positions which often have shallow soils with low yield and high potential runoff class 1 zones may also benefit from this strategy but they have deeper soils and therefore a better chance at retaining fall applied nitrogen class 3 and 4 field areas have little excess water so spring fertilizer application may not be as high a priority another strategy for reducing fertilizer waste is to manage excess water and thereby boost agricultural water use efficiency mcvicar et al 2002 for example growers may consider a fall seeded cover crop in class 1 and 2 soils where water is not limiting a cover crop reduces excess water leached nutrients and nitrous oxide emissions by increasing plant water uptake shelton et al 2018 knowledge of hydrologic connectivity between the zones may also provide some useful management strategies for example there is evidence that nitrate moves with subsurface lateral flow zhang et al 2011 such that areas acting as net sources of lateral flow will redistribute nitrate to downgradient convergent regions that accumulate water zhu et al 2009 therefore fertilizer rates could be decreased in class 1 high n loss potential areas which are typically located in toe slopes if they were located downgradient from a class 2 or 3 area that could provide supplementary n through subsurface lateral transport the best approach for adjusting an existing cropping practice or fertilizer strategy may be unclear to the grower post harvest evaluation is therefore an important management practice that can be enhanced by classified zones for example growers may undertake simple n budget accounting or profit analysis by zone and use the results to guide adjustments of zonal fertilizer rates by choosing zones with hydrologic and agronomic significance the grower adopts an organizational structure to the fields spatial complexity that simplifies targeting site specific deficiencies whether in crop yield or n loss in addition to changing management within existing zones post harvest recommendations may also involve changes to the number or the boundaries of zones the dual threshold approach used by this study can easily accommodate greater or fewer than four zones for example by selecting three levels of yield rather than two six classes the optimal number of classes will vary according to a host of factors related to characteristics of the field local climate the goals of the grower and the capabilities of the farming equipment used the dual threshold classification system is adaptable to other sources of data the first threshold regarding n loss potential could be informed by twi calculated from an elevation map since two components are necessary to create hydrologically sensitive areas excess water and excess nutrients n balance data is critical calculating n use efficiency has traditionally required intensive sampling but rapid advances in remote sensing technology may soon make crop n uptake calculations routine magney et al 2017 yield potential data required by the second threshold could originate from a yield monitor or from remote sensing images a practical threshold for yield would be the field wide average yield required to make a profit break even yield meanwhile a practical threshold for n loss could be based on a nitrogen uptake efficiency goal though we used simulated p e x the usefulness of the dual threshold classification system would be enhanced if p e x could be determined from annual precipitation and scaled with easily accessible soil and terrain data this warrants further investigation 7 summary and conclusion despite the close connection few distributed hydrologic models developed to replicate surface runoff patterns for water quality management have been used to assist or assess agronomic management strategies particularly for guiding and evaluating variable rate fertilizer strategies this is surprising from an environmental water quality perspective since management strategies which focus on source control particularly on the optimization of fertilizer application in agricultural landscapes are often much more effective than transport control where treatment focuses on minimizing the delivery pollutants to a water body such as grass riparian buffers for nitrate removal rittenburg et al 2015 we implemented a dynamic root zone into the smr model to more effectively capture water fluxes in cropping systems of the eastern palouse region while spatially distributed soil maps improved the model s ability to produce patterns of plant available water reflected in yields we demonstrated the link between landscape hydrology and the budyko framework using the smr model to calculate the mean annual and seasonal water balances at 10 m grid resolution application of the budyko framework at the subfield scale highlighted extreme diversity of ecosystems that must be managed within a single field in the eastern palouse region these unique hydrologic zones are established and maintained by the redistribution of water through strong landscape and climate controls with topography soil depth and crop type being dominant factors in this region using transpiration as an indicator of potential crop yield and excess water as an indicator of potential nutrient loss a classification system was presented which provides a framework to evaluate the effects of management strategies from both an agronomic and environmental perspective this classification system advances current variable rate fertilizer management strategies where nitrogen fertilizer rates are based on crop yield maps alone by providing insight into the mechanisms driving the storage and transport of water within a landscape this site specific information can then be used to provide insight into optimal management practices e g timing amount and type of fertilizer crop selection that are best suited for the dominant hydrology of a specific landscape position although this classification approach is based fundamentally on a spatially explicit hydrologic model it is possible that a similar simpler classification system could be developed using observed crop yield data in addition to excess water and soil moisture patterns captured through static topographic mapping or remotely sensed imagery declaration of interests none declared

6503,crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and subsurface flow paths these lateral flow paths create zones of saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath the root zone despite its clear importance a spatially explicit representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from site specific crop and fertilizer management plans this work uses the grid based water balance model smr soil moisture routing to adapt an established method of hydrologic classification the budyko framework for small agricultural watersheds the model was evaluated with spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern palouse region of the inland pacific northwest the budyko framework modified to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow was combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a dual threshold classification scheme for variable rate fertilizer management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss potentials which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution respectively results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed within individual fields and between fields the greatest variability was observed in the two eastern most fields where the wettest zone of each had water supply 172 and 137 that of the dry zone depth to a hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary landscape controls on the water supply precipitation plus net lateral flow minus change in water storage in these fields moreover the steep climate gradient in the region created field to field variability in water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation ranging from 91 in the western most field to approximately 70 in each of the fields to the east the clearest choice is for growers to apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is minimal less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water storage capacity that frequently saturate areas with high storage capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting fertilizer application to avoid excessive over winter leaching losses even though remote sensing and variable rate applicators are at the frontiers of precision agriculture landscape hydrology underlies all dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for inspiration in the design of cropping systems keywords subfield scale hydrologic classification budyko framework lateral water redistribution site specific crop management spatially explicit model assessment 1 introduction strategies to improve site specific crop and fertilizer management in dryland cropping systems are often limited by the difficulty of capturing water flux and storage with sufficient spatial and temporal detail ibrahim and huggins 2011 from an agronomic perspective spatial variability in plant available water influences crop selection and crop yield response both of which dictate required amount and efficiency of applied fertilizer pan et al 2007 in complex landscapes with consistent yield variability growers can increase overall profit by adopting variable rate fertilizer strategies that vary fertilizer amount and potentially the timing of fertilizer application by zone within a field ward et al 2017 these strategies can also benefit the environment for example cutting application rates in zones most prone to fertilizer loss through runoff and leaching reduces nitrate loading to surface and groundwater receiving streams basso et al 2011 the management strategy of reducing fertilizer waste by matching inputs to crop yield patterns shares goals with the watershed management approach that targets hydrologically sensitive areas to minimize overall pollutant loading walter et al 2000 in fact the underlying mechanism that drives temporal and spatial patterns of crop yield in dryland ecosystems namely spatial structure of stored soil water also drives surface runoff patterns of landscapes dominated by variable source area hydrology hewlett and hibbert 1967 dunne and black 1970 dunne et al 1975 therefore classification systems used to assess best management practices in watershed management studies can potentially contribute to development of fertilizer management strategies great emphasis has been placed on hydrologic classification in the field of hydrology see sivakumar et al 2015 with most approaches focused on classifying basins rather than smaller field or hillslope scale units a well known classification scheme for describing ecosystem functioning at the basin scale was developed by budyko 1974 the budyko framework groups basins according to their partition of precipitation into evapotranspiration et and runoff under equilibrium conditions annual et is described as a function of water and energy supplies either one of which limits et depending on climate although this simple framework has been used to classify large geographic regions and river basins its use at smaller spatial scales and time scales has been limited in part because of the assumptions undergirding its formulation the budyko framework assumes i steady state conditions negligible change in water storage and ii closed system boundaries i e that precipitation is the only source of water assumption i is violated at short time scales where the dynamic relationship between soil moisture and vegetation plays an increasingly important role in the water cycle donohue et al 2007 an example is the cyclical pattern of water uptake by annual crops during the growing season followed by soil water recharge during the non growing season assumption ii is violated if attempting to apply the budyko framework to any specific point hillslope or sub basin where there is net inflow from surface runoff subsurface flow or groundwater flow du et al 2016 have demonstrated both assumptions can be relaxed if additional inflows and changes in storage are quantified they applied the budyko framework over six arid sub basins in china replacing the mean precipitation in budyko s equations with an equivalent precipitation p e which accounts for channel inflow q i n and change in soil water storage δ s 1 p e p q i n δ s du et al 2016 applied their modified budyko framework to each of the six sub basins at annual and monthly time scales a similar approach could be applied to points or zones within a field if net lateral fluxes and changes in seasonal water storage were quantified the classification of unique ecosystems or hydrologic zones within a field using the budyko framework could provide useful information to assist site specific agronomic management since the technology required to routinely measure net lateral water flux within a landscape does not exist to our knowledge the budyko approach has never been used to identify unique hydrologic zones within annually cropped fields spatially explicit process based hydrology models that use governing equations of flow and mass balance to simulate lateral redistribution of water within complex landscapes provide an opportunity to apply the budyko framework at site specific management scales despite clear benefits from a site specific agricultural management perspective of capturing subfield scale soil moisture storage and fluxes few distributed hydrologic models have been developed or applied to production agricultural fields these models must simulate lateral subsurface flow pathways if the hydrology of steep landscapes is to be adequately represented walter et al 2000 mehta et al 2004 brooks et al 2007 two distributed hydrologic models well suited for simulating lateral flow are the dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 and smr frankenberger et al 1999 models dhsvm has been primarily applied to forested mountainous regions while smr has been used in both the catskill mountains of new york frankenberger et al 1999 and in the gently rolling landscape of the palouse region brooks et al 2007 dijksma et al 2011 however neither model was developed for simulating subfield scale hydrologic variability of agricultural land under cereal grain production in this study we develop a subfield scale classification system that combines the budyko framework with spatially distributed hydrologic modeling our use of subfield scale encapsulates both the 10 10 m2 grid scale at which the water balance is modeled and the hydrologically similar groupings of these grid cells within a field occurring below the field scale the classification system delineates fields into unique management zones based on their characteristic hydrologic and agronomic response we discuss how this classification system can provide growers with insight into management approaches to increase overall profitability and minimize off site environmental impact the specific objectives of this study were to i assess the ability of a modified version of the smr model to capture subfield scale soil water storage and fluxes in a semi arid cereal grain production region ii develop an approach to apply the budyko framework at the subfield scale and iii demonstrate a classification scheme to support development and assessment of site specific management strategies in complex agroecosystems these objectives provide the structural sub headings used in the following methods results and discussion sections 2 background 2 1 budyko framework in his seminal work budyko 1974 developed and validated a framework in which the proportion of precipitation that evaporates and that becomes runoff is strongly a result of climate by using long term averages 1 year he assumed change in water storage to be a negligible part of the water balance so that mean precipitation p is the sum of mean evapotranspiration et and mean streamflow q 2 p et q the fraction of p that evaporates from earth s surface is called evaporative index et p this quantity is related to climate through the radiative index of dryness ϕ which budyko defined to be net radiation converted to water units r n λ divided by p the term r n λ represents the maximum possible et under given climatic conditions and is one representation of the more broadly used term potential evapotranspiration e t 0 in conditions of abundant moisture ϕ becomes very small and nearly all net radiation is consumed by evaporation this condition describes the energy limit of et eq 3 which is illustrated by line a of fig 1 3 et e t 0 as ϕ 0 under dry conditions ϕ becomes very large and nearly all precipitation evaporates this condition describes the water limit shown as line b of fig 1 and eq 4 4 et p as ϕ the vertical distance between line b and curve c i e 1 represents runoff loss or excess water in describing the mean annual water balance budyko 1974 sought an equation of relationship of the form f ϕ leading him to the hyperbolic relationship now known as the budyko curve studies have documented considerable deviations from budyko s curve due to the influences of climate seasonality milly 1994 potter et al 2005 yokoo et al 2008 shao et al 2012 soil properties milly 1994

koster and suarez 1999 porporato et al 2004 liu et al 2016 multiple studies have posited alternative mathematic relationships to the budyko curve based on analytical solutions to the coupled water energy balance e g fu 1981 yang et al 2008 each of which includes an additional shaping parameter the ability of these latter equations to predict the long term and annual water balances has generally been improved through studies that link the shaping parameter to landscape and climate controls zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2007 oudin et al 2008 yang et al 2009 abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 found that precipitation seasonality the ratio of soil water holding capacity to precipitation topographic slope and the fraction of precipitation falling as snow explained 81 of the variability in the shaping parameter used to partition precipitation across the continental u s with the budyko framework vegetation plays a moderating role in et by tapping into water in the unsaturated zone soil plant interactions grow increasingly important at shorter time scales donohue et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 liu et al 2016 and at smaller spatial scales oudin et al 2008 donohue et al 2012 2 2 smr model overview smr is a distributed grid based water balance model well adapted to regions with steep sloping land and shallow soils it was developed as a spatially explicit management tool to inform management decisions addressing nonpoint source pollution from dairy farms in the catskill mountains of new york frankenberger et al 1999 walter et al 2000 as a management tool it was developed to be a relatively simple model with few parameters and requiring minimal calibration brooks et al 2007 frankenberger et al 1999 this 3d model simulates both vertical water fluxes within a grid cell e g rainfall snow accumulation and melt evapotranspiration deep percolation below the root zone as well as net lateral subsurface flow between cells surface runoff occurs in the landscape whenever the accumulated volume of soil water in a grid cell exceeds available pore space i e saturation excess runoff surface runoff is not explicitly routed overland to the outlet of the catchment but rather is assumed to reach the watershed outlet within the model timestep infiltration excess runoff is not directly simulated by the model which makes the model best suited to regions where the soil infiltration capacity is greater than the typical rainfall intensity boll et al 1998 frankenberger et al 1999 mehta et al 2004 subsurface lateral flow out of a grid cell is simulated using darcy s equation with hydraulic gradient equal to the land slope and routed to up to eight neighboring cells following the approach described in brooks et al 2007 variability in soil characteristics with depth e g bulk density and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity are represented by explicit functions the soil water balance in smr for each grid cell eq 5 consists of positive fluxes

al 1999 brooks and boll 2005 brooks et al 2007 3 study site and experimental measurements 3 1 study site the palouse the palouse region of the inland pacific northwest usa is famous for its rolling loess formed hills that support remarkable yields of soft white winter wheat washington wheat commission 2009 the moisture regime of the palouse region is dominated by low intensity storms klages 1942 distributed evenly between the fall winter and spring months united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service 2006 very little rain falls during the summer months when evaporative demand is greatest leading to a distinct wet and dry season mean annual precipitation map ranges from 450 mm in the western part of whitman county donaldson 1980 to more than 800 mm in the eastern part of latah county barker 1981 four small 30 ha fields in the dryland cropping region of eastern washington and northern idaho were selected for intensive hydrologic monitoring in cooperation with four private growers located near the towns of colfax wa genesee id troy id and leland id fig 2 each field comprises a distinct catchment so that the two terms field and catchment are used interchangeably throughout this paper the colfax and genesee fields are managed with no till practices in a continuous cereal wheat dominated crop rotation while the troy and leland fields are managed with minimal tillage in a wheat pulse crop rotation study sites capture a climate gradient across the southeastern part of the palouse river basin and its immediate vicinity from the drier lower elevation western part to the wetter higher elevation and slightly cooler eastern part an important feature of soils and hydrology of the eastern palouse is the presence of hydraulic restricting layers that form perched water tables in wet months perched water on sloping land drains into convergent downslope areas and subsequently generates saturation excess runoff hammermeister et al 1982 needelman et al 2004 gburek et al 2006 mcdaniel et al 2008 fig 2 shows 30 year map normals estimated from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism climate group 2012 for the region the field sites have highly variable terrain with slopes up to 45 observed at the colfax site 3 2 soil hydrological and meteorological measurements the ssurgo soil survey geographic database soil survey staff is of limited value for small scale applications where soil characteristics may change considerably over short distances therefore site specific measurements of bulk density bd and texture were acquired for each field and used to create input maps hydrological measurements for model validation were made within the field soil moisture depth to water table and at the catchment outlet surface runoff artificial drainage volumetric water content was measured at 12 instrumented sites per field microsites at 30 cm intervals to a depth of 150 cm we found that the accuracy of the 5te and 5tm soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa using the factory calibration was poor and improved the accuracy through site specific calibration with in season soil sampling depth to water table dtw was measured in shallow monitoring wells at microsites above hydraulically restrictive horizons the frequency of near surface saturation defined as dtw 30 cm was approximated as the percentage of time the moisture sensors installed at 30 cm read a saturated water content approximations were validated with periodic manual water table measurements surface runoff was measured at the catchment outlet of troy by a single 9 inch h flume and at genesee and leland catchments using a 6 inch parshall flume all four fields were equipped with a weather station which collected hourly precipitation air temperature wind speed and wind direction missing solar radiation humidity and temperature data were interpolated from several nearby stations whose data were accessed from washington state university s automated weather station network agweathernet or from ncdc national climatic data center managed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration for a more comprehensive description of measurements undertaken at these fields sites refer to yourek 2016 a summary of measurements is provided in table 1 4 methodology 4 1 development and assessment of smr model for cropping systems 4 1 1 model modifications to improve simulation of et flux from a growing crop canopy the single layer approach of brooks et al 2007 was replaced by a two layer model the upper layer is a dynamic root zone that increases with depth as the crop matures a lower soil layer extends from the bottom of the root zone to the top of the hydraulically restrictive layer root zone depth increases linearly with time after planting to a maximum rooting depth at maturity during periods with no crop the root zone is fixed at 30 cm as with brooks et al 2007 percolation dp begins as soon as perched water just begins to form on the restricting layer upward redistribution of water into the root zone from the deep soil layer is not simulated subsurface lateral flow is calculated for the entire soil profile above the restricting layer following brooks et al 2007 and is apportioned among the two soil layers based on root zone depth and height of the perched water table vertical drainage q v e r t from the root zone to the deep soil layer occurs whenever the soil water storage in the root zone exceeds field capacity in the absence of snow cover e t a is calculated by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 using the single crop coefficient k c and the short grass reference et e t r once the soil water in the root zone drops below field capacity e t a is further reduced to account for water stress through the stress coefficient k s which is determined according to campbell and norman 1998 e t a is the product of k s k c and e t r 6 e t a k s k c e t r a thin top soil layer of 15 cm thickness controls evaporation from the soil surface during the period between harvest and planting of next season s crop non growing season the rate of e t a for non growing periods is determined according to eq 6 with k s based on the thresholds of allen et al 1998 after planting the thin top soil layer is removed from the model and all e t a occurs from the root zone when the surface is covered by snow evaporation condensation from the snow surface is calculated using a snowpack water and energy balance brooks and boll 2005 condensation is subtracted from e t a to preserve the mass balance the potential et e t 0 from the fao penman monteith method is 1 2 times e t r for snow free conditions while e t 0 from a snow covered surface is 1 2 times the e t r calculated using snow albedo allen et al 1998 7 e t 0 1 2 e t r combining the vertical water fluxes into and out of the root zone and deep soil layers with lateral flow q i n r z q o u t r z to from neighboring grid cells the mass balance for the root zone over timestep δ t becomes 8 δ s r z δ t p θ d δ z δ t q i n r z e t a q o u t r z q v e r t r o where the additional term δ z δ t θ d accounts for water added to root zone storage δ s r z as the roots grow by length δ z over time δ t into the deep layer at moisture content θ d cm cm 1 similarly the mass balance for the deep soil layer is 9 δ s d δ t q v e r t q i n d θ d δ z δ t q o u t d d p 4 1 2 model calibration the smr model was manually calibrated at each of the catchments for the combined 2012 2014 water years yourek 2016 the three calibration parameters were depth to restricting layer d maximum effective rooting depth z e m a x and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restricting layer k s a t r a restrictive soil layer was identified by a bd greater than 1 65 g cm3 according to natural resources conservation service 2008 for silt loam soils any soil lacking a well defined restrictive layer was assigned a soil depth of 150 cm corresponding with the deepest soil measurement and approximately equal to z e m a x of winter wheat we assumed that roots do not penetrate the restrictive layer the calibrated b d c z e m a x and k s a t r values are reported in section 3 1 4 1 3 model assessment the model was assessed based on its ability to simulate site specific hydrologic response e g soil moisture and dtw as well as the integrated response of surface runoff we adopted the criteria of moriasi et al 2007 where a model provides satisfactory predictions if the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for surface runoff is greater than 0 5 agreement between simulated and observed root zone water content was assessed using root mean square error rmse the spatial pattern of saturation frequency was assessed using both rmse and percent bias pbias as defined by equation 10 where x represents frequency in d yr 1 and the subscripts obs and sim are for observed and simulated respectively 10 pbias 100 x sim x obs x obs 4 2 budyko framework at the subfield scale the budyko framework was applied within individual catchments by replacing p with equivalent precipitation p e q which accounts for additional sources of water from net lateral subsurface flow q n e t and change in soil water storage with time δ s δ t annual fluxes for any grid cell location within a catchment were determined from the cumulative hourly fluxes simulated by the smr model by combining the water balance eq 5 and substituting excess water p e x for dp r o to represent the loss term we define p e q as total influx of water from p q n e t and δ s δ t 11 p e q p q n e t δ s δ t e t a p e x as seen in eq 11 p e q is the sum of crop water consumption e t a representing agronomic benefit and water lost to the environment p e x representing potential water quality impact we refer to the characteristic partitioning of p e q into these two quantities as the specific location s hydrologic function the soil snow evaporation portion of e t a is assumed to be neutral with respect to both the agronomic and environmental interests while the remaining evaporative flux crop transpiration t is closely related to dry matter production and grain yield de wit 1958 since the single crop coefficient approach used in calculating e t a does not separate soil evaporation from t we use e t a over the growing season as a surrogate for t acknowledging that evaporation can be considerable during the early stages of crop growth given that grain yield has been shown to vary with growing season e t a in an approximately linear fashion novak and van genuchten 2008 we do not feel this is a significant limitation while precipitation is assumed uniform over the catchment p e q explicitly considers the effects of crop rotation on soil water storage and net lateral redistribution of water within a landscape on an annual time scale δ s can be positive or negative depending on whether the previous year s crop was deep rooting relative to the current year s crop for instance assuming the soil is sufficiently deep to allow root extension there will be a large negative δ s after a deep rooting crop e g winter wheat if the field was seeded to a shallow rooting crop e g garbanzo beans the previous year after incorporating p e q into the budyko framework the modified evaporative index runoff ratio 1 and dryness index ϕ are defined as 12 e t a p e q 1 p e x p e q ϕ e t 0 p e q the assumption of uniform precipitation is not valid for snowfall for which wind and topography play large roles in the distributions of snow accumulation and melt rate this is acknowledged as a limitation the main affect would be less et from snowdrifts since the surface is protected for a longer time from soil evaporation since the extra water input from snowmelt does not typically correspond with the timing of high crop water demand the plant available water would be minimally affected the main impact would be an increase in p e x 4 3 hydrologic classification for production agriculture although the budyko framework provides a classification system to identify unique ecosystems based on available energy and water we propose a slightly modified classification framework where crop yield variability is more directly represented in production agriculture site specific management of fertilizer should balance agronomic benefit i e yield profit with environmental impact i e nitrate leaching runoff and n2o emissions this concept is illustrated in fig 3 with yield potential on the horizontal axis and nitrogen n loss potential on the y axis a yield threshold and water quality threshold divide the plot into four quadrants representing four management zones characterized by the following 1 high yield high n loss 2 low yield high n loss 3 low yield low n loss and 4 high yield low n loss using this as a guiding framework we link yield potential and n loss potential based on hydrologic function and classify a field into four unique hydrologic zones crop water uptake t is used as a surrogate for crop yield on the horizontal axis while the potential for waterborne n loss is represented by 1 on the vertical axis for practical purposes the annual t threshold which defines whether a region is producing a high or low crop yield should be defined by a specific grower in this case we opted to use the median simulated t to demonstrate the utility of this approach furthermore to compare multiple crops on the same plot we use relative transpiration t r e l defined as the actual t at a particular location divided by median t t m e d for the field rather than absolute t the 1 threshold delineates regions of a field with high n loss from low n loss and like the t threshold it should be fixed based on the environmental sensitivity of the ecosystem or the price of fertilizer the 1 threshold in this study was set to 0 31 corresponding with the runoff ratio at ϕ 1 0 in the budyko 1974 curve finally to better understand the controlling factors that distinguish one hydrologic zone from another we compare the landscape d twi climate ϕ and water balance p e q p e x t characteristics by class the topographic wetness index twi used is that of beven and kirkby 1979 5 results 5 1 development and assessment of smr model 5 1 1 model calibration the model was manually calibrated in all four catchments by adjusting the parameters z e m a x and k s a t r although the model was sensitive to depth to a restrictive layer using a b d c of 1 65 g cm 3 in agreement with the natural resources conservation service 2008 recommendations produced reasonable estimations of soil depth the colfax field lacks a true restrictive horizon therefore a bottom boundary layer was defined at 150 cm uniformly across the catchment in the remaining three catchments the calibrated k s a t r were 0 051 mm h 1 0 031 mm h 1 and 0 013 mm h 1 for genesee leland and troy field sites respectively this is similar in magnitude to the k s a t r used by brooks et al 2007 when applying the model to similar soils the z e m a x for winter wheat spring barley canola and garbanzo were 150 cm 115 cm 115 cm and 75 cm respectively all z e m a x values were within the ranges given by allen et al 1998 5 1 2 model assessment the timing and magnitude of daily runoff simulated by smr generally agreed well with observations over the three year time series with nse values all above 0 63 fig 4 and table 2 the poorest agreement occurred during the driest years 2013 and 2014 at leland the agreement improved considerably when weekly rather than daily totals were analyzed see table 2 surface runoff was only observed in 2012 at the genesee site 1 24 mm total and was not observed at the colfax site the model tended to over predict peak flows and to simulate runoff later into the season than observed this over prediction can be partly attributed to the fact that surface runoff is not explicitly routed in the model and that these surface water storage release dynamics are particularly important during low flow conditions simulated surface runoff patterns late in the spring were often patchy and hydrologically disconnected this disconnectedness could prevent or greatly limit channel flow to the catchment outlet liang and uchida 2014 soil moisture patterns were captured well by the model with slightly better agreement occurring during the winter non growing seasons the rmse of simulated volumetric water content validated against water content determined from extracted soil cores during the non growing season for all fields and all years was 0 040 cm cm 1 n 294 which was approximately equal to the calibrated moisture sensor accuracy table 3 the rmse increased to 0 046 cm cm 1 n 103 for growing season predictions table 3 fig 5 the time series plots of simulated water content and calibrated sensor water content show generally good agreement in the rate of wetting up over winter and drying down late in the growing season fig 6 an exception was the 2012 season at both leland planted to garbanzos and colfax planted to winter wheat in which the simulated root zone water depletion occurred more rapidly than reported by sensors the modest decline in dry season soil moisture at the troy catchment in the 2014 crop year was the result of crop failure due to excessive weed pressure which was not simulated in the model the smr model was able to match the frequency and spatial patterns of shallow perched water within each field reasonably well saturation frequency maps are shown in fig 7 for genesee leland and troy the wettest site was a toe slope location at troy where the perched water table was within 30 cm of the soil surface for over 125 d yr 1 only three of twelve microsites at genesee had perched water within 30 cm of the surface during the three year observation period two of these microsites were located in the main draw while the third was situated on a s facing slope with a restrictive horizon at 90 120 cm overall seasonal saturation was over predicted at genesee pbias 3 2 rmse 4 d yr 1 n 12 and under predicted at leland pbias 22 rmse 24 d yr 1 n 12 and troy pbias 13 rmse 23 d yr 1 n 12 the model tended to under predict saturation on backslopes and over predict saturation on toeslopes and in draws which may suggest that actual k s a t is less than that set in the model although the smr model does not simulate grain yield explicitly there was a reasonable correlation between simulated e t a and crop yield at the three field sites located in the higher precipitation zones the model s ability to reproduce yield patterns based on growing season e t a was assessed for winter wheat ww and spring wheat sw crops using hand harvested yield samples obtained at the 12 microsites the plot of observed yield bu ac 1 vs growing season e t a is shown in fig 8 a for all locations and fig 8b for all locations other than colfax when all fields and crops were taken together the simulated e t a explained 37 of the variability in observed yield r2 0 37 p 0 01 the explanatory power improved to 57 when the driest field site colfax was removed from the analysis r2 0 57 p 0 01 the relative predictive power increased even further when relationships for specific years were evaluated interestingly there was no correlation between simulated e t a and wheat yield at the colfax field site r2 0 00 for ww and r2 0 13 for sw suggesting the model was unable to capture available water patterns in this dry catchment 5 2 budyko framework at the subfield scale the modified budyko classification revealed strong gradients in hydrologic function and response both across the region and within individual field sites the 3 year average verse ϕ for all 10 10 m grid cells in all four fields is plotted in fig 9 along with the modified budyko 1974 curve f ϕ and zhang et al 2001 curve f ϕ w 0 5 the points in fig 9 lie generally below the curves of budyko 1974 and zhang et al 2001 the plot is split into three regions using the thresholds of mcvicar et al 2012 water limited ϕ 1 35 energy limited ϕ 0 76 and equitant 0 76 ϕ 1 35 equitant areas are an intermediate case where the environment fluctuates seasonally and or in wet vs dry years between an energy limited and water limited state mcvicar et al 2012 based on average annual fluxes nearly every grid cell was classified as water limited 97 however there were specific points within the troy catchment that were classified as energy limited we also explored classification by wet season november 1 april 30 and dry season may 1 october 31 during the wet season nearly 14 of the grid cells were energy limited 56 equitant and 30 water limited while 100 were water limited in the dry season equitant grid cells fluctuated seasonally between an energy limiting state characterized by soil water recharge and high p e x and a water limiting state characterized by soil water depletion and crop water stress the mean annual 2012 2014 water balance table 4 indicated that the amount of p e x increased from the driest catchment in colfax wa in the west where 91 of precipitation evaporated or was taken up by crops to the wetter eastern catchments in genesee troy and leland where only 67 67 and 71 of the precipitation evaporated respectively the budyko variables and ϕ reflect how different points in a landscape function hydrologically in terms of water storage and lateral subsurface movement of water spatial variability of and ϕ was greatest in the steeper wetter fields suggesting high variability in soil water storage and excessive water at these sites for example table 5 shows that the standard deviations σ of and ϕ were 0 37 and 0 11 at the troy catchment and only 0 14 and 0 02 at the drier colfax catchment as seen in fig 10 effective rooting depth and soil depth control water storage which in turn affects the amount of et and runoff occurring in these landscapes there is generally a distinct drop in i e increase in runoff with shallow rooted crops and shallower soils 5 3 hydrologic classification for production agriculture using the hydrologic classification for production agriculture based on t r e l and 1 each 10 10 m grid cell in each field was assigned to one of the four classes see figs 11 and 12 like patterns in the budyko analysis the spatial variability in classified zones was greater in fields with a wetter climate the greatest range in t r e l 0 77 1 41 and 1 0 14 0 84 occurred at the troy field site the delineation of hydrologic classes fig 12a closely matches the distribution of soil depth fig 12b classes 1 and 2 each representing landscape positions having high runoff potential and a low dryness index ϕ 1 1 52 ϕ 2 1 96 occur in convergent toe slope or on long backslope landscape positions having a relatively large twi particularly in the cooler wetter fields in reporting class wide statistics the subscript denotes class and the overbar signifies the average of all grid cells in that class class 1 landscape positions typically consist of deep soils d 1 132 cm which despite having relatively large amounts of saturation excess runoff during the wet season provide the most plant available water for the dry season resulting in relatively high crop yields the soils of class 2 are characteristically shallow d 2 105 cm with high incoming lateral flow these soil profiles recharge and saturate sooner than class 1 landscape positions and are therefore first to generate subsurface flow and surface runoff but may also experience high water stress in the dry season because of their limited storage capacity classes 3 and 4 are in the drier locations of the field ϕ 3 2 40 ϕ 4 2 37 having the least excess water p e x 3 95 mm yr 1 p e x 4 99 mm yr 1 and therefore the lowest potential for leaching and runoff losses of n they are concentrated in topographically divergent locations as indicated by a low twi where q n e t is either small or negative class 3 includes shallow to moderate depth soils in divergent landscape positions acting as net sources of lateral flow class 4 contains deep soils that can store large amounts of water for crop uptake and have low potential for n loss these areas are found mainly on upper and mid hillslopes the driest field colfax field wide ϕ 2 91 has no class 1 or class 2 landscapes 6 discussion 6 1 development and assessment of the smr model the spatial patterns of soil moisture and saturation excess runoff in these no till and minimum tillage wheat based cropping systems of the palouse are very similar to the variable source area runoff patterns observed in perennial grassland systems by brooks et al 2007 and mcdaniel et al 2008 with relatively high soil infiltration capacity at the soil surface when compared to typical rainfall rates soil moisture and runoff patterns are heavily influenced by lateral drainage of perched water above restrictive layers mcdaniel et al 2008 brooks et al 2004 the surface runoff patterns within a landscape depend largely on landscape position beven and kirkby 1979 o loughlin 1986 as well as local soil depth liang and uchida 2014 the saturation maps of fig 7 especially 7a show patterns that are generally consistent with variable source area hydrology the more frequently saturated areas yield the most water and have potential to become critical source areas of nitrogen if excessive fertilizer is applied in addition to leaching nitrogen these areas of high p e x are also more prone to agrichemical runoff and create the anoxic soil conditions that promote n2o emissions from an agronomic viewpoint the deep toe slope soils which may generate relatively large amounts of surface runoff can be some of the most productive parts of the field due to the relatively large amount of plant available water classifying a field based both on plant available water i e t and p e x can provide valuable spatial information to growers to help them adjust fertilizer strategies to meet crop performance goals while minimizing the loss in revenue due to excessive fertilizer loss these alternative strategies then become a win win from both a grower profit perspective and environmental impact perspective pan et al 2017 despite not simulating crop growth the correlation between observed wheat yield and simulated t suggests that simulated t using smr can provide a rough approximation of the site specific yields obtained in a field the colfax field site was a clear exception where no correlation was found our soil and yield data suggest data not shown that yield variability is caused by heterogeneous soil organic carbon at this dry field site where subsurface lateral flow is minimal this field experienced excessive erosion due to intensive tillage during the early 20th century prior to its conversion to no till management we speculate that soil organic carbon is causing differences in water holding capacity and soil fertility that perpetuate low yields on some hilltops ridges and s facing slopes for the remaining catchments soil depth drives variability in plant available water and yield 6 2 budyko framework at the subfield scale this unique application of the budyko framework within fields of the palouse region highlights the extreme challenges many growers face when trying to manage spatial variability within a single field while the conventional budyko framework uses long term water and energy budgets to integrate hydrologic behavior across the whole catchment our grid based formulation brings the same water and energy balance calculations to bear on the constituent subunits that together make the catchment response since all inflows outflows and changes in water storage are modeled explicitly mass is conserved within each grid cell thus enabling calculations of and ϕ over arbitrary time periods site specific management is fundamentally concerned with how different parts of a field respond to inputs and local hydrology plays a key role in this response it is clear from our analysis that the hydrology can vary a great amount within the same field as can be seen from fig 9 a single field may contain landscape positions that effectively function like a humid ecosystem while neighboring locations in the same field are behaving as a semi arid ecosystem the subfield scale budyko analysis indicates that hydrologic functioning of each landscape varies with climate soil characteristics and topography the deep soils of the colfax field site generally allow full root extension so that plant available water is determined by crop type spatially uniform and hydraulic properties nearly uniform rather than soil depth the relatively warm dry climate and deep soils at colfax do not favor lateral redistribution despite the site s extreme topography as a result budyko analysis reveals little variability in hydrologic function the only point dispersion at colfax indicated in fig 9 is due to variability in direct net solar radiation however for the wetter cooler field sites the topographic redistribution of water by lateral flow leads to seasonal saturation and runoff in convergent and lowland areas and extreme variability along the budyko curve the steeper divergent landscape positions typically have a negative q n e t i e a net loss of subsurface lateral flow with relatively large ϕ and values the poor drainage in these hydraulically restrictive argillic soil horizons within the troy leland and to a limited extent the genesee catchments create extensive perched water conditions which distribute water laterally downslope to toeslope positions with low ϕ and values since these shallow soils also have a relatively low amount of plant available water the e t a is generally lower leading to increased runoff and greater variability in compared to the dry colfax catchment table 5 the variability in ϕ and likewise stems from both landscape and climate factors operating on multiple scales this is illustrated by the linked arrows in the bottom right corner of fig 9 within individual fields lateral redistribution and local net radiation cause micro climatological differences and dispersion in ϕ and while between different fields differences in p and e t 0 cause the observed variability in ϕ and therefore the site specific climate signal represented by ϕ integrates these local and mean controls on climate landscape controls on and ϕ in the smr model include topography effective rooting depth z e and k s a t topography drives lateral redistribution of subsurface water into areas of convergence and lower elevation resulting in greater p e q while aspect influences available energy from shortwave radiation the remaining local controls z e and k s a t affect primarily and hence the vertical dispersion of points we simulated higher and e t a for deeper rooting crops and in deeper soils that do not inhibit root growth this result underscores the fact that z e controls the volume of water potentially available for transpiration donohue et al 2007 and is consistent with other studies that have investigated the effect rooting depth has on partitioning the water balance zhang et al 2001 porporato et al 2004 donohue et al 2010 liu et al 2016 the permeability of a soil influences through its partitioning of vertical water fluxes into groundwater recharge and e t a yokoo et al 2008 accordingly we observed soils with higher k s a t r promote greater percolation and lower e t a for example the lower for the genesee catchment in fig 9 can be attributed to a higher vertical k s a t r in the subsoil and artificial drainage through a tile line as trancoso et al 2016 have shown with a catchment classification system based on streamflow signature the landscape and climate variables used to describe streamflow mechanisms in the dunne diagram likewise drive the long term water and energy balances of the budyko framework at a much smaller scale we similarly found that the dominant form of runoff varied by hydrologic classification within catchments the greatest subsurface discharge q out according to the model occurred in deep soils on steep slopes with large negative q n e t class 3 while saturation excess runoff occurred predominately on shallow slopes in shallow to deep soils with large positive q n e t classes 1 and 2 by comparing fig 12 with fig 7 one can see that these two classes were the most frequently saturated these results are generally consistent with the dunne diagram dunne 1983 which predicts the hydrograph of catchments in sub humid climates with characteristically steep slopes and deep soils will be dominated by saturation excess overland flow trancoso et al 2016 have shown that energy limited catchments where saturation excess tends to be the dominant runoff mechanism have streamflow regimes that are ephemeral and less sensitive to changes in precipitation whereas arid catchments have ephemeral streams that are very sensitive to changes in precipitation at our field sites the situation is somewhat different all these fields are located in a semi arid mediterranean climate where streamflow is ephemeral typically running december through may and highly sensitive to precipitation i e the hydrograph is peaky while the dunne diagram predicts infiltration excess runoff in this type of climate this form is rarely if ever observed due to the low rainfall intensities and the high infiltration capacities of the soil instead runoff usually forms due to soil layers of low conductivity greatly restricting vertical drainage leading to a gradual filling of the root zone and formation of perched water tables 6 3 hydrologic zones for site specific management the classification approach that delineates a field into unique hydrologic zones based on crop water uptake and excess water has practical applications for efficient site specific management a grower is concerned primarily about profit rather than environmental impact however n losses have important financial ramifications since n fertilizer is the greatest operating cost of wheat production in the unites states vocke and ali 2013 the fate of applied fertilizer is therefore of concern to the grower and likewise the hydrologic function of the landscape should be of interest in as much as water influences yields and nitrogen use efficiency fiez et al 1995 basso et al 2013 many growers are now following variable rate fertilizer strategies that involve dividing a field into zones based on crop yield alone however these yield centric zones do not consider water redistribution in the landscape and with it the potential for runoff and leaching losses of applied fertilizer the utility of the proposed hydrologic classification system is that it provides spatially explicit information on both crop yield and nutrient loss potentials a common strategy used in the pacific northwest to avoid over winter nitrogen loss with a fall seeded crop is to apply less fertilizer in the fall at planting and more in the spring this strategy would be most effective in class 2 landscape positions which often have shallow soils with low yield and high potential runoff class 1 zones may also benefit from this strategy but they have deeper soils and therefore a better chance at retaining fall applied nitrogen class 3 and 4 field areas have little excess water so spring fertilizer application may not be as high a priority another strategy for reducing fertilizer waste is to manage excess water and thereby boost agricultural water use efficiency mcvicar et al 2002 for example growers may consider a fall seeded cover crop in class 1 and 2 soils where water is not limiting a cover crop reduces excess water leached nutrients and nitrous oxide emissions by increasing plant water uptake shelton et al 2018 knowledge of hydrologic connectivity between the zones may also provide some useful management strategies for example there is evidence that nitrate moves with subsurface lateral flow zhang et al 2011 such that areas acting as net sources of lateral flow will redistribute nitrate to downgradient convergent regions that accumulate water zhu et al 2009 therefore fertilizer rates could be decreased in class 1 high n loss potential areas which are typically located in toe slopes if they were located downgradient from a class 2 or 3 area that could provide supplementary n through subsurface lateral transport the best approach for adjusting an existing cropping practice or fertilizer strategy may be unclear to the grower post harvest evaluation is therefore an important management practice that can be enhanced by classified zones for example growers may undertake simple n budget accounting or profit analysis by zone and use the results to guide adjustments of zonal fertilizer rates by choosing zones with hydrologic and agronomic significance the grower adopts an organizational structure to the fields spatial complexity that simplifies targeting site specific deficiencies whether in crop yield or n loss in addition to changing management within existing zones post harvest recommendations may also involve changes to the number or the boundaries of zones the dual threshold approach used by this study can easily accommodate greater or fewer than four zones for example by selecting three levels of yield rather than two six classes the optimal number of classes will vary according to a host of factors related to characteristics of the field local climate the goals of the grower and the capabilities of the farming equipment used the dual threshold classification system is adaptable to other sources of data the first threshold regarding n loss potential could be informed by twi calculated from an elevation map since two components are necessary to create hydrologically sensitive areas excess water and excess nutrients n balance data is critical calculating n use efficiency has traditionally required intensive sampling but rapid advances in remote sensing technology may soon make crop n uptake calculations routine magney et al 2017 yield potential data required by the second threshold could originate from a yield monitor or from remote sensing images a practical threshold for yield would be the field wide average yield required to make a profit break even yield meanwhile a practical threshold for n loss could be based on a nitrogen uptake efficiency goal though we used simulated p e x the usefulness of the dual threshold classification system would be enhanced if p e x could be determined from annual precipitation and scaled with easily accessible soil and terrain data this warrants further investigation 7 summary and conclusion despite the close connection few distributed hydrologic models developed to replicate surface runoff patterns for water quality management have been used to assist or assess agronomic management strategies particularly for guiding and evaluating variable rate fertilizer strategies this is surprising from an environmental water quality perspective since management strategies which focus on source control particularly on the optimization of fertilizer application in agricultural landscapes are often much more effective than transport control where treatment focuses on minimizing the delivery pollutants to a water body such as grass riparian buffers for nitrate removal rittenburg et al 2015 we implemented a dynamic root zone into the smr model to more effectively capture water fluxes in cropping systems of the eastern palouse region while spatially distributed soil maps improved the model s ability to produce patterns of plant available water reflected in yields we demonstrated the link between landscape hydrology and the budyko framework using the smr model to calculate the mean annual and seasonal water balances at 10 m grid resolution application of the budyko framework at the subfield scale highlighted extreme diversity of ecosystems that must be managed within a single field in the eastern palouse region these unique hydrologic zones are established and maintained by the redistribution of water through strong landscape and climate controls with topography soil depth and crop type being dominant factors in this region using transpiration as an indicator of potential crop yield and excess water as an indicator of potential nutrient loss a classification system was presented which provides a framework to evaluate the effects of management strategies from both an agronomic and environmental perspective this classification system advances current variable rate fertilizer management strategies where nitrogen fertilizer rates are based on crop yield maps alone by providing insight into the mechanisms driving the storage and transport of water within a landscape this site specific information can then be used to provide insight into optimal management practices e g timing amount and type of fertilizer crop selection that are best suited for the dominant hydrology of a specific landscape position although this classification approach is based fundamentally on a spatially explicit hydrologic model it is possible that a similar simpler classification system could be developed using observed crop yield data in addition to excess water and soil moisture patterns captured through static topographic mapping or remotely sensed imagery declaration of interests none declared

6504,spatially preferential flow processes occur at nested scales at the sediment water interface swi due in part to sediment heterogeneities which may be enhanced in flashy urban streams with heavy road sand influence however several factors including the flow rate dependence of preferential hyporheic flow and discrete groundwater discharge zones are commonly overlooked in reach scale models of groundwater surface water exchange using a series of controlled head tracer injection experiments coupled with cm scale geophysics within the highly reactive upper 30 cm of the hyporheic zone of an urban stream we quantified the flow dependence of local less mobile porosity volume mass transfer rate coefficient and the resulting local residence time in the less mobile pore space at three controlled downward fluid fluxes 0 8 2 and 3 m d experiments were performed in two adjacent streambed locations representing different sediment bulk vertical permeability less mobile porosity parameters were generally substantial and similar between the two streambed locations though a more competent thin organic layer at 15 cm depth in one location strongly impacted tracer loading flushing dynamics and local residence times increased downward flux led to 1 a decrease in less mobile porosity residence time in all experiments and 2 an increase in less mobile porosity fraction for most experiments additionally at the larger stream reach scale surface electrodes for electrical resistivity measurement were installed along 22 m of the wetted stream channel these surface electrode measurements were collected during a natural storm flow event which revealed widespread short term flushing e g 3 h of the hyporheic zone with stream water followed by longer term e g 60 h flushing of the swi with riparian zone groundwater flow dependence of preferential hyporheic zone flowpaths like in the controlled tracer experiments was also observed in these reach scale electrical resistivity tomography measurements our findings reveal that the spatial and temporal dependence of preferential flow processes create highly dynamic swi conditions that will affect the physical and coupled biogeochemical functions of the swi in urbanized sand impacted streams keywords preferential flow urban stream sediment water interface groundwater surface water interaction geophysics hyporheic 1 introduction the exchange of stream water with the hyporheic zone affects solute transport processes and coupling surface water sw and groundwater gw ecosystems brunke and gonser 1997 lewandowski et al 2015 in urban streams with flashy hydrographs the effect of such exchange can be further amplified through enhanced potential for various types of contamination in particular high nitrate concentration bhaskar and welty 2015 walsh et al 2005 northern urban streams of the united states us are further complicated by the physical and chemical influence of road salt and sand ledford and lautz 2015 in spite of the recent advances and numerous studies on sediment water interface swi exchange the factors affecting the interaction of urban streams with near stream aquifers particularly in regard to preferential flow processes have not been well quantified in stream conservative tracer injections are commonly used for characterizing the exchange between streams and their hyporheic zone the saturated sediments below and adjacent to streams into which sw temporarily recharges before returning to the channel knapp et al 2017 runkel and kimball 2002 wagner and harvey 1997 using conservative tracer concentration time series e g breakthrough curves btcs the average hyporheic zone size and exchange rate coefficient can be estimated indirectly over a stream reach of sufficient length to deform the input tracer signal bencala 1983 however the late time tailing observed in btcs during in stream tracer injection tests can be attributed to a combination of surface e g eddies pools and hyporheic zone transient storage briggs et al 2009 therefore the downstream tracer signature of hyporheic exchange alone is ambiguous in in channel solute btc tailing in the presence of surface transient storage further reach averaged transient storage estimations are not precise because hyporheic zones are composed of nested flowpaths of varied exchange timescales and the downstream in channel tracer response is often dominated by the hyporheic flowpaths with highest tracer mass flux occurring through relatively permeable sediments harvey et al 2013 although in stream tracer methods can be an efficient means to grossly parse stream reaches of varied residence time distribution timescales the nested flowpath complexity of hyporheic exchange is not well preserved using reach scale tracer techniques nor is heterogeneity in pore scale connectivity along individual flowpaths a growing body of model based and empirical research indicates that pore to bedform scale hyporheic zone residence time heterogeneity may be critical to predicting biogeochemical outcomes briggs et al 2015 harvey et al 2013 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 the variability of the hyporheic zone residence times in space results in part from heterogeneity in sediment permeability at varied scales brunke and gonser 1997 olsen and townsend 2003 the wide range of pore connectivity in the hyporheic zone generates spatially preferential flow through the more connected pores referred to as the mobile domain in groundwater flow and transport literature van genuchten and wierenga 1976 advection and dispersion are the dominant transport processes in the mobile domain the coupled less mobile domain created by more poorly connected pores or localized pockets with low permeability has hydraulic exchange governed by relatively slow advection and or diffusion berkowitz et al 2006 day lewis et al 2017 feehley et al 2000 wheaton and singha 2010 further large variability in grain size such as that commonly observed in sand and gravel sediments of streams can cause fundamentally well connected pores to function as less mobile zones due to obstructions in the flow field briggs et al 2018 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 at bedform to stream reach scales spatially focused preferential groundwater discharge constrains and modifies hyporheic flow fields briggs and hare 2018 hester et al 2014 further enhancing spatiotemporal heterogeneity in physical streambed exchange dynamics boano et al 2014 the presence of mobile and less mobile domains dual porosity in the hyporheic zone and groundwater discharge flowpaths can create a spectrum of solute residence times and as a result impacts biogeochemical reactivity solute transport aquifer management and design of remediation techniques briggs et al 2015 cardenas 2015 culkin et al 2008 in particular fine scale variation in sediment permeability may control the formation of anoxic microzones within hyporheic downwelling zones impacting the reduction of nitrate in stream water briggs et al 2015 as mentioned above quantitative evaluation of nested preferential flow processes at the swi universally challenges traditional sw and gw exchange methodologies as streambed complexity is enhanced through the addition of non native road sand and flashy reworking in urban streams these methodological challenges become daunting limitations one of the most common methods to investigate the hyporheic zone is direct fluid sampling however pumped fluid data might not be spatially representative and are primarily sensitive to mobile porosity domains from which water is more easily drawn on the other hand geoelectrical measurements are sensitive to both mobile and less mobile domains day lewis and singha 2008 geoelectrical techniques have been successfully used by researchers for imaging swi processes and preferential flow at varied scales acworth and dasey 2003 al hagrey and michaelsen 1999 crook et al 2008 nyquist et al 2008 toran et al 2013 ward et al 2010a using geoelectrical measurements at cm scales the bulk electrical conductivity ec which is sensitive to both mobile and less mobile domains can be measured providing additional information beyond fluid ec via fluid sampling briggs et al 2013 singha et al 2007 specifically the relationship between bulk ec and collocated fluid ec is used to quantify less mobile porosity dynamics briggs et al 2014 swanson et al 2012 this geoelectrical signature of mass transfer between domains with different connectivity has been observed in controlled laboratory experiments field experiments and simulated numerically briggs et al 2014 2013 day lewis and singha 2008 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 singha et al 2007 swanson et al 2012 in a medium with less mobile porosity bulk ec which is sensitive to both mobile and less mobile domains lags behind fluid ec which is predominantly sensitive to more mobile pore flow the bulk ec lag results from the fact that less mobile domains equilibrate to an induced ec perturbation e g tracer pulse at a later time compared to more well connected pores a hysteretic relation i e a hysteresis loop therefore develops between fluid and bulk ec when simultaneously monitoring both while injecting ionic tracers singha et al 2007 the shape of the hysteresis loops can provide information on less mobile exchange parameters which can be graphically and semi analytically extracted briggs et al 2014 for example this method has been used to reveal the differential loading of ionic tracer in cm scale sand and gravel sediments briggs et al 2018 numerical simulations by liu and kitanidis 2012 and mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 demonstrated the sensitivity of less mobile porosity dynamics to flow velocity however such flow dependence has not been investigated in the hyporheic zone particularly in complex urban systems previous work indicates hydraulically modified urban streams to be of unique nutrient cycling wollheim et al 2005 and greenhouse gas production dynamics beaulieu et al 2011 here we look to quantify the effect of hydrodynamics on varied scale preferential flow processes in an urban stream known specifically to have high nitrate concentration levels and nitrous oxide production in addition to strong nitrate loading this stream displays prominent accumulations of high permeability road sand that likely enhance hyporheic exchange and spatial variability in porosity and permeability compared to the native sediments specifically we measure and analyze the cm scale less mobile porosity fraction mass transfer rate coefficient and the resultant less mobile residence time under different controlled downward hyporheic fluid fluxes we hypothesize that less mobile porosity dynamics are flow dependent and we seek to quantify this dependence we also leveraged a concurrent large natural precipitation stream discharge event to image changes in reach scale preferential exchanges of sw and gw over several days affected by the changes in reach scale vertical flux due to the storm which might impact the spatial distribution and biogeochemical functionality of mobile versus less mobile porosity zones at the cm scale these multi scale geophysical measurements demonstrate the complexity and flow dependence of preferential hyporheic flow processes and groundwater discharge in the hyporheic zone of an urban stream setting and indicate the importance of multi scale modeling and field investigations 2 methods in this section we describe the field site and experimental setup and analysis for the cm scale and reach scale electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements 2 1 site description the multi scale electrical experiments were performed at sawmill brook in burlington massachusetts usa fig 1 in the westernmost part of the ipswich river watershed wollheim et al 2005 the study reach has a contributing area of approximately 4 km2 a slope of 0 017 and an average width of 1 9 m and depth of 0 09 m during summer low flow briggs et al 2010 the mean discharge of the ipswich river at south middleton ma which is the closest u s geological survey usgs site 01101500 was 1 2 m3 s in the month of experiment the stream flows through glacial till sands and gravels williams et al 2004 although along the upstream 22 m section used for this study the incised channel currently shows little evidence of connectivity with mapped natural sand and gravel deposits and is instead dominated by allochthonous organic material and mineral soils however the shallow swi material is dominated by road sand as discussed below the study site at sawmill brook is located in a small land conservation zone embedded in a densely populated area that is approximately 25 impervious pellerin et al 2008 the local hydrology is heavily influenced by anthropogenic signals due to urbanization as has been studied by a number of researchers for instance wollheim et al 2005 investigated the effect of urbanization on nitrogen retention in the ipswich river watershed via the stream measurements using a transient storage modeling approach that delineates in channel and hyporheic exchange briggs et al 2010 found that on average sawmill brook has a relatively small shallow hyporheic exchange zone 0 05 m depth that is likely constrained vertically by upwelling groundwater incomplete denitrification is likely an important process in this stream as sawmill brook and one of its tributaries were identified by beaulieu et al 2011 as being some of the largest net emitters of nitrous oxide n2o of the streams considered in that study the impact of winter road salt and sand on stream chemistry and the hyporheic zone is apparent in the stream bed and water chemistry pellerin et al 2008 road sand deposits dominate the main channel for hundreds of meters downstream of road crossings often being tens of centimeters thick fig s1 mixing of the sand with the natural organic rich material in the shallow streambed can hypothetically lead to the creation of mobile and less mobile domains as the sand deposits can function as the mobile matrix around less mobile mineral soil and organic deposits competent leaf layers were present in the shallow sediment in multiple locations at different depths in the site as evidenced during sediment core collection moreover preliminary seepage measurements made in the process of locating the dual domain porosity apparatuses ddpa described below indicated upward flow gradients 2 2 experimental setup the swi dual porosity and preferential groundwater exchange dynamics of sawmill brook were evaluated at two different scales simultaneously the cm scale measurements are used to investigate the less mobile exchange parameters in controlled induced infiltration experiments at different vertical fluid fluxes while the reach scale ert measurements are used to investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of sw and gw exchange in response to a large storm flow event 2 2 1 centimeter scale streambed tracer tests at different downward fluxes to quantitatively assess the effect of varied downward hyporheic fluxes on less mobile porosity dynamics two ddpas were designed and constructed in the same manner as briggs et al 2018 fig 2 and described in detail by scruggs et al 2018 a ddpa comprises an open ended cylinder made of polyvinyl chloride with diameter of 55 cm and height of 100 cm the cylinder was installed vertically into the swi to a depth of approximately 30 cm allowing discrete streambed locations within the ddpa to be temporarily converted to controlled downwelling zones to differentiate the two cylinders used for our experiments one is referred to as ddpa us the upstream ddpa and the other is referred to ddpa ds the downstream ddpa according to their location relative to the flow direction fig 1c the water level in the cylinder was maintained at a fixed higher head relative to the stream using a float switch given that the ddpa cylinder was open at both ends this created vertical flow with a desired constant flux into the streambed for the tracer tests stream water was first pumped to a large tank reservoir on the bank and an ionic tracer nacl was added to the water until it reached a fluid ec of approximately 2500 μs cm background fluid ec of the stream was approximately 900 μs cm during experiments a series of float switches and pumps cycled the ec fluid injectate from the larger tank through a smaller controlled intermediate reservoir and from there into the ddpa cylinders the controlled injection of elevated ec water was continued until the ddpa sediment reached fluid and bulk ec equilibrium the method to measure fluid and bulk ec are described in detail below at this stage the ddpa was flushed with the background stream water at a similar rate to the solute injection the background water was provided from a separate large reservoir and smaller tank using a process similar to that used for the tracer fluid and bulk ec were measured during the course of injection and flush phases measurements were performed in both ddpa for downward fluid fluxes of approximately 0 8 m d 2 m d and 3 m d the 2 m d flux experiment was performed on july 11 12 2017 prior to storm event flow while the 3 m d and 0 8 m d flux experiments were performed on july 13 14 and july 15 16 respectively after the surface water storm pulse had fully dissipated all equipment remained in place during the storm flow event in each experiment both ddpa us and ddpa ds had similar fluxes though different internal water levels to allow comparison of the response for differences between sediments at different locations the fluxes were monitored multiple times via measuring the volume of injected water through the ddpa system per time during the experiment to ensure a constant and similar flux for the two ddpas the average effective vertical hydraulic conductivity was measured to be 4 m d for ddpa us and 11 m d for ddpa ds based on constant head tests likely reflecting the greater abundance of natural organics versus road sand at the us location and the ddpa heads were adjusted according to darcy s law to maintain a similar flux for ddpa us and ddpa ds these vertical hydraulic conductivity measurements were performed before and after the storm pulse and no change was observed ensuring no major reworking of streambed sediments within the ddpa rings bulk ec was measured in the ddpas using the resistance measured by a super sting 8 resistivity meter connected to four stainless steel electrodes in a wenner equidistant configuration fig 2 in each cylinder two sets of four partially insulated electrodes were inserted in the sediment at two depths 10 and 20 cm hereafter we refer to the electrode set at 10 and 20 cm depth in the ddpa us as us 10 and us 20 respectively similarly the electrode sets in the ddpa ds are called ds 10 and ds 20 resistance was converted to apparent conductivity approximating the geometric factor as k 4πa where a is electrode spacing and is equal to 5 cm assuming the electrical measurements were not notably sensitive to the water column above or the insulating boundaries of the ddpa insensitivity of the geometric factor to the water column was verified experimentally when the tracer concentration within the ddpa water column was modified there was no immediate response at any subsurface electrode array the accuracy of the analytically determined geometric factor for the determination of apparent conductivity was assessed numerically and the error was found to be 6 or less for the setups considered here fluid ec was measured by ec meters amber science eugene oregon connected to electrical conductivity cells that were in turn connected to 1 8 stainless steel metal tubes with a slit opening at the bottom similar to the usgs minipoint design harvey et al 2013 water was pumped up to the meter via peristaltic pumps masterflex cole parmer with a low flow rate 3 ml min to minimize altering the ddpa sediment flow field synchronized data from all fluid ec meters were logged at 30 second intervals by a custom designed labview program national instruments austin tx run on a laptop computer using the tubing flow rate and the length of the tubing the time recorded by the ec meter was corrected to have similar timing for both fluid and bulk ec measurements in some cases the time correction was not precise enough perhaps due to the inconsistency of the sampling rate and fluid and bulk ec btcs were not completely aligned in such cases the measurements were aligned based on the median travel time extracted from fluid and bulk ec btcs the fluid ec measured by the device was reported as the specific ec at 25 c the work of briggs et al 2018 indicated that the ddpa methodology would be improved by depth specific temperature correction of bulk ec data to compare fluid and bulk ec directly measured bulk ec was also converted to specific ec at 25 c using the water temperature recorded by ibuttons ibutton thermochron ds1922l maxim integrated installed inside each ddpa at 10 and 20 cm depths specific fluid and bulk ec are plotted versus time generating btcs for both ec measurements and the hysteresis loops between the two are plotted in concentration space as bulk ec versus fluid ec the hysteresis loops are used to graphically estimate the ratio of less mobile to mobile porosities β and the first order mass transfer coefficient between mobile and less mobile domains briggs et al 2014 showed that using the hinge points obtained from the hysteresis loop fig 3 a β can be graphically estimated as 1 β σ b 3 σ b 0 σ b 2 σ b 3 here σ b 0 is the bulk ec associated with the hysteresis hinge point at equilibrium before injection σ b 2 is the bulk ec associated with the hinge point at equilibrium after injection and σ b 3 is the hysteresis hinge point of the flushing phase of the injection see briggs et al 2014 for additional detail in this method we assume that during the ionic tracer breakthrough the mobile and less mobile zones essentially act as parallel electrical conductors and this assumption is more valid during the flush limb of the hysteresis loop which is the reason why hinge points 0 2 and 3 are used for the calculation of β and hinge point 1 is not considered day lewis et al 2017 it is noteworthy that if the fraction of less mobile porosity is negligible hinge points 3 and 0 will be collocated resulting in a linear relationship between fluid and bulk ec as expected from archie s law archie 1942 using β and the measured total porosity mobile and less mobile porosities are determined total porosity was volumetrically measured in the laboratory using the samples extracted from different depths of the ddpa ds a cylinder with a known volume of water was slowly and filled with the oven dried sample on a shake table and porosity was calculated as the ratio of the initial known volume of water over the volume of saturated sediment the measured average total porosity was 0 38 the laboratory porosity measurement was also confirmed by the laser based grain size analysis to estimate the less mobile residence time the classic mass transfer rate coefficient ma and zheng 2011 between mobile and less mobile domains α is calculated using the semi analytical model presented by briggs et al 2014 and modified by briggs et al 2018 in this method we fit a differentiable function using non linear least squares regression to the mobile porosity ec σ m here synonymous with fluid ec time series prior to reaching the tracer injection plateau we used a second order polynomial for fitting which is called g hereafter fig 3b conceptually the equation for bulk ec σ b of a dual domain medium is obtained from singha et al 2007 as 2 σ b θ m θ lm q 1 θ m σ m θ lm σ lm here θ m is the mobile porosity θ lm is the less mobile porosity σ l m is the less mobile porosity ec and q is the cementation exponent which is estimated by archie s law archie 1942 using the slope of best fit line between equilibrium points the function g is substituted for σ m in equation 2 which is then differentiated with respect to time to obtain the time derivative of σ b additionally the transport equation of less mobile concentration θ lm σ lm t α σ m σ lm coats and smith 1964 ma and zheng 2011 is substituted in the equation for the time derivative of σ l m this yields a single ordinary differential equation the analytical solution of which is fit to the experimental bulk ec in order to estimate α fig 3b local residence time within the less mobile porosity domain is then calculated as θ lm α more details about quantification of less mobile porosity exchange timescales is provided in section s2 of supporting information 2 2 2 reach scale preferential surface and groundwater connectivity experiments reach scale ert measurements were performed to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of sw and gw connectivity at the reach scale i e 22 m of channel length to the approximate 4 m streambed depth our original intention was to conduct a constant rate salt addition at the upper reach boundary to electrically distinguish natural hyporheic exchange zones from lateral streambed groundwater flow and upward groundwater discharge zones similar to what has been done by ward et al 2010b however a large natural precipitation event 76 mm rain in 4 h according to nearby bedford hanscom field ma reported by the national center for environmental information ncei of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa started around 4 pm on july 12th 2017 was instead leveraged to more naturally investigate event driven hyporheic exchange and groundwater discharge the rain event could be harnessed for a natural ert tracer experiment because the rain water was over an order of magnitude less conductive than the pre storm stream water so there was abundant ec contrast to image the coupled sw and gw exchange processes reach scale ert data were collected along the channel by a super sting 8 resistivity meter using a dipole dipole array across 22 m of the stream and the data are presented as electrical conductivity bulk ec the inverse of bulk resistivity for the sake of consistency with the ddpa experiments the rainfall event occurred on july 12 2017 approximately 16 00 19 30 fig s2 and provided a fortuitous opportunity to observe a natural perturbation of stream fluid ec and stage which were both tracked over time using a solinst datalogger solinst on canada installed 11 5 m upstream of ddpa us attached to rebar in a large pool fig 1c the bulk ec measurements were collected twice before the storm starting from july 11 2017 and multiple times after the storm from 2 h after the storm to july 15 2017 summarized in table 1 each reach scale electrical measurement series lasted for approximately 1 h twenty eight electrodes were installed with an electrode spacing of 75 cm and data were collected from the electrode line run down the thalweg fig 1c unlike the ddpa experiments where apparent bulk ec was analyzed using the raw electrical data the reach scale resistivity data were inverted using r2 version 2 7a binley and kemna 2005 to recover two dimensional sections of bulk streambed ec that vary in space and over time the domain of interest for inversion in r2 was 4 m in depth and 22 m in length while boundaries are about 200 m away grid sizes in depth and longitudinal direction were 0 1 m and 0 25 m respectively the data errors are set for each measurement based on the field data less than 8 and the maximum number of allowed iterations was 7 moreover the effect of stream water layer on inversion results was tested and appeared to be negligible on the inversion results the changes in bulk ec with respect to the initial condition before the storm were also created using difference inversion in r2 3 results the results regarding the less mobile porosity dynamics obtained from the cm scale measurements are provided in section 3 1 and the storm event driven hyporheic exchange and groundwater discharge dynamics characterized with reach scale ert measurements is described in section 3 2 3 1 characterization of centimeter scale less mobile porosity fluid and bulk ec data from both ddpas at 3 m d downward fluid fluxes are presented as btcs in fig 4 btcs for all downward fluxes are shown in fig s3 in all cases after initially changing together the bulk ec lags behind fluid ec indicating the presence of less mobile porosity with delayed loading of solute tracer fluid and bulk ec reach a plateau before the start of the flush phase in all cases however in some cases a plateau is not reached in flush phases due to experimental limitations in the field e g poor weather that forced early termination of the experiments such as fig 4d the time to reach plateau varies between different fluxes and locations for instance at 3 m d flux ds 20 fig 4b reaches plateau after 7 h while it takes 12 h for us 20 fig 4d to reach plateau at the same flux in most cases the rising limb injection is complete and smooth however in some cases such as us 10 for a flux of 3 m d fig 4c the rising limb cannot be used for calculations given that fluid ec measurements were affected by a temporary device malfunction therefore only the falling limb is used for the calculations in these cases hysteresis loops are formed as a result of the lag between fluid and bulk ec hysteresis loops for 3 m d experiment are shown in fig 5 and the results for all experiments are shown in fig s4 the difference between the shapes of hysteresis loops at different locations depths and fluxes fig s4 indicate spatial variability and flux dependence of parameters controlling mobile less mobile exchange using the graphical evaluation method of briggs et al 2014 less mobile porosity can be calculated using β obtained from eq 1 and the measured total porosity of the ddpa sediments the less mobile porosity values extracted from ec hysteresis loops are presented in table 2 in all cases the less mobile porosity for 0 8 m d flux is smaller than the higher fluxes 2 and 3 m d sometimes this difference is more appreciable as in the case of us 20 where less mobile porosity increases approximately 40 from low to high downward flux the differences between 2 m d and 3 m d fluxes are not substantial except for us 20 the fits used for calculating α and less mobile residence time for 3 m d downward flux are shown in fig 6 fits used for all experiments are shown in fig s5 in all cases α increases with increase in flux indicating faster exchange between the dual porosity domains which causes the less mobile residence time to decrease as flux increases even though the volume of less mobile porosity increases in all experiments table 2 fig 7 a more notable change of less mobile porosity as a result of increase in flux for us 20 fig 7a as well as the distinct increase in residence time for us 20 compared to other locations fig 7c is noteworthy 3 2 reach scale preferential surface water and groundwater connectivity experiments as a result of the rain precipitation event and storm runoff event the water level increased by approximately 0 5 m in a pool at the head of the reach peaking on july 12 at 7 45 pm the fluid ec of stream water ranged between 145 and 1200 μs cm over the storm event and was at a minimum on july 12 at 10 00 pm as a result of more resistive rain water from the storm fig 8 a reach scale ert measurements were made two times leading up to the storm event and representative data inversions from before and after the storm are shown in fig s6 the meter scale zonation bulk ec in the background domain 8 h before the storm fig s6 a may indicate zones of varied sediment types and or varying pore water ec at 1 5 m depth due to groundwater discharge and preferential flowpath processes with bulk ec varying between 1 and 10 μs cm as mentioned above upward positive hydraulic head gradients were measured in several places including the locations of ddpas along the reach before the storm indicating upward flow of groundwater when the stream was at low stage a positive shift in bulk ec from before the event to 60 h after the storm fig s6 b is appreciable in the zones of relatively low bulk conductivity the changes of bulk ec over time with respect to the background condition indicate flow dependent hyporheic and groundwater exchanges no significant change in bulk ec was observed between 8 h pre storm and 2 h pre storm fig 8b with the small observed variations corresponding to the fact that stream water ec was also changing during the day by approximately 200 μs cm fig 8a figure panels 8c k show the change of bulk ec over time for the resistivity measurements made following the event compared to the pre storm condition the sensitivity map of the inverted ert measurements shows a strong reduction in sensitivity below approximately 3 m for most time steps fig s7 therefore although inversion results are always plotted to the 4 m depth here the deeper results are likely highly influenced by shallower bulk ec patterns a few hours after the storm most areas experience a reduction in bulk ec compared to the pre storm condition while some discrete zones experience increase in bulk ec fig 8c d these zones of increased conductivity generally correspond with the regions of relatively low background bulk ec fig s6 a as more time passes after the storm the areas that experience an increase in bulk ec compared to the pre storm condition expand albeit the shallow streambed and a few other discrete zones approach a similar bulk ec value or are somewhat less conductive than the pre storm condition fig 8h k we attribute the initial drop in streambed bulk ec throughout much of the domain to stage and velocity driven influx of resistive channel water as influenced by the lower ec rain source water the zones of enhanced conductivity that grow substantially over time likely represent flushing of riparian groundwaters while the late time regions that show similar or reduced conductivity to pre storm values represent ambient low streamflow hyporheic flowpaths no ddpa injections were performed in the day following the storm i e until the stream had returned to base flow so the zones of enhanced conductivity are not related to the effects of the cm scale preferential flow experiments 4 discussion in this section we discuss the flow dependence of swi exchange at the cm scale at the reach scale and then link those results to describe preferential flow 4 1 flow dependence of cm scale swi exchange and implications the time lag between fluid and bulk ec for both ddpas at all depths and experimental fluxes indicates the ubiquitous and resilient presence of less mobile porosity caused by heterogeneity in the media at the cm scale fig 4 at the us 20 location for all fluxes both fluid and bulk ec rise more slowly compared to their counterparts at ds 10 ds 20 and us 10 fig s3 j l the difference in the shape of hysteresis loops being narrower for us 20 compared to other comparable measurement sets is also clearly noticeable these observations suggest that the sediment permeability and differential mobile less mobile loading at us 20 is different from the other measurement locations after the tracer tests we excavated the sediment and observed that the sediment around 20 cm in the ddpa us included a thin layer of fine sediment mixed with leaf and organic material fig s8 embedded in more well sorted coarse sand presumed road sand this result exemplifies the sensitivity of this method to layers with different sediment properties at relatively high spatial resolution and indicates that sand from the urban setting may enhance dual porosity dynamics as natural silts and organics are embedded in a high permeability matrix visual inspection of the hysteresis loops reveals that the loops become wider with the increase in flux especially from 0 8 m d to 2 m d indicative of increased less mobile porosity fraction briggs et al 2014 meaning that there are more zones where solute can have longer residence time increasing the flux from 0 8 to 2 m d increases the estimated less mobile porosity but changing the flux from 2 to 3 m d causes minimal change with either no change or a slight increase in the less mobile porosity table 2 this differential response with flux rates indicates a stronger flow dependence of less mobile porosity at lower flows as flux increases the volume of less mobile porosity increases while α strongly decreases and causes a net reduction of less mobile porosity residence time such flow dependence of less mobile porosity dynamics is generally in accordance with the simulation results presented in mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 where they numerically investigated the effect of flow on less mobile exchange parameters in media streambed heterogeneities ranging from low permeability layers to cobble inclusions flow dependence of these less mobile zones would impact a number of processes including the formation and function of embedded anoxic microzones that can drive important redox biogeochemistry for example the anoxic production of n2o a potent greenhouse gas may be maximized at intermediate residence times e g quick et al 2016 so there is likely a sweet spot for n2o emissions in less mobile porosity in regards to hyporheic downwelling rate the organic material that helps form less mobile zones by increasing the heterogeneity in sediment permeability could further enhance reactivity by providing an in situ source of organic carbon and relatively high surface area for microbial colonization sawmill brook was reported by beaulieu et al 2011 as one of several urban streams with exceptionally high n2o production though the specific mechanisms of this strong net incomplete denitrification were not clear our work shows that shallow sediments within this stream may exhibit local residence times upward of approximately 2 5 h potentially generating the necessary conditions for the creation of anoxic microzones yet without the time needed for complete denitrification an intermediate time sweet spot for n2o production as indicated by the flume work of quick et al 2016 coupled with the substantial fraction of less mobile porosity and flow dependence observed at all measurement locations this work indicates less mobile dynamics should be explicitly considered in future work regarding n2o production in the hyporheic zone 4 2 flow dependence of reach scale swi exchange and implications at the reach scale directly following the storm event most areas of the subsurface experience a strong reduction in bulk ec compared to the pre storm condition as shown in fig 8c this widespread reduction in bulk ec likely results from deep penetration of rain dominated storm water into a temporarily expanded hyporheic zone these rapid surface and subsurface exchanges when stage changes quickly is also observed in larger dam regulated rivers where stage changes can be more systematically studied e g mwakanyamale et al 2012 sawyer and cardenas 2009 further these electrically based observations of the hyporheic zone response to the storm flow also support the geochemical characterization of zimmer and lautz 2014 who found preferential and time variable connectivity between sw and gw in response to a large flow event in a similar size headwater stream any cm scale less mobile porosity zones that were previously not included in low stage shallow hyporheic flowpaths might be expected to switch temporally to processing the storm pulse hyporheic exchange before reverting back to groundwater dominated water as the stream stage decreases approximately 4 h after the storm the storm pulse hyporheic zone quickly contracts vertically toward the swi as ambient groundwaters rebound we posit that strong spatially localized increases in streambed conductivity observed over the following 56 h results from precipitation loading of the adjacent hillslope and riparian areas and a subsequent flushing of riparian salts through preferential streambed groundwater discharge zones the hillslopes and riparian zone flush is likely highly conductive given the common use of road salt and sand due to urbanization and typical concentration of salts with the unsaturated zone due to evapotranspiration processes and finally the fact that they can act as a temporary storage of salt in urban streams and behave as its continuous source to the streams in summers cooper et al 2014 ledford et al 2016 flushing of the riparian zone brings more highly conductive water to the subsurface of the stream and increases the bulk ec for the entire subsurface except the shallow zones and those areas that are well connected to the stream through continued hyporheic exchange the subsurface zones being connected to groundwater expand as the downwelling flux decreases fig 8c k the flux driven change in connectivity of most pores from stream to groundwater shows that the zones are not entirely separated and the hyporheic zone preferential flowpaths are flow dependent 4 3 linking the two scales of swi preferential flow both cm scale and reach scale measurements demonstrate how pore connectivity depends on stream flow conditions in cm scale measurements this flow dependence was observed in the change in less mobile exchange parameters while the reach scale measurements show that a storm pulse induced expansion of the hyporheic zone followed by contraction and dominance by groundwater flushing therefore the less mobile functionality for a given localized streambed sediment packet can be expected to switch between processing gw and sw over the course of a storm or season while coupled changes in streambed flow rate will alter local less mobile porosity residence time this research opens a quantitative window into highly complex nested streambed flow and transport dynamics that was not before attainable using previous methodology hyporheic exchange is driven by hydraulic pressure differentials between the swi and the subsurface which is a summation of channel pressures such as flow depth and velocity and upwelling groundwater pressure our reach scale ert measurements show that the spatial patterning of hyporheic exchange and groundwater upwelling is strongly variable in space and time in response to a flashy storm event therefore the biogeochemical functionality of the less mobile porosity we have characterized in the hyporheic zone may shift as well as bedform to reach scale flowpath dynamics change less mobile pores that act as anoxic microzones under a downwelling hyporheic condition will contribute differently to processes such as n2o production than if the same packet of sediments experiences upwelling groundwater and both conditions are possible throughout one storm event as illustrated here reactive modeling that incorporates these multi scale flow dependent processes is challenging but may be necessary to refine predictive models of greenhouse gas production in the hyporheic zone further investigation of quantitative or qualitative linkage between the multi scale measurements with modifications in cm scale measurements can be the target of future studies 5 conclusions preferential flow processes occur in nested form within streambeds due to spatiotemporal heterogeneities in sediment permeability and groundwater and surface water connectivity here quantitative investigation of less mobile porosity dynamics in controlled cm scale experiments were carried out in an urban stream at varied downward fluid flux conditions in two different streambed locations of varied bed permeability this investigation was coupled with electrical analysis of reach scale hyporheic exchange and groundwater discharge dynamics in a 3 day period following a large precipitation flow event the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 flow dependence of localized e g cm scale less mobile porosity dynamics occurs in the stream sediments from low to high vertical water flux rates the volume of less mobile porosity increases and α dramatically increases which results in a net reduction of less mobile porosity residence time 2 localized residence times in the less mobile porosity range up to several hours particularly where fine grained and organic materials were embedded within coarser road sand deposits creating a physical template for the formation of reactive anoxic microzones 3 reach scale ert measurements show short term flushing of the hyporheic zone with stream pulse water to a depth of several meters followed by preferential groundwater discharge of elevated ec riparian water likely altering the biogeochemical functionality of localized zones of less mobile porosity preferential exchange between surface and groundwater is observed at the cm and reach scales and the coupling of these processes nested at these two scales is likely important to quantifying and predicting the spatiotemporal reactive dynamics of stream swis

6504,spatially preferential flow processes occur at nested scales at the sediment water interface swi due in part to sediment heterogeneities which may be enhanced in flashy urban streams with heavy road sand influence however several factors including the flow rate dependence of preferential hyporheic flow and discrete groundwater discharge zones are commonly overlooked in reach scale models of groundwater surface water exchange using a series of controlled head tracer injection experiments coupled with cm scale geophysics within the highly reactive upper 30 cm of the hyporheic zone of an urban stream we quantified the flow dependence of local less mobile porosity volume mass transfer rate coefficient and the resulting local residence time in the less mobile pore space at three controlled downward fluid fluxes 0 8 2 and 3 m d experiments were performed in two adjacent streambed locations representing different sediment bulk vertical permeability less mobile porosity parameters were generally substantial and similar between the two streambed locations though a more competent thin organic layer at 15 cm depth in one location strongly impacted tracer loading flushing dynamics and local residence times increased downward flux led to 1 a decrease in less mobile porosity residence time in all experiments and 2 an increase in less mobile porosity fraction for most experiments additionally at the larger stream reach scale surface electrodes for electrical resistivity measurement were installed along 22 m of the wetted stream channel these surface electrode measurements were collected during a natural storm flow event which revealed widespread short term flushing e g 3 h of the hyporheic zone with stream water followed by longer term e g 60 h flushing of the swi with riparian zone groundwater flow dependence of preferential hyporheic zone flowpaths like in the controlled tracer experiments was also observed in these reach scale electrical resistivity tomography measurements our findings reveal that the spatial and temporal dependence of preferential flow processes create highly dynamic swi conditions that will affect the physical and coupled biogeochemical functions of the swi in urbanized sand impacted streams keywords preferential flow urban stream sediment water interface groundwater surface water interaction geophysics hyporheic 1 introduction the exchange of stream water with the hyporheic zone affects solute transport processes and coupling surface water sw and groundwater gw ecosystems brunke and gonser 1997 lewandowski et al 2015 in urban streams with flashy hydrographs the effect of such exchange can be further amplified through enhanced potential for various types of contamination in particular high nitrate concentration bhaskar and welty 2015 walsh et al 2005 northern urban streams of the united states us are further complicated by the physical and chemical influence of road salt and sand ledford and lautz 2015 in spite of the recent advances and numerous studies on sediment water interface swi exchange the factors affecting the interaction of urban streams with near stream aquifers particularly in regard to preferential flow processes have not been well quantified in stream conservative tracer injections are commonly used for characterizing the exchange between streams and their hyporheic zone the saturated sediments below and adjacent to streams into which sw temporarily recharges before returning to the channel knapp et al 2017 runkel and kimball 2002 wagner and harvey 1997 using conservative tracer concentration time series e g breakthrough curves btcs the average hyporheic zone size and exchange rate coefficient can be estimated indirectly over a stream reach of sufficient length to deform the input tracer signal bencala 1983 however the late time tailing observed in btcs during in stream tracer injection tests can be attributed to a combination of surface e g eddies pools and hyporheic zone transient storage briggs et al 2009 therefore the downstream tracer signature of hyporheic exchange alone is ambiguous in in channel solute btc tailing in the presence of surface transient storage further reach averaged transient storage estimations are not precise because hyporheic zones are composed of nested flowpaths of varied exchange timescales and the downstream in channel tracer response is often dominated by the hyporheic flowpaths with highest tracer mass flux occurring through relatively permeable sediments harvey et al 2013 although in stream tracer methods can be an efficient means to grossly parse stream reaches of varied residence time distribution timescales the nested flowpath complexity of hyporheic exchange is not well preserved using reach scale tracer techniques nor is heterogeneity in pore scale connectivity along individual flowpaths a growing body of model based and empirical research indicates that pore to bedform scale hyporheic zone residence time heterogeneity may be critical to predicting biogeochemical outcomes briggs et al 2015 harvey et al 2013 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 the variability of the hyporheic zone residence times in space results in part from heterogeneity in sediment permeability at varied scales brunke and gonser 1997 olsen and townsend 2003 the wide range of pore connectivity in the hyporheic zone generates spatially preferential flow through the more connected pores referred to as the mobile domain in groundwater flow and transport literature van genuchten and wierenga 1976 advection and dispersion are the dominant transport processes in the mobile domain the coupled less mobile domain created by more poorly connected pores or localized pockets with low permeability has hydraulic exchange governed by relatively slow advection and or diffusion berkowitz et al 2006 day lewis et al 2017 feehley et al 2000 wheaton and singha 2010 further large variability in grain size such as that commonly observed in sand and gravel sediments of streams can cause fundamentally well connected pores to function as less mobile zones due to obstructions in the flow field briggs et al 2018 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 at bedform to stream reach scales spatially focused preferential groundwater discharge constrains and modifies hyporheic flow fields briggs and hare 2018 hester et al 2014 further enhancing spatiotemporal heterogeneity in physical streambed exchange dynamics boano et al 2014 the presence of mobile and less mobile domains dual porosity in the hyporheic zone and groundwater discharge flowpaths can create a spectrum of solute residence times and as a result impacts biogeochemical reactivity solute transport aquifer management and design of remediation techniques briggs et al 2015 cardenas 2015 culkin et al 2008 in particular fine scale variation in sediment permeability may control the formation of anoxic microzones within hyporheic downwelling zones impacting the reduction of nitrate in stream water briggs et al 2015 as mentioned above quantitative evaluation of nested preferential flow processes at the swi universally challenges traditional sw and gw exchange methodologies as streambed complexity is enhanced through the addition of non native road sand and flashy reworking in urban streams these methodological challenges become daunting limitations one of the most common methods to investigate the hyporheic zone is direct fluid sampling however pumped fluid data might not be spatially representative and are primarily sensitive to mobile porosity domains from which water is more easily drawn on the other hand geoelectrical measurements are sensitive to both mobile and less mobile domains day lewis and singha 2008 geoelectrical techniques have been successfully used by researchers for imaging swi processes and preferential flow at varied scales acworth and dasey 2003 al hagrey and michaelsen 1999 crook et al 2008 nyquist et al 2008 toran et al 2013 ward et al 2010a using geoelectrical measurements at cm scales the bulk electrical conductivity ec which is sensitive to both mobile and less mobile domains can be measured providing additional information beyond fluid ec via fluid sampling briggs et al 2013 singha et al 2007 specifically the relationship between bulk ec and collocated fluid ec is used to quantify less mobile porosity dynamics briggs et al 2014 swanson et al 2012 this geoelectrical signature of mass transfer between domains with different connectivity has been observed in controlled laboratory experiments field experiments and simulated numerically briggs et al 2014 2013 day lewis and singha 2008 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 singha et al 2007 swanson et al 2012 in a medium with less mobile porosity bulk ec which is sensitive to both mobile and less mobile domains lags behind fluid ec which is predominantly sensitive to more mobile pore flow the bulk ec lag results from the fact that less mobile domains equilibrate to an induced ec perturbation e g tracer pulse at a later time compared to more well connected pores a hysteretic relation i e a hysteresis loop therefore develops between fluid and bulk ec when simultaneously monitoring both while injecting ionic tracers singha et al 2007 the shape of the hysteresis loops can provide information on less mobile exchange parameters which can be graphically and semi analytically extracted briggs et al 2014 for example this method has been used to reveal the differential loading of ionic tracer in cm scale sand and gravel sediments briggs et al 2018 numerical simulations by liu and kitanidis 2012 and mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 demonstrated the sensitivity of less mobile porosity dynamics to flow velocity however such flow dependence has not been investigated in the hyporheic zone particularly in complex urban systems previous work indicates hydraulically modified urban streams to be of unique nutrient cycling wollheim et al 2005 and greenhouse gas production dynamics beaulieu et al 2011 here we look to quantify the effect of hydrodynamics on varied scale preferential flow processes in an urban stream known specifically to have high nitrate concentration levels and nitrous oxide production in addition to strong nitrate loading this stream displays prominent accumulations of high permeability road sand that likely enhance hyporheic exchange and spatial variability in porosity and permeability compared to the native sediments specifically we measure and analyze the cm scale less mobile porosity fraction mass transfer rate coefficient and the resultant less mobile residence time under different controlled downward hyporheic fluid fluxes we hypothesize that less mobile porosity dynamics are flow dependent and we seek to quantify this dependence we also leveraged a concurrent large natural precipitation stream discharge event to image changes in reach scale preferential exchanges of sw and gw over several days affected by the changes in reach scale vertical flux due to the storm which might impact the spatial distribution and biogeochemical functionality of mobile versus less mobile porosity zones at the cm scale these multi scale geophysical measurements demonstrate the complexity and flow dependence of preferential hyporheic flow processes and groundwater discharge in the hyporheic zone of an urban stream setting and indicate the importance of multi scale modeling and field investigations 2 methods in this section we describe the field site and experimental setup and analysis for the cm scale and reach scale electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements 2 1 site description the multi scale electrical experiments were performed at sawmill brook in burlington massachusetts usa fig 1 in the westernmost part of the ipswich river watershed wollheim et al 2005 the study reach has a contributing area of approximately 4 km2 a slope of 0 017 and an average width of 1 9 m and depth of 0 09 m during summer low flow briggs et al 2010 the mean discharge of the ipswich river at south middleton ma which is the closest u s geological survey usgs site 01101500 was 1 2 m3 s in the month of experiment the stream flows through glacial till sands and gravels williams et al 2004 although along the upstream 22 m section used for this study the incised channel currently shows little evidence of connectivity with mapped natural sand and gravel deposits and is instead dominated by allochthonous organic material and mineral soils however the shallow swi material is dominated by road sand as discussed below the study site at sawmill brook is located in a small land conservation zone embedded in a densely populated area that is approximately 25 impervious pellerin et al 2008 the local hydrology is heavily influenced by anthropogenic signals due to urbanization as has been studied by a number of researchers for instance wollheim et al 2005 investigated the effect of urbanization on nitrogen retention in the ipswich river watershed via the stream measurements using a transient storage modeling approach that delineates in channel and hyporheic exchange briggs et al 2010 found that on average sawmill brook has a relatively small shallow hyporheic exchange zone 0 05 m depth that is likely constrained vertically by upwelling groundwater incomplete denitrification is likely an important process in this stream as sawmill brook and one of its tributaries were identified by beaulieu et al 2011 as being some of the largest net emitters of nitrous oxide n2o of the streams considered in that study the impact of winter road salt and sand on stream chemistry and the hyporheic zone is apparent in the stream bed and water chemistry pellerin et al 2008 road sand deposits dominate the main channel for hundreds of meters downstream of road crossings often being tens of centimeters thick fig s1 mixing of the sand with the natural organic rich material in the shallow streambed can hypothetically lead to the creation of mobile and less mobile domains as the sand deposits can function as the mobile matrix around less mobile mineral soil and organic deposits competent leaf layers were present in the shallow sediment in multiple locations at different depths in the site as evidenced during sediment core collection moreover preliminary seepage measurements made in the process of locating the dual domain porosity apparatuses ddpa described below indicated upward flow gradients 2 2 experimental setup the swi dual porosity and preferential groundwater exchange dynamics of sawmill brook were evaluated at two different scales simultaneously the cm scale measurements are used to investigate the less mobile exchange parameters in controlled induced infiltration experiments at different vertical fluid fluxes while the reach scale ert measurements are used to investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of sw and gw exchange in response to a large storm flow event 2 2 1 centimeter scale streambed tracer tests at different downward fluxes to quantitatively assess the effect of varied downward hyporheic fluxes on less mobile porosity dynamics two ddpas were designed and constructed in the same manner as briggs et al 2018 fig 2 and described in detail by scruggs et al 2018 a ddpa comprises an open ended cylinder made of polyvinyl chloride with diameter of 55 cm and height of 100 cm the cylinder was installed vertically into the swi to a depth of approximately 30 cm allowing discrete streambed locations within the ddpa to be temporarily converted to controlled downwelling zones to differentiate the two cylinders used for our experiments one is referred to as ddpa us the upstream ddpa and the other is referred to ddpa ds the downstream ddpa according to their location relative to the flow direction fig 1c the water level in the cylinder was maintained at a fixed higher head relative to the stream using a float switch given that the ddpa cylinder was open at both ends this created vertical flow with a desired constant flux into the streambed for the tracer tests stream water was first pumped to a large tank reservoir on the bank and an ionic tracer nacl was added to the water until it reached a fluid ec of approximately 2500 μs cm background fluid ec of the stream was approximately 900 μs cm during experiments a series of float switches and pumps cycled the ec fluid injectate from the larger tank through a smaller controlled intermediate reservoir and from there into the ddpa cylinders the controlled injection of elevated ec water was continued until the ddpa sediment reached fluid and bulk ec equilibrium the method to measure fluid and bulk ec are described in detail below at this stage the ddpa was flushed with the background stream water at a similar rate to the solute injection the background water was provided from a separate large reservoir and smaller tank using a process similar to that used for the tracer fluid and bulk ec were measured during the course of injection and flush phases measurements were performed in both ddpa for downward fluid fluxes of approximately 0 8 m d 2 m d and 3 m d the 2 m d flux experiment was performed on july 11 12 2017 prior to storm event flow while the 3 m d and 0 8 m d flux experiments were performed on july 13 14 and july 15 16 respectively after the surface water storm pulse had fully dissipated all equipment remained in place during the storm flow event in each experiment both ddpa us and ddpa ds had similar fluxes though different internal water levels to allow comparison of the response for differences between sediments at different locations the fluxes were monitored multiple times via measuring the volume of injected water through the ddpa system per time during the experiment to ensure a constant and similar flux for the two ddpas the average effective vertical hydraulic conductivity was measured to be 4 m d for ddpa us and 11 m d for ddpa ds based on constant head tests likely reflecting the greater abundance of natural organics versus road sand at the us location and the ddpa heads were adjusted according to darcy s law to maintain a similar flux for ddpa us and ddpa ds these vertical hydraulic conductivity measurements were performed before and after the storm pulse and no change was observed ensuring no major reworking of streambed sediments within the ddpa rings bulk ec was measured in the ddpas using the resistance measured by a super sting 8 resistivity meter connected to four stainless steel electrodes in a wenner equidistant configuration fig 2 in each cylinder two sets of four partially insulated electrodes were inserted in the sediment at two depths 10 and 20 cm hereafter we refer to the electrode set at 10 and 20 cm depth in the ddpa us as us 10 and us 20 respectively similarly the electrode sets in the ddpa ds are called ds 10 and ds 20 resistance was converted to apparent conductivity approximating the geometric factor as k 4πa where a is electrode spacing and is equal to 5 cm assuming the electrical measurements were not notably sensitive to the water column above or the insulating boundaries of the ddpa insensitivity of the geometric factor to the water column was verified experimentally when the tracer concentration within the ddpa water column was modified there was no immediate response at any subsurface electrode array the accuracy of the analytically determined geometric factor for the determination of apparent conductivity was assessed numerically and the error was found to be 6 or less for the setups considered here fluid ec was measured by ec meters amber science eugene oregon connected to electrical conductivity cells that were in turn connected to 1 8 stainless steel metal tubes with a slit opening at the bottom similar to the usgs minipoint design harvey et al 2013 water was pumped up to the meter via peristaltic pumps masterflex cole parmer with a low flow rate 3 ml min to minimize altering the ddpa sediment flow field synchronized data from all fluid ec meters were logged at 30 second intervals by a custom designed labview program national instruments austin tx run on a laptop computer using the tubing flow rate and the length of the tubing the time recorded by the ec meter was corrected to have similar timing for both fluid and bulk ec measurements in some cases the time correction was not precise enough perhaps due to the inconsistency of the sampling rate and fluid and bulk ec btcs were not completely aligned in such cases the measurements were aligned based on the median travel time extracted from fluid and bulk ec btcs the fluid ec measured by the device was reported as the specific ec at 25 c the work of briggs et al 2018 indicated that the ddpa methodology would be improved by depth specific temperature correction of bulk ec data to compare fluid and bulk ec directly measured bulk ec was also converted to specific ec at 25 c using the water temperature recorded by ibuttons ibutton thermochron ds1922l maxim integrated installed inside each ddpa at 10 and 20 cm depths specific fluid and bulk ec are plotted versus time generating btcs for both ec measurements and the hysteresis loops between the two are plotted in concentration space as bulk ec versus fluid ec the hysteresis loops are used to graphically estimate the ratio of less mobile to mobile porosities β and the first order mass transfer coefficient between mobile and less mobile domains briggs et al 2014 showed that using the hinge points obtained from the hysteresis loop fig 3 a β can be graphically estimated as 1 β σ b 3 σ b 0 σ b 2 σ b 3 here σ b 0 is the bulk ec associated with the hysteresis hinge point at equilibrium before injection σ b 2 is the bulk ec associated with the hinge point at equilibrium after injection and σ b 3 is the hysteresis hinge point of the flushing phase of the injection see briggs et al 2014 for additional detail in this method we assume that during the ionic tracer breakthrough the mobile and less mobile zones essentially act as parallel electrical conductors and this assumption is more valid during the flush limb of the hysteresis loop which is the reason why hinge points 0 2 and 3 are used for the calculation of β and hinge point 1 is not considered day lewis et al 2017 it is noteworthy that if the fraction of less mobile porosity is negligible hinge points 3 and 0 will be collocated resulting in a linear relationship between fluid and bulk ec as expected from archie s law archie 1942 using β and the measured total porosity mobile and less mobile porosities are determined total porosity was volumetrically measured in the laboratory using the samples extracted from different depths of the ddpa ds a cylinder with a known volume of water was slowly and filled with the oven dried sample on a shake table and porosity was calculated as the ratio of the initial known volume of water over the volume of saturated sediment the measured average total porosity was 0 38 the laboratory porosity measurement was also confirmed by the laser based grain size analysis to estimate the less mobile residence time the classic mass transfer rate coefficient ma and zheng 2011 between mobile and less mobile domains α is calculated using the semi analytical model presented by briggs et al 2014 and modified by briggs et al 2018 in this method we fit a differentiable function using non linear least squares regression to the mobile porosity ec σ m here synonymous with fluid ec time series prior to reaching the tracer injection plateau we used a second order polynomial for fitting which is called g hereafter fig 3b conceptually the equation for bulk ec σ b of a dual domain medium is obtained from singha et al 2007 as 2 σ b θ m θ lm q 1 θ m σ m θ lm σ lm here θ m is the mobile porosity θ lm is the less mobile porosity σ l m is the less mobile porosity ec and q is the cementation exponent which is estimated by archie s law archie 1942 using the slope of best fit line between equilibrium points the function g is substituted for σ m in equation 2 which is then differentiated with respect to time to obtain the time derivative of σ b additionally the transport equation of less mobile concentration θ lm σ lm t α σ m σ lm coats and smith 1964 ma and zheng 2011 is substituted in the equation for the time derivative of σ l m this yields a single ordinary differential equation the analytical solution of which is fit to the experimental bulk ec in order to estimate α fig 3b local residence time within the less mobile porosity domain is then calculated as θ lm α more details about quantification of less mobile porosity exchange timescales is provided in section s2 of supporting information 2 2 2 reach scale preferential surface and groundwater connectivity experiments reach scale ert measurements were performed to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of sw and gw connectivity at the reach scale i e 22 m of channel length to the approximate 4 m streambed depth our original intention was to conduct a constant rate salt addition at the upper reach boundary to electrically distinguish natural hyporheic exchange zones from lateral streambed groundwater flow and upward groundwater discharge zones similar to what has been done by ward et al 2010b however a large natural precipitation event 76 mm rain in 4 h according to nearby bedford hanscom field ma reported by the national center for environmental information ncei of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa started around 4 pm on july 12th 2017 was instead leveraged to more naturally investigate event driven hyporheic exchange and groundwater discharge the rain event could be harnessed for a natural ert tracer experiment because the rain water was over an order of magnitude less conductive than the pre storm stream water so there was abundant ec contrast to image the coupled sw and gw exchange processes reach scale ert data were collected along the channel by a super sting 8 resistivity meter using a dipole dipole array across 22 m of the stream and the data are presented as electrical conductivity bulk ec the inverse of bulk resistivity for the sake of consistency with the ddpa experiments the rainfall event occurred on july 12 2017 approximately 16 00 19 30 fig s2 and provided a fortuitous opportunity to observe a natural perturbation of stream fluid ec and stage which were both tracked over time using a solinst datalogger solinst on canada installed 11 5 m upstream of ddpa us attached to rebar in a large pool fig 1c the bulk ec measurements were collected twice before the storm starting from july 11 2017 and multiple times after the storm from 2 h after the storm to july 15 2017 summarized in table 1 each reach scale electrical measurement series lasted for approximately 1 h twenty eight electrodes were installed with an electrode spacing of 75 cm and data were collected from the electrode line run down the thalweg fig 1c unlike the ddpa experiments where apparent bulk ec was analyzed using the raw electrical data the reach scale resistivity data were inverted using r2 version 2 7a binley and kemna 2005 to recover two dimensional sections of bulk streambed ec that vary in space and over time the domain of interest for inversion in r2 was 4 m in depth and 22 m in length while boundaries are about 200 m away grid sizes in depth and longitudinal direction were 0 1 m and 0 25 m respectively the data errors are set for each measurement based on the field data less than 8 and the maximum number of allowed iterations was 7 moreover the effect of stream water layer on inversion results was tested and appeared to be negligible on the inversion results the changes in bulk ec with respect to the initial condition before the storm were also created using difference inversion in r2 3 results the results regarding the less mobile porosity dynamics obtained from the cm scale measurements are provided in section 3 1 and the storm event driven hyporheic exchange and groundwater discharge dynamics characterized with reach scale ert measurements is described in section 3 2 3 1 characterization of centimeter scale less mobile porosity fluid and bulk ec data from both ddpas at 3 m d downward fluid fluxes are presented as btcs in fig 4 btcs for all downward fluxes are shown in fig s3 in all cases after initially changing together the bulk ec lags behind fluid ec indicating the presence of less mobile porosity with delayed loading of solute tracer fluid and bulk ec reach a plateau before the start of the flush phase in all cases however in some cases a plateau is not reached in flush phases due to experimental limitations in the field e g poor weather that forced early termination of the experiments such as fig 4d the time to reach plateau varies between different fluxes and locations for instance at 3 m d flux ds 20 fig 4b reaches plateau after 7 h while it takes 12 h for us 20 fig 4d to reach plateau at the same flux in most cases the rising limb injection is complete and smooth however in some cases such as us 10 for a flux of 3 m d fig 4c the rising limb cannot be used for calculations given that fluid ec measurements were affected by a temporary device malfunction therefore only the falling limb is used for the calculations in these cases hysteresis loops are formed as a result of the lag between fluid and bulk ec hysteresis loops for 3 m d experiment are shown in fig 5 and the results for all experiments are shown in fig s4 the difference between the shapes of hysteresis loops at different locations depths and fluxes fig s4 indicate spatial variability and flux dependence of parameters controlling mobile less mobile exchange using the graphical evaluation method of briggs et al 2014 less mobile porosity can be calculated using β obtained from eq 1 and the measured total porosity of the ddpa sediments the less mobile porosity values extracted from ec hysteresis loops are presented in table 2 in all cases the less mobile porosity for 0 8 m d flux is smaller than the higher fluxes 2 and 3 m d sometimes this difference is more appreciable as in the case of us 20 where less mobile porosity increases approximately 40 from low to high downward flux the differences between 2 m d and 3 m d fluxes are not substantial except for us 20 the fits used for calculating α and less mobile residence time for 3 m d downward flux are shown in fig 6 fits used for all experiments are shown in fig s5 in all cases α increases with increase in flux indicating faster exchange between the dual porosity domains which causes the less mobile residence time to decrease as flux increases even though the volume of less mobile porosity increases in all experiments table 2 fig 7 a more notable change of less mobile porosity as a result of increase in flux for us 20 fig 7a as well as the distinct increase in residence time for us 20 compared to other locations fig 7c is noteworthy 3 2 reach scale preferential surface water and groundwater connectivity experiments as a result of the rain precipitation event and storm runoff event the water level increased by approximately 0 5 m in a pool at the head of the reach peaking on july 12 at 7 45 pm the fluid ec of stream water ranged between 145 and 1200 μs cm over the storm event and was at a minimum on july 12 at 10 00 pm as a result of more resistive rain water from the storm fig 8 a reach scale ert measurements were made two times leading up to the storm event and representative data inversions from before and after the storm are shown in fig s6 the meter scale zonation bulk ec in the background domain 8 h before the storm fig s6 a may indicate zones of varied sediment types and or varying pore water ec at 1 5 m depth due to groundwater discharge and preferential flowpath processes with bulk ec varying between 1 and 10 μs cm as mentioned above upward positive hydraulic head gradients were measured in several places including the locations of ddpas along the reach before the storm indicating upward flow of groundwater when the stream was at low stage a positive shift in bulk ec from before the event to 60 h after the storm fig s6 b is appreciable in the zones of relatively low bulk conductivity the changes of bulk ec over time with respect to the background condition indicate flow dependent hyporheic and groundwater exchanges no significant change in bulk ec was observed between 8 h pre storm and 2 h pre storm fig 8b with the small observed variations corresponding to the fact that stream water ec was also changing during the day by approximately 200 μs cm fig 8a figure panels 8c k show the change of bulk ec over time for the resistivity measurements made following the event compared to the pre storm condition the sensitivity map of the inverted ert measurements shows a strong reduction in sensitivity below approximately 3 m for most time steps fig s7 therefore although inversion results are always plotted to the 4 m depth here the deeper results are likely highly influenced by shallower bulk ec patterns a few hours after the storm most areas experience a reduction in bulk ec compared to the pre storm condition while some discrete zones experience increase in bulk ec fig 8c d these zones of increased conductivity generally correspond with the regions of relatively low background bulk ec fig s6 a as more time passes after the storm the areas that experience an increase in bulk ec compared to the pre storm condition expand albeit the shallow streambed and a few other discrete zones approach a similar bulk ec value or are somewhat less conductive than the pre storm condition fig 8h k we attribute the initial drop in streambed bulk ec throughout much of the domain to stage and velocity driven influx of resistive channel water as influenced by the lower ec rain source water the zones of enhanced conductivity that grow substantially over time likely represent flushing of riparian groundwaters while the late time regions that show similar or reduced conductivity to pre storm values represent ambient low streamflow hyporheic flowpaths no ddpa injections were performed in the day following the storm i e until the stream had returned to base flow so the zones of enhanced conductivity are not related to the effects of the cm scale preferential flow experiments 4 discussion in this section we discuss the flow dependence of swi exchange at the cm scale at the reach scale and then link those results to describe preferential flow 4 1 flow dependence of cm scale swi exchange and implications the time lag between fluid and bulk ec for both ddpas at all depths and experimental fluxes indicates the ubiquitous and resilient presence of less mobile porosity caused by heterogeneity in the media at the cm scale fig 4 at the us 20 location for all fluxes both fluid and bulk ec rise more slowly compared to their counterparts at ds 10 ds 20 and us 10 fig s3 j l the difference in the shape of hysteresis loops being narrower for us 20 compared to other comparable measurement sets is also clearly noticeable these observations suggest that the sediment permeability and differential mobile less mobile loading at us 20 is different from the other measurement locations after the tracer tests we excavated the sediment and observed that the sediment around 20 cm in the ddpa us included a thin layer of fine sediment mixed with leaf and organic material fig s8 embedded in more well sorted coarse sand presumed road sand this result exemplifies the sensitivity of this method to layers with different sediment properties at relatively high spatial resolution and indicates that sand from the urban setting may enhance dual porosity dynamics as natural silts and organics are embedded in a high permeability matrix visual inspection of the hysteresis loops reveals that the loops become wider with the increase in flux especially from 0 8 m d to 2 m d indicative of increased less mobile porosity fraction briggs et al 2014 meaning that there are more zones where solute can have longer residence time increasing the flux from 0 8 to 2 m d increases the estimated less mobile porosity but changing the flux from 2 to 3 m d causes minimal change with either no change or a slight increase in the less mobile porosity table 2 this differential response with flux rates indicates a stronger flow dependence of less mobile porosity at lower flows as flux increases the volume of less mobile porosity increases while α strongly decreases and causes a net reduction of less mobile porosity residence time such flow dependence of less mobile porosity dynamics is generally in accordance with the simulation results presented in mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 where they numerically investigated the effect of flow on less mobile exchange parameters in media streambed heterogeneities ranging from low permeability layers to cobble inclusions flow dependence of these less mobile zones would impact a number of processes including the formation and function of embedded anoxic microzones that can drive important redox biogeochemistry for example the anoxic production of n2o a potent greenhouse gas may be maximized at intermediate residence times e g quick et al 2016 so there is likely a sweet spot for n2o emissions in less mobile porosity in regards to hyporheic downwelling rate the organic material that helps form less mobile zones by increasing the heterogeneity in sediment permeability could further enhance reactivity by providing an in situ source of organic carbon and relatively high surface area for microbial colonization sawmill brook was reported by beaulieu et al 2011 as one of several urban streams with exceptionally high n2o production though the specific mechanisms of this strong net incomplete denitrification were not clear our work shows that shallow sediments within this stream may exhibit local residence times upward of approximately 2 5 h potentially generating the necessary conditions for the creation of anoxic microzones yet without the time needed for complete denitrification an intermediate time sweet spot for n2o production as indicated by the flume work of quick et al 2016 coupled with the substantial fraction of less mobile porosity and flow dependence observed at all measurement locations this work indicates less mobile dynamics should be explicitly considered in future work regarding n2o production in the hyporheic zone 4 2 flow dependence of reach scale swi exchange and implications at the reach scale directly following the storm event most areas of the subsurface experience a strong reduction in bulk ec compared to the pre storm condition as shown in fig 8c this widespread reduction in bulk ec likely results from deep penetration of rain dominated storm water into a temporarily expanded hyporheic zone these rapid surface and subsurface exchanges when stage changes quickly is also observed in larger dam regulated rivers where stage changes can be more systematically studied e g mwakanyamale et al 2012 sawyer and cardenas 2009 further these electrically based observations of the hyporheic zone response to the storm flow also support the geochemical characterization of zimmer and lautz 2014 who found preferential and time variable connectivity between sw and gw in response to a large flow event in a similar size headwater stream any cm scale less mobile porosity zones that were previously not included in low stage shallow hyporheic flowpaths might be expected to switch temporally to processing the storm pulse hyporheic exchange before reverting back to groundwater dominated water as the stream stage decreases approximately 4 h after the storm the storm pulse hyporheic zone quickly contracts vertically toward the swi as ambient groundwaters rebound we posit that strong spatially localized increases in streambed conductivity observed over the following 56 h results from precipitation loading of the adjacent hillslope and riparian areas and a subsequent flushing of riparian salts through preferential streambed groundwater discharge zones the hillslopes and riparian zone flush is likely highly conductive given the common use of road salt and sand due to urbanization and typical concentration of salts with the unsaturated zone due to evapotranspiration processes and finally the fact that they can act as a temporary storage of salt in urban streams and behave as its continuous source to the streams in summers cooper et al 2014 ledford et al 2016 flushing of the riparian zone brings more highly conductive water to the subsurface of the stream and increases the bulk ec for the entire subsurface except the shallow zones and those areas that are well connected to the stream through continued hyporheic exchange the subsurface zones being connected to groundwater expand as the downwelling flux decreases fig 8c k the flux driven change in connectivity of most pores from stream to groundwater shows that the zones are not entirely separated and the hyporheic zone preferential flowpaths are flow dependent 4 3 linking the two scales of swi preferential flow both cm scale and reach scale measurements demonstrate how pore connectivity depends on stream flow conditions in cm scale measurements this flow dependence was observed in the change in less mobile exchange parameters while the reach scale measurements show that a storm pulse induced expansion of the hyporheic zone followed by contraction and dominance by groundwater flushing therefore the less mobile functionality for a given localized streambed sediment packet can be expected to switch between processing gw and sw over the course of a storm or season while coupled changes in streambed flow rate will alter local less mobile porosity residence time this research opens a quantitative window into highly complex nested streambed flow and transport dynamics that was not before attainable using previous methodology hyporheic exchange is driven by hydraulic pressure differentials between the swi and the subsurface which is a summation of channel pressures such as flow depth and velocity and upwelling groundwater pressure our reach scale ert measurements show that the spatial patterning of hyporheic exchange and groundwater upwelling is strongly variable in space and time in response to a flashy storm event therefore the biogeochemical functionality of the less mobile porosity we have characterized in the hyporheic zone may shift as well as bedform to reach scale flowpath dynamics change less mobile pores that act as anoxic microzones under a downwelling hyporheic condition will contribute differently to processes such as n2o production than if the same packet of sediments experiences upwelling groundwater and both conditions are possible throughout one storm event as illustrated here reactive modeling that incorporates these multi scale flow dependent processes is challenging but may be necessary to refine predictive models of greenhouse gas production in the hyporheic zone further investigation of quantitative or qualitative linkage between the multi scale measurements with modifications in cm scale measurements can be the target of future studies 5 conclusions preferential flow processes occur in nested form within streambeds due to spatiotemporal heterogeneities in sediment permeability and groundwater and surface water connectivity here quantitative investigation of less mobile porosity dynamics in controlled cm scale experiments were carried out in an urban stream at varied downward fluid flux conditions in two different streambed locations of varied bed permeability this investigation was coupled with electrical analysis of reach scale hyporheic exchange and groundwater discharge dynamics in a 3 day period following a large precipitation flow event the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 flow dependence of localized e g cm scale less mobile porosity dynamics occurs in the stream sediments from low to high vertical water flux rates the volume of less mobile porosity increases and α dramatically increases which results in a net reduction of less mobile porosity residence time 2 localized residence times in the less mobile porosity range up to several hours particularly where fine grained and organic materials were embedded within coarser road sand deposits creating a physical template for the formation of reactive anoxic microzones 3 reach scale ert measurements show short term flushing of the hyporheic zone with stream pulse water to a depth of several meters followed by preferential groundwater discharge of elevated ec riparian water likely altering the biogeochemical functionality of localized zones of less mobile porosity preferential exchange between surface and groundwater is observed at the cm and reach scales and the coupling of these processes nested at these two scales is likely important to quantifying and predicting the spatiotemporal reactive dynamics of stream swis
