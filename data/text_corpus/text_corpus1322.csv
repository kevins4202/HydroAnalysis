6610,data of open water evaporation eow such as evaporation of lake and reservoir have been widely used in hydraulic and hydrological engineering projects and water resources planning and management in agriculture forestry and ecology because of the low cost and maneuverability measuring the evaporation of a pan has been widely regarded as a reliable approach to estimate eow through multiplying an appropriate pan coefficient kp kp is affected by geometry and materials of a pan and complex surrounding environment variables however the relationship between kp and different environment variables is unknown thus this study chose china d20 pan as an example used meteorological observations from 767 stations and introduced the latest penpan model to analyze the sensitivity of kp to different environment variables the results show that the distribution of annual kp had a strong spatial gradient for all the stations annual kp ranged from 0 31 to 0 89 and decreased gradually from southeast to northwest the sensitivity analysis shows that for china as a whole kp was most sensitive to relative humidity followed by air temperature wind speed and sunshine duration for 767 stations in china kp was most sensitive to relative humidity for almost all the stations for stations north of yellow river wind speed and sunshine duration were the next sensitive variables while for stations south of yellow river air temperature was the next sensitive variable the method introduced in this study could benefit estimating and predicting kp under future changing environment keywords open

natural water cycle and a part of water loss from water bodies such as rivers lake and reservoirs fu et al 2004 brutsaert 2005 eow data have been widely required in hydraulic and hydrological engineering projects and water resources planning and management in agriculture forestry ecology and hydrology bruton et al 2000 there are two approaches generally used to obtain eow data one is to estimate eow using observed meteorological variables and the other is to measure it by experiment the first approach can be traced back to 1800s by dalton 1802 and since then numerous methods were proposed to estimate eow e g penman 1948 budiko 1958 sartori 2000 brutsaert 2005 among these methods some physical based methods e g penman model 1948 were widely used in the regions with continuous

types of pans used by different countries and regions generally have different geometry and materials table 1 in wang et al 2018 kp values of these pans can be measured by some local scale experiments for example the observed annual average kp of us class a with diameter 1 21 m russian ggi 3000 with diameter 0 618 m and china d20 pans with diameter 0 2 m for photos see li et al 2016 are around 0 7

eow and epan temperature irradiance vapor pressure deficit and wind speed are crucial physical drivers of eow and epan stephens et al 2018 thus to analyze the impact of complex surrounding environment

impact of environment variables on kp penman and penpan models can be used to carry on a sensitivity analysis in this paper we chose the china d20 pan as an example used meteorological observations from 767 stations in china to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of kp and introduced penman and the latest penpan v3 models to analyze the sensitivity of kp to different environment variables the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 lists the data and methods used for kp calculation and sensitivity analysis section 3 introduces the method evaluation and the spatial

for the period of 1960 2015 were used in this study these data have been provided by the china meteorological administration cma the daily data were calculated to monthly data based on roderick et al 2007 which calculated the monthly means of data only when a minimum of 25 days was available and excluded those months that did not satisfy this condition 2 2 pan coefficient of d20 pans pan coefficient kp is the ratio of open water evaporation eow to epan thus kp for d20 pans can be calculated as 1 k p e ow e pan o b s in eq 1 the penman model penman 1948 is commonly used when enough

u10 ssd and rh are the key physical drivers of kp to analyze the sensitivity of kp to these variables we use the penpan v3 model which can well simulate epan by using all these meteorological variables the penpan v3 model is the latest version of penpan model rotstayn et al 2006 lim et al 2016 which shows good performance in epan simulation of d20 pans wang et al 2018 the calculated

variables and sensitivity indices seta seu10 sessd and serh are the relative changes of kp against the relative changes of each variables we used the above sensitivity indices to represent the sensitivities of kp to ta u10 ssd and rh respectively in the sensitivity analysis all meteorological variables changed from 20 to 20 of their monthly mean values to analyze the sensitivity spatial difference of kp to ta u10 ssd and rh the range of seta seu10 sessd and serh for each station were defined as 5 1 r s e ta m a x s e ta m i n s e ta 5 2 r s e u 10 m a x s e u 10 m i n s e u 10 5 3 r

maximum and minimum functions 3 results 3 1 method evaluation to evaluate the reliability of using penpan v3 model in sensitivity analysis the observed and simulated annual kp of all the stations are compared the observed kp means that in equation 1 and the simulated kp is calculated by penpan v3 simulated epan cal as shown in fig 2 the simulated kp accorded with the observed kp and percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse wang et al 2017 were 0 82 0 88 and 0 05 respectively the good agreement indicates that it was reasonable and reliable to use penpan v3 model in analyzing the sensitivity of kp to different meteorological variables 3 2 spatial and temporal analysis of pan coefficient 3 2 1 spatial distributions of annual and seasonal kp fig 3 shows that the distribution of annual kp had a strong spatial gradient for all the stations annual kp ranged from 0 31 to 0 89 and decreased gradually from southeast to northwest the frequency distribution histogram indicates that annual kp was close to a unimodal distribution and more than half of the values centrally distributed between 0 53 and 0 69 to analyze seasonal kp values of d20 pans a year was divided into spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to the next year february in spring kp decreased from southeast to northwest and ranged from 0 31 to 0 89 kp displayed a double peaks distribution and more than half of the values distributed between 0 47 and 0 71 in summer kp ranged from 0 31 to 0 90 with higher values in the south of yellow river and northeast of china kp was close to a negative skewness distribution and more than half of the values distributed between 0 62 and 0 75 in autumn kp ranged from 0 29 to 0 91 with a similar distribution to summer and more than half of the values distributed between 0 49 and 0 68 in winter kp ranged from 0 29 to 0 91 with higher values in the south of yellow river and northwest of china kp was close to a positive skewness distribution and more than half of the values distributed between 0 43 and 0 63 3 2 2 temporal variations of annual and seasonal kp the temporal variations of average annual and seasonal kp for the whole china were drawn in fig 4 the vertical black line in fig 4 represents the year 2002 that d20 pans were no longer widely used in chinese epan observation networks before 2002 the five time series were calculated from more than 700 stations for each year while after 2002 the time series were calculated from less than 200 stations and the stations were decreased year by year more stations in southern china than northern china remained to observe epan of d20 pans thus the increasing trends of kp after 2002 in fig 4 a were caused by the gradually decreasing observation stations the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods in fig 4 was summer annual autumn spring winter the one standard deviation areas in fig 4 b illustrate that kp values in annual summer and autumn were concentrated and stable and kp was more fluctuant in spring and winter 3 3 sensitivity analysis of pan coefficient 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis of kp for china as a whole fig 5 shows the sensitivity of kp to ta u10 ssd and rh for the whole china i e mean value of all the 767 stations fig 5 shows that maximum or minimum values of seta seu10 sessd and serh were at 20 or 20 changes of each meteorological variables thus equations 5 1 5 4 represent the sensitivity indices ranges with different meteorological variables changing from 20 to 20 according to section 2 3 in the sensitivity analysis changes of these variables δta δu10 δssd and δrh ranged from 20 to 20 of t a u 10 ssd and rh which were 11 64 c 2 30 m s 6 10 h day and 67 00 respectively the x axis in fig 5 represents the change rate of different variables i e from 20 to 20 sensitivity indices seta seu10 sessd and serh were calculated within one standard deviation of mean ta u10 ssd and rh which were from 11 14 to 12 14 c from 2 08 to 2 52 m s from 5 86 to 6 32 h day and from 66 11 to 67 80 respectively these ranges are y axes in fig 5 for each variable different values within one standard deviation did not cause significant changes of sensitivity indices since the values of different years did not have large fluctuations for the whole china for ta as δta changed from 20 to 20 t a seta changed from 6 4 to 5 6 for u10 as δu10 changed from 20 to 20 u 10 seu10 changed from 5 2 to 3 8 for ssd as δssd changed from 20 to 20 ssd sessd changed from 4 6 to 3 7 for rh as δrh changed from 20 to 20 rh serh changed from 15 6 to 25 0 therefore kp was most sensitive to rh followed by ta u10 and ssd 3 3 2 sensitivity spatial difference of kp to meteorological variables fig 6 shows the sensitivity spatial difference of kp to different meteorological variables for ta r seta ranged from 0 1 to 22 5 with higher values in the south of yellow river and northwest of china the frequency distribution histogram indicates that r seta was close to a uniform distribution when r seta 15 and more than half of r seta values distributed between 7 7 and 17 2 for u10 r seu10 ranged from 4 9 to 11 4 with higher values in the north of yellow river the distribution of r seu10 was close to a double peaks distribution and more than half of the values centrally distributed between 7 6 and 9 6 for ssd r sessd ranged from 3 8 to 12 5 with higher values in the north of yellow river the distribution of r sessd was close to a unimodal distribution and more than half of the values centrally distributed between 6 4 and 9 3 for rh r serh ranged from 11 5 to 119 7 with higher values in the south of yellow river and northeast of china the distribution of r serh was close to a double peaks distribution and more than half of the values centrally distributed between 33 and 62 according to the values in fig 6 kp was most sensitive to rh for almost all the stations which is similar to the results for the whole china for stations north of yellow river u10 and ssd were the next sensitive variables while for stations south of yellow river ta was the next sensitive variable 4 discussion according to chapter four in allen et al 1998 kp is affected by pan type pan location and environment as well as meteorological variables e g wind speed relative humidity and temperature thus to use kp in eow estimation such as evaporation from lake and reservoirs the spatial variations of kp need to be investigated fu et al 2004 observed eow and epan at an evaporation experiment station in china 117 00 e 34 53 n and at 38 m above sea level for six years and kp of d20 pans in their experiment ranged from 0 49 to 0 75 chen et al 2005 used penman monteith model and measurements of d20 pans and found that pan coefficient between penman monteith simulated potential evaporation and epan varied from 0 4 to 0 8 across china xu et al 2006 reported that kp of d20 pans varied between 0 51 and 0 94 in the yangtze river basin mcvicar et al 2007 considered the topographic influences and found kp of d20 pans varied from 0 44 to 0 65 in coarse sandy hilly catchments in the yellow river basin liang et al 2011 reported kp of d20 pans ranged from 0 51 to 0 65 in the west songnen plain of china yang et al 2013 used lysimeter observed evaporation and measurements of d20 pans to estimate pan coefficient between lysimeter observed evaporation and epan in qilian mountains and found the pan coefficient in the summertime was around 0 7 the kp ranges reported in previous studies mostly focused on some regions of china and the ranges of kp in their studies were all within the kp range in fig 3 which was from 0 29 to 0 91 for all 767 stations in china for china as a whole kp decreased from southeast to northwest according to chen et al 2005 and penpan v3 calculated epan potential evaporation calculated by penman monteith and epan calculated by penpan v3 were both decreased from southeast to northwest the spatial pattern may be caused by that eow was smaller than epan and the numerical difference would become bigger from southeast to northwest for different regions in china the spatial distribution of kp in fig 3 were consistent with previous researches e g the spatial patterns in the yellow river basin mcvicar et al 2007 and the west songnen plain liang et al 2011 fig 6 in xu et al 2006 illustrated that kp in the upper reaches of yangtze river was less than 0 7 and kp in the middle reaches was greater than 0 7 and this finding was in accord with the distribution of kp in fig 3 the decreasing change patterns of kp from southeast to northwest and the quantity changes in the north and south of the yellow river in chen et al 2005 fig 9 were both consistent with the spatial distribution in fig 3 note that for a same region the specific kp values reported by the above researches would be a little different from the values in this study the difference may be caused by 1 the difference in kp calculations for example reference evaporation calculated by penman monteith was used in some researches chen et al 2005 xu et al 2006 liang et al 2011 while we strictly based on kp definition and used penman model penman 1948 to calculate eow and kp 2 meteorological data and other parameters used in calculation were different kp value of each station can vary with time which indicates that kp is unstable in the temporal distribution based on experiment observations of a specific station fu et al 2004 discovered that kp of d20 pans had the lowest value in april then increased with time and reached maximum value in september for the yangtze river basin xu et al 2006 fig 6 found the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods was about summer annual spring winter autumn for the whole china the relationship reported by chen et al 2005 fig 9 was about summer autumn annual spring winter in this study the temporal analysis for the whole china shows the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods was summer annual autumn spring winter fig 4 and for different regions the relationship could be changed fig 3 though the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods is different and uncertain in space one certainty is that the value of kp in summer was the largest for most stations in china since most area of china is in the north of the tropic of cancer the mean value of air temperature and irradiance would be largest in summer the high air temperature and strong solar irradiance may lead to pan wall absorbing more energy for evaporation in summer which may cause the largest kp value in summer meteorological conditions such as ta u10 ssd and rh determine the value and seasonal fluctuation pattern of kp allen et al 1998 fu et al 2004 mcmahon et al 2013 numerous researches were carried out on analyzing the sensitivity of eow and epan to meteorological conditions while the sensitivity of kp was rarely reported eow and epan were widely reported sensitive to u10 and ta mcvicar et al 2012 yang and yang 2012 li et al 2013 she et al 2017a for kp sensitivity analysis liang et al 2011 found rh decided the distribution of kp according to the consistency of spatial patterns yu et al 2017 reported that u10 was very relevant to kp based on the regression analysis in this study the physical based penman and penpan v3 models were used to calculate the physical processes and mechanisms of meteorological variables on kp the results reveal that kp was most sensitive to rh for almost all the stations for stations in the north of yellow river u10 and ssd were the next sensitive variables while for stations in the south of yellow river ta was the next sensitive variable 5 conclusion this study chose china d20 pan as an example used meteorological observations from 767 stations to analyze the spatial distribution and temporal variation of kp and introduced the state of art penpan v3 model to analyze the sensitivity of kp to different environment variables the method was validated by comparing the observed and simulated kp with the values of pbias nse and rmse being 0 82 0 88 and 0 05 mm month the distribution of annual kp had a strong spatial gradient for all the stations annual kp ranged from 0 29 to 0 91 and decreased gradually from southeast to northwest the annual kp was close to a unimodal distribution and more than half of the values concentrated between 0 53 and 0 69 the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods was summer annual autumn spring winter for china as a whole kp was most sensitive to relative humidity followed by air temperature wind speed and sunshine duration for 767 stations in china kp was most sensitive to relative humidity for almost all the stations for stations north of yellow river wind speed and sunshine duration were the next sensitive variables while for stations south of yellow river air temperature was the next sensitive variable spatial temporal and sensitivity analysis of kp in this study can benefit using epan observations to estimate eow in hydraulic and

variables the penpan v3 model is the latest version of penpan model rotstayn et al 2006 lim et al 2016 which shows good performance in epan simulation of d20 pans wang et al 2018 the calculated monthly pan evaporation epan cal in penpan v3 model follows 3 e pan c a l s s β γ r n p a n λ ρ w β γ s β γ v p d f v p a n where β is the ratio of heat to mass transfer coefficient calculated by a 11 fv pan m s pa is the wind speed function of the pan calculated by a 13 and rn pan w m2 is the net irradiance of the pan calculated by the method in wang et al 2018 to analyze the sensitivity of kp to ta u10 ssd and rh the relative changes of kp against the relative changes of each variables are calculated as follows 4 1 k p e ow t a u 10 ssd rh e pan c a l t a u 10 ssd rh 4 2 s e ta 1 k p t a k p

variables and sensitivity indices seta seu10 sessd and serh are the relative changes of kp against the relative changes of each variables we used the above sensitivity indices to represent the sensitivities of kp to ta u10 ssd and rh respectively in the sensitivity analysis all meteorological variables changed from 20 to 20 of their monthly mean values to analyze the sensitivity spatial difference of kp to ta u10 ssd and rh the range of seta seu10 sessd and serh for each station were defined as 5 1 r s e ta m a x s e ta m i n s e ta 5 2 r s e u 10 m a x s e u 10 m i n s e u 10 5 3 r

maximum and minimum functions 3 results 3 1 method evaluation to evaluate the reliability of using penpan v3 model in sensitivity analysis the observed and simulated annual kp of all the stations are compared the observed kp means that in equation 1 and the simulated kp is calculated by penpan v3 simulated epan cal as shown in fig 2 the simulated kp accorded with the observed kp and percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse wang et al 2017 were 0 82 0 88 and 0 05 respectively the good agreement indicates that it was reasonable and reliable to use penpan v3 model in analyzing the sensitivity of kp to different meteorological variables 3 2 spatial and temporal analysis of pan coefficient 3 2 1 spatial distributions of annual and seasonal kp fig 3 shows that the distribution of annual kp had a strong spatial gradient for all the stations annual kp ranged from 0 31 to 0 89 and decreased gradually from southeast to northwest the frequency distribution histogram indicates that annual kp was close to a unimodal distribution and more than half of the values centrally distributed between 0 53 and 0 69 to analyze seasonal kp values of d20 pans a year was divided into spring march to may summer june to august autumn september to november and winter december to the next year february in spring kp decreased from southeast to northwest and ranged from 0 31 to 0 89 kp displayed a double peaks distribution and more than half of the values distributed between 0 47 and 0 71 in summer kp ranged from 0 31 to 0 90 with higher values in the south of yellow river and northeast of china kp was close to a negative skewness distribution and more than half of the values distributed between 0 62 and 0 75 in autumn kp ranged from 0 29 to 0 91 with a similar distribution to summer and more than half of the values distributed between 0 49 and 0 68 in winter kp ranged from 0 29 to 0 91 with higher values in the south of yellow river and northwest of china kp was close to a positive skewness distribution and more than half of the values distributed between 0 43 and 0 63 3 2 2 temporal variations of annual and seasonal kp the temporal variations of average annual and seasonal kp for the whole china were drawn in fig 4 the vertical black line in fig 4 represents the year 2002 that d20 pans were no longer widely used in chinese epan observation networks before 2002 the five time series were calculated from more than 700 stations for each year while after 2002 the time series were calculated from less than 200 stations and the stations were decreased year by year more stations in southern china than northern china remained to observe epan of d20 pans thus the increasing trends of kp after 2002 in fig 4 a were caused by the gradually decreasing observation stations the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods in fig 4 was summer annual autumn spring winter the one standard deviation areas in fig 4 b illustrate that kp values in annual summer and autumn were concentrated and stable and kp was more fluctuant in spring and winter 3 3 sensitivity analysis of pan coefficient 3 3 1 sensitivity analysis of kp for china as a whole fig 5 shows the sensitivity of kp to ta u10 ssd and rh for the whole china i e mean value of all the 767 stations fig 5 shows that maximum or minimum values of seta seu10 sessd and serh were at 20 or 20 changes of each meteorological variables thus equations 5 1 5 4 represent the sensitivity indices ranges with different meteorological variables changing from 20 to 20 according to section 2 3 in the sensitivity analysis changes of these variables δta δu10 δssd and δrh ranged from 20 to 20 of t a u 10 ssd and rh which were 11 64 c 2 30 m s 6 10 h day and 67 00 respectively the x axis in fig 5 represents the change rate of different variables i e from 20 to 20 sensitivity indices seta seu10 sessd and serh were calculated within one standard deviation of mean ta u10 ssd and rh which were from 11 14 to 12 14 c from 2 08 to 2 52 m s from 5 86 to 6 32 h day and from 66 11 to 67 80 respectively these ranges are y axes in fig 5 for each variable different values within one standard deviation did not cause significant changes of sensitivity indices since the values of different years did not have large fluctuations for the whole china for ta as δta changed from 20 to 20 t a seta changed from 6 4 to 5 6 for u10 as δu10 changed from 20 to 20 u 10 seu10 changed from 5 2 to 3 8 for ssd as δssd changed from 20 to 20 ssd sessd changed from 4 6 to 3 7 for rh as δrh changed from 20 to 20 rh serh changed from 15 6 to 25 0 therefore kp was most sensitive to rh followed by ta u10 and ssd 3 3 2 sensitivity spatial difference of kp to meteorological variables fig 6 shows the sensitivity spatial difference of kp to different meteorological variables for ta r seta ranged from 0 1 to 22 5 with higher values in the south of yellow river and northwest of china the frequency distribution histogram indicates that r seta was close to a uniform distribution when r seta 15 and more than half of r seta values distributed between 7 7 and 17 2 for u10 r seu10 ranged from 4 9 to 11 4 with higher values in the north of yellow river the distribution of r seu10 was close to a double peaks distribution and more than half of the values centrally distributed between 7 6 and 9 6 for ssd r sessd ranged from 3 8 to 12 5 with higher values in the north of yellow river the distribution of r sessd was close to a unimodal distribution and more than half of the values centrally distributed between 6 4 and 9 3 for rh r serh ranged from 11 5 to 119 7 with higher values in the south of yellow river and northeast of china the distribution of r serh was close to a double peaks distribution and more than half of the values centrally distributed between 33 and 62 according to the values in fig 6 kp was most sensitive to rh for almost all the stations which is similar to the results for the whole china for stations north of yellow river u10 and ssd were the next sensitive variables while for stations south of yellow river ta was the next sensitive variable 4 discussion according to chapter four in allen et al 1998 kp is affected by pan type pan location and environment as well as meteorological variables e g wind speed relative humidity and temperature thus to use kp in eow estimation such as evaporation from lake and reservoirs the spatial variations of kp need to be investigated fu et al 2004 observed eow and epan at an evaporation experiment station in china 117 00 e 34 53 n and at 38 m above sea level for six years and kp of d20 pans in their experiment ranged from 0 49 to 0 75 chen et al 2005 used penman monteith model and measurements of d20 pans and found that pan coefficient between penman monteith simulated potential evaporation and epan varied from 0 4 to 0 8 across china xu et al 2006 reported that kp of d20 pans varied between 0 51 and 0 94 in the yangtze river basin mcvicar et al 2007 considered the topographic influences and found kp of d20 pans varied from 0 44 to 0 65 in coarse sandy hilly catchments in the yellow river basin liang et al 2011 reported kp of d20 pans ranged from 0 51 to 0 65 in the west songnen plain of china yang et al 2013 used lysimeter observed evaporation and measurements of d20 pans to estimate pan coefficient between lysimeter observed evaporation and epan in qilian mountains and found the pan coefficient in the summertime was around 0 7 the kp ranges reported in previous studies mostly focused on some regions of china and the ranges of kp in their studies were all within the kp range in fig 3 which was from 0 29 to 0 91 for all 767 stations in china for china as a whole kp decreased from southeast to northwest according to chen et al 2005 and penpan v3 calculated epan potential evaporation calculated by penman monteith and epan calculated by penpan v3 were both decreased from southeast to northwest the spatial pattern may be caused by that eow was smaller than epan and the numerical difference would become bigger from southeast to northwest for different regions in china the spatial distribution of kp in fig 3 were consistent with previous researches e g the spatial patterns in the yellow river basin mcvicar et al 2007 and the west songnen plain liang et al 2011 fig 6 in xu et al 2006 illustrated that kp in the upper reaches of yangtze river was less than 0 7 and kp in the middle reaches was greater than 0 7 and this finding was in accord with the distribution of kp in fig 3 the decreasing change patterns of kp from southeast to northwest and the quantity changes in the north and south of the yellow river in chen et al 2005 fig 9 were both consistent with the spatial distribution in fig 3 note that for a same region the specific kp values reported by the above researches would be a little different from the values in this study the difference may be caused by 1 the difference in kp calculations for example reference evaporation calculated by penman monteith was used in some researches chen et al 2005 xu et al 2006 liang et al 2011 while we strictly based on kp definition and used penman model penman 1948 to calculate eow and kp 2 meteorological data and other parameters used in calculation were different kp value of each station can vary with time which indicates that kp is unstable in the temporal distribution based on experiment observations of a specific station fu et al 2004 discovered that kp of d20 pans had the lowest value in april then increased with time and reached maximum value in september for the yangtze river basin xu et al 2006 fig 6 found the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods was about summer annual spring winter autumn for the whole china the relationship reported by chen et al 2005 fig 9 was about summer autumn annual spring winter in this study the temporal analysis for the whole china shows the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods was summer annual autumn spring winter fig 4 and for different regions the relationship could be changed fig 3 though the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods is different and uncertain in space one certainty is that the value of kp in summer was the largest for most stations in china since most area of china is in the north of the tropic of cancer the mean value of air temperature and irradiance would be largest in summer the high air temperature and strong solar irradiance may lead to pan wall absorbing more energy for evaporation in summer which may cause the largest kp value in summer meteorological conditions such as ta u10 ssd and rh determine the value and seasonal fluctuation pattern of kp allen et al 1998 fu et al 2004 mcmahon et al 2013 numerous researches were carried out on analyzing the sensitivity of eow and epan to meteorological conditions while the sensitivity of kp was rarely reported eow and epan were widely reported sensitive to u10 and ta mcvicar et al 2012 yang and yang 2012 li et al 2013 she et al 2017a for kp sensitivity analysis liang et al 2011 found rh decided the distribution of kp according to the consistency of spatial patterns yu et al 2017 reported that u10 was very relevant to kp based on the regression analysis in this study the physical based penman and penpan v3 models were used to calculate the physical processes and mechanisms of meteorological variables on kp the results reveal that kp was most sensitive to rh for almost all the stations for stations in the north of yellow river u10 and ssd were the next sensitive variables while for stations in the south of yellow river ta was the next sensitive variable 5 conclusion this study chose china d20 pan as an example used meteorological observations from 767 stations to analyze the spatial distribution and temporal variation of kp and introduced the state of art penpan v3 model to analyze the sensitivity of kp to different environment variables the method was validated by comparing the observed and simulated kp with the values of pbias nse and rmse being 0 82 0 88 and 0 05 mm month the distribution of annual kp had a strong spatial gradient for all the stations annual kp ranged from 0 29 to 0 91 and decreased gradually from southeast to northwest the annual kp was close to a unimodal distribution and more than half of the values concentrated between 0 53 and 0 69 the quantitative relationship of kp for different time periods was summer annual autumn spring winter for china as a whole kp was most sensitive to relative humidity followed by air temperature wind speed and sunshine duration for 767 stations in china kp was most sensitive to relative humidity for almost all the stations for stations north of yellow river wind speed and sunshine duration were the next sensitive variables while for stations south of yellow river air temperature was the next sensitive variable spatial temporal and sensitivity analysis of kp in this study can benefit using epan observations to estimate eow in hydraulic and

6611,proven in situ treatment and remediation approaches are limited for low permeability aquifers materials particularly because of limitations to the delivery of reactive chemicals or access to contaminated plumes in this paper we describe the development of a cutting edge solution for the remediation of contaminated groundwater in a low permeability and low water bearing aquifer contaminated with the chlorinated hydrocarbon trichloroethylene tce the remediation technique introduced coupling of large diameter permeable reactive barrier wells prb wells with 1 extraction wells through in a highly impacted plume and 2 re injection wells at the fringe of the plume a pump and treat system pts was employed at the site in a separate plume to reduce the mass of tce near the second source zone this research focuses only on the large diameter prb well system conceptual site model development design considerations implementation and performance evaluation demonstrated how each of these elements were applied in the field approaches for coupling technologies to increase technical and economic feasibility are presented extraction and reinjection wells of treated groundwater at the fringe of the plume promoted a positive hydraulic gradient facilitated groundwater transport through the reactive media and contained the plume detailed geospatial and statistical analysis with over 10 years monitoring data showed that dissolved tce plume delineation shrank and still concentration continues to decline and were projected to meet the demands of remediation compliance regulations in the next few years the results of this study indicate that significant remediation was achieved despite the challenging hydraulic conditions of the aquifer the developed the remediation technology and conclusions indicate the system s usefulness at other sites keywords permeable reactive barriers groundwater remediation trichloroethylene low hydraulic conductivity 1 introduction volatile organic compounds vocs are currently regarded as some of the most widely occurring environmental contaminants due to their widespread production and use as organic solvents and hydrocarbon fuels geller et al 2000 grandel and dahmke 2004 remediation of trichloroethylene tce contamination of groundwater is a priority as it occurs frequently at industrial sites and has been identified as a likely human carcinogen chiu et al 2013 u s epa 2012a there is much interest in sustainable low cost and environmentally benign groundwater remediation techniques for complex aquifer systems selecting the appropriate remediation technology to decontaminate groundwater depends on the chemistry of the contaminants and site specific conditions as well as technology performance cost sustainability of the process operation management of the remediation etc he et al 2006 hyman and dupont 2001 naidu 2013 environmental remediation denotes the process and result of removing or lessening the negative impact of pollution or contaminants from environmental media in the subsurface soil rock or groundwater warner and hadley 2015 remediation of contaminated sites with complex aquifer systems such as those with low to moderate permeability materials fractured rock aquifers and slow groundwater flow velocities require significant improvements on existing conventional in situ remediation approaches the potential for aquifer remediation decreases with increasing complexity of aquifer systems migration behavior economics and presence of sensitive receptor in 1993 the u s epa

fowler and cole 2010 the u s guidance specified that waivers were appropriate for sites where the agency deemed that remediation to drinking water standards is impractical by august 2012 the u s epa

advances in the remediation of groundwater have resulted in impressive innovations and the application of technical and economic solutions at more complex contaminated sites hyman and dupont 2001 leeson et al 2013 naidu 2013 the past 30 years of research have focused heavily on the development of in situ treatment technologies itrc 2011 such as permeable reactive barriers prb the first passive in situ treatment method introduced consisted of permeable reactive barriers prbs using granular zero valent iron zvi which are still considered as state of the art naidu et al 2014 a variety of prb configurations have been employed zero valent iron zvi has been the most common reactive medium for prbs a continued effort to develop new reactive materials resulted in a range of other prb materials for the remediation of organic zeolite activated carbon clays and ferrous minerals etc and inorganic contaminants activated carbon bauxite peat and exchange resin etc has been employed itrc 2011 thangavadivel et al 2013 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 warner et al 1994 the major drawback however is that prbs efficiency depends on the rate and volume of groundwater passing through the reactive media this has two direct impacts firstly the extended duration of the remediation and secondly availability of land for resale or reuse the applicability of conventional prb and pump and treat pts techniques is critically limited by the hydraulic gradient and conductivity of aquifers and are not suitable for sites with limited water bearing and low permeability units or strata in order to design an effective groundwater remediation technology for complex contaminated aquifers there has been recent recognition that a combination of two or more approaches i e incorporating both active and passive systems and in situ and ex situ methods hudak 2018 roehl et al 2005 multiple technologies applied concurrently or sequentially are often referred to as treatment trains and are usually developed to address overall site remediation it is recognized that no single specific remediation technology can be considered as a solution for all contaminated site problems frtr 2007 khan et al 2004 remediation technology implemented at most contaminated sites is not a stand alone or one size fits all remedy it is in fact generally part of a treatment train cases studies on the commonly used pump and treat system pts technologies shows that it rarely restored sites that had contaminated groundwater to background conditions usepa 1989 usepa 1992 one of the most promising remediation technologies is the use of prbs with deep trench filled with reactive material s to intercept and decontaminate plumes in the subsurface in the last decade there has been an extensive activities directed at the development and implementation of prbs thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 in this paper we present an innovative technique that achieves remediation of contaminated groundwater in a low permeability and low water bearing aquifer the technology has been fully demonstrated to field scale application from laboratory scale tests the innovative technology is based on an efficacious green remediation technique coupling passive and active methodologies powered entirely by solar power as an energy source grundfos stainless steel solar operated submersible pump with the level controller and programmable logic controller plc connection with dry run protection and a 750 w panel gf100 fixed solar array with io 101 ac interface backup which allows a generator or 240 volt interface this replicated system is used for the group of nearby recirculation wells the field testing of facilitated permeable reactive barrier wells prb wells remediation was monitored for over 10 years fostering an understanding of how the coupled remediation technique will lead to more effective protocols this specifically refers to the clean up of contaminated sites with complex hydrogeological settings this paper focuses on demonstrating the progress of remediation with long term groundwater monitoring geospatial and statistical data analyses understanding the progress of remediation is very important so that the potential design and implementation of the technology can be applied to other sites a comprehensive overview of the remediation technology development field scale up and remediation progress to date are reported 2 site description the remediation technology was tested at a australian department of defence royal australian airforce raaf base in south australia the site was contaminated with chlorinated solvents and in particular trichloroethylene tce which originated from a long history of degreasing activities the site was used previously an explosives factory when built in 1940 and included the manufacture of explosives the assembly of components and the filling of various forms of ammunition although the explosives factory was operational for only a short time between 1941 and 1945 the site was subsequently used for other defence operations the tce had spread over an area of around 20 ha and has an average water table depth 20 m below the ground surface with a saturated thickness up to 7 m the high concentration tce source areas throughout the site are documented as two separate source locations during detailed site investigations tce concentrations at these source locations ranged from 400 to 8890 μg l fig 1 tce is the primary contaminant of concern and some of its biodegradation products 1 1 cis 1 2 and trans 1 2 dichloroethylene dce were also detected the site characterization for soil contamination using spilt core driller samples were taken at vertical discrete interval of 50 cm in the unsaturated zone near at the source area the soils samples were below laboratory reporting limits which demonstrated that tce is present only in the dissolved phase subsequently there are no ongoing contributions to sources at the site similarly in the plume area dissolved tce concentrations in groundwater were significantly lower than the solubility limits indicating that tce was not present as a dense non aqueous phase liquid 3 geology and hydrogeological setting the site comprises three aquifers located on the lower adelaide alluvial plain south australian dept of mines and energy 1989 the system can be considered as a continuous multilayered aquifer with the upper aquifer or middle aquifer which is bounded both laterally and at the base by dense thick clayey deposits the upper phreatic aquifer developed in quaternary sediments of mixtures of silt and clay and has a saturated thickness varying up to a maximum of 6 m with low hydraulic conductivity k porosity which is a measure of the water bearing capacity of formation and hydraulic gradient the measured k values are between 4 8 10 7 m s and 5 2 10 9 m s the average of the slug tests in four other wells amounts to 3 7 10 7 m s with a fluctuation range of ½ decimal power the conductivity tests are consistent and lead to rather uniform hydraulic conductivity values that are typical for clays and clayey silts indicating a low to very low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer the average hydraulic gradient prior to remediation activity was approximately 0 001 in the vicinity of the plume the groundwater seepage velocities range from less than 0 1 m day to more than 1 m day the middle aquifer is developed in sandy clay eluvium of massive granite it is separated from the upper aquifer by a 1 0 4 0 m thick high plasticity dense clay layer the thickness of the saturated confined middle aquifer is 5 7 m recharge is due in part to subsurface contributions from the surrounding catchment and in part to direct local infiltration of precipitation from the surface most of the land is currently covered with grass paddocks and large eucalyptus trees and only a few large buildings are present fig 1 the land use at the site has a significant influence on the hydraulic conditions and on dispersal of contaminants the eucalyptus trees in the area amount to approximately 20 of the surface the remaining vegetation consists of sparse grassland and paved surfaces including buildings and roads the climate at the site is slightly arid the region has evapotranspiration rates of 400 to 500 mm and the average annual rainfall is 429 mm bureau of meteorology 2018 evapotranspiration at the site is strongly influenced by the eucalyptus trees due to their deep roots extending more than 8 m below the ground surface they are able to access the whole unsaturated zone down to the capillary fringe the contribution of rainfall infiltration to the groundwater hydraulic gradient is lost through evapotranspiration and consequently natural recharge has limited contribution to the overall groundwater table fluctuation splint examinations with the trees at site 9 have shown that the eucalyptus spec ingests the tce contaminants since no contaminants have been detected in the unsaturated zone this indicates that the suction of the roots reaches the groundwater table therefore we conclude that the trees also influence the position of the groundwater table due to their suction of groundwater bearing in mind that there is hardly any inflow of water from the boundaries at site 9 this all season withdrawal of groundwater about 0 8 mm d roberts et al 2001 may influence the local hydraulic situation significantly a comprehensive aquifer testing using slug tests has been done in a number of monitoring wells as part of the prb well design a constant pumping and recovery slug test was conducted from 10 monitoring wells representative of spatial dimensions of the plume and a repeated test to increase the accuracy slug tests were conducted using entirely filtered wells filter screen over the whole aquifer the groundwater piezometric head for the upper aquifer system q1 aquifer on march 2007 shows that around the tce plume and further west there was no or hardly any hydraulic decline with minimal flow velocities fig 1 thereby limiting the pumping rate of from extraction prb wells for the contaminant passing through the reactive material resulting in stagnant plume and affect the overall remediation rate the water table at the site ranges from 12 to 15 m below ground surface the groundwater chemistry data analysis using piper and schoeller berkaloff diagrams for the upper and middle aquifer system indicates that it has ca cl facies with high mineral content the groundwater has brackish to saline with values ranging from 1048 µs cm to 7754 µs cm mean values of 4933 µs cm and standard deviation of 1487 the groundwater field parameter indicated that the conditions were slightly to highly aerobic with high dissolved oxygen do concentrations i e 4 2 1 4 average standard deviation variable oxidation reduction potential orp values ranging from 154 3 mv to 140 mv with a mean value of 88 51 the groundwater chemistry revealed high sulfate concentrations 202 57 mg l high chloride concentrations 1127 413 mg l and low nitrate concentrations 2 5 1 9 mg l 4 environmental contamination site characterization detailed hydrogeological data of the q1 unconfined aquifer fig 2 were investigated the project involved three phases the initial phase involved detailed site characterization dsi necessary for the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical analyses groundwater samples were collected every six months using low flow sampling techniques samples were analyzed for field parameters ysi handheld multiparameter instrument dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential temperature ph and specific conductance geochemical parameters were analysed at the laboratory using thermo fisher dionex integrion ic c n analyzer dissolved iron sulfate nitrate chloride phosphate alkalinity and total organic carbon toc and agilent gc ms 7693 for volatile organic compounds vocs the dsi results showed that the groundwater at the site was contaminated with tce and degradation compounds such as dce were reported in some samples slightly above the laboratory limit of reporting lor of 25 µg l and vinyl chloride vc were below detection at all time the groundwater tce plume distributed with its two source zone indicated in the fig 2 to the south and north zone of the site the vertical contaminant concentrations plume showed that q2 confined aquifer was slightly impacted near source zone the designed remediation system doesn t target the q2 aquifer and few monitoring wells were installed and sampled to evaluate on going impact before and post remediation activity the geological characteristics of the aquifer were defined with particular reference to lithologies and hydrogeological aquifer parameters in total 51 groundwater monitoring wells were monitored for over 10 with bi annual measurements the major ions and water quality parameters were measured using ysi tools and the concentrations of tce and daughter products determined at each monitoring time as recommended by the u s epa 2002 the second phase involved determination of groundwater chemistry and conducting a long term column study for selecting reactive material and prb wells design the third step was the actual construction of two remediation systems on two separate plumes i e large prb wells and source removal using the pump and treat system a traditional pts groundwater remediation system was installed and operated near the source zone in the south portion of the site and the prb wells system were distributed in the northern plume area of the site fig 2 5 column study and pilot test a reactive material was evaluated in a large column study using contaminated groundwater sampled and transported to the laboratory using airtight canisters to avoid volatilization during the column tests the water from well mw 902 from tce contaminated source area 1 was used the column test was conducted for 12 months during which performance data were monitored by measuring tce concentration and daughter products in outflow and in the vertical intervals the prb reactive material was selected for long term in situ remediation its testing and selection have been described forthcoming bekele et al 2018 the reactive material matcare gw used in this research project is developed with enhanced organic matter mixed with rubber chips to enrich the permeability and compressive compaction strength to the overburden soil the material was selected based on batch experiment and column tests and the aims here were to evaluate the effectiveness of the material for sorption and desorption kinetics check its compatibility with the site s geochemistry i e highly saline and aerobic conditions estimate the longevity of prb reactive material were tested in terms of removing tce and determine tce mass reduction in the column test for the source area 6 prb well design and full scale field implementation in groundwater remediation design numerical simulation plays a central role zheng and wang 2002 detailed site investigation and calibrated groundwater fate and transport model simulations feflow 5 1 were set up so that the locations for extraction and re injection of large diameter prb wells could be selected the modeling work for this research study is published by sreenivasulu et al 2014 the objective was to achieve effective and rapid remediation of the entire tce plume with a minimum number of wells considering the pumping rates of the wells were governed by the low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer using the groundwater flow model the positions of the extraction wells were selected so as to increase the groundwater flow velocity through connected cones of depression zones for each extraction well and therefore increase the hydraulic gradient a totals of 14 extraction wells and 14 re injection wells were systematically placed down gradient of the dissolved plume fig 3 using the flow model the re injection wells was located at the fringe of the plume head and acted as the plume containment within the site boundary groundwater model simulation for contaminant plume were implemented to determine the capture zone from particle tracking calculations the treated water passing through the extraction prb wells was then re injected up gradient of the extraction well network the extraction well was pump is equipped with dynamic water level data logger which is connected to an automated plc system in addition the extraction pump is programmed with 2 h pumping per day duration and if the well goes dry the pumping system switched off the rate of extraction pump is also governed by average aquifer recharge rate which is 1 5 l per minute the hydraulic mound resulting from the re injection wells provided an increased groundwater head gradient towards the extraction wells and also provided a hydraulic containment of dissolved plume migration conventional on site pts was installed at the south plume in a shipping container and operated through a network of six large diameter extraction and five re injection wells fig 3 model simulations however revealed that an increase in the hydraulic gradient was only achieved with a large number of extraction and injection wells because even with maximum pumping and injection rates the cones of depression of groundwater elevation of each well covered only a very small zone consequently a method was devised based on the simulation results so that the extraction wells were positioned only a short distance with an average of 20 m apart from each other the cones of depression formed a connected drawdown from the extraction well and mound from the nearby reinjection well enhanced the hydraulic gradient across the plume zone significantly whether the whole contaminant plume was captured by the pumping had to be derived from a particle tracking groundwater simulation model the particle tracking method therefore represents an important control for the correct positioning of prb wells and re injection well system the hydraulic changes through extraction injection of groundwater required a long time to exhibit the intended effect due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer in order to check this the groundwater simulations were considered using transient hydraulic conditions the results show that stable hydraulic conditions are only reached after a duration of about 1 year the extraction and re injection of water in large diameter prb wells were constructed in order to firstly clean up the inner zones of the plume and secondly select the best positioning of the prb wells to ensure they were distributed evenly in the center this has to be considered in the remediation design sreenivasulu et al 2014 the system was fully automated controlled and monitored by a programmed logic control system the primary focus of the research was applying large diameter prb wells coupled with active remediation systems it was implemented at and around source zone 1 fig 3 an active and passive prb wells system comprised of twelve large diameter extraction wells 1 5 m and twelve injection wells 1 2 m diameter were installed to depths of 15 16 m below ground surface bgs the extraction and re injection wells were installed as close as practically possible to locations identified in the groundwater model simulation so as to maximize tce contaminant recovery the method of well construction included drilling using a civil construction piling rig fitted with 1 5 m and 1 2 m augers as illustrated in fig 4 a machine slotted 150 mm diameter upvc riser was placed in the centre of each drilled hole and backfilled with prb reactive material to approximately 2 m above the extraction wells water table and for injection wells backfilling 50 mm aggregate to approximately 2 m above the water table geotextile was placed on the top of the reactive material and aggregate and backfilled with natural soils to 1 m below the soil surface following the completion of the wells electric pumps and associated electrical and plumbing equipment were installed to facilitate the pumping of groundwater through the reactive media a programmable logic controller was installed in a dedicated control panel and its operation was fully automated 7 results and discussion remediation performance was determined by routine sampling and analyses of groundwater from 54 wells inside and outside the remediation area for over a decade following the placement of the prb wells the groundwater geochemistry has shown a change in few monitoring wells in particular increases in the total organic carbon toc do and orp this can be explained by groundwater reducing conditions generate from the biodegradable products 7 1 prb wells coupled with the active system groundwater hydraulics the local hydraulic conditions and groundwater velocity that govern the performance of the prb system for tce removal were enhanced by the extraction and re injection system the limitations of aquifer hydraulic conditions were alleviated thus facilitating the transport of contaminants to the large diameter prb wells fig 5 the dsi report for aquifer testing showed that the average hydraulic conductivity derived from the slug and aquifer pumping tests in four wells was 3 7 10 7 m s the hydraulic conductivity tests showed uniform values typical for clays and clayey silts thereby showing low to very low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer consequently the aquifer can only be treated as a limited water bearing stratum rather than a conventional aquifer the hydraulic gradient increased considerably from the initial condition fig 1 with the groundwater flow as part of the connected flow towards the zone of depression fig 5 the locations and number of proposed extraction and injection wells increased hydraulic containment thereby stopping the existing contamination plume from spreading any further fig 5 with the flow generally towards prb wells the re injection of cleaned groundwater from the pts and prb wells at the fringe of the plume increased the hydraulic gradient in areas of high contaminant concentrations transport of tce to the extraction wells was facilitated as was reducing the spread of tce fig 5 due to the sediments low hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic changes through extraction and injection of groundwater were not revealed quickly the groundwater monitoring results confirmed that an extensive increase in the hydraulic gradient was achieved with the cones of depression forming a connected drawdown which enhanced the hydraulic containment significantly predicted by the modelling 7 2 remediation performance monitoring and evaluation of the prb wells in general tce concentrations in groundwater showed significant declines in the source area over the 10 year monitoring period the baseline tce concentrations within the treatment area ranged from 400 to 8890 μg l fig 2 the average reductions in concentrations of tce at the case study site during the four years when the pts remediation was operating show that the average concentration at the start mar 2009 was 676 µg l the concentrations reported at the date when the pts terminated mar 2013 with the same monitoring wells was 365 µg l hence the approximate reduction was 46 fig 6 it is recommended to combine pts remediation techniques near the source high impact zones such that pts reduce the contaminant loading on the reactive material and improve the longevity of the prb wells in 2010 the monitoring network was expanded from 29 to 54 wells by the installation of additional wells close to the source areas and led to an increase in the mean concentrations of tce obtained in july 2010 the tce geometric mean concentration was adopted to calculate the reduction in concentration in percentage terms and was calculated as the difference between concentrations at start and end points divided by the average concentration at the start as shown in fig 6 the linear regression of the geometric mean concentration with time showed a declining trend the contribution of rainfall infiltration to the groundwater hydraulic gradient has limited contribution to the overall groundwater table fluctuation consequently tce concentration response to rainfall events as temporal variation is minimal as demonstrated in the fig 6 the tce concentrations over time for the groups of groundwater monitoring wells based on their locations relative to the source areas and or to the extraction re injection wells are shown in fig 7 during the monitoring and site characterization period 2006 2008 there were significant fluctuations of tce concentrations in all groundwater wells fig 7 demonstrated that following the commencement of remediation in 2009 performance of the reactive material were monitored comparing tce concentrations of groundwater extracted from prb wells to the concentration from the nearest monitoring well consequently tce remained adsorbed on reactive media at prb the increases in tce concentrations observed at the initial stage of prb well remediation i e at the monitoring wells close to the re injection wells may be due to relatively higher concentrations of tce in groundwater extracted from prb well reactive media afterwards the concentrations dropped as time passed fig 7 the optimal location of the recirculation system improved the hydraulic containment has been achieved in addition this has increased the hydraulic gradient in highly contaminated sectors of aquifers so that despite low hydraulic conductivity significant contaminant transport to the extraction wells occurs the tce concentrations from the monitoring wells situated away from the remediation system external wells showed that the concentrations were maintained thereby reducing the spread of the existing contamination plume figs 6 and 7 the modelling results indicate that in none of the scenarios did the tce plume spread during the remediation since the monitoring dataset is intrinsically heterogeneous considering 6 5 of non detections non normal distribution and temporal trends the mann kendall non parametric statistical test was applied to the groundwater tce concentration trends analysis itrc 2013 proucl 5 1 software was used here us epa 2016 and the results are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the mann kendall non parametric statistical test for all available data reveals an overall decline with 47 24 51 of the wells decreasing 8 4 51 increasing and 37 19 51 no trend were observed four mws 8 did not have enough data for the statistical test n 5 the increasing trend were observed at the groundwater wells located at the end of the plume outer side of the re injection wells due to the mound formed at the reinjection wells treated groundwater results in increasing trend on the outer side of the plume despite the lower concentration this result has further strengthened our confidence in the efficacy of the remediation system generally no significant changes in the geochemistry of groundwater samples were observed before and after installation of prb wells in general the tce concentrations in groundwater showed significant declines in the source area and furthermore the extended plume throughout the monitoring period indicated that the remediation strategy resulted in the clean up of the aquifers complementary statistical analysis was done using the same software us epa 2016 to estimate site representative mean tce groundwater concentrations with an upper confidence level of the 95 percentile ucl 95 and which is comparable to the adopted site screening value of dil tce 500 µg l fig 9 the resulting plot confirms a clear decline in tce groundwater concentrations but the ucl 95 was still above the adopted threshold dil after the last monitoring period oct 2017 projecting the exponential regression curve beyond the monitored period indicates the ucl 95 will achieve the target concentration for site closure dil in the next 6 years these results show that due to the limited hydraulic conditions of the aquifer that site closure can only be achieved by long term remediation even with the maximum pumping and injection rates the well interference covers only a very small area the research project demonstrated the efficiency of the technology and it is possible to draw the following conclusions on the main advantages of this technique it is very efficient to contain the plume and target specific area of remediation without disruption of land use it is applicable at the sites despite the challenging hydraulic condition with lower hydraulic conductivities such as dense clay if used with well calibrated groundwater modelling the technique could be used to remove contaminants from heterogeneous natural deposits the technique could be used is able to treat both organic and inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals nitrates etc if appropriate reactive material is sued good cost effectiveness to treat deep aquifer despite all the advantages this technique has some limitations which are the breakthrough of the reactive material depends on the extent of the plume hence the diameter of the prb well for civil construction the necessity to apply detail site investigation to calibrate groundwater modeling for selection of prb well locations and reinjection wells removal efficiency is significantly reduced if hydrogeochemistry is not suitable for the reactive material as well as the structure of the aquifer with large fracture rocks resulting in channel flow in order to guarantee efficient remediation of the techniques it is important to implement well calibrated groundwater fate and transport modeling and to investigate physicochemical contaminant hydro geochemical interactions the occurrence of reverse electroosmotic flow and the influence of organic substances present in the remediated soil 8 conclusion a large set of hydrogeological data was obtained and analyzed and a review of historical and field test results demonstrated that the hydraulic conditions at the particular study area were characterized principally as a low water bearing aquifer the aquifer had a very low hydraulic conductivity with the groundwater table 15 m below groundwater surface in order to evaluate the prb remediation technique and the impacts of hydraulic containment a column study and a three dimensional calibrated groundwater flow model was established when extraction and re injection wells were only a short distance apart they caused extensive increases in the hydraulic gradient by the formation of connected drawdown the recirculation of treated groundwater at the fringe of the plume in turn supports the plume being contained within the boundary of the property in addition to contributing to increasing the hydraulic gradient towards the prb wells the in situ innovative remediation approach using large diameter prb wells in a coupled active system can be very cost effective to successfully remediate contaminated aquifer with low hydraulic conductivity and low water bearing aquifer system the outcome of this technology were a significant reduction in the concentration of tce the daughter product 1 1 cis 1 2 and trans 1 2 dichloroethylene was monitored and were below the screening values and no increasing trend was measured over six years after the implementation no rebound has been observed and a decline in the contaminant concentration is the documented trend this technology leads to the reduction of the groundwater tce concentration as part of performance evaluation of the reactive material we are acknowledged the need to undertake sampling of reactive material from the prb wells the long term monitoring data obtained as part of performance evaluation and for assessing the longevity of the reactive material indicates continuing reduction of tce concentrations this system is expected to continue operating in the future finally the tce concentrations declined significantly in the source area and the extended plume throughout the monitoring period and indicated that the remediation process did clean up

6611,proven in situ treatment and remediation approaches are limited for low permeability aquifers materials particularly because of limitations to the delivery of reactive chemicals or access to contaminated plumes in this paper we describe the development of a cutting edge solution for the remediation of contaminated groundwater in a low permeability and low water bearing aquifer contaminated with the chlorinated hydrocarbon trichloroethylene tce the remediation technique introduced coupling of large diameter permeable reactive barrier wells prb wells with 1 extraction wells through in a highly impacted plume and 2 re injection wells at the fringe of the plume a pump and treat system pts was employed at the site in a separate plume to reduce the mass of tce near the second source zone this research focuses only on the large diameter prb well system conceptual site model development design considerations implementation and performance evaluation demonstrated how each of these elements were applied in the field approaches for coupling technologies to increase technical and economic feasibility are presented extraction and reinjection wells of treated groundwater at the fringe of the plume promoted a positive hydraulic gradient facilitated groundwater transport through the reactive media and contained the plume detailed geospatial and statistical analysis with over 10 years monitoring data showed that dissolved tce plume delineation shrank and still concentration continues to decline and were projected to meet the demands of remediation

leeson et al 2013 naidu 2013 the past 30 years of research have focused heavily on the development of in situ treatment technologies itrc 2011 such as permeable reactive barriers prb the first passive in situ treatment method introduced consisted of permeable reactive barriers prbs using granular zero valent iron zvi which are still considered as state of the art naidu et al 2014 a variety of prb configurations have been employed zero valent iron zvi has been the most common reactive medium for prbs a continued effort to develop new reactive materials resulted in a range of other prb materials

thangavadivel et al 2013 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 warner et al 1994 the major drawback however is that prbs efficiency depends on the rate and volume of groundwater passing through the reactive media this has two direct impacts firstly the extended duration of the remediation and secondly availability of land for resale or reuse the applicability of conventional prb and pump and treat pts techniques is critically limited by the hydraulic gradient and conductivity of aquifers and are not suitable for sites with limited water bearing and low permeability units or strata in order to design an effective groundwater remediation technology for complex contaminated aquifers there has been recent recognition that a combination of two or more approaches i e incorporating both active and passive systems and in situ and ex situ methods hudak 2018 roehl et al 2005 multiple technologies applied concurrently or sequentially are often referred to as treatment trains and are usually developed to address overall site remediation it is recognized that no single specific remediation technology can be considered as a solution for all contaminated site problems frtr 2007 khan et al 2004 remediation technology implemented at most contaminated sites is not a stand alone or one size fits all remedy it is in fact generally part of a treatment train cases studies on the commonly used pump and treat system pts technologies shows that it rarely restored sites that had contaminated groundwater to background conditions usepa 1989 usepa 1992 one of the most promising remediation technologies is the use of prbs with deep trench filled with reactive material s to intercept and decontaminate plumes in the subsurface in the last decade there has been an extensive activities directed at the development and implementation of prbs thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 in this paper we present an innovative technique that achieves remediation of contaminated groundwater in a low permeability and low water bearing aquifer the technology has been fully demonstrated to field scale application from laboratory scale tests the innovative technology is based on an efficacious green

replicated system is used for the group of nearby recirculation wells the field testing of facilitated permeable reactive barrier wells prb wells remediation was monitored for over 10 years fostering an understanding of how the coupled remediation technique will lead to more effective protocols this specifically refers to the clean up of contaminated sites with complex hydrogeological settings this paper focuses on demonstrating the progress of remediation with long term groundwater monitoring geospatial and statistical data analyses understanding the progress of remediation is very important so that the potential design and implementation of the technology can be applied to other sites a comprehensive overview of the remediation technology development field scale up and remediation progress to date are reported 2 site description the remediation technology was tested at a australian department of defence royal australian airforce raaf base in south australia the site was contaminated with chlorinated solvents and in particular trichloroethylene tce which originated from a long history of degreasing activities the site was used previously an explosives factory when built in 1940 and included the manufacture of explosives the assembly of components and the filling of various forms of ammunition although the explosives factory was operational for only a short time between 1941 and 1945 the site was subsequently used for other defence operations the tce had spread over an area of around 20 ha and has an average water table depth 20 m below the ground surface with a saturated thickness up to 7 m the high concentration tce source areas throughout the site are documented as two separate source locations during detailed site investigations tce concentrations at these source locations ranged from 400 to 8890 μg l fig 1 tce is the primary contaminant of concern and some of its biodegradation products 1 1 cis 1 2 and trans 1 2 dichloroethylene dce were also detected the site characterization for soil contamination using spilt core driller samples were taken at vertical discrete interval of 50 cm in the unsaturated zone near at the source area the soils samples were below laboratory reporting limits which demonstrated that tce is present only in the dissolved phase subsequently there are no ongoing contributions to sources at the site similarly in the plume area dissolved tce concentrations in groundwater were significantly lower than the solubility limits indicating that tce was not present as a dense non aqueous phase liquid 3 geology and hydrogeological setting the site comprises three aquifers located on the lower adelaide alluvial plain south australian dept of mines and energy 1989 the system can be considered as a continuous multilayered aquifer with the upper aquifer or middle aquifer which is bounded both laterally and at the base by dense thick clayey deposits the upper phreatic aquifer developed in quaternary sediments of mixtures of silt and clay and has a saturated thickness varying up to a maximum of 6 m with low hydraulic conductivity k porosity which is a measure of the water bearing capacity of formation and hydraulic gradient the measured k values are between 4 8 10 7 m s and 5 2 10 9 m s the average of the slug tests in four other wells amounts to 3 7 10 7 m s with a fluctuation range of ½ decimal power the conductivity tests are consistent and lead to rather uniform hydraulic conductivity values that are typical for clays and clayey silts indicating a low to very low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer the average hydraulic gradient prior to remediation activity was approximately 0 001 in the vicinity of the plume the groundwater seepage velocities range from less than 0 1 m day to more than 1 m day the middle aquifer is developed in sandy clay eluvium of massive granite it is separated from the upper aquifer by a 1 0 4 0 m thick high plasticity dense clay layer the thickness of the saturated confined middle aquifer is 5 7 m recharge is due in part to subsurface contributions from the surrounding catchment and in part to direct local infiltration of precipitation from the surface most of the land is currently covered with grass paddocks and large eucalyptus trees and only a few large buildings are present fig 1 the land use at the site has a significant influence on the hydraulic conditions and on dispersal of contaminants the eucalyptus trees in the area amount to approximately 20 of the surface the remaining vegetation consists of sparse grassland and paved surfaces including buildings and roads the climate at the site is slightly arid the region has evapotranspiration rates of 400 to 500 mm and the average annual rainfall is 429 mm bureau of meteorology 2018 evapotranspiration at the site is strongly influenced by the eucalyptus trees due to their deep roots extending more than 8 m below the ground surface they are able to access the whole unsaturated zone down to the capillary fringe the contribution of rainfall infiltration to the groundwater hydraulic gradient is lost through evapotranspiration and consequently natural recharge has limited contribution to the overall groundwater table fluctuation splint examinations with the trees at site 9 have shown that the eucalyptus spec ingests the tce contaminants since no contaminants have been detected in the unsaturated zone this indicates that the suction of the roots reaches the groundwater table therefore we conclude that the trees also influence the position of the groundwater table due to their suction of groundwater bearing in mind that there is hardly any inflow of water from the boundaries at site 9 this all season withdrawal of groundwater about 0 8 mm d roberts et al 2001 may influence the local hydraulic situation significantly a comprehensive aquifer testing using slug tests has been done in a number of monitoring wells as part of the prb well design a constant pumping and recovery slug test was conducted from 10 monitoring wells representative of spatial dimensions of the plume and a repeated test to increase the accuracy slug tests were conducted using entirely filtered wells filter screen over the whole aquifer the groundwater piezometric head for the upper aquifer system q1 aquifer on march 2007 shows that around the tce plume and further west there was no or hardly any hydraulic decline with minimal flow velocities fig 1 thereby limiting the pumping rate of from extraction prb wells for the contaminant passing through the reactive material resulting in stagnant plume and affect the overall remediation rate the water table at the site ranges from 12 to 15 m below ground surface the groundwater chemistry data analysis using piper and schoeller berkaloff diagrams for the upper and middle aquifer system indicates that it has ca cl facies with high mineral content the groundwater has brackish to saline with values ranging from 1048 µs cm to 7754 µs cm mean values of 4933 µs cm and standard deviation of 1487 the groundwater field parameter indicated that the conditions were slightly to highly aerobic with high dissolved oxygen do concentrations i e 4 2 1 4 average standard deviation variable oxidation reduction potential orp values ranging from 154 3 mv to 140 mv with a mean value of 88 51 the groundwater

detailed hydrogeological data of the q1 unconfined aquifer fig 2 were investigated the project involved three phases the initial phase involved detailed site characterization dsi necessary for the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical analyses groundwater samples were collected every six months using low flow sampling techniques samples were analyzed for field parameters ysi handheld multiparameter instrument dissolved oxygen oxidation reduction potential temperature ph and specific conductance geochemical parameters were analysed at the laboratory using thermo fisher dionex integrion ic c n analyzer dissolved iron sulfate nitrate chloride phosphate alkalinity and total organic carbon toc and agilent gc ms 7693 for volatile organic compounds vocs the dsi results showed that the groundwater at the site was contaminated with tce and degradation compounds such as dce were reported in some samples slightly above the laboratory limit of reporting lor of 25 µg l and vinyl chloride vc were below detection at all time the groundwater tce plume distributed with its two source zone indicated in the fig 2 to the south and north zone of the site the vertical contaminant concentrations plume showed that q2 confined aquifer was slightly impacted near source zone the designed remediation system doesn t target the q2 aquifer and few monitoring wells were installed and sampled to evaluate on going impact before and post remediation activity the geological characteristics of the aquifer were defined with particular reference to lithologies and hydrogeological aquifer parameters in total 51 groundwater monitoring wells were monitored for over 10 with bi annual measurements the major ions and water quality parameters were measured using ysi tools and the concentrations of tce and daughter products determined at each monitoring time as recommended by the u s epa 2002 the second phase involved determination of groundwater chemistry and conducting a long term column study for selecting reactive material and prb wells design the third step was the actual construction of two remediation systems on two separate plumes i e large prb wells and source removal using the pump and treat system a traditional pts groundwater remediation system was installed and operated near the source zone in the south portion of the site and the prb wells system were distributed in the northern plume area of the site fig 2 5 column study and pilot test a reactive material was evaluated in a large column study using contaminated groundwater sampled and transported to the laboratory using airtight canisters to avoid volatilization during the column tests the water from well mw 902 from tce contaminated source area 1 was used the column test was conducted for 12 months during which performance data were monitored by measuring tce concentration and daughter products in outflow and in the vertical intervals the prb reactive material was selected for long term in situ remediation its testing and selection have been described forthcoming bekele et al 2018 the reactive material matcare gw used in this research project is developed with enhanced organic matter mixed with rubber chips to enrich the permeability and compressive compaction strength to the overburden soil the material was selected based on batch experiment and column tests and the aims here were to evaluate the effectiveness of the material for sorption and desorption kinetics check its compatibility with the site s geochemistry i e highly saline and aerobic conditions estimate the longevity of prb reactive material were tested in terms of removing tce and determine tce mass reduction in the column test for the source area 6 prb well design and full scale field implementation in groundwater remediation design numerical simulation plays a central role zheng and wang 2002 detailed site investigation and calibrated groundwater fate and transport model simulations feflow 5 1 were set up so that the locations for extraction and re injection of large diameter prb wells could be selected the modeling work for this research study is published by sreenivasulu et al 2014 the objective was to achieve effective and rapid remediation of the entire tce plume with a minimum number of wells considering the pumping rates of the wells were governed by the low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer using the groundwater flow model the positions of the extraction wells were selected so as to increase the groundwater flow velocity through connected cones of depression zones for each extraction well and therefore increase the hydraulic gradient a totals of 14 extraction wells and 14 re injection wells were systematically placed down gradient of the dissolved plume fig 3 using the flow model the re injection wells was located at the fringe of the plume head and acted as the plume containment within the site boundary groundwater model simulation for contaminant plume were implemented to determine the capture zone from particle tracking calculations the treated water passing through the extraction prb wells was then re injected up gradient of the extraction well network the extraction well was pump is equipped with dynamic water level data logger which is connected to an automated plc system in addition the extraction pump is programmed with 2 h pumping per day duration and if the well goes dry the pumping system switched off the rate of extraction pump is also governed by average aquifer recharge rate which is 1 5 l per minute the hydraulic mound resulting from the re injection wells provided an increased groundwater head gradient towards the extraction wells and also provided a hydraulic containment of dissolved plume migration conventional on site pts was installed at the south plume in a shipping container and operated through a network of six large diameter extraction and five re injection wells fig 3 model simulations however revealed that an increase in the hydraulic gradient was only achieved with a large number of extraction and injection wells because even with maximum pumping and injection rates the cones of depression of groundwater elevation of each well covered only a very small zone consequently a method was devised based on the simulation results so that the extraction wells were positioned only a short distance with an average of 20 m apart from each other the cones of depression formed a connected drawdown from the extraction well and mound from the nearby reinjection well enhanced the hydraulic gradient across the plume zone significantly whether the whole contaminant plume was captured by the pumping had to be derived from a particle tracking groundwater simulation model the particle tracking method therefore represents an important control for the correct positioning of prb wells and re injection well system the hydraulic changes through extraction injection of groundwater required a long time to exhibit the intended effect due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer in order to check this the groundwater simulations were considered using transient hydraulic conditions the results show that stable hydraulic conditions are only reached after a duration of about 1 year the extraction and re injection of water in large diameter prb wells were constructed in order to firstly clean up the inner zones of the plume and secondly select the best positioning of the prb wells to ensure they were distributed evenly in the center this has to be considered in the remediation design sreenivasulu et al 2014 the system was fully automated controlled and monitored by a programmed logic control system the primary focus of the research was applying large diameter prb wells coupled with active remediation systems it was implemented at and around source zone 1 fig 3 an active and passive prb wells system comprised of twelve large diameter extraction wells 1 5 m and twelve injection wells 1 2 m diameter were installed to depths of 15 16 m below ground surface bgs the extraction and re injection wells were installed as close as practically possible to locations identified in the groundwater model simulation so as to maximize tce contaminant recovery the method of well construction included drilling using a civil construction piling rig fitted with 1 5 m and 1 2 m augers as illustrated in fig 4 a machine slotted 150 mm diameter upvc riser was placed in the centre of each drilled hole and backfilled with prb reactive material to approximately 2 m above the extraction wells water table and for injection wells backfilling 50 mm aggregate to approximately 2 m above the water table geotextile was placed on the top of the reactive material and aggregate and backfilled with natural soils to 1 m below the soil surface following the completion of the wells electric pumps and associated electrical and plumbing equipment were installed to facilitate the pumping of groundwater through the reactive media a programmable logic controller was installed in a dedicated control panel and its operation was fully automated 7 results and discussion remediation performance was determined by routine sampling and analyses of groundwater from 54 wells inside and outside the remediation area for over a decade following the placement of the prb wells the groundwater geochemistry has shown a change in few monitoring wells in particular increases in the total organic carbon toc do and orp this can be explained by groundwater reducing conditions generate from the biodegradable products 7 1 prb wells coupled with the active system groundwater hydraulics the local hydraulic conditions and groundwater velocity that govern the performance of the prb system for tce removal were enhanced by the extraction and re injection system the limitations of aquifer hydraulic conditions were alleviated thus facilitating the transport of contaminants to the large diameter prb wells fig 5 the dsi report for aquifer testing showed that the average hydraulic conductivity derived from the slug and aquifer pumping tests in four wells was 3 7 10 7 m s the hydraulic conductivity tests showed uniform values typical for clays and clayey silts thereby showing low to very low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer consequently the aquifer can only be treated as a limited water bearing stratum rather than a conventional aquifer the hydraulic gradient increased considerably from the initial condition fig 1 with the groundwater flow as part of the connected flow towards the zone of depression fig 5 the locations and number of proposed extraction and injection wells increased hydraulic containment thereby stopping the existing contamination plume from spreading any further fig 5 with the flow generally towards prb wells the re injection of cleaned groundwater from the pts and prb wells at the fringe of the plume increased the hydraulic gradient in areas of high contaminant concentrations transport of tce to the extraction wells was facilitated as was reducing the spread of tce fig 5 due to the sediments low hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic changes through extraction and injection of groundwater were not revealed quickly the groundwater monitoring results confirmed that an extensive increase in the hydraulic gradient was achieved with the cones of depression forming a connected drawdown which enhanced the hydraulic containment significantly predicted by the modelling 7 2 remediation performance monitoring and evaluation of the prb wells in general tce concentrations in groundwater showed significant declines in the source area over the 10 year monitoring period the baseline tce concentrations within the treatment area ranged from 400 to 8890 μg l fig 2 the average reductions in concentrations of tce at the case study site during the four years when the pts remediation was operating show that the average concentration at the start mar 2009 was 676 µg l the concentrations reported at the date when the pts terminated mar 2013 with the same monitoring wells was 365 µg l hence the approximate reduction was 46 fig 6 it is recommended to combine pts remediation techniques near the source high impact zones such that pts reduce the contaminant loading on the reactive material and improve the longevity of the prb wells in 2010 the monitoring network was expanded from 29 to 54 wells by the installation of additional wells close to the source areas and led to an increase in the mean concentrations of tce obtained in july 2010 the tce geometric mean concentration was adopted to calculate the reduction in concentration in percentage terms and was calculated as the difference between concentrations at start and end points divided by the average concentration at the start as shown in fig 6 the linear regression of the geometric mean concentration with time showed a declining trend the contribution of rainfall infiltration to the groundwater hydraulic gradient has limited contribution to the overall groundwater table fluctuation consequently tce concentration response to rainfall events as temporal variation is minimal as demonstrated in the fig 6 the tce concentrations over time for the groups of groundwater monitoring wells based on their locations relative to the source areas and or to the extraction re injection wells are shown in fig 7 during the monitoring and site characterization period 2006 2008 there were significant fluctuations of tce concentrations in all groundwater wells fig 7 demonstrated that following the commencement of remediation in 2009 performance of the reactive material were monitored comparing tce concentrations of groundwater extracted from prb wells to the concentration from the nearest monitoring well consequently tce remained adsorbed on reactive media at prb the increases in tce concentrations observed at the initial stage of prb well remediation i e at the monitoring wells close to the re injection wells may be due to relatively higher concentrations of tce in groundwater extracted from prb well reactive media afterwards the concentrations dropped as time passed fig 7 the optimal location of the recirculation system improved the hydraulic containment has been achieved in addition this has increased the hydraulic gradient in highly contaminated sectors of aquifers so that despite low hydraulic conductivity significant contaminant transport to the extraction wells occurs the tce concentrations from the monitoring wells situated away from the remediation system external wells showed that the concentrations were maintained thereby reducing the spread of the existing contamination plume figs 6 and 7 the modelling results indicate that in none of the scenarios did the tce plume spread during the remediation since the monitoring dataset is intrinsically heterogeneous considering 6 5 of non detections non normal distribution and temporal trends the mann kendall non parametric statistical test was applied to the groundwater tce concentration trends analysis itrc 2013 proucl 5 1 software was used here us epa 2016 and the results are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the mann kendall non parametric statistical test for all available data reveals an overall decline with 47 24 51 of the wells decreasing 8 4 51 increasing and 37 19 51 no trend were observed four mws 8 did not have enough data for the statistical test n 5 the increasing trend were observed at the groundwater wells located at the end of the plume outer side of the re injection wells due to the mound formed at the reinjection wells treated groundwater results in increasing trend on the outer side of the plume despite the lower concentration this result has further strengthened our confidence in the efficacy of the remediation system generally no significant changes in the geochemistry of groundwater samples were observed before and after installation of prb wells in general the tce concentrations in groundwater showed significant declines in the source area and furthermore the extended plume throughout the monitoring period indicated that the remediation strategy resulted in the clean up of the aquifers complementary statistical analysis was done using the same software us epa 2016 to estimate site representative mean tce groundwater concentrations with an upper confidence level of the 95 percentile ucl 95 and which is comparable to the adopted site screening value of dil tce 500 µg l fig 9 the resulting plot confirms a clear decline in tce groundwater concentrations but the ucl 95 was still above the adopted threshold dil after the last monitoring period oct 2017 projecting the exponential regression curve beyond the monitored period indicates the ucl 95 will achieve the target concentration for site closure dil in the next 6 years these results show that due to the limited hydraulic conditions of the aquifer that site closure can only be achieved by long term remediation even with the maximum pumping and injection rates the well interference covers only a very small area the research project demonstrated the efficiency of the technology and it is possible to draw the following conclusions on the main advantages of this technique it is very efficient to contain the plume and target specific area of remediation without disruption of land use it is applicable at the sites despite the challenging hydraulic condition with lower hydraulic conductivities such as dense clay if used with well calibrated groundwater modelling the technique could be used to remove contaminants from heterogeneous natural deposits the technique could be used is able to treat both organic and inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals nitrates etc if appropriate reactive material is sued good cost effectiveness to treat deep aquifer despite all the advantages this technique has some limitations which are the breakthrough of the reactive material depends on the extent of the plume hence the diameter of the prb well for civil construction the necessity to apply detail site investigation to calibrate groundwater modeling for selection of prb well locations and reinjection wells removal efficiency is significantly reduced if hydrogeochemistry is not suitable for the reactive material as well as the structure of the aquifer with large fracture rocks resulting in channel flow in order to guarantee efficient remediation of the techniques it is important to implement well calibrated groundwater fate and transport modeling and to investigate physicochemical contaminant hydro geochemical interactions the occurrence of reverse electroosmotic flow and the influence of organic substances present in the remediated soil 8 conclusion a large set of hydrogeological data was obtained and analyzed and a review of historical and field test results demonstrated that the hydraulic conditions at the particular study area were characterized principally as a low water bearing aquifer the aquifer had a very low hydraulic conductivity with the groundwater table 15 m below groundwater surface in order to evaluate the prb remediation technique and the impacts of hydraulic containment a column study and a three dimensional calibrated groundwater flow model was established when extraction and re injection wells were only a short distance apart they caused extensive increases in the hydraulic gradient by the formation of connected drawdown the recirculation of treated groundwater at the fringe of the plume in turn supports the plume being contained within the boundary of the property in addition to contributing to increasing the hydraulic gradient towards the prb wells the in situ innovative remediation approach using large diameter prb wells in a coupled active system can be very cost effective to successfully remediate contaminated aquifer with low hydraulic conductivity and low water bearing aquifer system the outcome of this technology were a significant reduction in the concentration of tce the daughter product 1 1 cis 1 2 and trans 1 2 dichloroethylene was monitored and were below the screening values and no increasing trend was measured over six years after the implementation no rebound has been observed and a decline in the contaminant concentration is the documented trend this technology leads to the reduction of the groundwater tce concentration as part of performance evaluation of the reactive material we are acknowledged the need to undertake sampling of reactive material from the prb wells the long term monitoring data obtained as part of performance evaluation and for assessing the longevity of the reactive material indicates continuing reduction of tce concentrations this system is expected to continue operating in the future finally the tce concentrations declined significantly in the source area and the extended plume throughout the monitoring period and indicated that the remediation process did clean up the aquifers to some extent declarations of interest none acknowledgments the authors of this article would like to acknowledge the support of the australian department of defence and the cooperative

6612,the interaction between the different components of the water cycle at ecosystem scale is of great interest in hydroecology stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecule can be used to study these processes quantitatively due to their different physical properties this study aims at quantifying the contribution of local moisture sources to the isotopic signature of water vapor in the specific estuary system of a coastal lagoon here we present a framework of the isotopic composition of the atmospheric water cycle components water vapor and precipitation for the coastal lagoon of venice italy and we discuss the interaction between the atmospheric component and the surface component of the local water cycle i e the atmospheric moisture and the lagoon water the venetian lagoon is an enclosed basin with low freshwater influx resulting in the presence of large horizontal gradients of the isotopic composition of surface water this feature allows to determine the sensitivity of the isotopic signal in near surface atmospheric moisture under a range of humidity conditions we observed that when the lower atmosphere is close to water vapor saturation pressure condition the isotopic composition of water vapor at the ground appears to be in isotopic equilibrium with lagoon surface water in a range of approximately 6 26 km from the sampling point on the other hand under unsaturated conditions we estimated that lagoon evaporation flux accounts on average for 27 to the daily 06 18 local sidereal time total evapotranspiration surface flux this is the first study that discusses the spatio temporal variability of water vapor precipitation and surface water isotopic composition for a coastal lagoon thus including the major components of the local water cycle in an estuarine system with the isotope approach keywords stable isotopes water vapor precipitation surface water lagoon evapotranspiration 1 introduction understanding the movements and paths of water through the different reservoirs of the water cycle is a central topic of hydrology the terrestrial surface and the atmosphere exchange water in both gas and liquid form through evapotranspiration and precipitation processes the isotopic composition of water represents an ideal tool to study these processes because it conserves the integrated history of the phase changes and of the mixing between different reservoirs in this context many studies used hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes ratios in water vapor and precipitation to better understand the transport and the sources of water vapor in marine benetti et al 2014 steen larsen et al 2015a b steen larsen et al 2014 and land ecosystems berkelhammer et al 2013 griffis et al 2016 jasechko et al 2013 yepez et al 2003 the isotopic composition of water vapor was largely used in vegetated land ecosystem studies to better understand the contribution of evapotranspiration flux within the planetary boundary layer pbl lee et al 2006 wei et al 2016 and the relative contribution of evaporation to transpiration on evapotranspiration flux wang et al 2010 yakir and sternberg 2000 the correct quantification of the evapotranspiration fluxes represents a key topic of these studies variations of these fluxes are expected because of the intensification of water cycle related to climate change huntington 2006 then alteration in evapotranspiration could have implications on ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate jung et al 2010 plants transpiration seems to be the main component of water vapor flux over land as highlighted by recent studies good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 however the relative contribution of transpiration to evapotranspiration can be influenced by several factor such as vegetation cover and free water and soil water availability moreover it has been shown that local water vapor sources can significantly affect the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor within the pbl especially if measurements are performed near the ground aemisegger et al 2014 delattre et al 2015 griffis et al 2016 wei et al 2016 an ecosystem with a characteristic isotopic composition of surface waters can be used to investigate the sensitivity of surface water vapor fluxes to nearby water sources coastal lagoons perfectly match the case since they are nearly enclosed systems where freshwater mixes with seawater in a relatively small area moreover the low energy regime of coastal lagoons makes this kind of estuary system feasible for the study of a number of processes operating in coastal water bodies adlam 2014 noting that the isotopic composition of water vapor near the ground is affected by local water sources this study aims at quantifying the lagoon s evaporation flux influence on the isotopic composition of the total surface flux i e the lagoon evaporation flux contribution relative to all evapotranspiration sources in the study area hence this study has two objectives 1 determine the isotopic composition and the sources of the main components of a lagoon s water cycle namely the atmospheric moisture the surface water and precipitation 2 determine how representative are the local water vapor sources on the moisture isotopic signal at ground level this is translated as a length scale and as a contribution of lagoon evaporation flux to the total surface flux under saturated and unsaturated vapor pressure conditions respectively we measured the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor and precipitation in the inland boundary of the venetian lagoon a shallow coastal lagoon in northern italy for one year a complete survey of the lagoon surface water was also performed during the study period to determine the mean isotopic composition of the lagoon its spatial variability and the processes driving this physical quantity variations of the isotopic ratio of water are discussed in this work using the delta notation craig 1961 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where r is isotopic ratio of the sample and of the standard water vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for d h δd and 18o 16o δ18o the secondary order parameter called d excess dansgaard 1964 is used to investigate non equilibrium effects on the isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation 2 d e x c e s s δ d 8 δ 18 o section 3 focuses on the main results regarding the water cycle components investigated in this study their main sources and the main processes affecting their isotopic composition objective 1 in section 4 the significance of local water vapor sources in local atmospheric moisture is discussed considering different relative humidity and wind conditions objective 2 the interaction between the different components of the water cycle at ecosystem scale is a field of study largely explored in hydroecology e g lai et al 2006 yakir and sternberg 2000 however no works are available for coastal lagoons considering precipitation water vapor and surface waters together this is the first study where the isotopic composition of moisture and surface water are investigated for the venetian lagoon therefore this study represents the first attempt of including the major components of the water cycle in an estuarine system paving the way for future studies about the interaction between the moisture in lower troposphere and the surface of transitional waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the venetian lagoon is a shallow coastal lagoon in northern italy connected to the adriatic sea by three main inlets bocche di porto the position of the venetian lagoon in the italian setting and a detailed map of the study area are reported in fig 1 a and b respectively the surface of the lagoon is 550 km2 11 of the surface is permanently covered with water 80 consists of tidal shallows and salt marshes strongly affected by the tide the remaining 9 of the surface is represented by small islands and the city of venice itself water exchange between lagoon and sea was extensively studied in the past cucco and umgiesser 2006 gačić et al 2002 it is estimated that nearly 60 of the lagoon water is replaced by seawater during each tidal cycle masiol et al 2014 on the other hand a small amount of freshwater drains into the lagoon by the twelve major tributaries zuliani et al 2005 estimated that the overall freshwater contribution to the lagoon is about 35 m3 s 1 this freshwater influx is two order of magnitude lower than the water exchange rate through all the three lagoon inlets estimated to be about 104 m3 s 1 following gačić et al 2002 the climate of the venetian lagoon likewise the whole po plain is affected by the influence of the mediterranean sea of the alps and the proximity of the continental europe the po plain conformation the large amount of freshwater and the nearby adriatic sea are the main cause of high relative humidity in this area therefore the po plain and the study area are of the same type köppen climate classification cfa but the air temperature range in the lagoon area is limited by the thermal regulation of the adriatic sea yearly evaporation over the 550 km2 of the lagoon surface is around 860 mm y 1 zirino et al 2014 and mean annual precipitation is estimated to be 831 mm y 1 bloom et al 2004 however mean annual precipitations are characterized by a north south gradient ranging from 700 mm in the southern lagoon area to 1100 mm in the northern lagoon area monai et al 2003 precipitation mostly occurs as rain during the year but sporadic snow and hailstorm events may occur during winter and summer seasons respectively only rain was recorded as precipitation during the study period the predominant wind direction in the study area is nne sea land breeze circulation is a common feature in this area especially in the spring autumn period with winds blowing from se camuffo 1981 in the following pages wind directions are clustered into two groups to distinguish between air parcels arriving at the sampling point from the mainland and from the lagoon from the sampling point perspective winds blowing from the mainland sector ms are characterized by an angle between n200 e and n60 e while winds blowing from the lagoon sector ls are characterized by an angle between n60 e and n200 e 2 2 meteorological data the main meteorological parameters were recorded by two automatic weather stations one is located at the scientific campus of ca foscari university n 45 48 e 12 26 10 m above ground level by laboratorio di fisica tecnica ambientale fistec iuav 2017 and the other one is located in venice by the mareographic network n 45 26 e 12 20 15 m above ground level of centro previsioni e segnalazioni maree cpsm 2017 the positions of the weather stations are reported in fig 1b more precisely air temperature t c relative humidity rh precipitation amount p mm wind speed ws m s 1 and wind direction wd n were measured at scientific campus the same meteorological variables plus sea level atmospheric pressure slp hpa and sea surface temperature sst c were measured in venice relative humidity compared to sea surface temperature rhsst and water vapor mixing ratio q mmol mol 1 were calculated from direct meteorological observations 2 3 lagrangian back trajectories lagrangian back trajectories were used to investigate potential sources that contributed to the observed isotopic composition d excess of water vapor and precipitation at sampling site and main moisture source areas since the residence time of water in the atmosphere is 9 days van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 trajectories were calculated 240 h backward in time with hysplit v4 stein et al 2015 era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 were used as meteorological input of hysplit model downloaded as grib data with 1 1 horizontal resolution and with 6 h temporal resolution analysis step 0 subsequently converted into arl data for water vapor analysis 10 days back trajectories started at 10 different heights within the pbl were calculated during sampling time at hourly step therefore starting height levels within the pbl changed for each water vapor sample between ground and pbl height for precipitation analysis every time a precipitation event was recorded 10 days back trajectories were started at 10 fixed heights to account for low and middle tropospheric circulation starting heights were set to m agl 10 440 900 1400 2000 2500 3100 3800 4400 5200 the spatial pattern of the potential sources was estimated with the concentration weighted trajectory cwt stohl 1996 model following the approach proposed in salamalikis et al 2015 the isotopic composition of water vapor in combination with trajectory residence time gives information about the origin of air masses and their isotopic signature in cwt the isotopic composition of water vapor at each grid point is calculated as follows 3 c ij l 1 l c l τ ijl l 1 l τ ijl where cij is the weighted average isotopic composition of water vapor for grid cell i j at 1 1 resolution cl is the isotopic value of vapor d excess corresponding to the arrival of back trajectory l τij is the number of endpoints in grid cell i j for back trajectory l capital l is the total number of back trajectories following the analogy of the weighted average the error associated to cij is the square root of the weighted variance defined as follows 4 σ ij l 1 l τ ijl c l c i j 2 l 1 l τ ijl grid cells with 10 water vapor analysis and 2 precipitation analysis back trajectory endpoints were discarded and are displayed as a grey area the different minimum endpoint number for water vapor and precipitation is due to the different number of back trajectories calculated for water vapor 5000 and precipitation 1000 analysis moisture source areas were detected along back trajectories with the approach proposed in sodemann et al 2008 this type of lagrangian diagnostic has been successfully used in several recent works which link isotopic composition of both ground level water vapor and precipitation to synoptic scale systems e g aemisegger et al 2014 crawford et al 2013 wang et al 2017 and determine water vapor isotopic composition sensitivity to moisture origin pfahl and wernli 2008 steen larsen et al 2015a b a moisture uptake i e water vapor is added to the air parcel by evaporation or mixing occurred for the air parcel at time ti if a positive variation of the specific humidity was detected during a time step i e between ti and ti 1 6 h and the height of the air parcel was below 1 5 times the pblh the specific humidity threshold used for accounting evaporative input into the air parcel has been discussed in several works for instance in sodemann and zubler 2010 the threshold of 0 2 g kg 1 was used for precipitation analysis over european alps highlighting that mean moisture sources at monthly scale are insensitive to threshold variation with respect to the distance from the alpine domain however the contribution of higher latitude moisture sources decreases with increasing values of the threshold in wang et al 2017 a sensitivity analysis was performed on humidity threshold 0 1 0 4 g kg 1 for central asia precipitation analysis showing that the moisture diagnostic is also valid for arid climate in this work 0 2 g kg 1 was chosen as the specific humidity threshold consistent with previous work focused on european alps weighted uptakes were calculated along back trajectories and integrated onto a 1 1 grid 104 km2 to allow the comparison between specific humidity and precipitation moisture source areas gridded moisture sources are reported as a relative contribution to accounted specific humidity at sampling site the accounted moisture uptakes resulted 70 for water vapor and 62 for precipitation analysis it should be noted that cwt and moisture source analyses are interpolated onto a 1 1 104 km2 an area nearly 20 fold relative to the venetian lagoon area therefore many fine scale features linked to the lagoon are not visible in the model the back trajectory approach is then useful to understand moisture transport and isotopic control on a regional scale rather than at local lagoon scale 2 4 water vapor sampling a cryogenic sampling campaign of water vapor was carried out from late march 2015 to june 2016 at the scientific campus of the ca foscari university located in the venice mainland daytime water vapor samples were collected with cryotraps weekly from march 2015 to september 2015 while daytime and nighttime samples were collected weekly from october 2015 to june 2016 for a total of 161 observations cryotrapping is a well established and cheap technique to collect atmospheric water vapor samples gat et al 2003 helliker et al 2002 uemura et al 2008 the main characteristics of our sampling apparatus are briefly described here the sampling was carried on inside the laboratory of isotope geochemistry at scientific campus external air was pumped 1 l min 1 through a heated copper line to an automated cryotrap sequencer the external inlet was installed facing the lagoon approximately 6 m over the ground traps were submerged in isopropyl alcohol maintained at 77 c with an haake immersion cooler model ek90 approximately 2 4 h were required for the collection of at least 1 ml of liquid water depending on the air moisture content after the sampling traps were securely sealed with parafilm and the frozen samples were allowed to melt for one hour at room temperature thereafter liquid samples were transferred to 2 ml vials and kept at 5 c until analysis that occurred within 72 h isotopic analysis was performed with a picarro cavity ring down spectroscopy crds analyzer model l 1102i and raw data was calibrated against the iaea vsmow slap scale following the procedure described in iaea 2009 isotopic compositions of standard waters for calibrating each run of analysis are reported in table 1 these internal standards were previously measured with conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometry to minimize memory effect between water samples characterized by a high inter vial isotopic difference 8 injections were performed for each sample penna et al 2012 then the mean and the standard deviation of 8 injections were calculated injections that deviated more than one standard deviation from the mean were discarded standard deviation of measurement technique ranges between 0 02 0 3 on average 0 08 for δ18o and between 0 04 1 5 on average 0 5 for δd 2 5 precipitation sampling precipitation was sampled at the scientific campus from april 2015 to june 2016 precipitation samples were collected on monthly and on single event basis with custom samplers designed with an anti evaporation system gröning et al 2012 the single event collector consists in five bottles each one connected to a dedicated peristaltic pump all the peristaltic pumps are connected to a single funnel that samples the rain water during the precipitation event the peristaltic pumps are driven by a microcontroller unit that i detect the occurrence of precipitation with a resistive sensor and ii save the beginning and ending date of the precipitation event this parallel sampling allowed to obtain the integrated isotopic signal of precipitation monthly sampler as well the high frequency features and the variability of the isotopic signal single event sampler for the study area precipitation amount was measured directly by the volume of water collected each event or month 114 single event 92 of detected rain events and 13 monthly precipitation samples were collected and analyzed with crds alike water vapor samples standard water 1 table 1 was included for calibrating enriched precipitation samples 2 6 modeling the water vapor isotopic composition to describe the isotope fractionation during evaporation we used the model developed by craig and gordon 1965 hereafter cg model with the cg model the isotopic composition of the water vapor flux δe is determined as follows 4 δ e α v l δ l h δ a ε ε k 1 h ε k 10 3 where αv l is the equilibrium fractionation factor at a given temperature horita and wesolowski 1994 δl is the isotopic composition of the liquid water subjected to evaporation δa is the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture h is the relative humidity ε is equal to 1 αv l103 and ε k represents the non equilibrium kinetic fractionation factor kinetic fractionation factor depends on the mechanism by which evaporation is driven i e diffusion and turbulence and on relative humidity the general formulation of ε k can be approximated to 5 ε k 1 h θ n 1 d i d where θ represents a weighting term that accounts for the resistance to diffusive flow to the sum of diffusive and turbulent flow n is an aerodynamic parameter that accounts for wind speed di d is the ratio of the diffusivity coefficients of vapor in air for the water molecule labelled with the heavier isotope di and common water d di d can be assumed equals to 0 9727 and 0 9757 for h2 18o h2 16o and hd16o h2 16o in air respectively merlivat 1978 the term 1 di d is often defined as ck gat 2010 opinions diverge on how to best incorporate the role of atmospheric turbulence in the cg model xiao et al 2017 in other words θ and n parameters depend on environmental and climatic settings of the study case for instance kinetic fractionation parameter can be estimated as a function of wind speed for ocean conditions merlivat and jouzel 1979 in this study different values of the product θnck are used since different environmental settings are associated to natural evaporation in the study area e g seawater freshwater and soil water evaporation therefore every time the cg model will be mentioned in the text kinetic fraction values for δ18o and δd will be reported the cg model can be simplified to estimate the atmospheric moisture isotopic composition under the assumption of a global closed water budget merlivat and jouzel 1979 this closure assumption hereafter mj79 assumption can be also applied to local scale studies meaning that all the water vapor in the boundary layer originates from the evaporation flux galewsky et al 2016 results obtained under the mj79 assumption for local studies must be considered carefully because systematic bias can affect the modeled water vapor isotope content jouzel and koster 1996 an important limitation to this approach is that the water vapor isotopic composition within the pbl is not only controlled by surface evaporation but also by atmospheric circulation advection plays a key role in the atmosphere to this effect accounting for horizontal transport of water vapor however when long timescales are considered the concept of an equilibrium pbl become useful to discriminate between moisture introduced by evaporation and moisture removed by mixing with the free atmosphere helliker et al 2004 the pbl can be treated as a 1 d box model with input and output of water vapor only from the top and bottom smoothing out the near surface horizontal advection by the long time period averaging angert et al 2008 wei et al 2016 the keeling plot kp approach combines the isotopic composition of water vapor with concentration measurements and extrapolates the isotopic signature of added vapor flux keeling 1958 the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture within the pbl δa can be estimated with eq 6 yakir and sternberg 2000 6 δ a q fa δ fa δ f 1 q δ f where qfa is the water vapor concentration mmol mol 1 in the free atmosphere δfa is the isotopic composition of water vapor in the free atmosphere q is the concentration of water vapor mmol mol 1 within the pbl and δf represents the isotopic composition of the total surface flux of water vapor since the model of eq 6 needs the isotopic composition and water vapor concentration in the free atmosphere the kp method estimates the δf parameter as the intercept of the regression line in the δ vs 1 q space i e when q δf is a combination of several water vapor sources and the intercept of the kp can be used to quantify the relative contribution of each of these sources to the total surface flux wei et al 2016 yakir and sternberg 2000 in a simple two sources approach e g evaporation and transpiration the relative contribution of source 1 f1 to source 2 can be defined as 7 f 1 δ kp δ 2 δ 1 δ 2 100 where δkp is the intercept of kp e g the isotopic composition of evapotranspiration flux δ 1 is the isotopic composition of source 1 e g transpiration and δ 2 is the isotopic composition of source 2 e g evaporation the kp method is the most popular method for estimating the evapotranspiration flux isotopic composition based on a large literature survey xiao et al 2018 estimated average uncertainties with kp method equal to 5 1 2 7 and 0 8 for evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration isotopic composition respectively these uncertainties lead to an error on transpiration evapotranspiration ratio of 21 in this study to improve the estimation of f1 and its uncertainty mean f1 and f1 max f1 min 2 were calculated using δ18o and δd following yepez et al 2003 kp integrates the contributing fluxes of different ecosystem sources and its spatial resolution depends on measurement height this allows to speculate about the spatial sensitivity of the isotopic signal of moisture sources in the study area at sampling height 2 7 surface waters sampling and modeling a complete survey of the lagoon was performed on 30 march 2016 from 8 00 to 18 00 lst the sampling campaign was carried out during a single semi tidal cycle close to a neap tide period in order to minimize the tide effect on lagoon water these conditions let to take a snapshot of the mean isotopic composition and of the variability of surface water of the lagoon little information is available about the isotopic composition of surface waters considering the whole drainage basin and the lagoon itself some seasonal variability in surface water is expected due to the complexity of the drainage network the pattern of meteoric inputs and the management of the water resources zuliani et al 2005 less than 50 mm of rain were recorded in march 2016 and no precipitation events were recorded in the 20 days before the sampling the 20 sampling positions in the lagoon domain are reported in fig 1 b as crosses lpx the water was sampled on the surface submerging a 100 ml bottle as close as possible to the air water interface and at 0 5 m depth with a pump for each sampling point profiles of salinity and temperature were acquired with an idronaut multiprobe model 316 to have a single value and its uncertainty representative of the isotopic composition and of the salinity of the lagoon water between 0 and 0 5 m mean and δmax δmin 2 of the two samples were calculated for each sampling point between 31 march and 1 april 2016 10 samples from major lagoon tributaries were also collected sampling points for river water were chosen following the measurement sections in zuliani et al 2005 positions of river sampling points are depicted in fig 1b as triangles ilx the river water was collected submerging a bucket in the middle of the river lagoon and river water samples were analyzed with a thermo fisher delta plus advantage mass spectrometer using a co2 h2 h2o equilibration unit online with the mass spectrometer isotopic compositions of internal standard waters are reported in table 1 standard deviations of surface water samples analyses are 0 05 for δ18o and 0 7 for δd to map the isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen over the contiguous surface of the venetian lagoon we used the hybrid method proposed by bowen and wilkinson 2002 the following parameters predictors were accounted for building the regression models of δ18o and δd the distance from sea inlets weighted by mass contribution gačić et al 2002 the distance from rivers weighted by mass contribution zuliani et al 2005 the lagoon bathymetry sarretta et al 2015 the water residence time isamr cnr 2018 the latitude all the possible regression models with the above mentioned predictors were calculated n 61 the model with the lowest akaike information criteria aic was considered to calculate predicted values of the lagoon water west et al 2014 3 results 3 1 the isotopic composition of water in the lagoon hydrosphere a summary of the isotopic composition of water vapor precipitation and surface waters of the study area is given in fig 2 the lmwl was calculated from monthly precipitation data in general d excess 10 for precipitation can be considered a signature of raindrops evaporation during the descent from the cloud base to the ground for venice mean sd d excess is 8 5 monthly samples therefore many precipitation events might have undergone partial evaporation to discriminate the precipitation samples subjected to strong evaporation a threshold of 0 was set for d excess parameter as can be noted in fig 2 water vapor and surface water samples lie on a line with a slope lower than the lmwl not reported in sections 3 2 3 4 the main results of the isotopic composition and the origin processes affecting each component of the local water cycle are presented 3 2 the isotopic composition and the sources of water vapor fig 3 a reports monthly means of water vapor δ18o d excess and air temperature mean values sd of δ18o δd and d excess for the whole study period are 17 4 123 29 17 5 respectively water vapor δ18o varies between 32 2 10 5 and a seasonal trend can be recognized standard errors s e s d n of water vapor isotopic composition at monthly scale are one order of magnitude greater than the precision achieved with the picarro instrument e g se ranges between 0 3 1 4 on average 0 7 for δ18o and between 0 7 11 on average 5 for δd seasonal variations of isotopic composition are in turn greater than monthly standard errors of water vapor composition and can be reasonably attributed to seasonal variations of air temperature which modulates the absolute concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere however the most depleted values were recorded in march 2016 δ18o 32 20 δd 243 60 while the most enriched in april 2016 δ18o 10 50 δd 83 13 delayed by just one month these two extremes are related to processes such as strong entrainment and long range transport of water vapor for march and persistence of high relative humidity conditions for april zannoni et al 2019 depleted water vapor isotopic composition was also observed in march 2015 but the sampling was performed during a single day and cannot be considered representative at monthly scale as expected significant correlation was found between δ18o and mixing ratio and air temperature measured during samples collection rδ18o q rδ18o t 0 6 p values 0 01 similar positive correlation was observed between the monthly average δ18o and air temperature r 0 61 p value 0 05 the seasonal trend observed for δ18o is not evident for d excess which is uncorrelated to air temperature to lagoon water temperature and to water vapor mixing ratio the d excess parameter shows large variability during winter january 2016 max min 23 and spring months april 2015 max min 22 march 2016 max min 16 april 2016 max min 24 and in general shows a significant negative correlation with rhsst r 0 49 p value 0 01 as can be noted in fig 1 c wind circulation in the sampling area is characterized by two modes n30 e and n120 e and wind blowing from mainland is a common feature therefore when air parcels reach the sampling point from mainland under ms wind conditions water vapor isotopic composition should be less related to lagoon evaporative conditions the hypothesis that the isotopic composition of local water vapor can be influenced by the lagoon is supported by the increasing correlation coefficient in absolute value between d excess and rhsst estimated when wind blowing from ms r 0 39 p value 0 01 and from ls r 0 75 p value 0 01 accordingly the cg model and the mj79 assumption were used to describe the isotope fractionation during evaporation from local surface water under ls wind conditions for this calculation mean temperature t sst 19 c and the mean wind speed ws 1 4 m s 1 when wind was blowing from the ls were considered θnck estimated for δ18o and δd are 6 4 and 5 6 comparable to the recent ones used in xiao et al 2017 for describing evaporation occurring over a large lake 2400 km2 for the isotopic composition of the evaporative source δl mean values of surface water were used δ18ol 0 88 δdl 5 8 see section 3 4 the observed linear relationship between d excess and rhsst expected from cg model with mj79 assumption is not comparable with water vapor observations in terms of regression parameters slope observed 0 35 0 04 1 slope modeled 0 46 1 as can be noted in fig 3b to accomplish the closure assumption a steeper line should fit the observations on d excess vs rhsst plane variability of the d excess vs rhsst slope using the cg model under the mj79 assumption can be attributed mostly to wind speed variability sst variability 1 sd 7 c does not contribute to this effect rather than contributing on intercept variability for 4 ws variability is small 1sd 0 7 m s 1 and is translated into a variation of θnck between 6 2 and 6 8 for δ18o when ws variability is considered the modeled slope varies in the range 0 44 1 0 49 1 which not includes the observed slope for oceanic settings the paper of steen larsen et al 2014 suggests that advection and different moisture sources could affect the d excess vs rhsst relationship this effect can be recognized as a relationship between the regression parameters and the wind direction similarly zannoni et al 2019 showed that a daily increase in water vapor d excess is due to advection of marine air in the study area during the spring season this translates in a wind direction dependence of water vapor d excess clearly detectable during the developing of the sea breeze circulation when the sampling point was downwind of the lagoon the discrepancy between water vapor observations and cg mj79 highlights that other processes such as advection are involved in the local water vapor budget and evaporation from lagoon surface water is not the only process that controls water vapor d excess in this area in the best case with wind blowing from ls rhsst explains 55 of d excess variability of sampled water vapor moisture sources were investigated with back trajectories to understand how regional contribution of water vapor and air masses origin could have influenced water vapor d excess in venice fig 4 air parcels for the most part originated in the west accordingly to westerlies similar circulation patterns were obtained selecting back trajectories under ls or ms wind conditions not shown therefore back trajectories origin cannot be directly related to wind direction measured locally about one third of the accounted specific humidity at sampling site is collected by air parcels within a radius of 500 km from venice from fig 4 it can also be noted that large part 50 of accounted moisture has continental origin land water vapor contribution estimated with lagrangian diagnostic is maximum during summer 67 and minimum during winter 32 as expected from increasing land evapotranspiration during hot months the positive correlation between land water vapor contribution and water vapor δ18o at the seasonal scale r 0 88 is consistent with this conclusion on the other hand d excess shows negative correlation r 0 63 with land water vapor contribution contrary to an expected larger contribution of recycled moisture over the continent it should be noted that p values associated with these correlations are high 0 1 p value 0 3 hence the statistical significance of these relationship may be weak however in the framework of seasonal water vapor d excess vs land moisture contribution relationship we can hypnotize that water vapor d excess is mostly affected by transpired water vapor in summer and by soil evaporation in winter the evaporation process has a larger impact on water vapor d excess than transpiration which is assumed to be a non fractionating process with respect to plant water source this hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that water vapor d excess and rhsst correlation is stronger during winter r 0 56 p value 0 01 than in summer r 0 27 p value 0 01 however it cannot be excluded that a certain degree of uncertainty to moisture sources diagnostic can be also attributed to land moisture contribution for warm conditions sodemann et al 2008 cwt was adopted to determine how air masses origin could have affected water vapor isotopic composition measured in venice a difference in the cwt pattern of water vapor d excess a map of δ18o is available in supplementary material s2 can be observed between air parcels with north east and south west origin fig 4 inset the former ones are in general related to depleted water vapor measured at the sampling point and their lower moisture content can be attributed to continental origin as inferable from moisture source distribution the latter ones are related to enriched water vapor and are specifically sourced over the western central mediterranean area there is also an evident gradient in the d excess pattern along the mediterranean sea with higher d excess 20 in the eastern zone consistent with precedent studies gat and carmi 1970 pfahl and wernli 2008 rindsberger et al 1983 3 3 the isotopic composition and the sources of precipitation the isotopic composition of precipitation unlike water vapor does not show a clear seasonal trend as can be seen in fig 5 a the correlation with air temperature measured at ground level during precipitation is low r 0 43 p value 0 01 for δ18o and air temperature of single precipitation events however low correlation between isotopic composition of precipitation and air temperature is a common feature for many coastal sites gat 2010 rozanski et al 1993 a weak but significant negative correlation r 0 27 p value 0 01 was found between δ18o and precipitation amount for single precipitation events no significant correlation was observed between precipitation amount and precipitation isotopic composition at monthly scale therefore the weak correlation identified for single event sampling is probably smoothed at longer time scales for single precipitation events with d excess 0 the correlation between δ18o and precipitation amount increase in absolute value seasonally i e for summer r 0 41 for autumn r 0 46 and for winter r 0 54 p values 0 05 the correlation for the spring season is not significant and about 40 of samples collected between march and may are characterized by negative d excess these results suggest that for the venetian lagoon area the amount effect is weak but visible despite a bias in such analysis could be introduced by the large number of light rain events from a comparison between monthly and single precipitation data it is evident that the monthly and event sampling methods capture the main features of the isotopic composition of precipitation e g the minimum of δ18o in november and in general the higher d excess during cold months the discrepancies between mean precipitation events and monthly data can be related to several reasons the first one is that not all the precipitation events were collected due the limited number of bottles in the automatic sampler from this point of view if such type of sampling will be used in future studies the number of bottles and peristaltic pumps must be considered carefully the second one is that rainwater in both samplers can be subjected to evaporation if not well sealed it is particularly true for warm months and can justify the large discrepancy for monthly precipitation collected during may and june 2016 however the weighted averages for monthly samples 6 9 and 48 for δ18o and δd respectively are comparable with the online isotopes in precipitation calculator bowen 2018 and with previous studies for this area gattacceca et al 2009 longinelli and selmo 2003 moreover lmwl estimated from single events is comparable with lmwl estimated from monthly samples when considering the standard errors of the regression fig 5b hence monthly samples are used in this work to determine the mean isotopic composition of precipitation and lmwl while precipitation events are used to estimate the monthly variability of the isotopic composition sd of precipitation events are 3 and 25 for δ18o and δd respectively for a comparison of precipitation isotopic composition at monthly scale with the two sampling methods see supplementary material s1 following the description of water vapor in section 3 2 the moisture sources areas for precipitation events and a cwt map of d excess are reported in fig 6 moisture sources include a larger area than for the water vapor analysis as expected by including back trajectories started at higher altitudes the continental contribution to precipitation is lower than the one estimated for ground level water vapor 43 but approximately twofold than the one estimated for alpine area during 1995 2002 sodemann and zubler 2010 it becomes also evident the contribution of the north atlantic ocean that is on average 14 but accounts for 36 of moisture sources during winter season combining the moisture uptake patterns of figs 4 and 6 it can be noted that major source areas of moisture include western mediterranean sea adriatic tyrrhenian and ligurian sea part of the po plain and central italy in particular the moisture contributions of ligurian sea and north adriatic sea are comparable on annual basis the cwt pattern of the precipitation d excess captures a slightly different gradient than water vapor d excess measured at ground level as expected by different moisture origin for precipitation and ground level water vapor analysis a possible continental moisture source area that contributes to higher precipitation d excess in venice is located in the eastern europe consistent with other studies e g lykoudis and argiriou 2007 no meaningful information can be extrapolated from the cwt pattern of δ18o of precipitation reported in supplementary material s2 about 21 of the collected precipitation events are characterized by negative d excess which can be considered a signature of partially evaporated raindrops dotsika et al 2010 froehlich et al 2008 stewart 1975 the isotopic composition of these samples is not correlated with air temperature or relative humidity evaporated samples were related to strong unsaturated air column between the cloud base and the ground some vertical profiles of rh estimated from era interim data are reported as a further example to this effect in supplementary material s3 we found a significant negative correlation r 0 72 p value 0 01 between mean rh measured during precipitation events and the distance of evaporated sample from the lmwl calculated along an evaporation line see supplementary material s4 hence rain evaporation and interaction with surface evaporation could play an important role in modifying the isotopic composition of precipitation in the study area isotope equilibrium between rain and vapor is discussed in detail in section 4 1 3 4 the isotopic composition of the venetian lagoon surface waters the isotopic composition of lagoon s surface waters ranges between 4 30 0 39 and 29 2 3 0 for δ18o and δd respectively the mean difference of water collected on the surface and at 0 5 m depth surface deep is 0 3 for δ18o and 1 7 for δd the largest difference observed is for sampling point lp7 where a scarce vertical mixing is plausible 1 79 and 12 32 for δ18o and δd respectively as initial approximation whether lagoon water is the result of mixing between seawater from the inlets gattacceca et al 2009 stenni et al 1995 and freshwater from rivers it is possible to estimate the contribution of both components with a simple two components mass balance for seawater the isotopic composition can be assumed relatively constant during the year however some variability of seawater isotopic composition might be important during the spring season due to freshwater discharge as observed for the gulf of trieste in the north east adriatic sea stenni et al 1995 for freshwater the isotopic composition of rivers draining into the lagoon could also present seasonal variability indeed the drainage basin of the venetian lagoon has undergone to human modification for centuries and freshwater discharge into the lagoon is currently regulated in large part zuliani et al 2005 brenta river il8 and nuovissimo canal il7 show the most depleted isotopic waters due to the alpine origin of water δ18o equals to 8 97 and 9 20 for il8 and il9 respectively their influx into the lagoon is located in the southern sector and their flow rate and composition could be influenced by seasonal rainfalls in the mountain area in the northern sector of the lagoon freshwater is supplied by sile il1 and dese il2 which are short rivers 90 and 52 km respectively characterized by resurgent springs i e with groundwater recharge their discharge into the lagoon is higher than for tributaries in the southern sector and their isotopic composition could be influenced by precipitation occurring over mainland near the lagoon however no precipitation was recorded in the study area during the two weeks before the sampling hence local precipitation contribution on river isotopic signal should be minimum mean isotopic composition of freshwater influx was estimated from the strong linear relationship between delta values and salinity r 0 97 p value 0 01 as the intercept of the regression model i e when salinity 0 psu fig 7 a and b show the relationship and the linear best fit between isotopic composition δ18o and d excess and salinity for the venetian lagoon the calculated isotopic composition of freshwater is fully compatible with measured isotopic composition of tributaries estimated δ18o 9 0 0 4 and δd 60 3 measured δ18o 8 6 0 4 and δd 58 3 accordingly the positions of the lagoon and tributaries water samples on the δ18o δd plane are reported in fig 7 c on average and under neap tide configuration lagoon water within the first 0 5 m mean isotopic composition δ18o 0 88 δd 5 8 is the results of freshwater and seawater mixing in the ratio 1 4 the mass contribution of freshwater to lagoon water is 20 8 0 2 now we focus on the spatial variability of the isotopic composition of surface water because large horizontal gradients for delta values are expected with depleted water near the western side of the lagoon close to freshwater input and enriched water near the eastern side of the lagoon close to sea inlets the regression model with minimum aic 39 9 for δ18o used to predict the isotopic composition of the contiguous surface of the lagoon is given in eq 8 8 δ w β 0 β 1 f w c β 2 bat mean β 3 bat std β 4 rt lag β 5 l a t where fwc is the distance from rivers weighted by mass contribution batmean and batstd are mean and standard deviation of lagoon bathymetry calculated for a square of 0 001 length 0 02 km2 rtlag is water residence time of the same square lat is the latitude a regression model with the same predictors of δ18o was estimated for δd coefficients of the models are reported in table 2 r2 0 75 for both δ18o and δd a geostatistical model was not computed with the residuals of the regression model because spatial autocorrelation resulted very low moran s i index 0 predicted and measured δ18o and d excess of the surface water of the venetian lagoon are reported in fig 8 maps in kmz format are available as supplementary material it is worth noting that an evident horizontal gradient emerges in the northern sector of the lagoon where the air interacts with the surface water for most of the time before reaching the water vapor sampling point another relevant feature that emerges in fig 8 is the large expansion of depleted water in southern and northern lagoon with respect to the central lagoon water this is consistent with the residence time of lagoon water that ranges between 8 days in the central area and 20 days near the southern and northern borders cucco and umgiesser 2006 the key feature of these maps is that freshwater plays a relevant role on the superficial water budget of the venetian lagoon and may lead to a characteristic signature of the water vapor isotopic composition in this area some modern modification of the hydrodynamics of the venetian lagoon e g the mose project could affect the surficial water budget rinaldo et al 2008 since freshwater glides over seawater and evaporation is a surface process the thin depleted layer of surficial water could largely affect the isotopic composition of water vapor near the surface in the future especially if the water column is not well mixed 4 discussion 4 1 isotopic equilibrium between water reservoirs when the air above the water surface is saturated with respect to the water surface temperature rhsst 100 vapor and liquid phases tend to isotope equilibrium and net surface evaporation flux is close to zero as can be noted in fig 3 b in some cases high mean rhsst 85 n 18 was recorded during water vapor sampling since rhsst 85 was observed with n 4 or without n 14 precipitation water vapor should be close to isotopic equilibrium with precipitation or with surface waters in the case of precipitation water vapor and rain quickly tend to isotope equilibrium bonne et al 2014 during a rainfall large amount of liquid water traversing through the local atmosphere interacts with relatively much smaller amount of water vapor deshpande et al 2010 precipitation intensity and raindrops size play a key role in this regard 12 water vapor and precipitation samples were collected simultaneously under rhsst ranging from 68 to 97 allowing a direct comparison between measured isotopic composition of water vapor and estimated composition of water vapor in isotope equilibrium with precipitation during these events the measured δ18o of atmospheric water vapor resulted on average depleted with respect to the δ18o of water vapor estimated from isotope equilibrium with precipitation δ18omeasured δ18o equilibrium 0 8 moreover measured d excess of atmospheric water vapor was on average 7 higher than d excess estimated by rain vapor equilibrium the same d excess offset exists on an annual basis i e considering all the observations water vapor precipitation and using mean air temperature 16 c for equilibrium fractionation factor estimation the observed offset suggest that kinetic effects were involved during precipitation in case of high humidity without precipitation water vapor tends to isotope equilibrium with surface waters however isotopic equilibrium could be difficult to establish because water vapor is quickly advected in the lower troposphere and surface waters are in general characterized by lesser isotopic variability near isotopic equilibrium between seawater and atmospheric water vapor has been observed for instance in the tropics during quiescent weather lawrence et al 2004 for the venetian lagoon case it has been observed that during specific synoptic configuration and persistent high humidity conditions water vapor d excess falls and near isotopic equilibrium between water vapor and lagoon surface water is established zannoni et al 2019 for 2015 2016 when rhsst 85 n 14 mean sd water vapor d excess is 10 6 and a significant difference exists between water vapor d excess measured with wind blowing from ls and from ms 3 2 and 13 5 respectively such low water vapor d excess under ls conditions led to hypothesize that water vapor observations may reflect the isotopic signal of the lagoon surface water this hypothesis was tested calculating the isotopic composition of water in equilibrium with vapor δ18ol using mean sst under ls condition and the result of δ18ol 2 1 was obtained such isotopic composition is comparable with predicted surface water composition near the inland boundary of the lagoon fig 8 in a range of 6 up to 26 km in agreement with the above hypothesis moreover this length is compatible with the mean displacement of an air parcel in the study area i e approximately 20 km considering mean horizontal non turbulent wind speed stohl et al 2002 at 10 m height during ls wind condition it is reasonable to say that this length probably changes as function of the tidal intensity 4 2 the isotopic composition of total surface flux most water vapor samples were collected under unsaturated conditions during which surface evaporation adds moisture to the pbl such conditions seem to be possible to explain as mixing between two main components because of the good determination coefficient for a linear fit between δ values and the inverse of mixing ratio r2 0 49 and 0 48 for δ18o and δd respectively hence the kp was used to investigate the relative contribution of water vapor sources to the total surface flux some adjustments were applied to the water vapor dataset the first adjustment is related to the relative number of diurnal and nocturnal observations only daytime data were considered since the number of diurnal observations is larger than the number of nocturnal observations and because diurnal observations cover the whole timespan 2015 2016 63 of the observations 06 18 lst we did not observe significant variations of kp intercepts when fitting only daytime data or the complete dataset e g intercept for δ18o switches between 12 5 0 5 and 12 6 0 4 for daytime data only and for complete dataset respectively the second adjustment is related to possible outliers observations that are more than three scaled median absolute deviations away from the median were considered outliers rousseeuw and croux 1993 and were removed from the kp calculation 6 of the observations such outliers are probably related to strong entrainment and to circulation systems which might have caused large variability of water vapor isotopic composition in the free atmosphere samples collected in march 2015 n 2 and march 2016 n 3 are representative of such atmospheric conditions a significant difference between kp intercepts under ls n 53 and ms n 43 wind conditions emerges as can be noted for δ18o in fig 9 a this difference allows to distinguish between two main sub components of the total surface flux land evapotranspiration and evaporation from the lagoon surface when wind is blowing from the interior land ms condition the evaporative contribution from the lagoon should be minimum thus it is also possible to speculate on the relative contribution of land transpiration using eq 6 for transpired water vapor it was assumed the simplest possible case with transpired water vapor flux isotopic composition δt land equals to source water isotopic composition under steady state condition gat 1996 harwood et al 1999 on this latter point recent studies conducted with high temporal resolution measurements indicate that δt reaches the steady state from late morning to afternoon xiao et al 2018 for evaporation flux isotopic composition δe land the water source parameter δl in the cg model was considered a combination of mainland soil water reservoir a and mainland surface waters reservoir b e g rivers and lakes data about the isotopic composition of freshwater in the study area is available in literature but no information is available about the isotopic composition of the soil water consequently the assumptions behind the isotopic composition of reservoirs a and b for this study are reservoir a soil water the isotopic fractionation of rainwater due to infiltration in soils depends on soil type infiltration rate and climate evaporation precipitation ratio gat 2010 moreover the isotopic composition of soil water largely changes as a function of depth with seasonal changes linked to the position of the evaporation front xiao et al 2018 on a global average d excess of soil water is 0 12 evaristo et al 2015 hence we simulated the isotopic composition of mean soil water assuming evaporation of precipitation along a soil evaporation line sel and a final d excess of 0 the slope of sel resulted 3 6 following the method of gibson et al 2008 and the mean isotopic composition of soil water resulted δ18o 5 2 and δd 42 δd value is consistent with mean soil water data from mediterranean biomes evaristo et al 2015 for cg model parametrization we considered that kinetic fractionation is larger for dry soil than for saturated soils therefore kinetic fractionation parameters are assumed to vary within the following boundary conditions mathieu and bariac 1996 θnck 28 1 18 7 for dry and saturated soil conditions respectively δ18o θnck 24 9 16 6 for dry and saturated soil conditions respectively δd reservoir b freshwater the dense river network of the po plain includes rivers from alpine and pre alpine regions as well as rivers whose springs are in the middle of the plain on average their isotopic composition ranges between 13 and 7 for δ18o bortolami et al 1973 marchina et al 2015 considering that we estimated δ18o 9 for the freshwater input into the lagoon it seems reasonable to assume the isotopic composition of lagoon s tributaries as indicative of the study area surface waters kinetic fractionation factor for freshwater evaporation were parametrized as follows θnck 14 2 for δ18o and θnck 12 5 for δd jasechko et al 2013 good et al 2015 estimated that the global fraction of evaporation occurring in soils ranges between 45 and 88 with a mean value of 65 using the global mean to weight soil evaporation the contribution of transpiration to the land evapotranspiration flux ranges between 64 8 and 60 6 considering evaporation from dry and saturated soil respectively these values are fully consistent with the recent estimates of terrestrial water fluxes good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 and can be considered at first approximation representative of land water vapor fluxes in the study area when the wind is blowing from the lagoon ls condition the contribution of the water vapor flux from the lagoon should be maximum and land vapor should mix with the lagoon vapor in this case the vapor flux contribution from the lagoon is translated into a shift of the kp intercepts of 1 8 and 14 for δ18o and δd respectively rearranging the terms of eq 6 with the isotopic composition of the water vapor flux from the lagoon surface under ls conditions θnck values estimated for δ18o and δd are 6 4 and 5 6 the percentage contribution of land evapotranspiration is 73 1 thus lagoon evaporation accounts on the total surface flux for about 27 the percentage contributions of the sub components of the total surface flux stacked to 100 are reported in fig 9b when the lagoon evaporation flux contribution is considered in the average daily evapotranspiration flux transpiration represents 44 to 47 of the total surface flux our estimation of transpiration fraction could be subjected to large errors due to the assumptions made for land water reservoirs an important limitation is that no information about the isotopic composition of soil water in the study area is available for instance changing the transpired water vapor isotopic composition from soil water δ18o 5 2 δd 42 to precipitation δ18o 6 9 δd 48 causes an increase of 4 of transpiration contribution secondly we have not considered the percentage of vegetation cover in the study area and it was demonstrated that transpiration evaporation ratio quickly decreases as a function of vegetation cover wang et al 2010 moreover our estimation of transpiration fraction uncertainty is probably too much optimistic when compared to recent studies involving high temporal resolution measurements of atmospheric water vapor isotopic composition xiao et al 2018 finally it should be noted that we have estimated the transpiration fraction only for daytime a more precise estimate of transpiration to evapotranspiration fraction for mainland goes beyond the scope of this study however the relative shift in the kp intercept is unrelated to land transpiration fraction hence the daily vapor flux from the lagoon surface only accounts for approximately one fourth of the total surface flux this result highlights the importance of the land vapor flux in the study area despite the coastal setting and the proximity to such a large transitional water body 5 conclusions stable isotopic composition of the water molecule is a powerful tool to study evapotranspiration and precipitation processes allowing to partition water fluxes between the atmosphere and the terrestrial surface we presented the first study of the atmospheric water cycle and its interaction in the lower pbl of the coastal lagoon of venice italy that includes observations of water vapor precipitation and surface water by answering to the following questions i to what extent the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor is representative of local free water sources and ii how large the impact of the evaporation flux of surface waters is on the isotopic composition of the total surface flux the sources and the processes affecting the isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation were studied at both regional and local scale air parcels with north east and eastern mediterranean origin are associated to higher water vapor d excess in venice good correlation was found between water vapor isotopic composition and the mixing ratio measured locally about 55 of the water vapor d excess variability can be explained by rhsst over the lagoon when sampling site is downwind with respect to the lagoon precipitation does not show a clear seasonality and is characterized by a large variability of its isotopic composition up to 8 for δ18o during a single month compared to ground level water vapor the relationship between air masses origin and precipitation d excess is less clear but in general air parcels with eastern continental origin are associated to higher d excess single precipitation events are characterized by weak correlations between isotopic composition and ground level air temperature and precipitation amount however correlation with precipitation amount becomes not significant at monthly scale isotopic equilibrium between vapor and rain is biased by 7 for d excess on yearly basis d excessvapor d excessrain the same bias was also observed for several synchronous measurements of water vapor and rain hence sub cloud interaction between vapor and rain could be involved for the modification of the isotopic signal of precipitation in the study area a model of the spatial isotopic composition of lagoon water is proposed surface waters of the venetian lagoon are characterized by large isotopic gradients especially in the southern and northern sectors the lagoon s surficial water is composed by freshwater at 21 mass mass and its isotopic composition clearly marks the water vapor isotopic composition under high relative humidity conditions we suggest that near isotopic equilibrium the isotopic signature of water vapor observation at the ground level is representative of the isotopic composition of surficial waters in a range of approximately 6 26 km from the measurement site future studies could investigate how this length is influenced by the tidal intensity under unsaturated conditions the kp method was used to determine the isotopic composition of the daily total surface flux evapotranspiration the local wind direction was used to discriminate between water vapor that interacted mainly with lagoon surface water and water vapor that interacted mainly with inland moisture the estimated fraction of transpired water vapor to evapotranspiration flux for land side observations resulted compatible with recent estimates of average terrestrial water vapor fluxes 64 although the approach used presents some limitations however when the sampling point is downwind with respect to the lagoon a significant positive shift is introduced in the kp intercept this positive shift can be explained as mixing with enriched vapor from the lagoon in relative terms the lagoon evaporation flux accounts on average 27 to the daily 06 18 lst total surface flux hence the isotopic composition of water vapor measured near the ground close to the inland boundary of the lagoon is highly representative of the land vapor counterpart

6612,the interaction between the different components of the water cycle at ecosystem scale is of great interest in hydroecology stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecule can be used to study these processes quantitatively due to their different physical properties this study aims at quantifying the contribution of local moisture sources to the isotopic signature of water vapor in the specific estuary system of a coastal lagoon here we present a framework of the isotopic composition of the atmospheric water cycle components water vapor and precipitation for the coastal lagoon of venice italy and we discuss the interaction between the atmospheric component and the surface component of the local water cycle i e the atmospheric moisture and the lagoon water the venetian lagoon is an enclosed basin with low freshwater influx resulting in the presence of large horizontal gradients of the isotopic composition of surface water this feature allows to determine the sensitivity of the isotopic signal in near surface atmospheric moisture under a range of humidity conditions we observed that when the lower atmosphere is close to water vapor saturation pressure condition the isotopic composition of water vapor at the ground appears to be in isotopic equilibrium with lagoon surface water in a range of approximately 6 26 km from the sampling point on the other hand under unsaturated conditions we estimated that lagoon evaporation flux accounts on average for 27 to the daily 06 18 local sidereal time total evapotranspiration surface flux this is the first study that discusses the spatio temporal variability of water vapor precipitation and surface water isotopic composition for a coastal lagoon thus including the major components of the local water cycle in an estuarine system with the isotope approach keywords stable isotopes water vapor precipitation surface water lagoon evapotranspiration 1 introduction understanding the movements and paths of water through the different reservoirs of the water cycle is a central topic of hydrology the terrestrial surface and the atmosphere exchange water in both gas and liquid form through evapotranspiration and precipitation processes the isotopic composition of water represents an ideal tool to study these processes because it conserves the integrated history of the phase changes and of the mixing between different reservoirs in this context many studies used hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes ratios in water vapor and precipitation to better understand the transport and the sources of water vapor in marine benetti et al 2014 steen larsen et al 2015a b steen larsen et al 2014 and land ecosystems berkelhammer et al 2013 griffis et al 2016 jasechko et al 2013 yepez et al 2003 the isotopic composition of water vapor was largely used in vegetated land ecosystem studies to better understand the contribution of evapotranspiration flux within the planetary boundary layer pbl lee et al 2006 wei et al 2016 and the relative contribution of evaporation to transpiration on evapotranspiration flux wang et al 2010 yakir and sternberg 2000 the correct quantification of the evapotranspiration fluxes represents a key topic of these studies variations of these fluxes are expected because of the intensification of water cycle related to climate change huntington 2006 then alteration in evapotranspiration could have implications on ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate jung et al 2010 plants transpiration seems to be the main component of water vapor flux over land as highlighted by recent studies good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 however the relative contribution of transpiration to evapotranspiration can be influenced by several factor such as vegetation cover and free water and soil water availability moreover it has been shown that local water vapor sources can significantly affect the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor within the pbl especially if measurements are performed near the ground aemisegger et al 2014 delattre et al 2015 griffis et al 2016 wei et al 2016 an ecosystem with a characteristic isotopic composition of surface waters can be used to investigate the sensitivity of surface water vapor fluxes to nearby water sources coastal lagoons perfectly match the case since they are nearly enclosed systems where freshwater mixes with seawater in a relatively small area moreover the low energy regime of coastal lagoons makes this kind of estuary system feasible for the study of a number of processes operating in coastal water bodies adlam 2014 noting that the isotopic composition of water vapor near the ground is affected by local water sources this study aims at quantifying the lagoon s evaporation flux influence on the isotopic composition of the total surface flux i e the lagoon evaporation flux contribution relative to all evapotranspiration sources in the study area hence this study has two objectives 1 determine the isotopic composition and the sources of the main components of a lagoon s water cycle namely the atmospheric moisture the surface water and precipitation 2 determine how representative are the local water vapor sources on the moisture isotopic signal at ground level this is translated as a length scale and as a contribution of lagoon evaporation flux to the total surface flux under saturated and unsaturated vapor pressure conditions respectively we measured the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor and precipitation in the inland boundary of the venetian lagoon a shallow coastal lagoon in northern italy for one year a complete survey of the lagoon surface water was also performed during the study period to determine the mean isotopic composition of the lagoon its spatial variability and the processes driving this physical quantity variations of the isotopic ratio of water are discussed in this work using the delta notation craig 1961 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where r is isotopic ratio of the sample and of the standard water vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for d h δd and 18o 16o δ18o the secondary order parameter called d excess dansgaard 1964 is used to investigate non equilibrium effects on the isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation 2 d e x c e s s δ d 8 δ 18 o section 3 focuses on the main results regarding the water cycle components investigated in this study their main sources and the main processes affecting their isotopic composition objective 1 in section 4 the significance of local water vapor sources in local atmospheric moisture is discussed considering different relative humidity and wind conditions objective 2 the interaction between the different components of the water cycle at ecosystem scale is a field of study largely explored in hydroecology e g lai et al 2006 yakir and sternberg 2000 however no works are available for coastal lagoons considering precipitation water vapor and surface waters together this is the first study where the isotopic composition of moisture and surface water are investigated for the venetian lagoon therefore this study represents the first attempt of including the major components of the water cycle in an estuarine system paving the way for future studies about the interaction between the moisture in lower troposphere and the surface of transitional waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the venetian lagoon is a shallow coastal lagoon in northern italy connected to the adriatic sea by three main inlets bocche di porto the position of the venetian lagoon in the italian setting and a detailed map of the study area are reported in fig 1 a and b respectively the surface of the lagoon is 550 km2 11 of the surface is permanently covered with water 80 consists of tidal shallows and salt marshes strongly affected by the tide the remaining 9 of the surface is represented by small islands and the city of venice itself water exchange between lagoon and sea was extensively studied in the past cucco and umgiesser 2006 gačić et al 2002 it is estimated that nearly 60 of the lagoon water is replaced by seawater during each tidal cycle masiol et al 2014 on the other hand a small amount of freshwater drains into the lagoon by the twelve major tributaries zuliani et al 2005 estimated that the overall freshwater contribution to the lagoon is about 35 m3 s 1 this freshwater influx is two order of magnitude lower than the water exchange rate through all the three lagoon inlets estimated to be about 104 m3 s 1 following gačić et al 2002 the climate of the venetian lagoon likewise the whole po plain is affected by the influence of the mediterranean sea of the alps and the proximity of the continental europe the po plain conformation the large amount of freshwater and the nearby adriatic sea are the main cause of high relative humidity in this area therefore the po plain and the study area are of the same type köppen climate classification cfa but the air temperature range in the lagoon area is limited by the thermal regulation of the adriatic sea yearly evaporation over the 550 km2 of the lagoon surface is around 860 mm y 1 zirino et al 2014 and mean annual precipitation is estimated to be 831 mm y 1 bloom et al 2004 however mean annual precipitations are characterized by a north south gradient ranging from 700 mm in the southern lagoon area to 1100 mm in the northern lagoon area monai et al 2003 precipitation mostly occurs as rain during the year but sporadic snow and hailstorm events may occur during winter and summer seasons respectively only rain was recorded as precipitation during the study period the predominant wind direction in the study area is nne sea land breeze circulation is a common feature in this area especially in the spring autumn period with winds blowing from se camuffo 1981 in the following pages wind directions are clustered into two groups to distinguish between air parcels arriving at the sampling point from the mainland and from the lagoon from the sampling point perspective winds blowing from the mainland sector ms are characterized by an angle between n200 e and n60 e while winds blowing from the lagoon sector ls are characterized by an angle between n60 e and n200 e 2 2 meteorological data the main meteorological parameters were recorded by two automatic weather stations one is located at the scientific campus of ca foscari university n 45 48 e 12 26 10 m above ground level by laboratorio di fisica tecnica ambientale fistec iuav 2017 and the other one is located in venice by the mareographic network n 45 26 e 12 20 15 m above ground level of centro previsioni e segnalazioni maree cpsm 2017 the positions of the weather stations are reported in fig 1b more precisely air temperature t c relative humidity rh precipitation amount p mm wind speed ws m s 1 and wind direction wd n were measured at scientific campus the same meteorological variables plus sea level atmospheric pressure slp hpa and sea surface temperature sst c were measured in venice relative humidity compared to sea surface temperature rhsst and water vapor mixing ratio q mmol mol 1 were calculated from direct meteorological observations 2 3 lagrangian back trajectories lagrangian back trajectories were used to investigate potential sources that contributed to the observed isotopic composition d excess of water vapor and precipitation at sampling site and main moisture source areas since the residence time of water in the atmosphere is 9 days van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 trajectories were calculated 240 h backward in time with hysplit v4 stein et al 2015 era interim reanalysis data dee et al 2011 were used as meteorological input of hysplit model downloaded as grib data with 1 1 horizontal resolution and with 6 h temporal resolution analysis step 0 subsequently converted into arl data for water vapor analysis 10 days back trajectories started at 10 different heights within the pbl were calculated during sampling time at hourly step therefore starting height levels within the pbl changed for each water vapor sample between ground and pbl height for precipitation analysis every time a precipitation event was recorded 10 days back trajectories were started at 10 fixed heights to account for low and middle tropospheric circulation starting heights were set to m agl 10 440 900 1400 2000 2500 3100 3800 4400 5200 the spatial pattern of the potential sources was estimated with the concentration weighted trajectory cwt stohl 1996 model following the approach proposed in salamalikis et al 2015 the isotopic composition of water vapor in combination with trajectory residence time gives information about the origin of air masses and their isotopic signature in cwt the isotopic composition of water vapor at each grid point is calculated as follows 3 c ij l 1 l c l τ ijl l 1 l τ ijl where cij is the weighted average isotopic composition of water vapor for grid cell i j at 1 1 resolution cl is the isotopic value of vapor d excess corresponding to the arrival of back trajectory l τij is the number of endpoints in grid cell i j for back trajectory l capital l is the total number of back trajectories following the analogy of the weighted average the error associated to cij is the square root of the weighted variance defined as follows 4 σ ij l 1 l τ ijl c l c i j 2 l 1 l τ ijl grid cells with 10 water vapor analysis and 2 precipitation analysis back trajectory endpoints were discarded and are displayed as a grey area the different minimum endpoint number for water vapor and precipitation is due to the different number of back trajectories calculated for water vapor 5000 and precipitation 1000 analysis moisture source areas were detected along back trajectories with the approach proposed in sodemann et al 2008 this type of lagrangian diagnostic has been successfully used in several recent works which link isotopic composition of both ground level water vapor and precipitation to synoptic scale systems e g aemisegger et al 2014 crawford et al 2013 wang et al 2017 and determine water vapor isotopic composition sensitivity to moisture origin pfahl and wernli 2008 steen larsen et al 2015a b a moisture uptake i e water vapor is added to the air parcel by evaporation or mixing occurred for the air parcel at time ti if a positive variation of the specific humidity was detected during a time step i e between ti and ti 1 6 h and the height of the air parcel was below 1 5 times the pblh the specific humidity threshold used for accounting evaporative input into the air parcel has been discussed in several works for instance in sodemann and zubler 2010 the threshold of 0 2 g kg 1 was used for precipitation analysis over european alps highlighting that mean moisture sources at monthly scale are insensitive to threshold variation with respect to the distance from the alpine domain however the contribution of higher latitude moisture sources decreases with increasing values of the threshold in wang et al 2017 a sensitivity analysis was performed on humidity threshold 0 1 0 4 g kg 1 for central asia precipitation analysis showing that the moisture diagnostic is also valid for arid climate in this work 0 2 g kg 1 was chosen as the specific humidity threshold consistent with previous work focused on european alps weighted uptakes were calculated along back trajectories and integrated onto a 1 1 grid 104 km2 to allow the comparison between specific humidity and precipitation moisture source areas gridded moisture sources are reported as a relative contribution to accounted specific humidity at sampling site the accounted moisture uptakes resulted 70 for water vapor and 62 for precipitation analysis it should be noted that cwt and moisture source analyses are interpolated onto a 1 1 104 km2 an area nearly 20 fold relative to the venetian lagoon area therefore many fine scale features linked to the lagoon are not visible in the model the back trajectory approach is then useful to understand moisture transport and isotopic control on a regional scale rather than at local lagoon scale 2 4 water vapor sampling a cryogenic sampling campaign of water vapor was carried out from late march 2015 to june 2016 at the scientific campus of the ca foscari university located in the venice mainland daytime water vapor samples were collected with cryotraps weekly from march 2015 to september 2015 while daytime and nighttime samples were collected weekly from october 2015 to june 2016 for a total of 161 observations cryotrapping is a well established and cheap technique to collect atmospheric water vapor samples gat et al 2003 helliker et al 2002 uemura et al 2008 the main characteristics of our sampling apparatus are briefly described here the sampling was carried on inside the laboratory of isotope geochemistry at scientific campus external air was pumped 1 l min 1 through a heated copper line to an automated cryotrap sequencer the external inlet was installed facing the lagoon approximately 6 m over the ground traps were submerged in isopropyl alcohol maintained at 77 c with an haake immersion cooler model ek90 approximately 2 4 h were required for the collection of at least 1 ml of liquid water depending on the air moisture content after the sampling traps were securely sealed with parafilm and the frozen samples were allowed to melt for one hour at room temperature thereafter liquid samples were transferred to 2 ml vials and kept at 5 c until analysis that occurred within 72 h isotopic analysis was performed with a picarro cavity ring down spectroscopy crds analyzer model l 1102i and raw data was calibrated against the iaea vsmow slap scale following the procedure described in iaea 2009 isotopic compositions of standard waters for calibrating each run of analysis are reported in table 1 these internal standards were previously measured with conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometry to minimize memory effect between water samples characterized by a high inter vial isotopic difference 8 injections were performed for each sample penna et al 2012 then the mean and the standard deviation of 8 injections were calculated injections that deviated more than one standard deviation from the mean were discarded standard deviation of measurement technique ranges between 0 02 0 3 on average 0 08 for δ18o and between 0 04 1 5 on average 0 5 for δd 2 5 precipitation sampling precipitation was sampled at the scientific campus from april 2015 to june 2016 precipitation samples were collected on monthly and on single event basis with custom samplers designed with an anti evaporation system gröning et al 2012 the single event collector consists in five bottles each one connected to a dedicated peristaltic pump all the peristaltic pumps are connected to a single funnel that samples the rain water during the precipitation event the peristaltic pumps are driven by a microcontroller unit that i detect the occurrence of precipitation with a resistive sensor and ii save the beginning and ending date of the precipitation event this parallel sampling allowed to obtain the integrated isotopic signal of precipitation monthly sampler as well the high frequency features and the variability of the isotopic signal single event sampler for the study area precipitation amount was measured directly by the volume of water collected each event or month 114 single event 92 of detected rain events and 13 monthly precipitation samples were collected and analyzed with crds alike water vapor samples standard water 1 table 1 was included for calibrating enriched precipitation samples 2 6 modeling the water vapor isotopic composition to describe the isotope fractionation during evaporation we used the model developed by craig and gordon 1965 hereafter cg model with the cg model the isotopic composition of the water vapor flux δe is determined as follows 4 δ e α v l δ l h δ a ε ε k 1 h ε k 10 3 where αv l is the equilibrium fractionation factor at a given temperature horita and wesolowski 1994 δl is the isotopic composition of the liquid water subjected to evaporation δa is the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture h is the relative humidity ε is equal to 1 αv l103 and ε k represents the non equilibrium kinetic fractionation factor kinetic fractionation factor depends on the mechanism by which evaporation is driven i e diffusion and turbulence and on relative humidity the general formulation of ε k can be approximated to 5 ε k 1 h θ n 1 d i d where θ represents a weighting term that accounts for the resistance to diffusive flow to the sum of diffusive and turbulent flow n is an aerodynamic parameter that accounts for wind speed di d is the ratio of the diffusivity coefficients of vapor in air for the water molecule labelled with the heavier isotope di and common water d di d can be assumed equals to 0 9727 and 0 9757 for h2 18o h2 16o and hd16o h2 16o in air respectively merlivat 1978 the term 1 di d is often defined as ck gat 2010 opinions diverge on how to best incorporate the role of atmospheric turbulence in the cg model xiao et al 2017 in other words θ and n parameters depend on environmental and climatic settings of the study case for instance kinetic fractionation parameter can be estimated as a function of wind speed for ocean conditions merlivat and jouzel 1979 in this study different values of the product θnck are used since different environmental settings are associated to natural evaporation in the study area e g seawater freshwater and soil water evaporation therefore every time the cg model will be mentioned in the text kinetic fraction values for δ18o and δd will be reported the cg model can be simplified to estimate the atmospheric moisture isotopic composition under the assumption of a global closed water budget merlivat and jouzel 1979 this closure assumption hereafter mj79 assumption can be also applied to local scale studies meaning that all the water vapor in the boundary layer originates from the evaporation flux galewsky et al 2016 results obtained under the mj79 assumption for local studies must be considered carefully because systematic bias can affect the modeled water vapor isotope content jouzel and koster 1996 an important limitation to this approach is that the water vapor isotopic composition within the pbl is not only controlled by surface evaporation but also by atmospheric circulation advection plays a key role in the atmosphere to this effect accounting for horizontal transport of water vapor however when long timescales are considered the concept of an equilibrium pbl become useful to discriminate between moisture introduced by evaporation and moisture removed by mixing with the free atmosphere helliker et al 2004 the pbl can be treated as a 1 d box model with input and output of water vapor only from the top and bottom smoothing out the near surface horizontal advection by the long time period averaging angert et al 2008 wei et al 2016 the keeling plot kp approach combines the isotopic composition of water vapor with concentration measurements and extrapolates the isotopic signature of added vapor flux keeling 1958 the isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture within the pbl δa can be estimated with eq 6 yakir and sternberg 2000 6 δ a q fa δ fa δ f 1 q δ f where qfa is the water vapor concentration mmol mol 1 in the free atmosphere δfa is the isotopic composition of water vapor in the free atmosphere q is the concentration of water vapor mmol mol 1 within the pbl and δf represents the isotopic composition of the total surface flux of water vapor since the model of eq 6 needs the isotopic composition and water vapor concentration in the free atmosphere the kp method estimates the δf parameter as the intercept of the regression line in the δ vs 1 q space i e when q δf is a combination of several water vapor sources and the intercept of the kp can be used to quantify the relative contribution of each of these sources to the total surface flux wei et al 2016 yakir and sternberg 2000 in a simple two sources approach e g evaporation and transpiration the relative contribution of source 1 f1 to source 2 can be defined as 7 f 1 δ kp δ 2 δ 1 δ 2 100 where δkp is the intercept of kp e g the isotopic composition of evapotranspiration flux δ 1 is the isotopic composition of source 1 e g transpiration and δ 2 is the isotopic composition of source 2 e g evaporation the kp method is the most popular method for estimating the evapotranspiration flux isotopic composition based on a large literature survey xiao et al 2018 estimated average uncertainties with kp method equal to 5 1 2 7 and 0 8 for evapotranspiration evaporation and transpiration isotopic composition respectively these uncertainties lead to an error on transpiration evapotranspiration ratio of 21 in this study to improve the estimation of f1 and its uncertainty mean f1 and f1 max f1 min 2 were calculated using δ18o and δd following yepez et al 2003 kp integrates the contributing fluxes of different ecosystem sources and its spatial resolution depends on measurement height this allows to speculate about the spatial sensitivity of the isotopic signal of moisture sources in the study area at sampling height 2 7 surface waters sampling and modeling a complete survey of the lagoon was performed on 30 march 2016 from 8 00 to 18 00 lst the sampling campaign was carried out during a single semi tidal cycle close to a neap tide period in order to minimize the tide effect on lagoon water these conditions let to take a snapshot of the mean isotopic composition and of the variability of surface water of the lagoon little information is available about the isotopic composition of surface waters considering the whole drainage basin and the lagoon itself some seasonal variability in surface water is expected due to the complexity of the drainage network the pattern of meteoric inputs and the management of the water resources zuliani et al 2005 less than 50 mm of rain were recorded in march 2016 and no precipitation events were recorded in the 20 days before the sampling the 20 sampling positions in the lagoon domain are reported in fig 1 b as crosses lpx the water was sampled on the surface submerging a 100 ml bottle as close as possible to the air water interface and at 0 5 m depth with a pump for each sampling point profiles of salinity and temperature were acquired with an idronaut multiprobe model 316 to have a single value and its uncertainty representative of the isotopic composition and of the salinity of the lagoon water between 0 and 0 5 m mean and δmax δmin 2 of the two samples were calculated for each sampling point between 31 march and 1 april 2016 10 samples from major lagoon tributaries were also collected sampling points for river water were chosen following the measurement sections in zuliani et al 2005 positions of river sampling points are depicted in fig 1b as triangles ilx the river water was collected submerging a bucket in the middle of the river lagoon and river water samples were analyzed with a thermo fisher delta plus advantage mass spectrometer using a co2 h2 h2o equilibration unit online with the mass spectrometer isotopic compositions of internal standard waters are reported in table 1 standard deviations of surface water samples analyses are 0 05 for δ18o and 0 7 for δd to map the isotopic composition of hydrogen and oxygen over the contiguous surface of the venetian lagoon we used the hybrid method proposed by bowen and wilkinson 2002 the following parameters predictors were accounted for building the regression models of δ18o and δd the distance from sea inlets weighted by mass contribution gačić et al 2002 the distance from rivers weighted by mass contribution zuliani et al 2005 the lagoon bathymetry sarretta et al 2015 the water residence time isamr cnr 2018 the latitude all the possible regression models with the above mentioned predictors were calculated n 61 the model with the lowest akaike information criteria aic was considered to calculate predicted values of the lagoon water west et al 2014 3 results 3 1 the isotopic composition of water in the lagoon hydrosphere a summary of the isotopic composition of water vapor precipitation and surface waters of the study area is given in fig 2 the lmwl was calculated from monthly precipitation data in general d excess 10 for precipitation can be considered a signature of raindrops evaporation during the descent from the cloud base to the ground for venice mean sd d excess is 8 5 monthly samples therefore many precipitation events might have undergone partial evaporation to discriminate the precipitation samples subjected to strong evaporation a threshold of 0 was set for d excess parameter as can be noted in fig 2 water vapor and surface water samples lie on a line with a slope lower than the lmwl not reported in sections 3 2 3 4 the main results of the isotopic composition and the origin processes affecting each component of the local water cycle are presented 3 2 the isotopic composition and the sources of water vapor fig 3 a reports monthly means of water vapor δ18o d excess and air temperature mean values sd of δ18o δd and d excess for the whole study period are 17 4 123 29 17 5 respectively water vapor δ18o varies between 32 2 10 5 and a seasonal trend can be recognized standard errors s e s d n of water vapor isotopic composition at monthly scale are one order of magnitude greater than the precision achieved with the picarro instrument e g se ranges between 0 3 1 4 on average 0 7 for δ18o and between 0 7 11 on average 5 for δd seasonal variations of isotopic composition are in turn greater than monthly standard errors of water vapor composition and can be reasonably attributed to seasonal variations of air temperature which modulates the absolute concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere however the most depleted values were recorded in march 2016 δ18o 32 20 δd 243 60 while the most enriched in april 2016 δ18o 10 50 δd 83 13 delayed by just one month these two extremes are related to processes such as strong entrainment and long range transport of water vapor for march and persistence of high relative humidity conditions for april zannoni et al 2019 depleted water vapor isotopic composition was also observed in march 2015 but the sampling was performed during a single day and cannot be considered representative at monthly scale as expected significant correlation was found between δ18o and mixing ratio and air temperature measured during samples collection rδ18o q rδ18o t 0 6 p values 0 01 similar positive correlation was observed between the monthly average δ18o and air temperature r 0 61 p value 0 05 the seasonal trend observed for δ18o is not evident for d excess which is uncorrelated to air temperature to lagoon water temperature and to water vapor mixing ratio the d excess parameter shows large variability during winter january 2016 max min 23 and spring months april 2015 max min 22 march 2016 max min 16 april 2016 max min 24 and in general shows a significant negative correlation with rhsst r 0 49 p value 0 01 as can be noted in fig 1 c wind circulation in the sampling area is characterized by two modes n30 e and n120 e and wind blowing from mainland is a common feature therefore when air parcels reach the sampling point from mainland under ms wind conditions water vapor isotopic composition should be less related to lagoon evaporative conditions the hypothesis that the isotopic composition of local water vapor can be influenced by the lagoon is supported by the increasing correlation coefficient in absolute value between d excess and rhsst estimated when wind blowing from ms r 0 39 p value 0 01 and from ls r 0 75 p value 0 01 accordingly the cg model and the mj79 assumption were used to describe the isotope fractionation during evaporation from local surface water under ls wind conditions for this calculation mean temperature t sst 19 c and the mean wind speed ws 1 4 m s 1 when wind was blowing from the ls were considered θnck estimated for δ18o and δd are 6 4 and 5 6 comparable to the recent ones used in xiao et al 2017 for describing evaporation occurring over a large lake 2400 km2 for the isotopic composition of the evaporative source δl mean values of surface water were used δ18ol 0 88 δdl 5 8 see section 3 4 the observed linear relationship between d excess and rhsst expected from cg model with mj79 assumption is not comparable with water vapor observations in terms of regression parameters slope observed 0 35 0 04 1 slope modeled 0 46 1 as can be noted in fig 3b to accomplish the closure assumption a steeper line should fit the observations on d excess vs rhsst plane variability of the d excess vs rhsst slope using the cg model under the mj79 assumption can be attributed mostly to wind speed variability sst variability 1 sd 7 c does not contribute to this effect rather than contributing on intercept variability for 4 ws variability is small 1sd 0 7 m s 1 and is translated into a variation of θnck between 6 2 and 6 8 for δ18o when ws variability is considered the modeled slope varies in the range 0 44 1 0 49 1 which not includes the observed slope for oceanic settings the paper of steen larsen et al 2014 suggests that advection and different moisture sources could affect the d excess vs rhsst relationship this effect can be recognized as a relationship between the regression parameters and the wind direction similarly zannoni et al 2019 showed that a daily increase in water vapor d excess is due to advection of marine air in the study area during the spring season this translates in a wind direction dependence of water vapor d excess clearly detectable during the developing of the sea breeze circulation when the sampling point was downwind of the lagoon the discrepancy between water vapor observations and cg mj79 highlights that other processes such as advection are involved in the local water vapor budget and evaporation from lagoon surface water is not the only process that controls water vapor d excess in this area in the best case with wind blowing from ls rhsst explains 55 of d excess variability of sampled water vapor moisture sources were investigated with back trajectories to understand how regional contribution of water vapor and air masses origin could have influenced water vapor d excess in venice fig 4 air parcels for the most part originated in the west accordingly to westerlies similar circulation patterns were obtained selecting back trajectories under ls or ms wind conditions not shown therefore back trajectories origin cannot be directly related to wind direction measured locally about one third of the accounted specific humidity at sampling site is collected by air parcels within a radius of 500 km from venice from fig 4 it can also be noted that large part 50 of accounted moisture has continental origin land water vapor contribution estimated with lagrangian diagnostic is maximum during summer 67 and minimum during winter 32 as expected from increasing land evapotranspiration during hot months the positive correlation between land water vapor contribution and water vapor δ18o at the seasonal scale r 0 88 is consistent with this conclusion on the other hand d excess shows negative correlation r 0 63 with land water vapor contribution contrary to an expected larger contribution of recycled moisture over the continent it should be noted that p values associated with these correlations are high 0 1 p value 0 3 hence the statistical significance of these relationship may be weak however in the framework of seasonal water vapor d excess vs land moisture contribution relationship we can hypnotize that water vapor d excess is mostly affected by transpired water vapor in summer and by soil evaporation in winter the evaporation process has a larger impact on water vapor d excess than transpiration which is assumed to be a non fractionating process with respect to plant water source this hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that water vapor d excess and rhsst correlation is stronger during winter r 0 56 p value 0 01 than in summer r 0 27 p value 0 01 however it cannot be excluded that a certain degree of uncertainty to moisture sources diagnostic can be also attributed to land moisture contribution for warm conditions sodemann et al 2008 cwt was adopted to determine how air masses origin could have affected water vapor isotopic composition measured in venice a difference in the cwt pattern of water vapor d excess a map of δ18o is available in supplementary material s2 can be observed between air parcels with north east and south west origin fig 4 inset the former ones are in general related to depleted water vapor measured at the sampling point and their lower moisture content can be attributed to continental origin as inferable from moisture source distribution the latter ones are related to enriched water vapor and are specifically sourced over the western central mediterranean area there is also an evident gradient in the d excess pattern along the mediterranean sea with higher d excess 20 in the eastern zone consistent with precedent studies gat and carmi 1970 pfahl and wernli 2008 rindsberger et al 1983 3 3 the isotopic composition and the sources of precipitation the isotopic composition of precipitation unlike water vapor does not show a clear seasonal trend as can be seen in fig 5 a the correlation with air temperature measured at ground level during precipitation is low r 0 43 p value 0 01 for δ18o and air temperature of single precipitation events however low correlation between isotopic composition of precipitation and air temperature is a common feature for many coastal sites gat 2010 rozanski et al 1993 a weak but significant negative correlation r 0 27 p value 0 01 was found between δ18o and precipitation amount for single precipitation events no significant correlation was observed between precipitation amount and precipitation isotopic composition at monthly scale therefore the weak correlation identified for single event sampling is probably smoothed at longer time scales for single precipitation events with d excess 0 the correlation between δ18o and precipitation amount increase in absolute value seasonally i e for summer r 0 41 for autumn r 0 46 and for winter r 0 54 p values 0 05 the correlation for the spring season is not significant and about 40 of samples collected between march and may are characterized by negative d excess these results suggest that for the venetian lagoon area the amount effect is weak but visible despite a bias in such analysis could be introduced by the large number of light rain events from a comparison between monthly and single precipitation data it is evident that the monthly and event sampling methods capture the main features of the isotopic composition of precipitation e g the minimum of δ18o in november and in general the higher d excess during cold months the discrepancies between mean precipitation events and monthly data can be related to several reasons the first one is that not all the precipitation events were collected due the limited number of bottles in the automatic sampler from this point of view if such type of sampling will be used in future studies the number of bottles and peristaltic pumps must be considered carefully the second one is that rainwater in both samplers can be subjected to evaporation if not well sealed it is particularly true for warm months and can justify the large discrepancy for monthly precipitation collected during may and june 2016 however the weighted averages for monthly samples 6 9 and 48 for δ18o and δd respectively are comparable with the online isotopes in precipitation calculator bowen 2018 and with previous studies for this area gattacceca et al 2009 longinelli and selmo 2003 moreover lmwl estimated from single events is comparable with lmwl estimated from monthly samples when considering the standard errors of the regression fig 5b hence monthly samples are used in this work to determine the mean isotopic composition of precipitation and lmwl while precipitation events are used to estimate the monthly variability of the isotopic composition sd of precipitation events are 3 and 25 for δ18o and δd respectively for a comparison of precipitation isotopic composition at monthly scale with the two sampling methods see supplementary material s1 following the description of water vapor in section 3 2 the moisture sources areas for precipitation events and a cwt map of d excess are reported in fig 6 moisture sources include a larger area than for the water vapor analysis as expected by including back trajectories started at higher altitudes the continental contribution to precipitation is lower than the one estimated for ground level water vapor 43 but approximately twofold than the one estimated for alpine area during 1995 2002 sodemann and zubler 2010 it becomes also evident the contribution of the north atlantic ocean that is on average 14 but accounts for 36 of moisture sources during winter season combining the moisture uptake patterns of figs 4 and 6 it can be noted that major source areas of moisture include western mediterranean sea adriatic tyrrhenian and ligurian sea part of the po plain and central italy in particular the moisture contributions of ligurian sea and north adriatic sea are comparable on annual basis the cwt pattern of the precipitation d excess captures a slightly different gradient than water vapor d excess measured at ground level as expected by different moisture origin for precipitation and ground level water vapor analysis a possible continental moisture source area that contributes to higher precipitation d excess in venice is located in the eastern europe consistent with other studies e g lykoudis and argiriou 2007 no meaningful information can be extrapolated from the cwt pattern of δ18o of precipitation reported in supplementary material s2 about 21 of the collected precipitation events are characterized by negative d excess which can be considered a signature of partially evaporated raindrops dotsika et al 2010 froehlich et al 2008 stewart 1975 the isotopic composition of these samples is not correlated with air temperature or relative humidity evaporated samples were related to strong unsaturated air column between the cloud base and the ground some vertical profiles of rh estimated from era interim data are reported as a further example to this effect in supplementary material s3 we found a significant negative correlation r 0 72 p value 0 01 between mean rh measured during precipitation events and the distance of evaporated sample from the lmwl calculated along an evaporation line see supplementary material s4 hence rain evaporation and interaction with surface evaporation could play an important role in modifying the isotopic composition of precipitation in the study area isotope equilibrium between rain and vapor is discussed in detail in section 4 1 3 4 the isotopic composition of the venetian lagoon surface waters the isotopic composition of lagoon s surface waters ranges between 4 30 0 39 and 29 2 3 0 for δ18o and δd respectively the mean difference of water collected on the surface and at 0 5 m depth surface deep is 0 3 for δ18o and 1 7 for δd the largest difference observed is for sampling point lp7 where a scarce vertical mixing is plausible 1 79 and 12 32 for δ18o and δd respectively as initial approximation whether lagoon water is the result of mixing between seawater from the inlets gattacceca et al 2009 stenni et al 1995 and freshwater from rivers it is possible to estimate the contribution of both components with a simple two components mass balance for seawater the isotopic composition can be assumed relatively constant during the year however some variability of seawater isotopic composition might be important during the spring season due to freshwater discharge as observed for the gulf of trieste in the north east adriatic sea stenni et al 1995 for freshwater the isotopic composition of rivers draining into the lagoon could also present seasonal variability indeed the drainage basin of the venetian lagoon has undergone to human modification for centuries and freshwater discharge into the lagoon is currently regulated in large part zuliani et al 2005 brenta river il8 and nuovissimo canal il7 show the most depleted isotopic waters due to the alpine origin of water δ18o equals to 8 97 and 9 20 for il8 and il9 respectively their influx into the lagoon is located in the southern sector and their flow rate and composition could be influenced by seasonal rainfalls in the mountain area in the northern sector of the lagoon freshwater is supplied by sile il1 and dese il2 which are short rivers 90 and 52 km respectively characterized by resurgent springs i e with groundwater recharge their discharge into the lagoon is higher than for tributaries in the southern sector and their isotopic composition could be influenced by precipitation occurring over mainland near the lagoon however no precipitation was recorded in the study area during the two weeks before the sampling hence local precipitation contribution on river isotopic signal should be minimum mean isotopic composition of freshwater influx was estimated from the strong linear relationship between delta values and salinity r 0 97 p value 0 01 as the intercept of the regression model i e when salinity 0 psu fig 7 a and b show the relationship and the linear best fit between isotopic composition δ18o and d excess and salinity for the venetian lagoon the calculated isotopic composition of freshwater is fully compatible with measured isotopic composition of tributaries estimated δ18o 9 0 0 4 and δd 60 3 measured δ18o 8 6 0 4 and δd 58 3 accordingly the positions of the lagoon and tributaries water samples on the δ18o δd plane are reported in fig 7 c on average and under neap tide configuration lagoon water within the first 0 5 m mean isotopic composition δ18o 0 88 δd 5 8 is the results of freshwater and seawater mixing in the ratio 1 4 the mass contribution of freshwater to lagoon water is 20 8 0 2 now we focus on the spatial variability of the isotopic composition of surface water because large horizontal gradients for delta values are expected with depleted water near the western side of the lagoon close to freshwater input and enriched water near the eastern side of the lagoon close to sea inlets the regression model with minimum aic 39 9 for δ18o used to predict the isotopic composition of the contiguous surface of the lagoon is given in eq 8 8 δ w β 0 β 1 f w c β 2 bat mean β 3 bat std β 4 rt lag β 5 l a t where fwc is the distance from rivers weighted by mass contribution batmean and batstd are mean and standard deviation of lagoon bathymetry calculated for a square of 0 001 length 0 02 km2 rtlag is water residence time of the same square lat is the latitude a regression model with the same predictors of δ18o was estimated for δd coefficients of the models are reported in table 2 r2 0 75 for both δ18o and δd a geostatistical model was not computed with the residuals of the regression model because spatial autocorrelation resulted very low moran s i index 0 predicted and measured δ18o and d excess of the surface water of the venetian lagoon are reported in fig 8 maps in kmz format are available as supplementary material it is worth noting that an evident horizontal gradient emerges in the northern sector of the lagoon where the air interacts with the surface water for most of the time before reaching the water vapor sampling point another relevant feature that emerges in fig 8 is the large expansion of depleted water in southern and northern lagoon with respect to the central lagoon water this is consistent with the residence time of lagoon water that ranges between 8 days in the central area and 20 days near the southern and northern borders cucco and umgiesser 2006 the key feature of these maps is that freshwater plays a relevant role on the superficial water budget of the venetian lagoon and may lead to a characteristic signature of the water vapor isotopic composition in this area some modern modification of the hydrodynamics of the venetian lagoon e g the mose project could affect the surficial water budget rinaldo et al 2008 since freshwater glides over seawater and evaporation is a surface process the thin depleted layer of surficial water could largely affect the isotopic composition of water vapor near the surface in the future especially if the water column is not well mixed 4 discussion 4 1 isotopic equilibrium between water reservoirs when the air above the water surface is saturated with respect to the water surface temperature rhsst 100 vapor and liquid phases tend to isotope equilibrium and net surface evaporation flux is close to zero as can be noted in fig 3 b in some cases high mean rhsst 85 n 18 was recorded during water vapor sampling since rhsst 85 was observed with n 4 or without n 14 precipitation water vapor should be close to isotopic equilibrium with precipitation or with surface waters in the case of precipitation water vapor and rain quickly tend to isotope equilibrium bonne et al 2014 during a rainfall large amount of liquid water traversing through the local atmosphere interacts with relatively much smaller amount of water vapor deshpande et al 2010 precipitation intensity and raindrops size play a key role in this regard 12 water vapor and precipitation samples were collected simultaneously under rhsst ranging from 68 to 97 allowing a direct comparison between measured isotopic composition of water vapor and estimated composition of water vapor in isotope equilibrium with precipitation during these events the measured δ18o of atmospheric water vapor resulted on average depleted with respect to the δ18o of water vapor estimated from isotope equilibrium with precipitation δ18omeasured δ18o equilibrium 0 8 moreover measured d excess of atmospheric water vapor was on average 7 higher than d excess estimated by rain vapor equilibrium the same d excess offset exists on an annual basis i e considering all the observations water vapor precipitation and using mean air temperature 16 c for equilibrium fractionation factor estimation the observed offset suggest that kinetic effects were involved during precipitation in case of high humidity without precipitation water vapor tends to isotope equilibrium with surface waters however isotopic equilibrium could be difficult to establish because water vapor is quickly advected in the lower troposphere and surface waters are in general characterized by lesser isotopic variability near isotopic equilibrium between seawater and atmospheric water vapor has been observed for instance in the tropics during quiescent weather lawrence et al 2004 for the venetian lagoon case it has been observed that during specific synoptic configuration and persistent high humidity conditions water vapor d excess falls and near isotopic equilibrium between water vapor and lagoon surface water is established zannoni et al 2019 for 2015 2016 when rhsst 85 n 14 mean sd water vapor d excess is 10 6 and a significant difference exists between water vapor d excess measured with wind blowing from ls and from ms 3 2 and 13 5 respectively such low water vapor d excess under ls conditions led to hypothesize that water vapor observations may reflect the isotopic signal of the lagoon surface water this hypothesis was tested calculating the isotopic composition of water in equilibrium with vapor δ18ol using mean sst under ls condition and the result of δ18ol 2 1 was obtained such isotopic composition is comparable with predicted surface water composition near the inland boundary of the lagoon fig 8 in a range of 6 up to 26 km in agreement with the above hypothesis moreover this length is compatible with the mean displacement of an air parcel in the study area i e approximately 20 km considering mean horizontal non turbulent wind speed stohl et al 2002 at 10 m height during ls wind condition it is reasonable to say that this length probably changes as function of the tidal intensity 4 2 the isotopic composition of total surface flux most water vapor samples were collected under unsaturated conditions during which surface evaporation adds moisture to the pbl such conditions seem to be possible to explain as mixing between two main components because of the good determination coefficient for a linear fit between δ values and the inverse of mixing ratio r2 0 49 and 0 48 for δ18o and δd respectively hence the kp was used to investigate the relative contribution of water vapor sources to the total surface flux some adjustments were applied to the water vapor dataset the first adjustment is related to the relative number of diurnal and nocturnal observations only daytime data were considered since the number of diurnal observations is larger than the number of nocturnal observations and because diurnal observations cover the whole timespan 2015 2016 63 of the observations 06 18 lst we did not observe significant variations of kp intercepts when fitting only daytime data or the complete dataset e g intercept for δ18o switches between 12 5 0 5 and 12 6 0 4 for daytime data only and for complete dataset respectively the second adjustment is related to possible outliers observations that are more than three scaled median absolute deviations away from the median were considered outliers rousseeuw and croux 1993 and were removed from the kp calculation 6 of the observations such outliers are probably related to strong entrainment and to circulation systems which might have caused large variability of water vapor isotopic composition in the free atmosphere samples collected in march 2015 n 2 and march 2016 n 3 are representative of such atmospheric conditions a significant difference between kp intercepts under ls n 53 and ms n 43 wind conditions emerges as can be noted for δ18o in fig 9 a this difference allows to distinguish between two main sub components of the total surface flux land evapotranspiration and evaporation from the lagoon surface when wind is blowing from the interior land ms condition the evaporative contribution from the lagoon should be minimum thus it is also possible to speculate on the relative contribution of land transpiration using eq 6 for transpired water vapor it was assumed the simplest possible case with transpired water vapor flux isotopic composition δt land equals to source water isotopic composition under steady state condition gat 1996 harwood et al 1999 on this latter point recent studies conducted with high temporal resolution measurements indicate that δt reaches the steady state from late morning to afternoon xiao et al 2018 for evaporation flux isotopic composition δe land the water source parameter δl in the cg model was considered a combination of mainland soil water reservoir a and mainland surface waters reservoir b e g rivers and lakes data about the isotopic composition of freshwater in the study area is available in literature but no information is available about the isotopic composition of the soil water consequently the assumptions behind the isotopic composition of reservoirs a and b for this study are reservoir a soil water the isotopic fractionation of rainwater due to infiltration in soils depends on soil type infiltration rate and climate evaporation precipitation ratio gat 2010 moreover the isotopic composition of soil water largely changes as a function of depth with seasonal changes linked to the position of the evaporation front xiao et al 2018 on a global average d excess of soil water is 0 12 evaristo et al 2015 hence we simulated the isotopic composition of mean soil water assuming evaporation of precipitation along a soil evaporation line sel and a final d excess of 0 the slope of sel resulted 3 6 following the method of gibson et al 2008 and the mean isotopic composition of soil water resulted δ18o 5 2 and δd 42 δd value is consistent with mean soil water data from mediterranean biomes evaristo et al 2015 for cg model parametrization we considered that kinetic fractionation is larger for dry soil than for saturated soils therefore kinetic fractionation parameters are assumed to vary within the following boundary conditions mathieu and bariac 1996 θnck 28 1 18 7 for dry and saturated soil conditions respectively δ18o θnck 24 9 16 6 for dry and saturated soil conditions respectively δd reservoir b freshwater the dense river network of the po plain includes rivers from alpine and pre alpine regions as well as rivers whose springs are in the middle of the plain on average their isotopic composition ranges between 13 and 7 for δ18o bortolami et al 1973 marchina et al 2015 considering that we estimated δ18o 9 for the freshwater input into the lagoon it seems reasonable to assume the isotopic composition of lagoon s tributaries as indicative of the study area surface waters kinetic fractionation factor for freshwater evaporation were parametrized as follows θnck 14 2 for δ18o and θnck 12 5 for δd jasechko et al 2013 good et al 2015 estimated that the global fraction of evaporation occurring in soils ranges between 45 and 88 with a mean value of 65 using the global mean to weight soil evaporation the contribution of transpiration to the land evapotranspiration flux ranges between 64 8 and 60 6 considering evaporation from dry and saturated soil respectively these values are fully consistent with the recent estimates of terrestrial water fluxes good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 and can be considered at first approximation representative of land water vapor fluxes in the study area when the wind is blowing from the lagoon ls condition the contribution of the water vapor flux from the lagoon should be maximum and land vapor should mix with the lagoon vapor in this case the vapor flux contribution from the lagoon is translated into a shift of the kp intercepts of 1 8 and 14 for δ18o and δd respectively rearranging the terms of eq 6 with the isotopic composition of the water vapor flux from the lagoon surface under ls conditions θnck values estimated for δ18o and δd are 6 4 and 5 6 the percentage contribution of land evapotranspiration is 73 1 thus lagoon evaporation accounts on the total surface flux for about 27 the percentage contributions of the sub components of the total surface flux stacked to 100 are reported in fig 9b when the lagoon evaporation flux contribution is considered in the average daily evapotranspiration flux transpiration represents 44 to 47 of the total surface flux our estimation of transpiration fraction could be subjected to large errors due to the assumptions made for land water reservoirs an important limitation is that no information about the isotopic composition of soil water in the study area is available for instance changing the transpired water vapor isotopic composition from soil water δ18o 5 2 δd 42 to precipitation δ18o 6 9 δd 48 causes an increase of 4 of transpiration contribution secondly we have not considered the percentage of vegetation cover in the study area and it was demonstrated that transpiration evaporation ratio quickly decreases as a function of vegetation cover wang et al 2010 moreover our estimation of transpiration fraction uncertainty is probably too much optimistic when compared to recent studies involving high temporal resolution measurements of atmospheric water vapor isotopic composition xiao et al 2018 finally it should be noted that we have estimated the transpiration fraction only for daytime a more precise estimate of transpiration to evapotranspiration fraction for mainland goes beyond the scope of this study however the relative shift in the kp intercept is unrelated to land transpiration fraction hence the daily vapor flux from the lagoon surface only accounts for approximately one fourth of the total surface flux this result highlights the importance of the land vapor flux in the study area despite the coastal setting and the proximity to such a large transitional water body 5 conclusions stable isotopic composition of the water molecule is a powerful tool to study evapotranspiration and precipitation processes allowing to partition water fluxes between the atmosphere and the terrestrial surface we presented the first study of the atmospheric water cycle and its interaction in the lower pbl of the coastal lagoon of venice italy that includes observations of water vapor precipitation and surface water by answering to the following questions i to what extent the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor is representative of local free water sources and ii how large the impact of the evaporation flux of surface waters is on the isotopic composition of the total surface flux the sources and the processes affecting the isotopic composition of water vapor and precipitation were studied at both regional and local scale air parcels with north east and eastern mediterranean origin are associated to higher water vapor d excess in venice good correlation was found between water vapor isotopic composition and the mixing ratio measured locally about 55 of the water vapor d excess variability can be explained by rhsst over the lagoon when sampling site is downwind with respect to the lagoon precipitation does not show a clear seasonality and is characterized by a large variability of its isotopic composition up to 8 for δ18o during a single month compared to ground level water vapor the relationship between air masses origin and precipitation d excess is less clear but in general air parcels with eastern continental origin are associated to higher d excess single precipitation events are characterized by weak correlations between isotopic composition and ground level air temperature and precipitation amount however correlation with precipitation amount becomes not significant at monthly scale isotopic equilibrium between vapor and rain is biased by 7 for d excess on yearly basis d excessvapor d excessrain the same bias was also observed for several synchronous measurements of water vapor and rain hence sub cloud interaction between vapor and rain could be involved for the modification of the isotopic signal of precipitation in the study area a model of the spatial isotopic composition of lagoon water is proposed surface waters of the venetian lagoon are characterized by large isotopic gradients especially in the southern and northern sectors the lagoon s surficial water is composed by freshwater at 21 mass mass and its isotopic composition clearly marks the water vapor isotopic composition under high relative humidity conditions we suggest that near isotopic equilibrium the isotopic signature of water vapor observation at the ground level is representative of the isotopic composition of surficial waters in a range of approximately 6 26 km from the measurement site future studies could investigate how this length is influenced by the tidal intensity under unsaturated conditions the kp method was used to determine the isotopic composition of the daily total surface flux evapotranspiration the local wind direction was used to discriminate between water vapor that interacted mainly with lagoon surface water and water vapor that interacted mainly with inland moisture the estimated fraction of transpired water vapor to evapotranspiration flux for land side observations resulted compatible with recent estimates of average terrestrial water vapor fluxes 64 although the approach used presents some limitations however when the sampling point is downwind with respect to the lagoon a significant positive shift is introduced in the kp intercept this positive shift can be explained as mixing with enriched vapor from the lagoon in relative terms the lagoon evaporation flux accounts on average 27 to the daily 06 18 lst total surface flux hence the isotopic composition of water vapor measured near the ground close to the inland boundary of the lagoon is highly representative of the land vapor counterpart

6613,the powder river basin in montana and wyoming supplies about 40 percent of coal in the united states in recent decades coalbed methane cbm extracted from coal beds has become an important source of energy in the united states and other countries cbm water is the produced water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction the use of cbm water from the powder river basin for irrigation is limited by its relatively high sodium adsorption ratio so the water has to be maintained in lined retention ponds the liners can be detached from the pond bed breached through normal weathering or from extreme weather events and can wear out with time water level changes due to constant and dynamic evaporation and precipitation of rainfalls and snowfalls and refilling by gas companies the objectives of this study are 1 to develop and validate a novel uniformness based multi component algorithm to quantify the areas of water and exposed not submerged in water liners of the retention ponds from regular red green blue rgb images and 2 to quantify the areas of water and liners of the cbm retention ponds in the powder river basin using high resolution true color images such

segmentation 1 introduction coalbed methane cbm is the methane rich natural gas generated and entrapped within the coal beds on its internal surfaces within or on surfaces of macerals micropores and cleats or within the molecular structures of coal molecules during various coalification stages from lignite subbituminous coal bituminous coal to anthracite on geological time scales water permeates coal beds and its hydrostatic pressure helps to keep the methane within the coal cbm desorbs from the coal beds after water is withdrawn and the local pressure is reduced nuccio 2000 rice et al 2002 de bruin et al 2004 in recent decades technological advances have enabled the economic development of cbm stored in coal beds scientific understanding of the genesis of cbm and its production are both in the early learning stages though biogenic methane and thermogenic methane are two commonly accepted forms of methane formation rice and claypool 1981 rightmire 1984 de bruin et al 2004 geologic geochemical and hydrologic controls on coalbed methane generation migration distribution and recoverability along with environmental implications of developing cbm resource are yet to be investigated the powder river basin prb in montana and wyoming usa supplies about 40 percent of coal in the united states it covers an area of more than 61 000 square kilometers km2 in southern montana and northern wyoming in the powder river basin coal beds in the fort union formation at depths of 100 1000 m are the main source regions for coal bed gas development bartos and ogle 2002 since the late 1990 s cbm extracted from coal beds has become an important energy source in the united states for instance in 2016 alone 3 74 109 m3 cbm was produced in the powder river basin wyoming oil and gas conservation commission 2017 cbm water is the produced water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction water is produced in large volumes especially in the early stages of production and as the amount of water in the coal decreases gas production increases nuccio 2000 wheaton and brown 2005 approximately 143 135 581 barrels 22 756 777 80 m3 of cbm water were produced by 19 energy companies in the powder river basin in 2016 alone data provided by wyoming oil and gas conservation commission 2017 to produce the 3 74 109 m3 natural gas or on average 0 61 m3 cbm water was extracted per 100 m3 gas produced produced water is generally a sodium bicarbonate type with total dissolved solids in the range of 200 4 000 mg liter mg l and sodium adsorption ratios sar in the range of 5 6 69 0 rice et al 2002 bartos and ogle 2002 jackson and reddy 2007 healy et al 2011 sar is a measure of the concentration of sodium in water relative to the concentrations of calcium and magnesium water with an sar greater than 13 is undesirable for irrigation because soil structure can deteriorate as sodium replaces calcium and magnesium on clay particles soil survey laboratory 1995 mace and amrhein 2001 healy et al 2011 such large amounts of cbm water from the basin is thus limited for irrigation by its relatively high sar and has to be maintained in plastic lined retention ponds in an unlined impoundment cbm water will eventually infiltrate into ground water cbm water itself is not a primary source of solutes in groundwater near an unlined retention pond naturally occurring salts and minerals within the unsaturated zone dissolved and mobilized by infiltrating impoundment water account for most of the observed solute mass in groundwater healy et al 2011 since cbm water cannot be recharged into subsurface it has to be maintained in lined retention ponds refilling of the cbm water in these ponds depends on the water surface level that changes due to evaporation rainfall or snowfall events assuming no infiltration therefore an efficient monitoring tool is desirable to quantify the water area changes and to monitor whether the liner of lined ponds is in good shape seepage of water into the local groundwater system can occur if plastic liners are breached through normal weathering or from extreme weather events an automatic tool to extract water area and the exposed not submerged in water area of the liners of these ponds from high resolution satellite images or images acquired by a regular camera from an air borne system such as an unmanned aircraft system uas should serve this purpose well visual discrimination of water bodies from other land surfaces in a remote sensing image or regular picture per se is not a difficult task however accurate delineation of the boundary waterline and area estimation of a water body and exposed liners from an image by either eyes or a computer is not straight forward due to the transition zones at the boundary between different and cover types ryu et al 2002 maiti et al 2009 and the criteria of discriminating water liner pixels from pixels of other land surfaces algorithms on water body extraction from multispectral satellite images have been proposed and well verified work and gilmer 1976 white 1978 xu 2006 du et al 2012 ouma and tateishi 2006 sun et al 2012 pardo pascual et al 2012 tang et al 2013 li et al 2013 the main feature of these algorithms is that various water indices are defined using two or more bands to form an index so that water pixel is spectrally enhanced the spectral reflectance of at least one near infrared band is used taking advantage of its distinctly strong absorption in water than visible bands mcfeeters 1996 rogers and kearney 2004 xu 2006 ouma and tateishi 2006 lacaux et al 2007 feyisa et al 2014 wang et al 2015 automation for water pixel extraction in these algorithms is realized through thresholding of the water index values and thus these algorithms perform very efficiently in water body extraction some researchers used an ndvi threshold to segment lake area directly from an ndvi image assuming a pixel with ndvi value below the threshold e g 0 34 is water borro et al 2014 these algorithms are based on data from multi spectral imaging systems such as landsat imaging systems and large water bodies where hundreds and thousands of water pixels should be available otherwise the waterline cannot be accurately delineated however small artificial ponds such as the cbm water impoundments in prb are generally small in size compared to the spatial resolution of satellite images available on the public domain such as landsat images for instance the largest cbm pond in the montana prb is about 50 695 m2 about 56 water pixels within a landsat image spatial resolution 30 m while the smallest pond is 6213 m2 approximately only 7 pixels within a landsat image it is almost impossible to extract accurately water bodies as small as the artificial cbm ponds from the landsat images using the water index methods unless commercial multispectral satellite images with spatial resolution at or less than one meter are used if these image systems have the same near infrared bands for the verified water indices valuable resources of regular true color images that have extremely high resolution cm and are freely available cannot be used for water body delineation using the near infrared band based water index methods discussed above accurate measurement of water surface area and the exposed lined area of the cbm ponds in the powder river basin can provide important parameters for monitoring and management of these ponds however images of very high spatial resolution as high as tens of centimeters from google earth pro or pictures taken by a regular camera from a uas platform can be very useful for water body extraction and pond state monitoring the challenge is how to extract water pixels from regular red green blue rgb images since the rgb images from the google earth pro images formed from the rgb bands of satellite images or acquired by a regular camera have only three bands in the visible spectrum the objectives of this study are to develop an algorithm to extract water area and exposed lined area from a regular rgb image then to apply the algorithm to extract water area and area of exposed liners of the cbm ponds in the montana powder river basin from google earth pro images as case studies evaluation of the algorithm will be performed through differential global positioning system gps measurements along the boundary of some of the cbm ponds through a field campaign to summarize the novelty of this study is to develop an algorithm that automatically extracts water area and the exposed liner area of a cbm water pond from a regular rgb image in which case no useful spectral information from near infrared bands can be leveraged this is a challenging task and is very different from the literatures on water pixel extraction that is based on multispectral or hyperspectral images in which at least one band in the near infrared band is available for use feyisa et al 2014 and references therein also the algorithm will also extract automatically the pixels of exposed lined area to our knowledge there is not yet any algorithm available for automatic extraction of water body and the area of exposed lined area directly from a rgb image this study will also use the exposed lined area for state monitoring of the cbm ponds the characteristics that are used for automatic water and exposed liner pixel extraction from a rgb image include 1 a water body or lined area is a connected body in an image 2 the water body in an image is the largest and most homogeneous and or isotropic natural surface from which water area is to be extracted and 3 lined area is the second most homogeneous natural surface and its rgb pixel values are lower than water pixels which is the case for all cbm ponds in the prb the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we will discuss the characteristics of the study site in section 3 we will describe the data sources and data acquisition for this project in section 4 we will describe in details the development of the multi component algorithm for automatic extraction of water area and exposed lined area from rgb images results and evaluation of the algorithm will be given in section 5 discussion and conclusions are given in section 6 2 study site of cbm ponds the study site includes ten cbm water retention ponds in the big horn county montana powder river basin about 40 km to the northeast of sheridan wyoming usa fig 1 shows the study site the average temperature at sheridan is about 7 2 degrees celsius c average annual rainfall is 336 8 mm and average annual snowfall is 711 2 mm us climate data 2017 the study site is within the typical semiarid grasslands of the powder river basin there are ten retention ponds within the study site the pond names and approximate geographic locations of these ponds are shown in table 1 the ten impoundments were constructed in quaternary age unconsolidated deposits overlying tertiary age bedrock by summit gas resources inc of wyoming the pond names were given by the company too water is prevented from infiltrating into the ground water zone by lining the ponds evaporation is supposed to be the main depletion mechanism of the reduction of water level so that cbm water is refilled the company refills these ponds with cbm water to the possible water level for maximum evaporation the left panel in fig 1 shows the location of the powder river basin the top right panel shows a picture taken of the big nose kate pond the largest of the ten during a field campaign on july 14 16 2016 and the bottom right panel shows the locations of the ten cbm ponds in a google earth pro image 3 data sources and acquisition the longest side of the cbm ponds is 300 m that was estimated using the ruler tool of google earth pro thus multispectral satellite images available on the public domain such as landsat images do not have high enough resolution to monitor and estimate the areal coverage of these ponds thus we considered google earth pro true color images of cell size as high as tens of centimeters we followed the general guidelines of using google earth imagery https www google com permissions geoguidelines html general guidelines to download the google earth images high spatial resolution google images are mainly from commercial satellites or airborne orthogonal imagery google encourages creative applications of the google earth imagery and other google resources images in google earth pro can be exported up to 4 800 pixels wide for each pond we zoomed in to the pond image to make the pond as large as possible so that the spatial resolution is as high as possible then we used the add placemark tool to add a placemark as the ground control point the coordinates of the point were shown in the new placemark window we wrote down the coordinates for all ground control points and saved it as a separate file we used placemark circle symbol to denote the placemark where the coordinates of the center of the circle will be used for georeferencing of a downloaded jpeg image later in arcgis as many usually above 9 as possible placemarks were placed uniformly within the image to be downloaded once finishing the placement of ground control points the google earth image in jpeg format was downloaded the pixel number of each image is fixed thus the actual spatial resolution of the images downloaded is variable depending on the size of the pond that was zoomed in this spatial resolution only represents the pixel size of the downloaded image not the capacity of spatial resolution of the original image system that acquired the images all the borders labels placemark symbols icons and information that were seen on the screen showed up in the image that was saved from google earth georeferencing was carried out in arcgis for each image using the ground control points recorded above for each google earth image during downloading after georeferencing all images were converted to geotiff format from none geocoded true color images georeferenced images were projected to utm zone 13 n with wgs 84 as the datum a field campaign to the study site was made on july 14 16 2016 differential gps surveys of centimeter accuracy using the leica 1200 survey type units were carried out along the boundaries of four ponds randomly chosen for pond area measurement for each pond a stationary base gps station was set up using the base gps unit for a couple of hours at some point along the edge of the pond and a rover unit was used for waypoint data collection along the boundary of each pond based on the method described in section 5 2 that was used for pond area estimation from gps waypoints the more gps waypoints are collected along non linear segments of the pond boundary the more accurate the measured area will be therefore the greater the curvature of a segment is the more waypoints will be taken 4 algorithm development for automatic extraction of water area and exposed lined area fig 2 shows the flow chart of the algorithm of multiple components developed for the automatic extraction of water surface pixels and pixels of exposed lined zones from georeferenced images this is a batch processing procedure for each iteration an input image is firstly denoised then the denoised rgb image is converted to an l a b color space image followed by unsupervised classification based on k means clustering analysis using the chrominance a and b data connected objects in each class are then located and the connected object that has the minimum average gradient magnitude per pixel is identified as a water body based on the luminance image l the first component of the algorithm is denoising of the input image via iterative sparse and redundant representations over learned dictionaries i e given a noise containing image y the denoised image x is given by elad and aharon 2006 1a x λ i ij r ij t r ij 1 λ y ij r ij t d α ij in which the representation vectors α i j for each patch r ij x is computed by solving 1b ij min α ij α ij 0 s t r ij x d α ij 2 2 c σ 2 using any pursuit algorithm i is the unit matrix σ is the standard deviation of the additive zero mean gaussian white noise c is the noise gain a constant λ is the lagrange multiplier e g λ 30 σ d is an adaptive dictionary trained on patches from the noise containing image the notation α ij 0 stands for the count of the nonzero entries in α this component is optional but effective when the input image contains zero mean white and homogeneous gaussian additive noises if the input image does not contain any gaussian additive noises the output from this step is the same as the input the second component of the algorithm is image conversion from a rgb to an l a b color image the denoised standard rgb values are firstly converted to commission international d eclairage cie or international commission on illumination in english 1931 xyz values then converted to the 1976 cie l a b color space cie standard illuminant d65 was used as the reference white point which represents the average daylight illuminant the reason for this conversion before segmentation is that the rgb values such as those from the elements of a regular charge coupled device digital camera are light intensity dependent and redundant while the l a b color space is device independent and is color constant also the l a b color space has a much larger gamut than that of computer displays or human vision sharma and trussel 1997 hastings and rubin 2012 in the cie l a b color space l represents the luminance that closely matches human s perception of lightness l 0 represents the darkest black while l 100 represents the brightest white colors of the green red opponents are represented by the a axis with positive a indicating red and negative a indicating green colors of the yellow blue opponents are represented by the b axis with positive b indicating yellow and negative b indicating blue the a and b axes from the l a b space are orthogonal to each other the a and b components are then extracted for classification using only chrominance values offers a robust tool against variation in illumination intensity both in the time and spatial domains this means that image segmentation will be based only on the chromatic content of the color and the confusing impact of difference in ambient lighting conditions of images collected at different times on the segmentation will be mostly alleviated the third component of the algorithm is unsupervised classification or segmentation this is accomplished using the k means clustering analysis matoušek 2000 which partitions the observations in the two column chrominance matrix a and b each corresponds to a column into k clusters or classes of land surfaces we refer this as the chrominance based k mean clustering which is an iterative algorithm used to segment chrominance a and b matrices of m row by n column into k classes by minimizing the sum of the within cluster sums of pixel to cluster centroid squared euclidean distances over the k clusters to partition an n point set x r d into k classes g 1 g 2 g k where n m n and k are both integers we wish to find k cluster centroids c g i c g 2 c g k to minimize the potential function 2 φ i 1 k x g i min x c g i 2 during each iteration after the first one pixels are reassigned to their nearest cluster centroids cluster centroids are then recalculated the classification terminates when the minimum of the potential function i e when assigning any pixel to a different cluster increases the potential function or the preset maximum number of iterations is reached since there are limited k n possible classes the process will always automatically terminate for our case that classification was performed on the two column chrominance matrix n equals 2 the output was a vector containing the class indices of each pixel the classification procedure was duplicated multiple times each with a new set of initial centroids using several replicates with random starting points typically results in a solution that is a global minimum arthur and vassilvitskii 2007 if a cluster loses all of its member observations a new cluster consisting of the one observation furthest from its centroid will be created the fourth component of the algorithm is isolating connected objects in each class and finding the number of pixels of each connected object once the unsupervised classification is done classes will be separated into individual image files to identify the connected objects the image of each class is firstly converted to a binary image either 0 or 1 pixel values a pixel that belongs to the class is referred to as a class pixel that takes the value 1 whether a pixel is connected to another pixel of the same class is determined by the 8 way connectivity rule search starts from the beginning of the image once a class pixel is found it is labeled first then search for all contiguous pixels based on the 8 way connectivity rule use a region growing algorithm also called flood fill algorithm painter s algorithm or seed fill algorithm to label all the pixels in the connected components containing the pixel glassner 2001 nosal 2008 any time the 8 neighbor fill finds a class pixel the algorithm labels it and then examines its eight neighbors when it hits the image s edge in one direction it starts searching in other directions in a recursive process the surrounding pixels of each class pixel are considered if they fulfill the eight connected neighborhood criteria if they do they are added to the connected object and the process restarts until all the class pixels in the binary image are assigned to one of the connected objects after the clustering analysis the classes corresponding to water surface and exposed lined area need to be identified the world file corresponding to each geotiff image is also read to automatically extract the cell size of the corresponding image so that the area of the water body and exposed lined body can be calculated once these bodies are extracted spectral property at near infrared bands is usually useful information in identifying water bodies from other land surface types however these bands are not available in rgb images we proposed here to make use of other properties of water bodies and exposed lined area among natural surfaces 1 a water body is a connected object connectivity 2 water bodies have the maximum uniformness of all land types in the image and 3 exposed lined areas have the secondary maximum uniformness or of least root mean square rms rgb value that is defined as 3 rb g rms i 1 n c r i 2 g i 2 b i 2 n c where r g b are the pixel values corresponding to the rgb bands when the connected objects are filled with the original rgb values and n c is the pixel number of each connected object the connected objects found will then be filled with the gray values of luminance image l maximum uniformness mu is represented by the minimum of the average gradient magnitude per pixel among all connected objects in the luminance image l 4 mu min 1 n c i 1 n c l x i 2 l y i 2 where l x i and l y i are the directional gradients of luminance image l where positive x direction points in the direction of increasing column subscripts and positive y direction points in the direction of increasing row subscripts a connected object is a water body if it has mu among all connected objects once the water body is identified water area is the total number of pixel times the corresponding spatial resolution the exposed lined zone is considered to be secondary in mu or with the least rb g rms once the exposed lined zone is identified the area is calculated the same way as the water area 5 results and evaluation 5 1 water body and exposed lined area extraction the inputs to the algorithm developed are geotiff image files including the corresponding world files and the number of classes for the chrominance based k means cluster analysis images in the geotiff format can be inputs to the computer program since the extraction process can be automated the value of the lagrange multiplier λ in the denoising module was obtained λ 1 429 by calibration using the minimum difference between the extracted and measured areas of the big nose kate pond as the objective function see section 5 2 this value was used for the extraction of water area and area of exposed liner for all other ponds final outputs include binary images water area of a water body and area of the exposed lined area as optional fig 3 shows the sequential intermediate and final outputs during the retrieval of the water and exposed lined areas of each cbm pond taking the john wayne pond as an example as we can see in both the original rgb image and the image of exposed lined area the liner is broken in the north western part of the pond and the situation was reported to the pond maintainer summit gas resources inc test results using images of a single cbm pond in the montana powder river basin show that 1 chrominance based k mean clustering is useful to successfully separate water and exposed lined zones from other surface features 2 three is a good number of classes for the unsupervised classification resulting in accurate delineation of water bodies and exposed lined zones 3 a connected object is a water body when mu among all connected objects is used and 4 an exposed lined zone has mu secondary to a water body or has the least rms rgb value fig 4 shows the rgb images of the ten cbm ponds within the montana powder river basin the downloaded images were in jpeg format after georeferencing all images were converted to geotiff images each with a world file that contains the spatial resolution see table 2 for resolution values we can see that the spatial resolutions are within the range between 0 20 m and 0 34 m we kept the google earth logo appearing at the lower right corner of each image when it was downloaded however as shown below the logo does not affect the extraction of water area exposed lined area and delineation of water bodies and exposed lined zones fig 5 shows the output water surface images of the ten cbm ponds the output images are black and white images showing only the water surface pixels all ten water ponds were automatically extracted and the area of each was calculated extracted water area for each pond is shown in table 2 fig 6 shows the output images of the exposed lined zones corresponding to the ten cbm ponds as the water surface images the output images are in black and white with while pixels representing the exposed lined area there is no exposed lined area for the doc holiday 2 pond this pond may not have been lined for the other ponds the shapes of the exposed lined zone are clearly delineated the area of the exposed lined zone extracted for each pond is also shown in table 2 for the big nose kate pond there is not exposed line zone along the northern edge of the pond it may indicate that the liner may have been blown into the pond and sunk or just torn away the part of liner at the north west corner of the john wayne pond was also damaged and torn away these results show that the liner maintenance is needed for the big nose kate and john wayne ponds other lined ponds are in good state 5 2 algorithm evaluation comparison with in situ measurement to evaluate the performance of the algorithm we carried out differential gps surveys during a field campaign on july 14 16 2016 along the edges of four randomly chosen ponds big nose kate john wayne calamity jane and bronco billy using the survey type leica 1200 gps units as is shown in fig 7 there are only dirt roads leading to the ponds the distance between the ponds is long for instance the driving distance along the dirt road from big nose kate pond to the bronco billy pond is about 8 0 km to estimate the water area of each pond through gps surveys is very labor intensive this is why it is important to develop an efficient algorithm to quantify the pond area from high resolution rgb images each small circle denotes a gps waypoint along the edge of a pond at each pond a stationary base station was set up and the position data of the base station was logged in for a couple of hours the gps waypoints were collected using a kinetic rover gps waypoints were denser along curved segments and less dense along the linear segments so that the polygon formed by the gps waypoints is closer to the actual shape of the pond the design for the gps surveys was as follows for the big nose kate pond waypoints were taken along the water edge the measured water area should be equal to the extracted water area for the john wayne pond gps waypoints were taken at the water edge for the north and north east parts of the pond boundary while along the outer edge of the pond liner black belts surrounding water of the south and north west parts of the pond boundary so the measured area should be equal to the water area plus half of the lined area for the calamity jane and bronco billy ponds gps waypoints were taken along the outer edges of the pond liners that logistically were the easiest since the exposed lined area is generally steep and slippery the measured area should be equal to the water area plus the lined area for each of them the following describes the algorithm for measuring the area with gps waypoints given the coordinates of the three vertices of a triangle abc see fig 8 the area of the triangle abc is given by 5 area of δ a b c 1 2 ab bc where ab and bc are vectors formed from vertices a to b b to c respectively of the triangle abc this formula allows us to calculate the area of a triangle when we know the coordinates of the three vertices from which the two vectors ab and bc are formed the following shows how the area of a pond is calculated from the gps waypoints consider any shape of a pond as shown in fig 8 the close loop dashed line presents the real shape of the pond the polygon is formed from the assumed gps waypoints a b c h the more waypoints especially along curved segments the closer the polygon abdfhgeca represents the real shape of the pond if there are n waypoints on the closed loop there are n 2 non overlapping triangles the area of the first triangle is calculated by the vectors ab and bc that of the second triangle by the vectors bc and cd so on so forth each vector except for the first one ab and the last one gh will be used twice the area of the polygon is then the sum of all triangles the results are shown in the measured m2 column of tables 3 and 4 to compare the extracted water area from a rgb image and the gps measurement for each pond surveyed the absolute relative error are shown in the last column of tables 3 and 4 is defined as are measured e x t r a c t e d measured 100 the measured area shown in tables 3 and 4 may include the sum of water and the surrounding exposed lined area or partial of it depending on the survey design as described above the measured area of the big nose kate pond is 50 061 90 m2 the gps measurement was along the water edge thus the measured area is the water area the extracted water area from image is 50 617 81 m2 the are is 1 11 for the john wayne pond the measured area 23 538 59 m2 includes the water area plus half of the exposed lined area the corresponding area extracted from image is 23 501 75 m2 the are is 0 16 for the calamity jane pond the measured area 12 928 21 m2 includes the water area and the exposed lined area the corresponding area extracted from image is 13 101 70 m2 the are is 1 34 for the bronco billy pond the measured area 16 383 60 m2 includes both the water area and the exposed lined area the corresponding water area extracted from image is 16 824 45 m2 the are is 2 78 this detailed comparison demonstrates that the extracted water area from the rgb images agrees with the measured areas from the gps surveys within an are of 0 16 2 78 if the denoising component is not activated in the water body extraction results similar to table 3 are shown in table 4 comparing results of extracted area with denoising component active table 3 and inactive table 4 we can see that 1 the difference between the water areas extracted for the four ponds are between 0 04 m2 bronco billy and 95 57 m2 john wayne 2 the are error changed from 1 13 no denoising to 1 11 with denoising for the big nose kate pond from 0 56 to 0 16 for the john wayne pond from 1 03 to 1 34 for the calamity jane pond and no change both 2 78 for the bronco billy pond no big improvement when denoising module was activated was observed since the published google images are generally of high quality the noise level should be very low it is thus expected that the results with table 3 and without table 4 denoising are very similar however for input images that contain noise the situation can be quite different to further illustrate this we added gaussian noise to the image of wild bill hickock pond then we used the new algorithm with the noisy image as input to extract the wild bill hickock pond results with and without the denoising component activated are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively fig 9 shows the results of segmentation and extraction of the water pond with the denoising component activated the left image of the top row is the noisy image while the right one is the image of gaussian noise that was added to the original image producing the noisy image the second row is the three classes segmented by the k means method after the input image was denoised by the denoising component the third row is the images of the largest connected object in each class after the connected component analysis the fourth row is the image that has the maximum uniformness that is the water body we can see that for the input noisy image the water body was still successfully extracted but the extracted water area was less than that extracted from the original image that is supposed to be noise free see fig 12 this may be because some water pixels have been classified as non water pixel due to incomplete removal of the noise fig 10 shows the results of segmentation and extraction of the water pond when the denoising component was deactivated using the same noisy image as fig 9 as input we can see clearly that it failed to segment and extract the water body due to the noise comparing to the results fig 9 when the denoising component was active denoising is imperative in the case of noisy input image 5 3 algorithm evaluation inter algorithm comparison many image segmentation algorithms are available for image classification our algorithm is a multi component algorithm as an integrated package including denoising conversion of rgb to l a b color space image k means clustering separation of clusters classes based on images of cluster index finding the largest connected component in each class extraction of a water body as one of the connected objects is based on the minimum gradient in the luminance image as defined by eq 4 the algorithm for connected component analysis in each class is based only on binary images the color based segmentation algorithm as described at https www mathworks com help images examples color based segmentation using k means clustering html after rgb conversion to l a b color space and k means clustering can also be used for image segmentation we modified the matlab code at the website so that we can input our georeferenced geotiff images and ran it for all the ten images used in this study table 2 fig 11 shows the result of classification of the image of the wild bill hickock pond using the color based segmentation algorithm the top image is the original image as input the images of the second row from left to right are red green and blue classes segmented respectively the images of the bottom row from left to right are images of the red nuclei green nuclei and blue nuclei respectively each nuclei image represents the pixels of the corresponding color class that are within a certain range around the center of the class cluster the range is determined in this case by the threshold selection method developed by otsu 1979 we can see that using the color nuclei method we could not be able to segment the water body either we ran the code for all the ten images shown in table 2 out of the ten images the pond in each image can be within one of the three classes but none of the classes is uniquely the pond this means that the pond cannot be uniquely segmented if we just use the color based segmentation algorithm or equivalently the second and third components of our algorithm fig 2 i e conversion of rgb to l a b color space image followed by the k mean clustering on the other hand our algorithm performs connected component analysis after k mean clustering then the largest connected object in each class is found and separated water body is extracted from the separated objects based on the criteria that the gradient in the luminance should not exceed a threshold we tested all images shown in this study and some other images not shown and found that 1 for images with only one pond a threshold that equals the minimum gradient among the separated connected objects in all classes and 2 for images of more than one pond a threshold that equals the minimum gradient plus 5 is good enough to extract water bodies fig 12 shows the sequence of intermediate and final output images during the extraction of water area and exposed lined area using the image of the wild bill hickock pond as an example the second row shows the 3 classes after the k means clustering where the input number of classes was 3 the third row shows the largest connected component in each class after connected component analysis even after this step we cannot say which object is water or lined area the fourth row shows the water body that is the separated object that has the minimum gradient per pixel and the lined area that is the separated object that has the second minimum gradient per pixel or least root mean square rms rgb value up to this moment the water body and lined area were automatically extracted and the area of each was calculated 5 4 applicability to images of more than one pond for estimation of water area or exposed lined area from google earth true color images the image containing only one cbm pond is recommended for high spatial resolution and thus better accuracy in area estimation after connected component analysis the largest connected object in each class is found and separated water bodies are those separated objects whose spatial gradient per pixel does not exceed a threshold that equals the minimum gradient among the separated connected objects in all classes plus 5 this method works not only for images of a single pond but images of more than one pond the only requirement is that the number of classes needs to increase accordingly fig 13 shows a case of extraction of two ponds from an image that includes ponds doc holliday 1 doc holliday 2 see table 1 where the number of classes was set to 6 the first row from the top is the input image of two ponds the second row is the 6 classes after k means clustering and the third row is the largest connected object in each class and is thus separated objects the fourth row is the water bodies that satisfy the gradient condition the bottom row is the image with only water bodies this demonstrates that the new multi component algorithm can be used to extract water bodies from an image containing more than one pond the only difference from the water body extraction from images of a single pond is that the number of classes was doubled to 6 6 discussion and conclusions to extract water area from multispectral satellite images an image of at least one band of near infrared is usually used considering the specific characteristics of the near infrared band for water however for water area extraction of small artificial ponds or lakes multispectral or hyperspectral images available on the public domain do not have high enough spatial resolution so that water area can be extracted accurately on the other hand true color images with very high resolution are available from the commercial satellite images 1m and google earth rgb images resolution of 0 20 0 34 m and can be acquired from airborne platforms using a regular camera from a uas system high resolution 0 5 m google earth true color images provide useful resources for monitoring small artificial ponds or lakes the challenge is how to extract water pixels from a true color image in this study we developed a new multi component algorithm to extract water pixels and liner pixels for cbm ponds from regular true color rgb images and then applied the algorithm to extract water area and exposed lined area of the ten cbm ponds in the montana powder river basin the components in the algorithm include 1 denoising via iterative sparse and redundant representations over learned dictionaries 2 conversion from rgb images to l a b color images 3 unsupervised classification through chrominance based k means clustering analysis that is performed only in the chrominance images a and b 4 connected object identification 5 water body identification through connectivity and maximum uniformness that is critical in the successful separation of water surface from other surface features and 6 exposed lined zone identification through uniformness and least rms values of rgb rb g rms that is critical in the successful separation of the exposed lined areas from other natural features except for the first component that is optional for noise free images but imperative for noisy images all other components are essential in isolating water and exposed lined bodies and calculating the corresponding areas with the algorithm developed in this project we are able to extract water and exposed lined areas separately from regular true color images as we showed in figs 11 and 12 k means method can segment an image into classes the number of which is specified by a user water body belongs to one of the classes but not uniquely because the class corresponding to a water body also includes other pixels having the same or similar colorimetric information as the water pixels see the images of the second row of figs 11 12 therefore k means method alone cannot isolate the water body or the lined area since by itself it cannot tell which class is the water class and the water body does not usually belong to a unique class further isolation of water bodies has to be done either by the user interactively which makes it impossible to automate the procedure or by the computer through a new algorithm which makes automation or artificial intelligence possible the processes that follow the k means segmentation step in our algorithm are doing the later job to automatically isolate the water body these processes include the largest connected component analysis and spatial uniformness of the water reflectance within a single water body in summary the present algorithm makes use of both colorimetric and spatial distribution information of a water body in segmenting and isolating it automatically from regular rgb images we applied the algorithm to extract the water and exposed lined areas of all the cbm ponds in the montana powder river basin from the google earth rgb images the extracted water areas of four of them were compared with ground measurements using in situ differential gps surveys the absolute relative error is 0 16 2 78 from the comparison in summary 1 a novel multi component algorithm has been successfully developed to extract water area of a water body and exposed lined area from regular georeferenced rgb images 2 the algorithm was evaluated using ground gps measurements and found that the absolute relative errors are within the range of 0 16 2 78 which indicates that the developed algorithm can extract the water area and exposed lined area within reason accuracy 3 the water areas of all the cbm retention ponds in the montana powder river basin was estimated using the algorithm from high resolution google earth rgb images and 4 the advantage of this algorithm for water area extraction is that many free rgb images from satellite or any other platforms such as airplane or uas once georeferenced can be used for water area and cbm pond monitoring google earth imagery is a valuable resource for area estimation of surface features such as cbm ponds area and monitoring of exposed lined area especially for small artificial ponds reservoirs or lakes taking advantage of its high spatial resolution conflict of interest there is no

6613,the powder river basin in montana and wyoming supplies about 40 percent of coal in the united states in recent decades coalbed methane cbm extracted from coal beds has become an important source of energy in the united states and other countries cbm water is the produced water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction the use of cbm water from the powder river basin for irrigation is limited by its relatively high sodium adsorption ratio so the water has to be maintained in lined retention ponds the liners can be detached from the pond bed breached through normal weathering or from extreme weather events and can wear out with time water level changes due to constant and dynamic evaporation and precipitation of rainfalls and snowfalls and refilling by gas companies the objectives of this study are 1 to develop and validate a novel uniformness based multi component algorithm to quantify the areas of water and exposed not submerged in water liners of the retention ponds from regular red green blue rgb images and 2 to quantify the areas of water and liners of the cbm retention ponds in the powder river basin using high resolution true color images such as free google earth imagery the multi component algorithm is composed of a sequence of processes georeferencing denoising rgb to l a b color space transformation k mean clustering analysis intelligent identification of connected component in each class extraction of water body based on maximum uniformness extraction of exposed lined zones based on uniformness or least root mean square value of rgb and eventually calculation of water area and exposed line area application of the multi component algorithm to the cbm retention ponds in the powder river basin using high resolution true color images shows that the algorithm can extract accurately water area and the exposed area of liners from these images of high spatial resolution 0 20 0 34 m providing a useful tool to use regular rgb images as a resource for monitoring reservoirs lakes or artificial small ponds keywords feature extraction true color image denoising l a b color image chrominance based k mean clustering image

cleats or within the molecular structures of coal molecules during various coalification stages from lignite subbituminous coal bituminous coal to anthracite on geological time scales water permeates coal beds and its hydrostatic pressure helps to keep the methane within the coal cbm desorbs from the coal beds after water is withdrawn and the local pressure is reduced nuccio 2000 rice et al 2002 de bruin et al 2004 in recent decades technological advances have enabled the economic development of cbm stored in coal beds scientific understanding of the genesis of cbm and its production are both in the early learning stages though biogenic methane and thermogenic methane are two commonly accepted forms of methane formation rice and claypool 1981 rightmire 1984 de bruin et al 2004 geologic geochemical and hydrologic controls on coalbed methane generation migration distribution and recoverability along with environmental implications of developing cbm resource are yet to be investigated the powder river basin prb in montana and wyoming usa supplies about 40 percent of coal in the united states it covers an area of more than 61 000 square kilometers km2 in southern montana and northern wyoming in the powder river basin coal beds in the fort union formation at depths of 100 1000 m are the main source regions for coal bed gas development bartos and ogle 2002 since the late 1990 s cbm extracted from coal beds has become an important energy source in the united states for instance in 2016 alone 3 74 109 m3 cbm was produced in the powder river basin wyoming oil and gas conservation commission 2017 cbm water is the produced water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction water is produced in large volumes especially in the early stages of production and as the amount of water in the coal decreases gas production increases nuccio 2000 wheaton and brown 2005 approximately 143 135 581 barrels 22 756 777 80 m3 of cbm water were produced by 19 energy companies in the powder river basin in 2016 alone data provided by wyoming oil and gas conservation commission 2017 to produce the 3 74 109 m3 natural gas or on average 0 61 m3 cbm water was extracted per 100 m3 gas produced produced water is generally a sodium bicarbonate type with total dissolved solids in the range of 200 4 000 mg liter mg l and sodium adsorption ratios sar in the range of 5 6 69 0 rice et al 2002 bartos and ogle 2002 jackson and reddy 2007 healy et al 2011 sar is a measure of the concentration of sodium in water relative to the concentrations of calcium and magnesium water with an sar greater than 13 is undesirable for irrigation because soil structure can deteriorate as sodium replaces calcium and magnesium on clay particles soil survey laboratory 1995 mace and amrhein 2001 healy et al 2011 such large amounts of cbm water from the basin is thus limited for irrigation by its relatively high sar and has to be maintained in plastic lined retention ponds in an unlined impoundment cbm water will eventually infiltrate into ground water cbm water itself is not a primary source of solutes in groundwater near an unlined retention pond naturally occurring salts and minerals within the unsaturated zone dissolved and mobilized by infiltrating impoundment water account for most of the observed solute mass in groundwater healy et al 2011 since cbm water cannot be recharged into subsurface it has to be maintained in lined retention ponds refilling of the cbm water in these ponds depends on the water surface level that changes due to evaporation rainfall or snowfall events assuming no infiltration therefore an efficient monitoring tool is desirable to quantify the water area changes and to monitor whether the liner of lined ponds is in good shape seepage of water into the local groundwater system can occur if plastic liners are breached through normal weathering or from extreme weather events an automatic tool to extract water area and the exposed not submerged in water area of the liners of these ponds from high resolution satellite images or images acquired by a regular camera from an air borne system such as an unmanned aircraft system uas should serve this purpose well visual discrimination of water bodies from other land surfaces in a remote sensing image or regular picture per se is not a difficult task however accurate delineation of the boundary waterline and area estimation of a water body and exposed liners from an image by either eyes or a computer is not straight forward due to the transition zones at the boundary between different and cover types ryu et al 2002 maiti et al 2009 and the criteria of discriminating water liner pixels from pixels of other land surfaces algorithms on water body extraction from multispectral satellite images have been proposed and well verified work and gilmer 1976 white 1978 xu 2006 du et al 2012 ouma and tateishi 2006 sun et al 2012 pardo pascual et al 2012 tang et al 2013 li et al 2013 the main feature of these algorithms is that various water indices are defined using two or more bands to form an index so that water pixel is spectrally enhanced the spectral reflectance of at least one near infrared band is used taking advantage of its distinctly strong absorption in water than visible bands mcfeeters 1996 rogers and kearney 2004 xu 2006 ouma and tateishi 2006 lacaux et al 2007 feyisa et al 2014 wang et al 2015 automation for water pixel extraction in these algorithms is realized through thresholding of the water index values and thus these algorithms perform very efficiently in water body extraction some researchers used an ndvi threshold to segment lake area directly from an ndvi image assuming a pixel with ndvi value below the threshold e g 0 34 is water borro et al 2014 these algorithms are based on data from multi spectral imaging systems such as landsat imaging systems and large water bodies where hundreds and thousands of water pixels should be available otherwise the waterline cannot be accurately delineated however small artificial ponds such as the cbm water impoundments in prb are generally small in size compared to the spatial resolution of satellite images available on the public domain such as landsat images for instance the largest cbm pond in the montana prb is about 50 695 m2 about 56 water pixels within a landsat image spatial resolution 30 m while the smallest pond is 6213 m2 approximately only 7 pixels within a landsat image it is almost impossible to extract accurately water bodies as small as the artificial cbm ponds from the landsat images using the water index methods unless commercial multispectral satellite images with spatial resolution at or less than one meter are used if these image systems have the same near infrared bands for the verified water indices valuable resources of regular true color images that have extremely high resolution cm and are freely available cannot be used for water body delineation using the near infrared band based water index methods discussed above accurate measurement of water surface area and the exposed lined area of the cbm ponds in the powder river basin can provide important parameters for monitoring and management of these ponds however images of very high spatial resolution as high as tens of centimeters from google earth pro or pictures taken by a regular camera from a uas platform can be very useful for water body extraction and pond state monitoring the challenge is how to extract water pixels from regular red green blue rgb images since the rgb images from the google earth pro images formed from the rgb bands of satellite images or acquired by a regular camera have only three bands in the visible spectrum the objectives of this study are to develop an algorithm to extract water area and exposed lined area from a regular rgb image then to apply the algorithm to extract water area and area of exposed liners of the cbm ponds in the montana powder river basin from google earth pro images as case studies evaluation of the algorithm will be performed through differential global positioning system gps measurements along the boundary of some of the cbm ponds through a field campaign to summarize the novelty of this study is to develop an algorithm that automatically extracts water area and the exposed liner area of a cbm water pond from a regular rgb image in which case no useful spectral information from near infrared bands can be leveraged this is a challenging task and is very different from the literatures on water pixel extraction that is based on multispectral or hyperspectral images in which at least one band in the near infrared band is available for use feyisa et al 2014 and references therein also the algorithm will also extract automatically the pixels of exposed lined area to our knowledge there is not yet any algorithm available for automatic extraction of water body and the area of exposed lined area directly from a rgb image this study will also use the exposed lined area for state monitoring of the cbm ponds the characteristics that are used for automatic water and exposed liner pixel extraction from a rgb image include 1 a water body or lined area is a connected body in an image 2 the water body in an image is the largest and most homogeneous and or isotropic natural surface from which water area is to be extracted and 3 lined area is the second most homogeneous natural surface and its rgb pixel values are lower than water pixels which is the case for all cbm ponds in the prb the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we will discuss the characteristics of the study site in section 3 we will describe the data sources and data acquisition for this project in section 4 we will describe in details the development of the multi component algorithm for automatic extraction of water area and exposed lined area from rgb images results and evaluation of the algorithm will be given in section 5 discussion and conclusions are given in section 6 2 study site of cbm ponds the study site includes ten cbm water retention ponds in the big horn county montana powder river basin about 40 km to the northeast of sheridan wyoming usa fig 1 shows the study site the average temperature at sheridan is about 7 2 degrees celsius c average annual rainfall is 336 8 mm and average annual snowfall is 711 2 mm us climate data 2017 the study site is within the typical semiarid grasslands of the powder river basin there are ten retention ponds within the study site the pond names and approximate geographic locations of these ponds are shown in table 1 the ten impoundments were constructed in quaternary age unconsolidated deposits overlying tertiary age bedrock by summit gas resources inc of wyoming the pond names were given by the company too water is prevented from infiltrating into the ground water zone by lining the ponds evaporation is supposed to be the main depletion mechanism of the reduction of water level so that cbm water is refilled the company refills these ponds with cbm water to the possible water level for maximum evaporation the left panel in fig 1 shows the location of the powder river basin the top right panel shows a picture taken of the big nose kate pond the largest of the ten during a field campaign on july 14 16 2016 and the bottom right panel shows the locations of the ten cbm ponds in a google earth pro image 3 data sources and acquisition the longest side of the cbm ponds is 300 m that was estimated using the ruler tool of google earth pro thus multispectral satellite images available on the public domain such as landsat images do not have high enough resolution to monitor and estimate the areal coverage of these ponds thus we considered google earth pro true color images of cell size as high as tens of centimeters we followed the general guidelines of using google earth imagery https www google com permissions geoguidelines html general guidelines to download the google earth images high spatial resolution google images are mainly from commercial satellites or airborne orthogonal imagery google encourages creative applications of the google earth imagery and other google resources images in google earth pro can be exported up to 4 800 pixels wide for each pond we zoomed in to the pond image to make the pond as large as possible so that the spatial resolution is as high as possible then we used the add placemark tool to add a placemark as the ground control point the coordinates of the point were shown in the new placemark window we wrote down the coordinates for all ground control points and saved it as a separate file we used placemark circle symbol to denote the placemark where the coordinates of the center of the circle will be used for georeferencing of a downloaded jpeg image later in arcgis as many usually above 9 as possible placemarks were placed uniformly within the image to be downloaded once finishing the placement of ground control points the google earth image in jpeg format was downloaded the pixel number of each image is fixed thus the actual spatial resolution of the images downloaded is variable depending on the size of the pond that was zoomed in this spatial resolution only represents the pixel size of the downloaded image not the capacity of spatial resolution of the original image system that acquired the images all the borders labels placemark symbols icons and information that were seen on the screen showed up in the image that was saved from google earth georeferencing was carried out in arcgis for each image using the ground control points recorded above for each google earth image during downloading after georeferencing all images were converted to geotiff format from none geocoded true color images georeferenced images were projected to utm zone 13 n with wgs 84 as the datum a field campaign to the study site was made on july 14 16 2016 differential gps surveys of centimeter accuracy using the leica 1200 survey type units were carried out along the boundaries of four ponds randomly chosen for pond area measurement for each pond a stationary base gps station was set up using the base gps unit for a couple of hours at some point along the edge of the pond and a rover unit was used for waypoint data collection along the boundary of each pond based on the method described in section 5 2 that was used for pond area estimation from gps waypoints the more gps waypoints are collected along non linear segments of the pond boundary the more accurate the measured area will be therefore the greater the curvature of a segment is the more waypoints will be taken 4 algorithm development for automatic extraction of water area and exposed lined area fig 2 shows the flow chart of the algorithm of multiple components developed for the automatic extraction of water surface pixels and pixels of exposed lined zones from georeferenced images this is a batch processing procedure for each iteration an input image is firstly denoised then the denoised rgb image is converted to an l a b color space image followed by unsupervised classification based on k means clustering analysis using the chrominance a and b data connected objects in each class are then located and the connected object that has the minimum average gradient magnitude per pixel is identified as a water body based on the luminance image l the first component of the algorithm is denoising of the input image via iterative sparse and redundant representations over learned dictionaries i e given a noise containing image y the denoised image x is given by elad and aharon 2006 1a x λ i ij r ij t r ij 1 λ y ij r ij t d α ij in which the representation vectors α i j for each patch r ij x is computed by solving 1b ij min α ij α ij 0 s t r ij x d α ij 2 2 c σ 2 using any pursuit algorithm i is the unit matrix σ is the standard deviation of the additive zero mean gaussian white noise c is the noise gain a constant λ is the lagrange multiplier e g λ 30 σ d is an adaptive dictionary trained on patches from the noise containing image the notation α ij 0 stands for the count of the nonzero entries in α this component is optional but effective when the input image contains zero mean white and homogeneous gaussian additive noises if the input image does not contain any gaussian additive noises the output from this step is the same as the input the second component of the algorithm is image conversion from a rgb to an l a b color image the denoised standard rgb values are firstly converted to commission international d eclairage cie or international commission on illumination in english 1931 xyz values then converted to the 1976 cie l a b color space cie standard illuminant d65 was used as the reference white point which represents the average daylight illuminant the reason for this conversion before segmentation is that the rgb values such as those from the elements of a regular charge coupled device digital camera are light intensity dependent and redundant while the l a b color space is device independent and is color constant also the l a b color space has a much larger gamut than that of computer displays or human vision sharma and trussel 1997 hastings and rubin 2012 in the cie l a b color space l represents the luminance that closely matches human s perception of lightness l 0 represents the darkest black while l 100 represents the brightest white colors of the green red opponents are represented by the a axis with positive a indicating red and negative a indicating green colors of the yellow blue opponents are represented by the b axis with positive b indicating yellow and negative b indicating blue the a and b axes from the l a b space are orthogonal to each other the a and b components are then extracted for classification using only chrominance values offers a robust tool against variation in illumination intensity both in the time and spatial domains this means that image segmentation will be based only on the chromatic content of the color and the confusing impact of difference in ambient lighting conditions of images collected at different times on the segmentation will be mostly alleviated the third component of the algorithm is unsupervised classification or segmentation this is accomplished using the k means clustering analysis matoušek 2000 which partitions the observations in the two column chrominance matrix a and b each corresponds to a column into k clusters or classes of land surfaces we refer this as the chrominance based k mean clustering which is an iterative algorithm used to segment chrominance a and b matrices of m row by n column into k classes by minimizing the sum of the within cluster sums of pixel to cluster centroid squared euclidean distances over the k clusters to partition an n point set x r d into k classes g 1 g 2 g k where n m n and k are both integers we wish to find k cluster centroids c g i c g 2 c g k to minimize the potential function 2 φ i 1 k x g i min x c g i 2 during each iteration after the first one pixels are reassigned to their nearest cluster centroids cluster centroids are then recalculated the classification terminates when the minimum of the potential function i e when assigning any pixel to a different cluster increases the potential function or the preset maximum number of iterations is reached since there are limited k n possible classes the process will always automatically terminate for our case that classification was performed on the two column chrominance matrix n equals 2 the output was a vector containing the class indices of each pixel the classification procedure was duplicated multiple times each with a new set of initial centroids using several replicates with random starting points typically results in a solution that is a global minimum arthur and vassilvitskii 2007 if a cluster loses all of its member observations a new cluster consisting of the one observation furthest from its centroid will be created the fourth component of the algorithm is isolating connected objects in each class and finding the number of pixels of each connected object once the unsupervised classification is done classes will be separated into individual image files to identify the connected objects the image of each class is firstly converted to a binary image either 0 or 1 pixel values a pixel that belongs to the class is referred to as a class pixel that takes the value 1 whether a pixel is connected to another pixel of the same class is determined by the 8 way connectivity rule search starts from the beginning of the image once a class pixel is found it is labeled first then search for all contiguous pixels based on the 8 way connectivity rule use a region growing algorithm also called flood fill algorithm painter s algorithm or seed fill algorithm to label all the pixels in the connected components containing the pixel glassner 2001 nosal 2008 any time the 8 neighbor fill finds a class pixel the algorithm labels it and then examines its eight neighbors when it hits the image s edge in one direction it starts searching in other directions in a recursive process the surrounding pixels of each class pixel are considered if they fulfill the eight connected neighborhood criteria if they do they are added to the connected object and the process restarts until all the class pixels in the binary image are assigned to one of the connected objects after the clustering analysis the classes corresponding to water surface and exposed lined area need to be identified the world file corresponding to each geotiff image is also read to automatically extract the cell size of the corresponding image so that the area of the water body and exposed lined body can be calculated once these bodies are extracted spectral property at near infrared bands is usually useful information in identifying water bodies from other land surface types however these bands are not available in rgb images we proposed here to make use of other properties of water bodies and exposed lined area among natural surfaces 1 a water body is a connected object connectivity 2 water bodies have the maximum uniformness of all land types in the image and 3 exposed lined areas have the secondary maximum uniformness or of least root mean square rms rgb value that is defined as 3 rb g rms i 1 n c r i 2 g i 2 b i 2 n c where r g b are the pixel values corresponding to the rgb bands when the connected objects are filled with the original rgb values and n c is the pixel number of each connected object the connected objects found will then be filled with the gray values of luminance image l maximum uniformness mu is represented by the minimum of the average gradient magnitude per pixel among all connected objects in the luminance image l 4 mu min 1 n c i 1 n c l x i 2 l y i 2 where l x i and l y i are the directional gradients of luminance image l where positive x direction points in the direction of increasing column subscripts and positive y direction points in the direction of increasing row subscripts a connected object is a water body if it has mu among all connected objects once the water body is identified water area is the total number of pixel times the corresponding spatial resolution the exposed lined zone is considered to be secondary in mu or with the least rb g rms once the exposed lined zone is identified the area is calculated the same way as the water area 5 results and evaluation 5 1 water body and exposed lined area extraction the inputs to the algorithm developed are geotiff image files including the corresponding world files and the number of classes for the chrominance based k means cluster analysis images in the geotiff format can be inputs to the computer program since the extraction process can be automated the value of the lagrange multiplier λ in the denoising module was obtained λ 1 429 by calibration using the minimum difference between the extracted and measured areas of the big nose kate pond as the objective function see section 5 2 this value was used for the extraction of water area and area of exposed liner for all other ponds final outputs include binary images water area of a water body and area of the exposed lined area as optional fig 3 shows the sequential intermediate and final outputs during the retrieval of the water and exposed lined areas of each cbm pond taking the john wayne pond as an example as we can see in both the original rgb image and the image of exposed lined area the liner is broken in the north western part of the pond and the situation was reported to the pond maintainer summit gas resources inc test results using images of a single cbm pond in the montana powder river basin show that 1 chrominance based k mean clustering is useful to successfully separate water and exposed lined zones from other surface features 2 three is a good number of classes for the unsupervised classification resulting in accurate delineation of water bodies and exposed lined zones 3 a connected object is a water body when mu among all connected objects is used and 4 an exposed lined zone has mu secondary to a water body or has the least rms rgb value fig 4 shows the rgb images of the ten cbm ponds within the montana powder river basin the downloaded images were in jpeg format after georeferencing all images were converted to geotiff images each with a world file that contains the spatial resolution see table 2 for resolution values we can see that the spatial resolutions are within the range between 0 20 m and 0 34 m we kept the google earth logo appearing at the lower right corner of each image when it was downloaded however as shown below the logo does not affect the extraction of water area exposed lined area and delineation of water bodies and exposed lined zones fig 5 shows the output water surface images of the ten cbm ponds the output images are black and white images showing only the water surface pixels all ten water ponds were automatically extracted and the area of each was calculated extracted water area for each pond is shown in table 2 fig 6 shows the output images of the exposed lined zones corresponding to the ten cbm ponds as the water surface images the output images are in black and white with while pixels representing the exposed lined area there is no exposed lined area for the doc holiday 2 pond this pond may not have been lined for the other ponds the shapes of the exposed lined zone are clearly delineated the area of the exposed lined zone extracted for each pond is also shown in table 2 for the big nose kate pond there is not exposed line zone along the northern edge of the pond it may indicate that the liner may have been blown into the pond and sunk or just torn away the part of liner at the north west corner of the john wayne pond was also damaged and torn away these results show that the liner maintenance is needed for the big nose kate and john wayne ponds other lined ponds are in good state 5 2 algorithm evaluation comparison with in situ measurement to evaluate the performance of the algorithm we carried out differential gps surveys during a field campaign on july 14 16 2016 along the edges of four randomly chosen ponds big nose kate john wayne calamity jane and bronco billy using the survey type leica 1200 gps units as is shown in fig 7 there are only dirt roads leading to the ponds the distance between the ponds is long for instance the driving distance along the dirt road from big nose kate pond to the bronco billy pond is about 8 0 km to estimate the water area of each pond through gps surveys is very labor intensive this is why it is important to develop an efficient algorithm to quantify the pond area from high resolution rgb images each small circle denotes a gps waypoint along the edge of a pond at each pond a stationary base station was set up and the position data of the base station was logged in for a couple of hours the gps waypoints were collected using a kinetic rover gps waypoints were denser along curved segments and less dense along the linear segments so that the polygon formed by the gps waypoints is closer to the actual shape of the pond the design for the gps surveys was as follows for the big nose kate pond waypoints were taken along the water edge the measured water area should be equal to the extracted water area for the john wayne pond gps waypoints were taken at the water edge for the north and north east parts of the pond boundary while along the outer edge of the pond liner black belts surrounding water of the south and north west parts of the pond boundary so the measured area should be equal to the water area plus half of the lined area for the calamity jane and bronco billy ponds gps waypoints were taken along the outer edges of the pond liners that logistically were the easiest since the exposed lined area is generally steep and slippery the measured area should be equal to the water area plus the lined area for each of them the following describes the algorithm for measuring the area with gps waypoints given the coordinates of the three vertices of a triangle abc see fig 8 the area of the triangle abc is given by 5 area of δ a b c 1 2 ab bc where ab and bc are vectors formed from vertices a to b b to c respectively of the triangle abc this formula allows us to calculate the area of a triangle when we know the coordinates of the three vertices from which the two vectors ab and bc are formed the following shows how the area of a pond is calculated from the gps waypoints consider any shape of a pond as shown in fig 8 the close loop dashed line presents the real shape of the pond the polygon is formed from the assumed gps waypoints a b c h the more waypoints especially along curved segments the closer the polygon abdfhgeca represents the real shape of the pond if there are n waypoints on the closed loop there are n 2 non overlapping triangles the area of the first triangle is calculated by the vectors ab and bc that of the second triangle by the vectors bc and cd so on so forth each vector except for the first one ab and the last one gh will be used twice the area of the polygon is then the sum of all triangles the results are shown in the measured m2 column of tables 3 and 4 to compare the extracted water area from a rgb image and the gps measurement for each pond surveyed the absolute relative error are shown in the last column of tables 3 and 4 is defined as are measured e x t r a c t e d measured 100 the measured area shown in tables 3 and 4 may include the sum of water and the surrounding exposed lined area or partial of it depending on the survey design as described above the measured area of the big nose kate pond is 50 061 90 m2 the gps measurement was along the water edge thus the measured area is the water area the extracted water area from image is 50 617 81 m2 the are is 1 11 for the john wayne pond the measured area 23 538 59 m2 includes the water area plus half of the exposed lined area the corresponding area extracted from image is 23 501 75 m2 the are is 0 16 for the calamity jane pond the measured area 12 928 21 m2 includes the water area and the exposed lined area the corresponding area extracted from image is 13 101 70 m2 the are is 1 34 for the bronco billy pond the measured area 16 383 60 m2 includes both the water area and the exposed lined area the corresponding water area extracted from image is 16 824 45 m2 the are is 2 78 this detailed comparison demonstrates that the extracted water area from the rgb images agrees with the measured areas from the gps surveys within an are of 0 16 2 78 if the denoising component is not activated in the water body extraction results similar to table 3 are shown in table 4 comparing results of extracted area with denoising component active table 3 and inactive table 4 we can see that 1 the difference between the water areas extracted for the four ponds are between 0 04 m2 bronco billy and 95 57 m2 john wayne 2 the are error changed from 1 13 no denoising to 1 11 with denoising for the big nose kate pond from 0 56 to 0 16 for the john wayne pond from 1 03 to 1 34 for the calamity jane pond and no change both 2 78 for the bronco billy pond no big improvement when denoising module was activated was observed since the published google images are generally of high quality the noise level should be very low it is thus expected that the results with table 3 and without table 4 denoising are very similar however for input images that contain noise the situation can be quite different to further illustrate this we added gaussian noise to the image of wild bill hickock pond then we used the new algorithm with the noisy image as input to extract the wild bill hickock pond results with and without the denoising component activated are shown in fig 9 and fig 10 respectively fig 9 shows the results of segmentation and extraction of the water pond with the denoising component activated the left image of the top row is the noisy image while the right one is the image of gaussian noise that was added to the original image producing the noisy image the second row is the three classes segmented by the k means method after the input image was denoised by the denoising component the third row is the images of the largest connected object in each class after the connected component analysis the fourth row is the image that has the maximum uniformness that is the water body we can see that for the input noisy image the water body was still successfully extracted but the extracted water area was less than that extracted from the original image that is supposed to be noise free see fig 12 this may be because some water pixels have been classified as non water pixel due to incomplete removal of the noise fig 10 shows the results of segmentation and extraction of the water pond when the denoising component was deactivated using the same noisy image as fig 9 as input we can see clearly that it failed to segment and extract the water body due to the noise comparing to the results fig 9 when the denoising component was active denoising is imperative in the case of noisy input image 5 3 algorithm evaluation inter algorithm comparison many image segmentation algorithms are available for image classification our algorithm is a multi component algorithm as an integrated package including denoising conversion of rgb to l a b color space image k means clustering separation of clusters classes based on images of cluster index finding the largest connected component in each class extraction of a water body as one of the connected objects is based on the minimum gradient in the luminance image as defined by eq 4 the algorithm for connected component analysis in each class is based only on binary images the color based segmentation algorithm as described at https www mathworks com help images examples color based segmentation using k means clustering html after rgb conversion to l a b color space and k means clustering can also be used for image segmentation we modified the matlab code at the website so that we can input our georeferenced geotiff images and ran it for all the ten images used in this study table 2 fig 11 shows the result of classification of the image of the wild bill hickock pond using the color based segmentation algorithm the top image is the original image as input the images of the second row from left to right are red green and blue classes segmented respectively the images of the bottom row from left to right are images of the red nuclei green nuclei and blue nuclei respectively each nuclei image represents the pixels of the corresponding color class that are within a certain range around the center of the class cluster the range is determined in this case by the threshold selection method developed by otsu 1979 we can see that using the color nuclei method we could not be able to segment the water body either we ran the code for all the ten images shown in table 2 out of the ten images the pond in each image can be within one of the three classes but none of the classes is uniquely the pond this means that the pond cannot be uniquely segmented if we just use the color based segmentation algorithm or equivalently the second and third components of our algorithm fig 2 i e conversion of rgb to l a b color space image followed by the k mean clustering on the other hand our algorithm performs connected component analysis after k mean clustering then the largest connected object in each class is found and separated water body is extracted from the separated objects based on the criteria that the gradient in the luminance should not exceed a threshold we tested all images shown in this study and some other images not shown and found that 1 for images with only one pond a threshold that equals the minimum gradient among the separated connected objects in all classes and 2 for images of more than one pond a threshold that equals the minimum gradient plus 5 is good enough to extract water bodies fig 12 shows the sequence of intermediate and final output images during the extraction of water area and exposed lined area using the image of the wild bill hickock pond as an example the second row shows the 3 classes after the k means clustering where the input number of classes was 3 the third row shows the largest connected component in each class after connected component analysis even after this step we cannot say which object is water or lined area the fourth row shows the water body that is the separated object that has the minimum gradient per pixel and the lined area that is the separated object that has the second minimum gradient per pixel or least root mean square rms rgb value up to this moment the water body and lined area were automatically extracted and the area of each was calculated 5 4 applicability to images of more than one pond for estimation of water area or exposed lined area from google earth true color images the image containing only one cbm pond is recommended for high spatial resolution and thus better accuracy in area estimation after connected component analysis the largest connected object in each class is found and separated water bodies are those separated objects whose spatial gradient per pixel does not exceed a threshold that equals the minimum gradient among the separated connected objects in all classes plus 5 this method works not only for images of a single pond but images of more than one pond the only requirement is that the number of classes needs to increase accordingly fig 13 shows a case of extraction of two ponds from an image that includes ponds doc holliday 1 doc holliday 2 see table 1 where the number of classes was set to 6 the first row from the top is the input image of two ponds the second row is the 6 classes after k means clustering and the third row is the largest connected object in each class and is thus separated objects the fourth row is the water bodies that satisfy the gradient condition the bottom row is the image with only water bodies this demonstrates that the new multi component algorithm can be used to extract water bodies from an image containing more than one pond the only difference from the water body extraction from images of a single pond is that the number of classes was doubled to 6 6 discussion and conclusions to extract water area from multispectral satellite images an image of at least one band of near infrared is usually used considering the specific characteristics of the near infrared band for water however for water area extraction of small artificial ponds or lakes multispectral or hyperspectral images available on the public domain do not have high enough spatial resolution so that water area can be extracted accurately on the other hand true color images with very high resolution are available from the commercial satellite images 1m and google earth rgb images resolution of 0 20 0 34 m and can be acquired from airborne platforms using a regular camera from a uas system high resolution 0 5 m google earth true color images provide useful resources for monitoring small artificial ponds or lakes the challenge is how to extract water pixels from a true color image in this study we developed a new multi component algorithm to extract water pixels and liner pixels for cbm ponds from regular true color rgb images and then applied the algorithm to extract water area and exposed lined area of the ten cbm ponds in the montana powder river basin the components in the algorithm include 1 denoising via iterative sparse and redundant representations over learned dictionaries 2 conversion from rgb images to l a b color images 3 unsupervised classification through chrominance based k means clustering analysis that is performed only in the chrominance images a and b 4 connected object identification 5 water body identification through connectivity and maximum uniformness that is critical in the successful separation of water surface from other surface features and 6 exposed lined zone identification through uniformness and least rms values of rgb rb g rms that is critical in the successful separation of the exposed lined areas from other natural features except for the first component that is optional for noise free images but imperative for noisy images all other components are essential in isolating water and exposed lined bodies and calculating the corresponding areas with the algorithm developed in this project we are able to extract water and exposed lined areas separately from regular true color images as we showed in figs 11 and 12 k means method can segment an image into classes the number of which is specified by a user water body belongs to one of the classes but not uniquely because the class corresponding to a water body also includes other pixels having the same or similar colorimetric information as the water pixels see the images of the second row of figs 11 12 therefore k means method alone cannot isolate the water body or the lined area since by itself it cannot tell which class is the water class and the water body does not usually belong to a unique class further isolation of water bodies has to be done either by the user interactively which makes it impossible to automate the procedure or by the computer through a new algorithm which makes automation or artificial intelligence possible the processes that follow the k means segmentation step in our algorithm are doing the later job to automatically isolate the water body these processes include the largest connected component analysis and spatial uniformness of the water reflectance within a single water body in summary the present algorithm makes use of both colorimetric and spatial distribution information of a water body in segmenting and isolating it automatically from regular rgb images we applied the algorithm to extract the water and exposed lined areas of all the cbm ponds in the montana powder river basin from the google earth rgb images the extracted water areas of four of them were compared with ground measurements using in situ differential gps surveys the absolute relative error is 0 16 2 78 from the comparison in summary 1 a novel multi component algorithm has been successfully developed to extract water area of a water body and exposed lined area from regular georeferenced rgb images 2 the algorithm was evaluated using ground gps measurements and found that the absolute relative errors are within the range of 0 16 2 78 which indicates that the developed algorithm can extract the water area and exposed lined area within reason accuracy 3 the water areas of all the cbm retention ponds in the montana powder river basin was estimated using the algorithm from high resolution google earth rgb images and 4 the advantage of this algorithm for water area extraction is that many free rgb images from satellite or any other platforms such as airplane or uas once georeferenced can be used for water area and cbm pond monitoring google earth imagery is a valuable resource for area estimation of surface features such as cbm ponds area and monitoring of exposed lined area especially for small artificial ponds reservoirs or lakes taking advantage of its high spatial resolution conflict of interest there is no

6614,intermediate water disturbance in the form of overflow of surface water and changes in the depth of groundwater may help to accelerate restoration of degraded riparian forest ecosystems in extremely arid areas and enhance the resistance of those ecosystems to drought to test this possibility we selected the lower reaches of the tarim river in china to analyse monitoring data on vegetation and hydrology spanning a 16 year period and a 100 year data record of tree rings in populus euphratica the results suggested that ecological water conveyance can restore degraded desert riparian forest ecosystems in the early stages of restoration the interval between two overflows should not be longer than 3 years intermediate disturbance 1 2 overflows a year each lasting 21 30 days proved conducive to the formation of a plant community that is both diverse and stable thereby supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis both p euphratica and tamarix chinensis adopt suitable strategies for using groundwater from different depths to adapt to drought based on these results appropriate disturbance modes related to both surface water and groundwater are proposed for the restoration and conservation of desert riparian forest ecosystems under varying intensities of drought these modes offer scientific guidance on more efficient use of water and on ecosystem management in similar areas around the world keywords intermediate water disturbance drought stress overflow of surface water depth of groundwater desert riparian forest 1 introduction in arid river basins water is the most important environmental factor to guarantee the structural integrity and functional stability of the ecosystem yinglan et al 2018 barkaoui et al 2017 campos et al 2013 fang et al 2018a b as the main component of ecosystems in the arid inland river basins of central asia e g the rivers tarim heihe amu darya and syr darya desert riparian forests are near the top of the pyramid of natural plant communities in the process of natural succession of basin vegetation under a temperate desert climate ding et al 2017 thevs et al 2008b changes in desert riparian forest ecosystems also affect hydrological processes bleby et al 2010 prieto et al 2012 therefore finding out how desert riparian forests respond to hydrological processes and the mutual feedback mechanisms have become a hot topic in research on ecosystem restoration and conservation in arid areas schilling et al 2014 due to global warming terrestrial ecosystems in arid areas have been suffering from increasingly severe more frequent and longer lasting droughts campos et al 2013 han et al 2018 perry et al 2012 prudhomme et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 desert riparian forests are a unique ecosystem and their formation and existence depends on the supply of groundwater and soil moisture derived from river runoff from glaciers chen et al 2017 however global warming induces an initial increase and subsequent decline in runoff owing to the extensive reduction in glacier areas and the decreasing river runoff exacerbates droughts cauvy fraunie et al 2016 pohl et al 2017 thayyen and gergan 2010 van tiel et al 2018 in addition water needed for restoring desert riparian forests is recently being used in excessive quantities in inland river basins of arid areas glenn et al 2017 merritt and bateman 2012 rumbaur et al 2015 such unfavourable factors mean that long term drought stress on desert riparian forests will not be completely reversed yet another consequence of global warming is higher evapotranspiration which leads to water shortages perry et al 2012 and in turn even more severe ecological degradation of desert riparian forests it was against this background that the present research was initiated seeking answers to two questions 1 how to achieve rapid restoration of degraded riparian forest ecosystems in extreme arid areas 2 how to enhance the resistance of desert riparian forest ecosystems to drought stress in extreme arid areas in restoring desert riparian forest ecosystems river overflow could make the environment more favourable for germination of seeds that constitute the ecosystem s seed banks and for seedling establishment mainly through better circulation of soil nutrients and alleviating stress in the form of drought and high concentrations of salts capon and brock 2006 garssen et al 2015 thevs et al 2008a b xu et al 2009 the impact of water conservancy projects on regional ecosystems and the important role of overflow in restoring degraded ecosystems have been analysed andersen et al 2007 pohl 2002 xu et al 2008 herbaceous plants are known to be more sensitive to overflow than trees and shrubs because seeds of many herbs can germinate after even a single overflow event whereas those of trees and shrubs require many such events for germination xu et al 2009 other studies capon and brock 2006 grimoldi et al 1999 simpson et al 2013 have shown that the duration and frequency of overflows constrain the degree to which the vegetation responds to restoration efforts however lack of long term data and insufficient quantification of the duration and frequency of overflows have been major impediments to elucidating the lasting impacts of overflows on succession in plant communities moreover many studies bornette and amoros 1996 capon and reid 2016 trémolières 2004 have also reported such succession in areas less affected by overflows and proposed that overflow disturbances of intermediate intensity are most likely to increase biodiversity this has led to many attempts to restore biodiversity using intermediate levels of disturbance however research on how to establish the dominant or constructive species drought resistant plants that form the core of a plant community in restoring species diversity is relatively scarce different forms of desert riparian vegetation deploy different strategies of using water to adapt to drought for example most annual herbs seek to escape drought whereas tree shrubs and some perennial herbs adapt to drought by developing more extensive and deeper root systems to access soil moisture from greater depths fan et al 2017 hao et al 2010a yu et al 2013 it is therefore crucial to maintain a suitable depth of groundwater in protecting desert riparian forest ecosystems that suitable depth varies depending on the ecological and physiological changes that the constructive species such as populus euphratica and tamarix chinensis of those ecosystems undergo at different depths of groundwater chen et al 2004 hao et al 2010b however from the perspectives of ecological conservation and restoration a suitable depth has been determined in a few cases by using joint surface water groundwater disturbance among different forms that make up a plant community and the different water use strategies they deploy under different intensities of drought to seek answers to the two questions posed above and after reviewing earlier research on the topic we proposed the following hypothesis intermediate water disturbance is beneficial to the formation and maintenance of desert riparian forest ecosystems and to combat aridification to test this hypothesis we selected an area that was representative of such an ecosystem in the lower reaches of the tarim river fig 1 and analysed the effects of the duration and frequency of overflows on the restoration of riparian vegetation by examining 16 years of monitoring data on vegetation and hydrology the results of the study offer scientific guidance on more efficient use of water and on ecosystem management to promote stable and well developed desert riparian forest ecosystems in similar areas around the world 2 selection of region for research the tarim river basin 34 20 43 39 n 71 39 93 45 e measuring 1 02 106 km2 encompasses nine major river systems and 144 rivers that encircle the basin the average annual run off of the basin is 3 98 1010 m3 derived mainly from glacial melt and precipitation the tarim river with a total length of 1321 km is the longest inland river in china however excessive use of water has severely degraded the ecosystem of the desert riparian forest since 1972 when the lower reaches of the tarim river were cut off from it ling et al 2016 the area under p euphratica continues to shrink the ecosystem continues to deteriorate and the rump lake taitma lake of the tarim river basin has dried up to restore and conserve the desert riparian p euphratica forest the chinese government invested 10 7 billion yuan on a project of ecological water conveyance engineering in 2000 mainly to divert water from the kongque river to fill the taitma lake fig 1 the fundamental purpose of the project was ecosystem protection as a result of ecological water conveyance in the lower reaches both banks of the river overflowed with surface water the depth of groundwater decreased and the degraded p euphratica forest recovered to some extent chen et al 2004 fig s1 at present the area has become not only one of the most typical regions worldwide in which human disturbance has resulted in severe damage to the ecosystem but also a site in the world where human intervention has also sought to restore the degraded ecosystem with remarkable results ling et al 2016 therefore the lower reaches of the tarim river can be regarded as an ideal test site for research on ecological conservation and restoration the ecological water conveyance process lasted for 1670 days during april 2000 to november 2015 and the total volume of water thus conveyed was 51 0 108 m3 fig s1 the years 2000 2006 were marked by a wet season with 22 5 108 m3 of water conveyed over 892 days with the water flowing into the taitma lake the years 2007 2009 were dry years with 0 2 108 m3 of water conveyed over 70 days with the water flowing onto the transects in karday the years 2010 2015 were once again marked by a wet season and the total volume was 4 8 108 m3 although the conveyance lasted only for 10 days in 2014 amounting to 0 1 108 m3 the daily ecological water conveyance maximum occurred in 2015 583 5 m3 day and the minimum occurred in 2006 346 6 m3 day the study area spread over 2190 km2 lies below the daxihaizi reservoir in the lower reaches of the tarim river fig 1 the area is adjacent to the taklamakan desert which is characterized by high temperatures and little rainfall annual precipitation in the area is 17 4 42 0 mm and annual potential evaporation as high as 2500 3000 mm annual accumulated daily temperature 10 c is 4100 4300 c day thus the area is one of the driest areas in china and the growth of vegetation depends almost entirely on groundwater replenishment trees in the tarim river basin are mainly p euphratica shrubs mainly t chinensis halostachys caspica and alhagi sparsifolia and herbs mainly phragmites australis glycyrrhiza apocynum venetum and karelinia caspica p euphratica is distributed along both banks of the tarim river and the plant community is one of the rarest ones in the arid areas of asia and possibly worldwide 3 data resources and methods we used the area of taitma lake ascertained from the data from remote sensing images tree ring width index from the tree ring data of p euphratica and the ratio of surface water transferred to groundwater and to soil water from isotope sampling of surface water groundwater and soil water verified the restoration of the degraded ecosystems as a result of ecological water conveyance from hydrological data and then put forward the necessity of further regulating water disturbance from an overflow experiment from vegetation quadrat monitoring data we analysed the plant community succession laws defined the threshold of intervals between overflows and presented an intermediate disturbance mode for vegetation restoration we also used stable isotopes from isotope labelled samples of groundwater soil water and plants to determine the water sources exploited by the two dominant species p euphratica and t chinensis at different groundwater depths pooling the results of the above analyses we inferred the strategies deployed by the desert riparian vegetation to adapt to water disturbance finally a combination of surface water and groundwater disturbance modes was proposed for protecting and restoring degraded desert riparian forest ecosystems fig 2 3 1 data resources the hydrological data used in this research included 1 the amount of water released and the duration over which it was released over the course of the 16 years 2000 2015 when ecological water conveyance was practised in the lower reaches of the tarim river and 2 groundwater depths during 2000 2016 from 30 monitoring wells perpendicular to the river channel and 50 m 150 m 300 m 500 m 750 m and 1050 m away from it these hydrological data were monitored and provided by the hydrographic bureau of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region the hydrological monitoring authority in china and the tarim river basin authority the area of taitma lake was ascertained from remote sensing images data from the landsat multispectral scanner mss resolution 57 m from 1972 to 1979 from september to november each year and from the landsat thematic mapper tm or enhanced thematic mapper etm at a resolution of 30 m from 1989 to 2015 the area of taitma lake was determined by adopting the visual interpretation process kappa coefficients 0 7 which meet the standard of precision test tchebakova et al 2009 and using arcgis ver 10 3 the data on vegetation during 2001 2016 included the vegetation survey comprising 50 overflow experiment areas and 536 vegetation quadrats and 8 tree ring cores of 100 year old p euphratica 1913 2012 acquired in 2013 within 50 1000 m from the river because trees within this range are most sensitive to changes in the depth of groundwater and to ecological water conveyance two cores from each tree were taken using the cross intersect method holmes 1983 fritts 1976 in 2016 652 isotope samples were taken and analysed of which 24 were from surface water 22 from groundwater and 483 from soil water 60 from p euphratica and 63 from t chinensis isotope sampling of surface water groundwater soil water and plants was carried out as follows 1 sampling of surface water surface water samples were taken from 30 cm below the surface of the water the sampling points were 15 km apart and two samples were taken from each sampling point from august to october during the ecological water conveyance in the lower reaches of the tarim river in 2016 2 sampling of groundwater groundwater samples were taken at the same time as the surface water samples water samples were taken from one well each in the four monitoring transects of yingsu karday algan and yganbjm two samples were collected from each monitoring well 3 sampling of soil water soil samples were collected around the monitoring wells to extract soil moisture soil sampling stratification and profile depths at different sampling points were different the sampling interval for the 0 100 cm soil layer was 20 cm that for the 100 250 cm soil layer was 30 cm that for the layer beyond 250 cm was 50 cm two samples were collected from each depth 4 sampling of plants three plants each of p euphratica height 9 15 m diameter at breast height 18 25 cm and t chinensis height 2 4 m basal diameter 5 8 cm were selected from the area surrounding the groundwater monitoring wells and at a distance of 500 1050 m from the river way areas without overflow disturbance from each plant three suberified stems were collected 0 3 0 5 mm in diameter and 3 5 cm long the cortex and the phloem were removed whereas the xylem was kept intact these plant samples for the isotope test were placed in 20 ml penicillin bottles sealed with parafilm stored in ice boxes during the transit to the laboratory and frozen at 20 c until used in the isotope assay 3 2 methods 3 2 1 calculating the tree ring width index we selected eight adult p euphratica trees from the algan to yganbjm transect in the lower reaches of the tarim river to sample the tree rings we used an increment borer to remove cores from two points along the vertical dimension height of the tree from the trunk of each tree a total of 16 sample cores of p euphratica in august 2013 the samples were then numbered and processed i e pasted fixed polished and then cross dated by following the standard procedures for tree ring samples holmes 1983 fritts 1976 the width was measured using a lintabtm 6 tree ring measuring instrument rinntech heidelberg germany precision of 0 001 mm and for cross dating and growth correction the software package cofecha cook 1985 a quality control program was used to ensure the accuracy of cross dating to eliminate the influence of the age of a tree on the radial growth of its trunk a standardized tree ring width index was calculated using another program arstan cook 1997 this index sequence eliminated the effect of self growth on tree ring width and highlighted the role of environmental factors 3 2 2 standardization of data the data were handled by dimensionless standardization in order to guarantee the comparability of the data sequence at different magnitudes e g tree ring width index and the area of taitma lake the formula is shown in eq 1 1 y i x i x min x max x min where yi is a standardized data sequence in the range 0 1 xi is the value of the ith datum in the sequence xmin is the minimum value in the sequence and xmax is the maximum value in the sequence yi was calculated using spss statistical product and service solutions 3 2 3 calculating the river conversion ratio we set sampling transects along the river course according to the locations of the hydrological monitoring transects and groundwater monitoring wells to sample river water groundwater and soil water and then measured the δ 18o values of the samples we estimated the proportion of river water in groundwater based on the principle of mass conservation zhang et al 2005 as shown in eq 2 2 c s q s c g q g c b q s q g where cs is the δ18o value of river water at the sampling points cg is the δ18o value of groundwater at the sampling points cb is the δ18o value of water from the upper reaches of the river qs is the water flow at the sampling points and qg is the amount of river water that replenished the groundwater stocks therefore the proportion percentage of groundwater replenished by the river flow was as shown in eq 3 3 f q g q s 100 c s c b c g c b 100 similarly the conversion ratio of river water to soil water is shown in eq 4 4 f s c r c ur c s c ur 100 and the conversion ratio of groundwater to soil water is shown in eq 5 5 f g c g c r c s c r 100 where cr is the δ 18o value of the river water at the sampling points cur is the δ 18o value at the upper reaches of the river cg is the δ 18o value of groundwater at the sampling points and cs is the δ 18o value of soil water 3 2 4 determining the sources of water we collected branches of p euphratica and t chinensis as samples from trees in the no overflow areas at locations that differed in the depth of groundwater based on the isotope ratios in the samples and the isosource model we estimated the proportions of soil water and groundwater in the water used by the plants the model is based on the principle of isotope mass balance and we used it for iterative calculations and initially determined the ratios in increments of 1 or 2 subsequently we established all possible combinations of potential water sources and their respective proportions in the total 100 next we calculated the isotope indicator value for each possible combination and compared it to the isotopic ratios of the plant samples if the results were the same or within the acceptance range of mass balance 0 1 the contribution of each potential water source to the plant was obtained phillips and gregg 2003 3 2 5 overflow experiment an overflow experiment was set up mainly along the 11 transects near the river fig 1 with 50 plots and 536 quadrats and the depth of groundwater was less than 4 m the frequency and the duration of the overflow were divided based on the overflow situation observed in the field into different gradients this exercise led to three grades of overflow disturbance table 1 once every 2 3 years once or twice a year and more than twice a year the duration of the overflow was divided into four categories 1 10 days 11 20 days 21 30 days and more than 30 days based on these categories 3 5 vegetation survey quadrats were set up at random in the plots that represented different frequencies and durations of overflow the plots measured 1 m 1 m for herbs 5 m 5 m for shrubs and 20 m 20 m for trees this was followed by a detailed survey of the vegetation and of the seedlings bank which recorded many parameters including the species composition the number of plants their height and diameter at breast height dbh crown width extent of area covered the density of vegetation and the number height density and mortality of seedlings the aim was to find the dynamic characteristics of plant communities as affected by the differences in the frequency and duration of the overflow importance values iv were chosen to characterize the importance of plants in community succession based on the results of the field survey xu et al 2009 importance value is a comprehensive value that represents the relative importance of a given plant species in the community and was calculated as shown in eq 6 simpson 1949 curtis and mcintosh 1951 6 iv dr c r h r 3 where dr cr and hr are the relative density relative coverage and relative height respectively expressed as percentages and calculated as follows dr quantity of one species total quantity of all species 100 cr coverage of one species total coverage of the plot 100 hr total height of one species total height of all plants 100 in addition the shannon wiener index and margalef index were calculated to reflect the changes in species diversity xu et al 2009 there are two characteristics of diversity species richness and uniformity ma et al 1995 pointed out that the shannon weiner index has a close relationship with species richness and margalef index is a common index which has a close relationship with species uniformity margalef 1963 gamito 2010 simpson s index is sensitive to the dominant species i e dominance which is similar to the importance value hunter and gaston 1988 magurran 1988 4 results and analyses 4 1 threshold of intervals between overflows for vegetation restoration as can be seen in fig 3 a in the first 1 3 years after one overflow for 10 20 days the importance value of trees and shrubs increased significantly but began to decline steeply from the 4th year the importance value of annual herbs decreased by 84 3 in the first 1 3 years and reached 0 in the 4th year whereas the importance value of perennial herbs increased by 73 3 in the 4th year compared to that in the 3rd year and then changed little from the 5th year to the 7th year in the case of the importance values of the main species in the 3rd and 4th years after the overflow fig s2 the importance value of p euphratica a tree decreased by 79 9 and that of t chinensis a shrub decreased by 43 9 whereas that of k caspica glycyrrhiza and p australis all perennial herbs increased by 81 3 18 7 and 87 3 respectively in the 3rd year t chinensis had the greatest importance value followed by that of k caspica p euphratica p australis and glycyrrhiza but halogeton glomeratus and salsola collina both annual herbs had the lowest importance values in the 4th year k caspica had the greatest importance value followed by that of t chinensis p australis glycyrrhiza and p euphratica whereas h glomeratus and s collina disappeared altogether as to the species diversity in the lower reaches of the tarim river fig 3 b the shannon wiener index showed a highly significant decrease 27 1 at the 0 01 level in the 2nd year and in the 3rd year after the overflow and then decreased by 18 2 at the 0 05 level in the 3rd year and in the 4th year whereas the margalef index decreased by 40 3 at the 0 01 level after the 3rd year the shannon wiener index and the margalef index of the overflow areas were not significantly different from those of the non overflow areas which means that the diversity after the overflow had decreased to that of the non overflow level these analyses showed that to promote stable and diverse plant communities with tree and shrub species as the main constitutive species the interval between two consecutive overflows should be 2 years and never more than 3 years at the early stage of restoration of desert riparian vegetation this also provides a theoretical basis for setting a gradient of one overflow in 2 3 years for the experiment involving surface water overflow table 1 4 2 appropriate overflow disturbance for ecosystem restoration in the present experiment a combination of low frequency of overflow once in 2 3 years and short duration 1 10 days referred to as f1t1 in fig 4 a led to the formation of a plant community in which k caspica was the dominant species with the greatest importance value fig s3 and table s1 after more than 7 years of the overflow experiment in the combinations involving low frequency and longer durations 11 20 days or f1t2 fig 4 b and 21 30 days or f1t3 fig 4 c the importance value of perennial herbs decreased by 8 3 whereas that of the trees and shrubs increased by 18 7 in the combination involving low frequency and the longest duration more than 30 days or f1t4 fig 4 d the importance value of perennial herbs increased by 51 3 because the importance value of p australis increased on account of the extended duration of the overflow moreover mean values of the shannon wiener index and margalef index under f1t3 were the greatest after more than 7 years fig 4 c at the next higher frequency of overflow namely once or twice a year the importance value of perennial herbs was greater than that of trees shrubs and annual herbs after more than 7 years when the duration of overflow was 1 10 days f2t1 fig 5 a however compared to the values under f1t1 fig s3 the importance value of k caspica decreased by 45 7 of p australis by 22 2 of h glomeratus by 10 6 and of s collina by 5 8 whereas the importance value of p euphratica increased by 1537 4 of t chinensis by 2037 9 and of glycyrrhiza by 44 7 at the same frequency of overflow 1 2 per year but with longer duration namely 11 20 days f2t2 fig 5 b the importance value of trees and of shrubs was significantly greater than that of the perennial herbs at 0 05 level the same pattern was seen when the duration was 21 30 days f2t3 fig 5 c except that the difference was significant at the 0 01 level when combined with the longest duration of overflow namely more than 30 days f2t4 fig 5 d the importance value of perennial herbs was significantly greater than that of trees or shrubs because the importance value of p australis increased by 1200 0 and that of glycyrrhiza by 67 6 when compared to the values under f2t3 the importance value of p euphratica decreased by 58 4 and that of t chinensis decreased by 40 2 fig s3 in particular the mean value of shannon wiener index under f2t3 was 26 6 greater than that under f2t2 and the corresponding increase in margalef index was 14 6 because the importance value of trees and shrubs increased by 9 6 under f2t3 therefore the combination of intermediate frequency and longer duration f2t3 of overflow proved better than that of intermediate frequency and shorter duration f2t2 because the former resulted in a more diverse plant community in which the constructive species comprised trees and shrubs table s1 at the highest frequency more than twice a year of overflow combined with short duration f3t1 fig 6 a the importance value of annual herbs was significantly greater than that of perennial herbs trees and shrubs after 1 3 years of the treatment after 4 5 years the importance value of trees and shrubs was the greatest and a community of k caspica formed after 6 years table s1 when the highest frequency was combined with intermediate duration f3t2 fig 6 b which resulted in higher levels of water the importance value of perennial herbs with k caspica as the constructive species decreased whereas that of trees and shrubs increased when the highest frequency of overflow was combined with longer duration namely 21 30 days f3t3 fig 6 c the community structure became dominated by p australis the constructive species after 7 years table s1 and the importance value of trees and shrubs increased by 20 0 compared to that under f3t2 lastly when the duration exceeded 30 days f3t4 fig 6 d the importance value of k caspica was 39 8 lower than that under f2t4 and that of glycyrrhiza was 35 3 lower after 7 years whereas the importance value of p australis was higher by 129 1 of h glomeratus higher by 19 0 and of s collina higher by 16 2 fig s3 therefore the herbaceous community formed under f3t4 consisted mainly of p australis table s1 and it was this community that was predominantly distributed in the area surrounding the daxihaizi reservoir and taitma lake with an ample water supply 4 3 water source of the constructive species of desert riparian forest ecosystem in the lower reach of the tarim river the critical groundwater depth for both p euphratica and t chinensis is about 5 m chen et al 2004 xu et al 2008 when groundwater depth was less than the critical depth fig 7 a groundwater depth 3 9 m the root systems of p euphratica and t chinensis were distributed mainly near the deeper layer closer to groundwater and the two species mostly used soil water in the 300 400 cm layer soil water accounted for 28 2 of the water used by p euphratica and for 23 9 of that used by t chinensis and groundwater for 56 6 of the total in p euphratica and 63 2 in t chinensis despite any increase in the depth of groundwater fig 7 b groundwater depth 4 5 m p euphratica and t chinensis continued to tap soil water from the 400 500 cm layer which was closer to groundwater soil water met 29 3 of the total requirements of p euphratica and 29 4 of those of t chinensis the corresponding figures for groundwater being 37 7 and 38 9 however the average contribution of soil water from the 300 400 cm layer decreased to 20 5 in p euphratica and 19 9 in t chinensis in particular as drought stress intensified fig 7 c groundwater depth 6 2 m the contribution from the 0 100 cm layer increased to 33 2 in p euphratica and 26 1 in t chinensis significantly greater than the contribution from the same layer when groundwater depth was greater than 4 5 m 5 discussion 5 1 necessity of regulating water disturbance ecological water conveyance supports the growth of desert riparian vegetation by recharging groundwater replenishing soil water and overflowing the stable isotope studies in the lower reaches showed that 44 5 of surface water was converted into groundwater and 42 6 into soil water combined with hydrological data and the water balance principle we estimated that 4 9 was used for overflow outside the channel and 8 0 either evaporated from within the channel or flowed into the rump lake as the conveyance continued fig s1 the level of groundwater continued to rise and the ecosystem developed continuously hao et al 2010b rumbaur et al 2015 xu et al 2008 however going back over 100 years 1913 2012 the tree ring index of p euphratica offered further insights into the restoration of degraded ecosystems in the lower reaches of the tarim river spearman s correlation test was conducted on the standardized values of the tree ring index and the correlation between the index and the area of taitma lake rump lake was significant r 2 0 621 p 0 024 0 05 fig s4 the condition of taitma lake is linked to the penetration of the tarim river basin by the river system and the extent of its completeness if the lake has ample water then so does the entire ecosystem in the lower reaches of the tarim river therefore in the lower reaches of the tarim river changes in the growth of p euphratica as judged by tree rings can be used as a reliable index of the health of the ecosystem as can be seen in fig s4 the average value of p euphratica rings was 0 0847 during the period through which the river flow had been cut off from 1972 to 1999 and decreased by 63 4 before the cut off period from 1913 to 1971 however the average value of the tree ring index increased by only 40 1 after the ecological water conveyance therefore although the ecological water conveyance promoted the growth of p euphratica the growth rate did not reach the level that existed before the cut off period indicating that the degraded ecosystem in the lower reaches of the tarim river is yet to be restored fully that is to the level before the cut off thus to facilitate ecosystem restoration in the lower reaches of the tarim river it is necessary to optimize the degree of water disturbance caused by ecological water conveyance this approach can be extended to other similar areas around the world especially to many river basins in central asia for ecosystem restoration and protection 5 2 adaptation strategies of desert riparian vegetation to water disturbance in degraded desert riparian forest ecosystems surface overflow is a major disturbance that promotes the restoration of vegetation andersen et al 2007 bateman et al 2012 xu et al 2009 after one overflow fig 3 from the 4th year to the 7th year perennial herbs had the greatest importance values the reason was the accumulation of salt in surface soil which aggravated soil aridity seeds of the annual herbs failed to germinate under those conditions nor did their seedlings survive xu et al 2003 however seedlings of perennial herbs such as k caspica were more resistant to drought and had greater tolerance to salt than the seedlings of p euphratica jia and an 2004 xu et al 2009 some earlier studies bornette and amoros 1996 capon and brock 2006 garssen et al 2015 grimoldi et al 1999 simpson et al 2013 have shown that the duration and the intensity frequency of floods determine the composition of plant communities and the distribution of species our experiment on overflow disturbance figs 4 6 and table s1 after more than 7 years of overflow showed that disturbances that take the form of infrequent and short overflows such as f1t1 and f1t2 lead to the formation of a community in which k caspica is the constructive species whereas disturbances comprising more frequent and longer lasting overflows such as f3t3 and f3t4 lead to the formation of a community in which p australis is the constructive species the analyses also showed that the duration of overflow had greater influence than its frequency on plant community succession our research showed that when overflows were less frequent and lasted longer f1t4 the result was a community led by p australis whereas with more frequent but shorter overflows f3t1 and f3t2 the community was led by k caspica in the present research intermediate disturbance was represented by f2t2 and f2t3 following which the plant community would evolve and finally become a community in which the constructive species would be p euphratica and t chinensis both of which recorded the highest importance values shannon wiener index and margalef index under f2t3 this indicated that the disturbance caused by one or two overflows a year each lasting for 21 30 days promoted the formation of a desert riparian forest ecosystem that was both diverse and highly resistant to drought a conclusion that supported the intermediate disturbance hypothesis ideally these overflows should be carried out from june to september to coincide with the period of germination and vigorous growth of the desert riparian vegetation ling et al 2016 a suitable depth of groundwater is the most crucial controlling factor to ensure the stability of a desert riparian forest ecosystem hao et al 2010b bateman et al 2012 in our study the yearly average precipitation was less than 40 mm whereas the evaporation was greater than 2500 mm thus natural rainfall had almost no ecological effect on the growth of vegetation chen et al 2004 hao et al 2010a in addition a study dawson and ehleringer 1991 indicated that trees growing close to the banks of a steam do not use stream water directly ecological water demand of the desert riparian forest depended only on groundwater and soil water in the lower reaches of tarim river owing to the absence of any disturbance from surface water overflow and precipitation in the area over which the depth of groundwater was monitored these changes fig 7 in the adaptive strategies of p euphratica and t chinensis could be attributed to hydraulic redistribution of the root system yu et al 2013 yuan et al 2012 to resist drought roots of both species used hydraulic redistribution to transport soil water and groundwater from the deeper layers to the surface layer conserved that water overnight and used it the next day yu et al 2013 yuan et al 2012 this mechanism improved water use efficiency earlier studies si et al 2007 yuan et al 2012 have shown that fine roots diameters less than 2 mm of p euphratica and t chinensis are distributed mainly in the surface layer 0 120 cm and the distribution of roots is significantly correlated to soil water content the main role of fine roots is to absorb water and nutrients from soil a function that would have been seriously impaired by the scarcity of moisture in the surface layer as a consequence of drought thus hydraulic redistribution is a physiological mechanism to keep the surface layer moist so that fine roots continue to discharge their role unimpaired during the growing season hydraulic redistribution by p euphratica roots contributed 14 6 113 04 to transpiration the average value was 38 75 the corresponding values for t chinensis roots were 10 46 53 33 and 19 44 yu 2013 5 3 combined disturbance to surface water and groundwater desert riparian forest vegetation needs overflow for germination and a suitable groundwater depth for growth garssen et al 2015 hao et al 2010b xu et al 2009 to make desert riparian forest ecosystems more resistant to drought a combined disturbance to surface water and groundwater is needed for restoration and conservation of the ecosystem fig 8 this study has shown that the likely outcome of more frequent and longer lasting overflows fig 6 is a plant community with p australis as the constructive species fig 8 s1 that species is likely to suffer with many of its members dying off if the groundwater level recedes below the critical value more than 3 m and the entire community would disappear fig 8 s2 if the groundwater depth is more than 5 m xu et al 2008 the likely outcome of infrequent and short duration overflows fig 4 is a plant community with k caspica as the constructive species fig 8l1 and many of its members would die fig 8 l2 if the groundwater depth is more than 6 m which is the critical depth for drought xu et al 2008 the likely outcome of overflow that is intermediate in terms of both frequency and duration f2t3 is the recovery of the degraded desert riparian forest and a stable plant community of trees shrubs and both perennial and annual herbs with p euphratica and t chinensis as its main members fig 8 i1 for such a result groundwater depth should be maintained at 2 4 m hao et al 2010b however transpiration would be much greater in that situation because of the proximity of groundwater to the surface layer and because of the extensive growth of vegetation therefore in arid areas where water is extremely scarce groundwater depth should be increased to save water fig 9 community diversity of desert riparian forest begins to decline when groundwater depth is 4 m and the herbaceous members begin to die when groundwater depth is 5 5 m han 2014 populus euphratica and t chinensis will use soil water and groundwater when groundwater depth is less than 5 m fig 7 for efficient use of water and for stable functioning of an ecosystem a groundwater depth of 4 5 m would be reasonable fig 8 i2 the frequency of overflow of surface water should be set at once every 2 3 years fig 3 to promote the germination of the seeds and growth of herbs and that overflow frequency should be sustained for a duration of 21 30 days f1t3 fig 4 to maintain species diversity of the plant community fig 9 hydraulic redistribution is an important physiological mechanism by which desert riparian forests adapt to drought hao et al 2010a yu et al 2013 when groundwater depth is 5 7 m the critical value for drought fig 8 i3 both p euphratica and t chinensis transport soil water and groundwater from the deeper layers to the surface layer through hydraulic redistribution which ensures maximum water to combat drought fig 7 d hydraulic redistribution is also conducive to the formation of a plant community hydraulic redistribution by p euphratica for example promotes germination and growth in herbaceous members of the plant community hao et al 2010a however hydraulic redistribution also leads to the water table receding deeper if groundwater is not replenished fig 8 i4 thereby intensifying drought and as a consequence severe degradation of the desert riparian forest ecosystem a similar situation has also been observed in other regions jackson et al 2000 showed that hydraulic redistribution resulted in groundwater depth increasing by 16 33 when drought persists for a long time in the amazon forest hydraulic lifting increases evapotranspiration and soil moisture reaches the wilting point faster thereby favouring dry deciduous trees at the cost of evergreen trees wang et al 2011 therefore groundwater depth can be maintained at 5 7 m figs 8 i3 and 9 if a desert riparian forest ecosystem is suffering from drought so long as the source of groundwater is stable if water disturbance is used for reducing the depth of groundwater from 5 7 m to 4 5 m for example and the frequency of overflow is once in 2 3 years the desert riparian forest ecosystem can be effectively restored and protected fig 9 if the depth of groundwater increases to 7 9 m the death threshold for plants xu et al 2008 and drought continues to intensify the desert riparian forest ecosystem would be severely degraded such as that in the lower reaches of the tarim river before ecological water conveyance and we should take recourse to frequent and longer overflows f2t3 for example and reduction in the depth of groundwater so that it is only 2 4 m deep to rebuild and restore the plant community fig 9 thus controlled disturbance of both surface water and groundwater by regulating the frequency and duration of overflows fig 9 to match the intensity of drought and taking into account the composition of the plant community and its strategy of water use can promote the conservation and restoration of desert riparian forest ecosystems in arid areas such an approach also offers theoretical guidance and serves as a scientific basis for sustainable management of ecosystems in similar areas in other parts of the world 6 conclusions ecological water conveyance has provided abundant water for the protection and restoration of a desert riparian forest ecosystem the water thus supplied accounts for 44 5 of groundwater and 42 6 of soil water and 4 9 of the water conveyance is used for overflow in the lower reaches of the tarim river the degraded desert riparian forest ecosystem has been restored to some extent in the early stage of the efforts to restore a desert riparian forest ecosystem the interval between two successive overflows should be no more than 3 years because the effect of the duration of overflow on succession in a plant community is stronger than that of the frequency of overflow the combined effect of these two attributes should be exploited in regulating the extent of disturbance through overflow to promote the formation of two communities one dominated by p australis favoured by greater disturbance and the other dominated by k caspica which is less resistant to drought and is favoured by smaller disturbance a level of disturbance that is intermediate secured through 1 2 overflows a year each lasting 21 30 days f2t3 leads to a plant community with maximum diversity in which the constructive species are mainly trees and shrubs a result that supports the intermediate disturbance hypothesis proper depth of groundwater is the key to stable desert riparian forest ecosystems when the depth is less than the critical value for drought p euphratica and t chinensis mainly use soil water and groundwater from the deeper layers when the depth is greater than the critical value the two species mainly use soil water from the surface layer brought to it by means of hydraulic redistribution an important physiological mechanism by which plants maximize water use during drought we therefore propose that the mechanism of joint disturbance to surface water and groundwater be used regulated as required to deal with droughts of varying intensity in the early stages of the efforts to restore desert riparian forest ecosystems combining one or two overflows each lasting 21 30 days the depth of groundwater will decrease from more than 7 m to 2 4 m after that stage to protect the ecosystem and to use water more efficiently the depth should be maintained at 4 5 m and the frequency of surface overflow reduced to once every 2 to 3 years for optimal results each overflow should last 21 30 days if the drought is severe the depth can be maintained at 5 7 m to avoid serious damage to the ecosystem at that depth hydraulic distribution can make up for the ecological water deficit to some extent our analysis thus offers theoretical guidance for faster restoration of degraded desert riparian ecosystems and for making them more resistant to drought declaration of interests the authors report no conflicts of

6614,intermediate water disturbance in the form of overflow of surface water and changes in the depth of groundwater may help to accelerate restoration of degraded riparian forest ecosystems in extremely arid areas and enhance the resistance of those ecosystems to drought to test this possibility we selected the lower reaches of the tarim river in china to analyse monitoring data on vegetation and hydrology spanning a 16 year period and a 100 year data record of tree rings in populus euphratica the results suggested that ecological water conveyance can restore degraded desert riparian forest ecosystems in the early stages of restoration the interval between two overflows should not be longer than 3 years intermediate disturbance 1 2 overflows a year each lasting 21 30 days proved conducive to the formation of a plant community that is both diverse and stable thereby supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis both p euphratica and tamarix chinensis adopt suitable strategies for using groundwater from different depths to adapt to drought based on these results appropriate disturbance modes related to both surface water and groundwater are proposed for the restoration and conservation of desert riparian forest ecosystems under varying intensities of drought these modes offer scientific guidance on more efficient use of water and on ecosystem management in similar areas around the world keywords intermediate water disturbance drought stress overflow of surface water depth of groundwater desert riparian forest 1 introduction in arid river basins water is the most important environmental factor to guarantee the structural integrity and functional stability of the ecosystem yinglan et al 2018 barkaoui et al 2017 campos et al 2013 fang et al 2018a b as the main component of ecosystems in the arid inland river basins of central asia e g the rivers tarim heihe amu darya and syr darya desert riparian forests are near the top of the pyramid of natural plant communities in the process of natural succession of basin vegetation under a temperate desert climate ding et al 2017 thevs et al 2008b changes in desert riparian forest ecosystems also affect hydrological processes bleby et al 2010 prieto et al 2012 therefore finding out how desert riparian forests respond to hydrological processes and the mutual feedback mechanisms have become a hot topic in research on ecosystem restoration and conservation in arid areas schilling et al 2014 due to global warming terrestrial ecosystems in arid areas have been suffering from increasingly severe more frequent and longer lasting droughts campos et al 2013 han et al 2018 perry et al 2012 prudhomme et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 desert riparian forests are a unique ecosystem and their formation and existence depends on the supply of groundwater and soil moisture derived from river runoff from glaciers chen et al 2017 however global warming induces an initial increase and subsequent decline in runoff owing to the extensive reduction in glacier areas and the decreasing river runoff exacerbates droughts cauvy fraunie et al 2016 pohl et al 2017 thayyen and gergan 2010 van tiel et al 2018 in addition water needed for restoring desert riparian forests is recently being used in excessive quantities in inland river basins of arid areas glenn et al 2017 merritt and bateman 2012 rumbaur et al 2015 such unfavourable factors mean that long term drought stress on desert riparian forests will not be completely reversed yet another consequence of global warming is higher evapotranspiration which leads to water shortages perry et al 2012 and in turn even more severe ecological degradation of desert riparian forests it was against this background that the present research was initiated seeking answers to two questions 1 how to achieve rapid restoration of degraded riparian forest ecosystems in extreme arid areas 2 how to enhance the resistance of desert riparian forest ecosystems to drought stress in extreme arid areas in restoring desert riparian forest ecosystems river overflow could make the environment more favourable for germination of seeds that constitute the ecosystem s seed banks and for seedling establishment mainly through better circulation of soil nutrients and alleviating stress in the form of drought and high concentrations of salts capon and brock 2006 garssen et al 2015 thevs et al 2008a b xu et al 2009 the impact of water conservancy projects on regional ecosystems and the important role of overflow in restoring degraded ecosystems have been analysed andersen et al 2007 pohl 2002 xu et al 2008 herbaceous plants are known to be more sensitive to overflow than trees and shrubs because seeds of many herbs can germinate after even a single overflow event whereas those of trees and shrubs require many such events for germination xu et al 2009 other studies capon and brock 2006 grimoldi et al 1999 simpson et al 2013 have shown that the duration and frequency of overflows constrain the degree to which the vegetation responds to restoration efforts however lack of long term data and insufficient quantification of the duration and frequency of overflows have been major impediments to elucidating the lasting impacts of overflows on succession in plant communities moreover many studies bornette and amoros 1996 capon and reid 2016 trémolières 2004 have also reported such succession in areas less affected by overflows and proposed that overflow disturbances of intermediate intensity are most likely to increase biodiversity this has led to many attempts to restore biodiversity using intermediate levels of disturbance however research on how to establish the dominant or constructive species drought resistant plants that form the core of a plant community in restoring species diversity is relatively scarce different forms of desert riparian vegetation deploy different strategies of using water to adapt to drought for example most annual herbs seek to escape drought whereas tree shrubs and some perennial herbs adapt to drought by developing more extensive and deeper root systems to access soil moisture from greater depths fan et al 2017 hao et al 2010a yu et al 2013 it is therefore crucial to maintain a suitable depth of groundwater in protecting desert riparian forest ecosystems that suitable depth varies depending on the ecological and physiological changes that the constructive species such as populus euphratica and tamarix chinensis of those ecosystems undergo at different depths of groundwater chen et al 2004 hao et al 2010b however from the perspectives of ecological conservation and restoration a suitable depth has been determined in a few cases by using joint surface water groundwater disturbance among different forms that make up a plant community and the different water use strategies they deploy under different intensities of drought to seek answers to the two questions posed above and after reviewing earlier research on the topic we proposed the following hypothesis intermediate water disturbance is beneficial to the formation and maintenance of desert riparian forest ecosystems and to combat aridification to test this hypothesis we selected an area that was representative of such an ecosystem in the lower reaches of the tarim river fig 1 and analysed the effects of the duration and frequency of overflows on the restoration of riparian vegetation by examining 16 years of monitoring data on vegetation and hydrology the results of the study offer scientific guidance on more efficient use of water and on ecosystem management to promote stable and well developed desert riparian forest ecosystems in similar areas around the world 2 selection of region for research the tarim river basin 34 20 43 39 n 71 39 93 45 e measuring 1 02 106 km2 encompasses nine major river systems and 144 rivers that encircle the basin the average annual run off of the basin is 3 98 1010 m3 derived mainly from glacial melt and precipitation the tarim river with a total length of 1321 km is the longest inland river in china however excessive use of water has severely degraded the ecosystem of the desert riparian forest since 1972 when the lower reaches of the tarim river were cut off from it ling et al 2016 the area under p euphratica continues to shrink the ecosystem continues to deteriorate and the rump lake taitma lake of the tarim river basin has dried up to restore and conserve the desert riparian p euphratica forest the chinese government invested 10 7 billion yuan on a project of ecological water conveyance engineering in 2000 mainly to divert water from the kongque river to fill the taitma lake fig 1 the fundamental purpose of the project was ecosystem protection as a result of ecological water conveyance in the lower reaches both banks of the river overflowed with surface water the depth of groundwater decreased and the degraded p euphratica forest recovered to some extent chen et al 2004 fig s1 at present the area has become not only one of the most typical regions worldwide in which human disturbance has resulted in severe damage to the ecosystem but also a site in the world where human intervention has also sought to restore the degraded ecosystem with remarkable results ling et al 2016 therefore the lower reaches of the tarim river can be regarded as an ideal test site for research on ecological conservation and restoration the ecological water conveyance process lasted for 1670 days during april 2000 to november 2015 and the total volume of water thus conveyed was 51 0 108 m3 fig s1 the years 2000 2006 were marked by a wet season with 22 5 108 m3 of water conveyed over 892 days with the water flowing into the taitma lake the years 2007 2009 were dry years with 0 2 108 m3 of water conveyed over 70 days with the water flowing onto the transects in karday the years 2010 2015 were once again marked by a wet season and the total volume was 4 8 108 m3 although the conveyance lasted only for 10 days in 2014 amounting to 0 1 108 m3 the daily ecological water conveyance maximum occurred in 2015 583 5 m3 day and the minimum occurred in 2006 346 6 m3 day the study area spread over 2190 km2 lies below the daxihaizi reservoir in the lower reaches of the tarim river fig 1 the area is adjacent to the taklamakan desert which is characterized by high temperatures and little rainfall annual precipitation in the area is 17 4 42 0 mm and annual potential evaporation as high as 2500 3000 mm annual accumulated daily temperature 10 c is 4100 4300 c day thus the area is one of the driest areas in china and the growth of vegetation depends almost entirely on groundwater replenishment trees in the tarim river basin are mainly p euphratica shrubs mainly t chinensis halostachys caspica and alhagi sparsifolia and herbs mainly phragmites australis glycyrrhiza apocynum venetum and karelinia caspica p euphratica is distributed along both banks of the tarim river and the plant community is one of the rarest ones in the arid areas of asia and possibly worldwide 3 data resources and methods we used the area of taitma lake ascertained from the data from remote sensing images tree ring width index from the tree ring data of p euphratica and the ratio of surface water transferred to groundwater and to soil water from isotope sampling of surface water groundwater and soil water verified the restoration of the degraded ecosystems as a result of ecological water conveyance from hydrological data and then put forward the necessity of further regulating water disturbance from an overflow experiment from vegetation quadrat monitoring data we analysed the plant community succession laws defined the threshold of intervals between overflows and presented an intermediate disturbance mode for vegetation restoration we also used stable isotopes from isotope labelled samples of groundwater soil water and plants to determine the water sources exploited by the two dominant species p euphratica and t chinensis at different groundwater depths pooling the results of the above analyses we inferred the strategies deployed by the desert riparian vegetation to adapt to water disturbance finally a combination of surface water and groundwater disturbance modes was proposed for protecting and restoring degraded desert riparian forest ecosystems fig 2 3 1 data resources the hydrological data used in this research included 1 the amount of water released and the duration over which it was released over the course of the 16 years 2000 2015 when ecological water conveyance was practised in the lower reaches of the tarim river and 2 groundwater depths during 2000 2016 from 30 monitoring wells perpendicular to the river channel and 50 m 150 m 300 m 500 m 750 m and 1050 m away from it these hydrological data were monitored and provided by the hydrographic bureau of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region the hydrological monitoring authority in china and the tarim river basin authority the area of taitma lake was ascertained from remote sensing images data from the landsat multispectral scanner mss resolution 57 m from 1972 to 1979 from september to november each year and from the landsat thematic mapper tm or enhanced thematic mapper etm at a resolution of 30 m from 1989 to 2015 the area of taitma lake was determined by adopting the visual interpretation process kappa coefficients 0 7 which meet the standard of precision test tchebakova et al 2009 and using arcgis ver 10 3 the data on vegetation during 2001 2016 included the vegetation survey comprising 50 overflow experiment areas and 536 vegetation quadrats and 8 tree ring cores of 100 year old p euphratica 1913 2012 acquired in 2013 within 50 1000 m from the river because trees within this range are most sensitive to changes in the depth of groundwater and to ecological water conveyance two cores from each tree were taken using the cross intersect method holmes 1983 fritts 1976 in 2016 652 isotope samples were taken and analysed of which 24 were from surface water 22 from groundwater and 483 from soil water 60 from p euphratica and 63 from t chinensis isotope sampling of surface water groundwater soil water and plants was carried out as follows 1 sampling of surface water surface water samples were taken from 30 cm below the surface of the water the sampling points were 15 km apart and two samples were taken from each sampling point from august to october during the ecological water conveyance in the lower reaches of the tarim river in 2016 2 sampling of groundwater groundwater samples were taken at the same time as the surface water samples water samples were taken from one well each in the four monitoring transects of yingsu karday algan and yganbjm two samples were collected from each monitoring well 3 sampling of soil water soil samples were collected around the monitoring wells to extract soil moisture soil sampling stratification and profile depths at different sampling points were different the sampling interval for the 0 100 cm soil layer was 20 cm that for the 100 250 cm soil layer was 30 cm that for the layer beyond 250 cm was 50 cm two samples were collected from each depth 4 sampling of plants three plants each of p euphratica height 9 15 m diameter at breast height 18 25 cm and t chinensis height 2 4 m basal diameter 5 8 cm were selected from the area surrounding the groundwater monitoring wells and at a distance of 500 1050 m from the river way areas without overflow disturbance from each plant three suberified stems were collected 0 3 0 5 mm in diameter and 3 5 cm long the cortex and the phloem were removed whereas the xylem was kept intact these plant samples for the isotope test were placed in 20 ml penicillin bottles sealed with parafilm stored in ice boxes during the transit to the laboratory and frozen at 20 c until used in the isotope assay 3 2 methods 3 2 1 calculating the tree ring width index we selected eight adult p euphratica trees from the algan to yganbjm transect in the lower reaches of the tarim river to sample the tree rings we used an increment borer to remove cores from two points along the vertical dimension height of the tree from the trunk of each tree a total of 16 sample cores of p euphratica in august 2013 the samples were then numbered and processed i e pasted fixed polished and then cross dated by following the standard procedures for tree ring samples holmes 1983 fritts 1976 the width was measured using a lintabtm 6 tree ring measuring instrument rinntech heidelberg germany precision of 0 001 mm and for cross dating and growth correction the software package cofecha cook 1985 a quality control program was used to ensure the accuracy of cross dating to eliminate the influence of the age of a tree on the radial growth of its trunk a standardized tree ring width index was calculated using another program arstan cook 1997 this index sequence eliminated the effect of self growth on tree ring width and highlighted the role of environmental factors 3 2 2 standardization of data the data were handled by dimensionless standardization in order to guarantee the comparability of the data sequence at different magnitudes e g tree ring width index and the area of taitma lake the formula is shown in eq 1 1 y i x i x min x max x min where yi is a standardized data sequence in the range 0 1 xi is the value of the ith datum in the sequence xmin is the minimum value in the sequence and xmax is the maximum value in the sequence yi was calculated using spss statistical product and service solutions 3 2 3 calculating the river conversion ratio we set sampling transects along the river course according to the locations of the hydrological monitoring transects and groundwater monitoring wells to sample river water groundwater and soil water and then measured the δ 18o values of the samples we estimated the proportion of river water in groundwater based on the principle of mass conservation zhang et al 2005 as shown in eq 2 2 c s q s c g q g c b q s q g where cs is the δ18o value of river water at the sampling points cg is the δ18o value of groundwater at the sampling points cb is the δ18o value of water from the upper reaches of the river qs is the water flow at the sampling points and qg is the amount of river water that replenished the groundwater stocks therefore the proportion percentage of groundwater replenished by the river flow was as shown in eq 3 3 f q g q s 100 c s c b c g c b 100 similarly the conversion ratio of river water to soil water is shown in eq 4 4 f s c r c ur c s c ur 100 and the conversion ratio of groundwater to soil water is shown in eq 5 5 f g c g c r c s c r 100 where cr is the δ 18o value of the river water at the sampling points cur is the δ 18o value at the upper reaches of the river cg is the δ 18o value of groundwater at the sampling points and cs is the δ 18o value of soil water 3 2 4 determining the sources of water we collected branches of p euphratica and t chinensis as samples from trees in the no overflow areas at locations that differed in the depth of groundwater based on the isotope ratios in the samples and the isosource model we estimated the proportions of soil water and groundwater in the water used by the plants the model is based on the principle of isotope mass balance and we used it for iterative calculations and initially determined the ratios in increments of 1 or 2 subsequently we established all possible combinations of potential water sources and their respective proportions in the total 100 next we calculated the isotope indicator value for each possible combination and compared it to the isotopic ratios of the plant samples if the results were the same or within the acceptance range of mass balance 0 1 the contribution of each potential water source to the plant was obtained phillips and gregg 2003 3 2 5 overflow experiment an overflow experiment was set up mainly along the 11 transects near the river fig 1 with 50 plots and 536 quadrats and the depth of groundwater was less than 4 m the frequency and the duration of the overflow were divided based on the overflow situation observed in the field into different gradients this exercise led to three grades of overflow disturbance table 1 once every 2 3 years once or twice a year and more than twice a year the duration of the overflow was divided into four categories 1 10 days 11 20 days 21 30 days and more than 30 days based on these categories 3 5 vegetation survey quadrats were set up at random in the plots that represented different frequencies and durations of overflow the plots measured 1 m 1 m for herbs 5 m 5 m for shrubs and 20 m 20 m for trees this was followed by a detailed survey of the vegetation and of the seedlings bank which recorded many parameters including the species composition the number of plants their height and diameter at breast height dbh crown width extent of area covered the density of vegetation and the number height density and mortality of seedlings the aim was to find the dynamic characteristics of plant communities as affected by the differences in the frequency and duration of the overflow importance values iv were chosen to characterize the importance of plants in community succession based on the results of the field survey xu et al 2009 importance value is a comprehensive value that represents the relative importance of a given plant species in the community and was calculated as shown in eq 6 simpson 1949 curtis and mcintosh 1951 6 iv dr c r h r 3 where dr cr and hr are the relative density relative coverage and relative height respectively expressed as percentages and calculated as follows dr quantity of one species total quantity of all species 100 cr coverage of one species total coverage of the plot 100 hr total height of one species total height of all plants 100 in addition the shannon wiener index and margalef index were calculated to reflect the changes in species diversity xu et al 2009 there are two characteristics of diversity species richness and uniformity ma et al 1995 pointed out that the shannon weiner index has a close relationship with species richness and margalef index is a common index which has a close relationship with species uniformity margalef 1963 gamito 2010 simpson s index is sensitive to the dominant species i e dominance which is similar to the importance value hunter and gaston 1988 magurran 1988 4 results and analyses 4 1 threshold of intervals between overflows for vegetation restoration as can be seen in fig 3 a in the first 1 3 years after one overflow for 10 20 days the importance value of trees and shrubs increased significantly but began to decline steeply from the 4th year the importance value of annual herbs decreased by 84 3 in the first 1 3 years and reached 0 in the 4th year whereas the importance value of perennial herbs increased by 73 3 in the 4th year compared to that in the 3rd year and then changed little from the 5th year to the 7th year in the case of the importance values of the main species in the 3rd and 4th years after the overflow fig s2 the importance value of p euphratica a tree decreased by 79 9 and that of t chinensis a shrub decreased by 43 9 whereas that of k caspica glycyrrhiza and p australis all perennial herbs increased by 81 3 18 7 and 87 3 respectively in the 3rd year t chinensis had the greatest importance value followed by that of k caspica p euphratica p australis and glycyrrhiza but halogeton glomeratus and salsola collina both annual herbs had the lowest importance values in the 4th year k caspica had the greatest importance value followed by that of t chinensis p australis glycyrrhiza and p euphratica whereas h glomeratus and s collina disappeared altogether as to the species diversity in the lower reaches of the tarim river fig 3 b the shannon wiener index showed a highly significant decrease 27 1 at the 0 01 level in the 2nd year and in the 3rd year after the overflow and then decreased by 18 2 at the 0 05 level in the 3rd year and in the 4th year whereas the margalef index decreased by 40 3 at the 0 01 level after the 3rd year the shannon wiener index and the margalef index of the overflow areas were not significantly different from those of the non overflow areas which means that the diversity after the overflow had decreased to that of the non overflow level these analyses showed that to promote stable and diverse plant communities with tree and shrub species as the main constitutive species the interval between two consecutive overflows should be 2 years and never more than 3 years at the early stage of restoration of desert riparian vegetation this also provides a theoretical basis for setting a gradient of one overflow in 2 3 years for the experiment involving surface water overflow table 1 4 2 appropriate overflow disturbance for ecosystem restoration in the present experiment a combination of low frequency of overflow once in 2 3 years and short duration 1 10 days referred to as f1t1 in fig 4 a led to the formation of a plant community in which k caspica was the dominant species with the greatest importance value fig s3 and table s1 after more than 7 years of the overflow experiment in the combinations involving low frequency and longer durations 11 20 days or f1t2 fig 4 b and 21 30 days or f1t3 fig 4 c the importance value of perennial herbs decreased by 8 3 whereas that of the trees and shrubs increased by 18 7 in the combination involving low frequency and the longest duration more than 30 days or f1t4 fig 4 d the importance value of perennial herbs increased by 51 3 because the importance value of p australis increased on account of the extended duration of the overflow moreover mean values of the shannon wiener index and margalef index under f1t3 were the greatest after more than 7 years fig 4 c at the next higher frequency of overflow namely once or twice a year the importance value of perennial herbs was greater than that of trees shrubs and annual herbs after more than 7 years when the duration of overflow was 1 10 days f2t1 fig 5 a however compared to the values under f1t1 fig s3 the importance value of k caspica decreased by 45 7 of p australis by 22 2 of h glomeratus by 10 6 and of s collina by 5 8 whereas the importance value of p euphratica increased by 1537 4 of t chinensis by 2037 9 and of glycyrrhiza by 44 7 at the same frequency of overflow 1 2 per year but with longer duration namely 11 20 days f2t2 fig 5 b the importance value of trees and of shrubs was significantly greater than that of the perennial herbs at 0 05 level the same pattern was seen when the duration was 21 30 days f2t3 fig 5 c except that the difference was significant at the 0 01 level when combined with the longest duration of overflow namely more than 30 days f2t4 fig 5 d the importance value of perennial herbs was significantly greater than that of trees or shrubs because the importance value of p australis increased by 1200 0 and that of glycyrrhiza by 67 6 when compared to the values under f2t3 the importance value of p euphratica decreased by 58 4 and that of t chinensis decreased by 40 2 fig s3 in particular the mean value of shannon wiener index under f2t3 was 26 6 greater than that under f2t2 and the corresponding increase in margalef index was 14 6 because the importance value of trees and shrubs increased by 9 6 under f2t3 therefore the combination of intermediate frequency and longer duration f2t3 of overflow proved better than that of intermediate frequency and shorter duration f2t2 because the former resulted in a more diverse plant community in which the constructive species comprised trees and shrubs table s1 at the highest frequency more than twice a year of overflow combined with short duration f3t1 fig 6 a the importance value of annual herbs was significantly greater than that of perennial herbs trees and shrubs after 1 3 years of the treatment after 4 5 years the importance value of trees and shrubs was the greatest and a community of k caspica formed after 6 years table s1 when the highest frequency was combined with intermediate duration f3t2 fig 6 b which resulted in higher levels of water the importance value of perennial herbs with k caspica as the constructive species decreased whereas that of trees and shrubs increased when the highest frequency of overflow was combined with longer duration namely 21 30 days f3t3 fig 6 c the community structure became dominated by p australis the constructive species after 7 years table s1 and the importance value of trees and shrubs increased by 20 0 compared to that under f3t2 lastly when the duration exceeded 30 days f3t4 fig 6 d the importance value of k caspica was 39 8 lower than that under f2t4 and that of glycyrrhiza was 35 3 lower after 7 years whereas the importance value of p australis was higher by 129 1 of h glomeratus higher by 19 0 and of s collina higher by 16 2 fig s3 therefore the herbaceous community formed under f3t4 consisted mainly of p australis table s1 and it was this community that was predominantly distributed in the area surrounding the daxihaizi reservoir and taitma lake with an ample water supply 4 3 water source of the constructive species of desert riparian forest ecosystem in the lower reach of the tarim river the critical groundwater depth for both p euphratica and t chinensis is about 5 m chen et al 2004 xu et al 2008 when groundwater depth was less than the critical depth fig 7 a groundwater depth 3 9 m the root systems of p euphratica and t chinensis were distributed mainly near the deeper layer closer to groundwater and the two species mostly used soil water in the 300 400 cm layer soil water accounted for 28 2 of the water used by p euphratica and for 23 9 of that used by t chinensis and groundwater for 56 6 of the total in p euphratica and 63 2 in t chinensis despite any increase in the depth of groundwater fig 7 b groundwater depth 4 5 m p euphratica and t chinensis continued to tap soil water from the 400 500 cm layer which was closer to groundwater soil water met 29 3 of the total requirements of p euphratica and 29 4 of those of t chinensis the corresponding figures for groundwater being 37 7 and 38 9 however the average contribution of soil water from the 300 400 cm layer decreased to 20 5 in p euphratica and 19 9 in t chinensis in particular as drought stress intensified fig 7 c groundwater depth 6 2 m the contribution from the 0 100 cm layer increased to 33 2 in p euphratica and 26 1 in t chinensis significantly greater than the contribution from the same layer when groundwater depth was greater than 4 5 m 5 discussion 5 1 necessity of regulating water disturbance ecological water conveyance supports the growth of desert riparian vegetation by recharging groundwater replenishing soil water and overflowing the stable isotope studies in the lower reaches showed that 44 5 of surface water was converted into groundwater and 42 6 into soil water combined with hydrological data and the water balance principle we estimated that 4 9 was used for overflow outside the channel and 8 0 either evaporated from within the channel or flowed into the rump lake as the conveyance continued fig s1 the level of groundwater continued to rise and the ecosystem developed continuously hao et al 2010b rumbaur et al 2015 xu et al 2008 however going back over 100 years 1913 2012 the tree ring index of p euphratica offered further insights into the restoration of degraded ecosystems in the lower reaches of the tarim river spearman s correlation test was conducted on the standardized values of the tree ring index and the correlation between the index and the area of taitma lake rump lake was significant r 2 0 621 p 0 024 0 05 fig s4 the condition of taitma lake is linked to the penetration of the tarim river basin by the river system and the extent of its completeness if the lake has ample water then so does the entire ecosystem in the lower reaches of the tarim river therefore in the lower reaches of the tarim river changes in the growth of p euphratica as judged by tree rings can be used as a reliable index of the health of the ecosystem as can be seen in fig s4 the average value of p euphratica rings was 0 0847 during the period through which the river flow had been cut off from 1972 to 1999 and decreased by 63 4 before the cut off period from 1913 to 1971 however the average value of the tree ring index increased by only 40 1 after the ecological water conveyance therefore although the ecological water conveyance promoted the growth of p euphratica the growth rate did not reach the level that existed before the cut off period indicating that the degraded ecosystem in the lower reaches of the tarim river is yet to be restored fully that is to the level before the cut off thus to facilitate ecosystem restoration in the lower reaches of the tarim river it is necessary to optimize the degree of water disturbance caused by ecological water conveyance this approach can be extended to other similar areas around the world especially to many river basins in central asia for ecosystem restoration and protection 5 2 adaptation strategies of desert riparian vegetation to water disturbance in degraded desert riparian forest ecosystems surface overflow is a major disturbance that promotes the restoration of vegetation andersen et al 2007 bateman et al 2012 xu et al 2009 after one overflow fig 3 from the 4th year to the 7th year perennial herbs had the greatest importance values the reason was the accumulation of salt in surface soil which aggravated soil aridity seeds of the annual herbs failed to germinate under those conditions nor did their seedlings survive xu et al 2003 however seedlings of perennial herbs such as k caspica were more resistant to drought and had greater tolerance to salt than the seedlings of p euphratica jia and an 2004 xu et al 2009 some earlier studies bornette and amoros 1996 capon and brock 2006 garssen et al 2015 grimoldi et al 1999 simpson et al 2013 have shown that the duration and the intensity frequency of floods determine the composition of plant communities and the distribution of species our experiment on overflow disturbance figs 4 6 and table s1 after more than 7 years of overflow showed that disturbances that take the form of infrequent and short overflows such as f1t1 and f1t2 lead to the formation of a community in which k caspica is the constructive species whereas disturbances comprising more frequent and longer lasting overflows such as f3t3 and f3t4 lead to the formation of a community in which p australis is the constructive species the analyses also showed that the duration of overflow had greater influence than its frequency on plant community succession our research showed that when overflows were less frequent and lasted longer f1t4 the result was a community led by p australis whereas with more frequent but shorter overflows f3t1 and f3t2 the community was led by k caspica in the present research intermediate disturbance was represented by f2t2 and f2t3 following which the plant community would evolve and finally become a community in which the constructive species would be p euphratica and t chinensis both of which recorded the highest importance values shannon wiener index and margalef index under f2t3 this indicated that the disturbance caused by one or two overflows a year each lasting for 21 30 days promoted the formation of a desert riparian forest ecosystem that was both diverse and highly resistant to drought a conclusion that supported the intermediate disturbance hypothesis ideally these overflows should be carried out from june to september to coincide with the period of germination and vigorous growth of the desert riparian vegetation ling et al 2016 a suitable depth of groundwater is the most crucial controlling factor to ensure the stability of a desert riparian forest ecosystem hao et al 2010b bateman et al 2012 in our study the yearly average precipitation was less than 40 mm whereas the evaporation was greater than 2500 mm thus natural rainfall had almost no ecological effect on the growth of vegetation chen et al 2004 hao et al 2010a in addition a study dawson and ehleringer 1991 indicated that trees growing close to the banks of a steam do not use stream water directly ecological water demand of the desert riparian forest depended only on groundwater and soil water in the lower reaches of tarim river owing to the absence of any disturbance from surface water overflow and precipitation in the area over which the depth of groundwater was monitored these changes fig 7 in the adaptive strategies of p euphratica and t chinensis could be attributed to hydraulic redistribution of the root system yu et al 2013 yuan et al 2012 to resist drought roots of both species used hydraulic redistribution to transport soil water and groundwater from the deeper layers to the surface layer conserved that water overnight and used it the next day yu et al 2013 yuan et al 2012 this mechanism improved water use efficiency earlier studies si et al 2007 yuan et al 2012 have shown that fine roots diameters less than 2 mm of p euphratica and t chinensis are distributed mainly in the surface layer 0 120 cm and the distribution of roots is significantly correlated to soil water content the main role of fine roots is to absorb water and nutrients from soil a function that would have been seriously impaired by the scarcity of moisture in the surface layer as a consequence of drought thus hydraulic redistribution is a physiological mechanism to keep the surface layer moist so that fine roots continue to discharge their role unimpaired during the growing season hydraulic redistribution by p euphratica roots contributed 14 6 113 04 to transpiration the average value was 38 75 the corresponding values for t chinensis roots were 10 46 53 33 and 19 44 yu 2013 5 3 combined disturbance to surface water and groundwater desert riparian forest vegetation needs overflow for germination and a suitable groundwater depth for growth garssen et al 2015 hao et al 2010b xu et al 2009 to make desert riparian forest ecosystems more resistant to drought a combined disturbance to surface water and groundwater is needed for restoration and conservation of the ecosystem fig 8 this study has shown that the likely outcome of more frequent and longer lasting overflows fig 6 is a plant community with p australis as the constructive species fig 8 s1 that species is likely to suffer with many of its members dying off if the groundwater level recedes below the critical value more than 3 m and the entire community would disappear fig 8 s2 if the groundwater depth is more than 5 m xu et al 2008 the likely outcome of infrequent and short duration overflows fig 4 is a plant community with k caspica as the constructive species fig 8l1 and many of its members would die fig 8 l2 if the groundwater depth is more than 6 m which is the critical depth for drought xu et al 2008 the likely outcome of overflow that is intermediate in terms of both frequency and duration f2t3 is the recovery of the degraded desert riparian forest and a stable plant community of trees shrubs and both perennial and annual herbs with p euphratica and t chinensis as its main members fig 8 i1 for such a result groundwater depth should be maintained at 2 4 m hao et al 2010b however transpiration would be much greater in that situation because of the proximity of groundwater to the surface layer and because of the extensive growth of vegetation therefore in arid areas where water is extremely scarce groundwater depth should be increased to save water fig 9 community diversity of desert riparian forest begins to decline when groundwater depth is 4 m and the herbaceous members begin to die when groundwater depth is 5 5 m han 2014 populus euphratica and t chinensis will use soil water and groundwater when groundwater depth is less than 5 m fig 7 for efficient use of water and for stable functioning of an ecosystem a groundwater depth of 4 5 m would be reasonable fig 8 i2 the frequency of overflow of surface water should be set at once every 2 3 years fig 3 to promote the germination of the seeds and growth of herbs and that overflow frequency should be sustained for a duration of 21 30 days f1t3 fig 4 to maintain species diversity of the plant community fig 9 hydraulic redistribution is an important physiological mechanism by which desert riparian forests adapt to drought hao et al 2010a yu et al 2013 when groundwater depth is 5 7 m the critical value for drought fig 8 i3 both p euphratica and t chinensis transport soil water and groundwater from the deeper layers to the surface layer through hydraulic redistribution which ensures maximum water to combat drought fig 7 d hydraulic redistribution is also conducive to the formation of a plant community hydraulic redistribution by p euphratica for example promotes germination and growth in herbaceous members of the plant community hao et al 2010a however hydraulic redistribution also leads to the water table receding deeper if groundwater is not replenished fig 8 i4 thereby intensifying drought and as a consequence severe degradation of the desert riparian forest ecosystem a similar situation has also been observed in other regions jackson et al 2000 showed that hydraulic redistribution resulted in groundwater depth increasing by 16 33 when drought persists for a long time in the amazon forest hydraulic lifting increases evapotranspiration and soil moisture reaches the wilting point faster thereby favouring dry deciduous trees at the cost of evergreen trees wang et al 2011 therefore groundwater depth can be maintained at 5 7 m figs 8 i3 and 9 if a desert riparian forest ecosystem is suffering from drought so long as the source of groundwater is stable if water disturbance is used for reducing the depth of groundwater from 5 7 m to 4 5 m for example and the frequency of overflow is once in 2 3 years the desert riparian forest ecosystem can be effectively restored and protected fig 9 if the depth of groundwater increases to 7 9 m the death threshold for plants xu et al 2008 and drought continues to intensify the desert riparian forest ecosystem would be severely degraded such as that in the lower reaches of the tarim river before ecological water conveyance and we should take recourse to frequent and longer overflows f2t3 for example and reduction in the depth of groundwater so that it is only 2 4 m deep to rebuild and restore the plant community fig 9 thus controlled disturbance of both surface water and groundwater by regulating the frequency and duration of overflows fig 9 to match the intensity of drought and taking into account the composition of the plant community and its strategy of water use can promote the conservation and restoration of desert riparian forest ecosystems in arid areas such an approach also offers theoretical guidance and serves as a scientific basis for sustainable management of ecosystems in similar areas in other parts of the world 6 conclusions ecological water conveyance has provided abundant water for the protection and restoration of a desert riparian forest ecosystem the water thus supplied accounts for 44 5 of groundwater and 42 6 of soil water and 4 9 of the water conveyance is used for overflow in the lower reaches of the tarim river the degraded desert riparian forest ecosystem has been restored to some extent in the early stage of the efforts to restore a desert riparian forest ecosystem the interval between two successive overflows should be no more than 3 years because the effect of the duration of overflow on succession in a plant community is stronger than that of the frequency of overflow the combined effect of these two attributes should be exploited in regulating the extent of disturbance through overflow to promote the formation of two communities one dominated by p australis favoured by greater disturbance and the other dominated by k caspica which is less resistant to drought and is favoured by smaller disturbance a level of disturbance that is intermediate secured through 1 2 overflows a year each lasting 21 30 days f2t3 leads to a plant community with maximum diversity in which the constructive species are mainly trees and shrubs a result that supports the intermediate disturbance hypothesis proper depth of groundwater is the key to stable desert riparian forest ecosystems when the depth is less than the critical value for drought p euphratica and t chinensis mainly use soil water and groundwater from the deeper layers when the depth is greater than the critical value the two species mainly use soil water from the surface layer brought to it by means of hydraulic redistribution an important physiological mechanism by which plants maximize water use during drought we therefore propose that the mechanism of joint disturbance to surface water and groundwater be used regulated as required to deal with droughts of varying intensity in the early stages of the efforts to restore desert riparian forest ecosystems combining one or two overflows each lasting 21 30 days the depth of groundwater will decrease from more than 7 m to 2 4 m after that stage to protect the ecosystem and to use water more efficiently the depth should be maintained at 4 5 m and the frequency of surface overflow reduced to once every 2 to 3 years for optimal results each overflow should last 21 30 days if the drought is severe the depth can be maintained at 5 7 m to avoid serious damage to the ecosystem at that depth hydraulic distribution can make up for the ecological water deficit to some extent our analysis thus offers theoretical guidance for faster restoration of degraded desert riparian ecosystems and for making them more resistant to drought declaration of interests the authors report no conflicts of
