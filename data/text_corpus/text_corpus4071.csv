20355,slip distributions have been proved to have significant influence on the flow past cylinder problems however rare studies focus on the square cylinders to obtain better understanding of the effect of slip distributions on the flow past square cylinder problems that widely appear in the engineering fields the flows past a single square cylinder and two tandem square cylinders under different slip distributions and gap ratios are numerically investigated using the lattice boltzmann method at low reynolds numbers 25 200 mainly at 100 the flow structures and drag properties including the friction drag and the pressure drag are analyzed various slip distributions are found to have minor impacts on the drag reduction of a single cylinder 3 5 in maximum but larger impacts on that of the tandem cylinders especially the downstream cylinder 100 in maximum in addition flank side slip is found to have important contributions to the drag reduction keywords slip distribution drag reduction flow control flow past cylinders tandem square cylinders lattice boltzmann 1 introduction during the past decades the flow past bluff bodies has attracted great attentions besides its academic interests this flow phenomenon associates with technical problems involving heat transfer energy conservation structural design and flow control which is related to many applications in ocean platforms buildings bridges submerged pipelines chimneys towers and so on sohankar et al 1998 square and circular cylinders are the most widely studied bluff bodies for the flow past a square cylinder the separation points are fixed on the corner points of the cylinder however the separation points of the flow past a circular cylinder are time dependent according to flow conditions yoon et al 2010 to realize the delay of separations for a circular cylinder is much more easily and could be used to fulfill the reduction of the drag lift or even vibrations recently researchers have found that slip boundaries e g superhydrophobic surfaces are good alternatives to achieve this end rothstein 2009 bixler and bhushan 2013 dey et al 2014 seo and garcía mayoral 2018 therefore various experimental studies have been performed to access the influence of slip boundaries on circular cylinders for example muralidhar et al 2011 examined the effect of superhydrophobic induced slip on the flow past a circular cylinder and found that the superhydrophobic cylinder can notably delay the onset of the vortex shedding and lengthen the recirculation region in the wake of the cylinder daniello et al 2013 also studied the influence of superhydrophobic surfaces on the vortex induced vibrations at r e 1300 2300 and obtained obvious reduction in rms root mean square lift up to 15 with an ignorable reduction in drag kim et al 2015 gained 40 reduction in the size of the recirculation bubble and less than 10 reduction in drag besides the experimental researches numerical investigations have also presented the probability of delaying separations and reducing drag around a circular cylinder with slip configurations legendre et al 2009 examined the impact of slip on the wake dynamics for the flow past a circular cylinder at r e 5 800 they found that slip can postpone the onset of recirculation and shedding in the wake reduce the drag and lift forces and increase the shedding frequency in addition you and moin 2007 accessed the effect of alternating slip boundaries on the circular cylinder seo and song 2012 studied the effect of partial slip boundaries on the circular cylinder and gruncell et al 2013 performed two phase simulations to investigate the laminar flow across a superhydrophobic sphere with surface textures plastron they all found that slip configurations could suppress flow separations and reduce drag furthermore li et al 2014 investigated the effect of five symmetric slip boundary configurations on the flow past a circular cylinder with the reynolds numbers in the range of 100 to 500 among the five slip boundaries the flank slip configuration shows the best effect for drag reduction more recently huang et al 2018 inspected the influence of the dimensionless slip length on the total friction and pressure drag coefficients for the flow r e 60 80 past a hydrophobic circular cylinder the friction drag are found to contribute major part of drag reduction at low reynolds r e 100 and small slip length l s 0 02 while the pressure drag at moderate reynolds number and slip length although some researchers have explored the effect of slip distributions on the flow past circular cylinders rare studies focus on the square cylinders since square cylinders have been widely used among the engineering fields investigations on the influence of slip distributions on the square cylinders will strengthen our understanding towards the mechanism of how slip affects the flow fields near the square cylinders and further fulfill desired control to flow fields for example adopting slip distributions on bluff bodies in a microfluidic device to improve the mixing and heat transfer efficiency you and moin 2007 as discussed above we can figure out that the key mechanism why slip boundaries on a circular cylinder can reduce drag is that slip can decrease the adverse pressure gradient in the boundary layer which leads to the delay or suppression of separations li et al 2014 however for a square cylinder no obvious mechanism is currently present since the separation of a square cylinder happens at fixed points which makes the research on the square cylinder with slip challenging even so we still can figure out useful information by carefully analyzing the flow structures the total drag including the friction and pressure drag for the flow past square cylinders problems under different slip distributions the interpretations of slip distributions with obvious influence on the drag or the flow state will provide valuable information to guide the fulfillment of desired flow control the lattice boltzmann lbm is a newly developed method and derived from the boltzmann equation lbm has now been extensively studied due to its kinetic nature nature parallelism and the ability to handle complex boundaries in an easy way chen and doolen 1998 owning to these merits lbm has been extended to various fields chen and doolen 1998 succi 2001 aidun and clausen 2009 it is also suitable for the simulation of the flow past bluff bodies with slip boundaries wang et al 2018b succi 2002 wang et al 2018a yang et al 2018 therefore in this work taking the advantages of the lattice boltzmann method we investigate the effect of slip distributions on the flows past a square cylinder and two tandem cylinders at low reynolds numbers 25 200 mainly at 100 we consider eight types of slip distributions namely no slip fore slip flank slip aft slip fore flank slip fore aft slip flank aft slip and full slip for the flow past a cylinder in addition sixteen kinds of slip distributions are studied for the flow past two tandem cylinders with these simulations we analyze how these slip configurations influence the wake vortex shedding and the drag including the pressure drag and the friction drag and lift coefficients of the flows past a cylinder and two tandem cylinders these studies may serve as a guidance for desired flow control e g reducing drag by carefully distributing slip boundaries on cylinders the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the general concepts of the lattice boltzmann method and the slip boundary conditions in lbm in section 3 numerical results with various types of slip distributions are shown and some discussions are presented section 4 makes the conclusion 2 numerical methods 2 1 the lattice boltzmann method different from the continuum nature of the conventional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods the lattice boltzmann method lbm derives from the discrete boltzmann equation aidun and clausen 2009 to model fluid flow field the physical space in lbm is evenly discretized as a regular grid called lattice the time step is dependent on the space step and is chosen to ensure that fluid particles can only stream to adjacent lattice nodes or stay stationary within one time step lbm has second order accuracy both in space and time chen and doolen 1998 in general a lattice boltzmann equation lbe model includes three elements an evolution equation discrete velocities of fluid particles and the lattice structure square regular grid in two dimension the lbe describes the movement of distribution functions of fluid particles on a fixed lattice guo and shu 2013 an evolution equation depicts the interactions between fluid particles the most common evolution equation is the bhatnagar gross krook bgk operator bhatnagar et al 1954 1 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t 1 τ f i x t f i e q x t where f i x t represents the distribution function df at position x and time t with a particle velocity e i along the i th direction of the lattice f i e q is the equilibrium distribution function δ t is the time step and τ is the relaxation time the movements of the particles on lattice nodes obey the rules determined by a lattice model which defines discrete velocities of these particles the most common model for a two dimension 2d simulation is the d2q9 model a square lattice with nine discrete velocity directions qian et al 1992 which has the following velocity directions e i for particles fig 1 2 e i 0 0 i 0 cos i 1 π 2 sin i 1 π 2 c i 1 4 2 cos 2 i 1 π 4 sin 2 i 1 π 4 c i 5 8 where c δ x δ t is the lattice speed and δ x is the space step the equilibrium distribution function adopted in the d2q9 model is qian et al 1992 3 f i e q ω i ρ 1 e i u c s 2 e i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where ω i is the weight parameter ω i 4 9 i 0 1 9 i 1 4 1 36 i 5 8 ρ is the fluid density u is the fluid velocity and c s c 3 is the sound speed through the moments of the distribution functions macroscopic variables ρ and u on a lattice node can be obtained using 4 ρ i f i ρ u i e i f i in addition the pressure can be obtained 5 p ρ c s 2 utilizing the chapman enskog expansion multi scaling expansion we can derive the macro navier stokes equations from the lbm up to second order if setting the relaxation time τ in the eq 1 as guo et al 2000 6 τ ν c s 2 δ t 1 2 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid we also have 7 ν τ 1 2 c s 2 δ t the evolution equation eq 1 is composed of two steps the collision step and the streaming step 8 collision f i x t f i x t 1 τ f i x t f i e q x t streaming f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t with appropriate boundary conditions related descriptions will be presented in section 2 2 lbm executes the collision and streaming steps repeatedly and the evolution of a fluid can be simulated 2 2 slip boundary conditions in the lbm lbm simulates the fluid flow through the evolution of distribution functions on a boundary node after a collision step some distribution functions are unknown to ensure the validness of the simulation these unknown distribution functions need to be reconstructed according to a specific boundary condition the most common boundary condition for a no slip wall is the bounce back scheme ziegler 1993 chen et al 1996 including the standard the modified and the half way methods slip boundary can be achieved on the basis of the bounce back scheme the combination of the half way bounce back and specular reflection hbsr scheme succi 2002 karimipour et al 2012 is one of these slip boundary schemes and has been successfully applied to various gas and liquid flows with slip wang et al 2018a yang et al 2018 2019 this paper adopts the hbsr scheme to realize slip boundary conditions fig 2 depicts the boundary arrangement of the hbsr scheme in the d2q9 model taking bottom boundary for example as we can see f 2 f 5 and f 6 are unknown and can be reconstructed with yang et al 2018 9 f 2 f 4 f 5 r f 7 1 r f 8 f 6 r f 8 1 r f 7 where r is the combination parameter in the liquid flow slip boundary conditions are usually achieved via the slip length the concept of the slip length fig 3 is firstly proposed by navier 1823 the navier s slip model is defined as navier 1823 10 u s b u n w a l l where u s represents the slip velocity on the wall b is the slip length and u n is the gradient of velocity along the normal direction of wall with the navier s slip model the following relationship between the combination parameter r in eq 9 and the slip length b can be obtained yang et al 2018 wang et al 2018a 11 r 1 1 2 b 2 τ 1 validations of the slip boundary conditions eqs 9 and 11 have been made by wang et al 2018a and yang et al 2018 through a series of numerical simulations including the couette flow the force driven poiseuille flow the unsteady womersley flow and the cylindrical couette flow 3 numerical results and discussions this section will implement and analyze the flow past square cylinder problems as confirmed by various researches that the flow past cylinders with a reynolds number r e 200 is still in a laminar state and shows two dimensional features jackson 1987 wen and lin 2001 sanyal and dhiman 2017 ma et al 2017 huang et al 2018 simulations in current study are all proceeded in two dimension 3 1 grid independence check in this section flow past a single square cylinder is considered with a reynolds number r e 100 the sketch of this flow is showed in fig 4 the size of the computational domain is 51 d 30 d d is the side length of the square cylinder the boundary conditions of the problem are inlet u u v 0 outlet u x v x 0 bottom and top u y 0 v 0 square cylinders u v 0 where u is the inlet velocity constant in current study u is the velocity along the x direction and v is the velocity along the y direction the reynolds number is 12 r e u d ν the drag and lift coefficients are defined as 13 c d f d 0 5 u 2 d c l f l 0 5 u 2 d where f d is the total drag force on the cylinder and f l is the total lift force on the cylinder f d and f l are calculated using the momentum exchange method ladd and verberg 2001 chen et al 2013 the average drag coefficient is defined as 14 c d 1 n i 1 n c d i where n is the number of samples and c d i is the i th selected drag coefficient the strouhal number is defined as 15 s t f l c u c where f is the frequency of the vortex shedding l c is the characteristic length and u c is the characteristic velocity in current study l c is taken as the side length of the square cylinder d and u c is taken as the inlet velocity u f can be obtained via the fast fourier transform fft of the lift coefficients all the parameters during the simulations are converted to lattice units δ x 1 δ t 1 u is set as 0 01 the initial density ρ of the flow field is set as 1 0 then we take the grid independence test with the dimension of the square cylinder side length d as 10 20 30 respectively the mean drag coefficients c d and the strouhal numbers are shown in table 1 from table 1 we can see that the cylinder with a grid of 20 has only 1 9 difference with the case of grid 30 and agrees well with the results in literatures shown in table 1 therefore we will adopt the grid of the cylinder side length d as 20 for r e 125 in the following simulations furthermore we adopt the recommended procedure by celik et al 2008 to analysis the discretization error for this problem since lbm uses a regular grid the representative grid size h is 2d 16 h 1 n i 1 n δ a i 1 2 1 n i 1 n δ x 2 1 2 δ x where δ a i is the area of the i th cell and n is the total number of cells used for the computation therefore the grid refinement factor r h c o a r s e h f i n e for the three cases are 17 r 21 1 20 1 30 1 5 r 32 1 10 1 20 2 0 the total number of cells for the three cases are 18 n 1 1 377 000 n 2 612 000 n 3 153 000 then the apparent order p is 19a p 1 l n r 21 l n ɛ 32 ɛ 21 q p 19b q p l n r 21 p s r 32 p s 19c s s g n ɛ 32 ɛ 21 where ɛ 32 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 ɛ 21 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 and p can solved using a fixed point iteration with p we can obtain the extrapolated values ϕ e x t 21 20 ϕ e x t 21 r 21 p ϕ 1 ϕ 2 r 21 p 1 the approximate relative error e α 21 21 e α 21 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 the extrapolated relative error e e x t 21 22 e e x t 21 ϕ e x t 21 ϕ 1 ϕ e x t 21 and the fine grid convergence index g c i f i n e 21 23 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e α 21 r 21 p 1 table 2 shows the above procedure to calculate the discretization error according to table 2 the numerical uncertainty in the fine grid solution for the average drag coefficient c d is 3 7 which is acceptable for the practical application as the same manner we implement the grid test for r e 150 200 for r e 150 the difference of mean c d between the grid of 30 and the grid of 40 is 1 53 for r e 200 the difference of mean c d between the grid of 40 and the grid of 50 is 1 48 therefore we adopt the grid of 30 for r e 150 and the grid of 40 for r e 175 200 in the following simulations 3 2 the effect of slip distributions on the flow past a square cylinder in this section the flow past a single square cylinder with different slip distributions is explored eight slip distributions no slip full slip fore slip flank slip aft slip fore flank fore aft slip and flank aft slip are considered in the following simulations which are shown in fig 5 all the cases are symmetrical to the center axis along the inflow direction for different slip distributions the slip length b is taken as 0 05 d the dimensionless slip length is defined as b b d b 0 05 for all the cases in this paper to analyze the influence of slip boundary on the drag of the single cylinder the relative drag reduction dr is defined as 24 d r 100 c d n o s l i p c d c d n o s l i p in addition the relative lift reduction lr is defined as 25 l r 100 c l n o s l i p c l c l n o s l i p the total drag coefficient c d is the combination of the friction drag coefficient c d f and the pressure drag coefficient c d p 26 c d c d f c d p the pressure drag coefficient is calculated by 27 c d p 0 d p f o r e p a f t d x 0 5 ρ u 2 d where the p f o r e and p a f t are the pressure on the fore side and the aft side edge of the cylinder respectively the sketch of the pressure drag calculation is shown in fig 6 the friction drag coefficient is obtained by c d f c d c d p in the following simulations the average c d f and c d p are denoted as c d f and c d p respectively similar to c d defined in eq 14 3 2 1 the effect of slip distributions at r e 100 instantaneous vorticity contours of the flow past a single cylinder with different slip distributions at r e 100 are presented in fig 7 from fig 7 we can observe that the shear layers separate from the up rear corner point and the down rear corner point alternately a group of karman vortex streets is formed and the vortices rotate vortices above rotate clockwise while vortices below counterclockwise sketched in fig 8 and move downstream separately without coalescence and disturbance between each other as we can see except for the slightly different phase of the shedding vortices the differences between the slip cases with the no slip case are not so obvious fig 9 displays the time evolution of the drag coefficients and lift coefficients for the flow past a single cylinder with different slip distributions from fig 9 observable influence of the slip distributions on the drag coefficients could be found for example in fig 9 g the drag coefficient curve of the full slip case in solid line is much lower than that of the no slip case in dashed line suggesting a positive dr when it comes to the lift coefficient curve in fig 9 g apparent phase lag is spotted in addition the amplitude of the lift coefficient curve also has evident change however the period of the lift coefficient curve is almost unchanged which confirmed by the nearly unchanged s t of various cases with different slip distributions in table 3 that is to say the vortex shedding frequency the strouhal number is insensitive to the change of the slip distributions in current simulations at r e 100 at r e 100 the separation points of the flow at different time periods are on the corners of the aft side of the cylinder sohankar et al 1999 sen et al 2011 slip boundary in current simulations cannot alter the positions of these separation points therefore the frequency of the vortex shedding keeps unchanged under the effect of slip table 3 compares the average drag coefficients with different slip distributions indicating that different slip configurations have a relatively obvious impact on the drag of the cylinder in detail the full slip case gains the largest dr while the fore case gains the smallest dr even negative for the cases with slip boundary on the fore side and the aft side negative drs are observed in contrary the flank case gains a positive dr the combination of the fore and aft slip boundary receives a negative dr between the fore case and the aft case the union of the fore slip and the flank slip boundary the aft slip and the flank slip boundary show positive drs the fore flank case gains a dr of 3 27 very close to the dr 3 49 of the full slip case slip boundary conditions could generate slip velocity on the boundary and decrease the velocity gradient along the normal direction of the boundary if the tangential direction of the boundary has a component along the direction of the friction drag the friction drag could be reduced in addition the velocity gradient can also alter the pressure distributions near the boundary leading to the variation of the pressure drag for the square cylinder with a horizontal inflow the total drag is contributed by the friction drag arisen on the flank top and bottom sides and the pressure drag arisen on the fore left and aft right sides the relative changes of the friction drag and the pressure drag determine whether the total drag increases or not as shown in table 4 the pressure drag takes up the most portion of the total drag 90 while the effect of the friction drag is relatively small as shown in table 4 a large portion of the dr for the flank case has been contributed by the friction reduction 73 since the flank edges are along the direction of drag for the square cylinder the flank slip on the cylinder mainly reduces the friction drag in addition to a slightly change on the pressure drag in the same manner with the presence of the flank side slip the fore flank the flank aft and the full slip cases are all have a relatively high amount friction reduction 40 slightly lower than that of the flank case the fore slip or the aft slip cases have mild but negative influence on the drag reduction the addition of the fore side slip or the aft side slip to the flank side slip slightly increases the velocity gradient along the normal direction of the flank boundary leading to the mildly decrease of the friction reduction compared with the flank case though the total drags of the fore flank and aft flank cases both reduce mainly due to the pressure reduction the fore flank case endures a higher pressure reduction having slip on the fore flank side is more benefit for the pressure reduction than on the flank aft side a possible reason for this phenomenon is that the uniform slip boundary conditions e g fore flank from the fore edge to the flank edge along the flow direction make the transition of the velocity and pressure relatively mild compared with the slip no slip e g fore or the no slip slip e g flank cases the pressure difference between the fore and aft side of the fore flank case is also lower than that of the flank aft case in the same manner the fore flank aft slip full slip should endure the highest pressure reduction which suggested in table 4 though the friction drag augments slightly compared with the fore flank case the total drag gains further reduction furthermore we can also see that the aforementioned cases with flank slip commonly reduce friction drags contributing to a large portion of the dr this observation agrees with the findings of li et al 2014 when exploring the influence of slip distributions on a circular cylinder table 3 also compares the maximum lift coefficients with different slip distributions from table 3 the maximum lift coefficients share the same trend with the drag coefficients except the fore aft case the fore aft case gains a negative dr but a positive lr in addition the flank case the fore flank case and the full slip case all obtains lr higher than 9 similar to the dr the flank side slip also contributes to a large portion of the lr lr 17 639 in maximum vs dr 3 489 in maximum from the above analysis we can find that imposing slip boundaries on the fore and flank side of the cylinder are more efficient to change the local flow field for the purpose of drag reduction the full slip and the fore flank slip are the most recommended schemes when it comes to the flow past a single cylinder still the full slip case gains the best dr and the best lr and the differences between the full slip and the fore flank are 0 22 for dr and 1 8 for lr respectively however since the numerical uncertainty for the c d obtained in section 3 1 is 3 7 and the numerical results cited in table 1 have a margin on c d approaching 3 5 the dr of 3 5 is indeed not a big difference even so the relative differences between different slip distributions are still good references for further examining the effect of slip distributions on the two tandem cases 3 2 2 two typical slip distributions for the single cylinder at various reynolds numbers then we investigate the fore flank and full slip cases at various reynolds numbers and compare the results with the no slip case fig 10 shows the average drag coefficients c d and the strouhal number s t for these slip distributions under the reynolds numbers from 25 to 200 comparisons of the current results with the experimental data okajima 1995 norberg 1993 and the numerical data franke et al 1990 sohankar et al 1995 ma et al 2017 are also presented in general our results can capture the similar tendencies for the average drag coefficient c d and the strouhal number s t within the simulated range of the reynolds numbers in addition c d of current simulation has a minimum within the range of 125 r e 175 just similar to the results in the literatures cited in fig 10 fig 10 b also suggests that the fore flank and full slip conditions have nearly no influence on the s t compared with the no slip cases within the simulated reynolds numbers from 25 to 200 which agrees with the conclusions for r e 100 in section 3 2 1 when it comes to the drag reduction shown in fig 11 the drs of the full slip cases are better than those of the fore flank cases in general and rise almost in a concurrent pace as the reynolds number when r e 125 suggesting a similar tendency with the results in section 3 2 1 however when r e 125 the dr of both cases begin to reduce quickly when r e 200 the full slip case with a dr of nearly 5 8 even obtains a much lower negative drag reduction compared with the fore flank case with a dr of nearly 3 8 as displayed in fig 12 a turning point for the friction drag coefficient c d f at 125 r e 175 can be observed at this point c d f becomes negative for the three cases which is caused by the shift of the separation points from the rear corners to the front corners sohankar et al 1998 this changing of separation points not only alters the flow patterns near the cylinder but also influences the pressure distributions near the cylinder as a result the pressure drag and the friction drag are affected in addition when r e 125 the presence of slip boundaries enlarge the pressure compared with the no slip case with slightly changed c d f the total drag increases for the fore flank and full slip case as we know the only difference between the fore flank case and the full slip is the absence of the slip boundary condition on the aft side of the cylinder as we have analyzed in section 3 2 1 that the aft side slip has negative effect on the pressure reduction this negative influences on the pressure reduction becomes larger when r e 125 leading to a much higher pressure for the full slip case than that for the fore flank case shown in fig 12 therefore though gains higher dr than the fore flank case when r e 125 the full slip obtains much lower negative dr compared with the fore flank case when r e 125 in the next section we will investigate the flow past two tandem square cylinders the presence of a downstream cylinder will affect the flow after the upstream cylinder with different gap ratios l d and slip distributions in a dissimilar way 3 3 flow past two square cylinders in tandem arrangement in the previous subsection we investigated the flow past a square cylinder with different slip distributions next we will consider the flow past two tandem square cylinders with different slip distributions the sketch of the flow past two tandem square cylinders is showed in fig 13 the computational domain the boundary conditions and the simulation parameters are the same with the single cylinder cases some surfaces of the cylinders will be set as slip boundaries during the simulations as shown in fig 13 the left cylinder upstream cylinder is marked as a and the right cylinder downstream cylinder is marked as b we apply the slip boundary condition to the cylinder a and cylinder b with different slip distributions similar to the single cylinder cases respectively for each of the square cylinders there is seven different slip distributions described in section 3 2 in addition to these cases the full slip all the edges of the a and b cylinders are imposed with slip boundary conditions and the no slip case are also simulated hence there are totally sixteen different slip distributions these cases are marked as a fore a cylinder with slip on its fore edge b fore b cylinder with slip on its fore edge and so on we also investigate the influence of different gap ratios l d where l is the center to center distance between two cylinders between the upstream cylinder a and the downstream cylinder b six kind of gap ratios l d 2 3 4 5 6 7 are considered for the full slip and the no slip cases three kind of gap ratios l d 3 5 7 are adopted for the other slip distributions 3 3 1 the effect of the full slip boundary condition at r e 100 to begin with we analyze the influence of the full slip boundary and gap ratios on the flow past two tandem cylinders the comparison of the vorticity contours between the no slip and full slip case are shown in fig 14 from fig 14 two flow patterns which are also confirmed by zhao et al 2016 can be observed for the cases with l d 2 3 4 the vortex shedding only arises behind the downstream cylinder and the two cylinders are enclosed by the shear layers this flow pattern is marked as mode i for the cases with l d 5 6 7 the vortex shedding is induced on both of the cylinders this flow pattern is marked as mode ii for the cases with l d 2 3 4 the gaps between the two cylinders are relatively small and confine the detachment and the shedding of the vortex zhang et al 2019 therefore two cylinders behave like a bluff body and the vortex sheds after the wake of the downstream cylinder b fig 14 a c illustrate the streamlines for l d 2 3 4 when l d 2 there is a steady recirculation region behind the cylinder a as the increase of the l d the length of the recirculation region becomes larger l d 3 and the region even becomes unsteady l d 4 which makes the vortex formation length shorter compared with the steady cases l d 2 3 when l d 5 the vortex sheds from the upstream cylinder a the gap between two cylinders in this case is not long enough for the vortex to fully develop thus before the vortex detaches from the cylinder a completely it arrives at the cylinder b then the vortex sheds from the cylinder b and forms a double vortex streets the intense interactions between the vortices generated in the gap and the flow near the cylinder b lead to the perturbed wake flow with vortices of irregular shapes when l d 6 the gap between the two cylinders becomes long enough allowing the full development of the vortex shedding from the rear sharp corners of the cylinder a then this vortex arrives at the cylinder b that is to say the initial vortex shedding does not influenced by the cylinder b the wake flow after cylinder b is also disturbed and the shapes of the vortices are more irregular near the cylinder b when l d 7 there is more room for the vortex shedding from the cylinder a to develop before arriving at the cylinder b in this case the vortices shed in a more fast frequency and the distance between the vortices in the downstream become smaller as a result merging between adjacent vortices occurs and a long chain of vortices forms as shown in fig 14 f by contrast from the vorticity contours and streamlines of fig 14 the full slip boundary only influences the local flow field near the cylinders therefore the full slip cases share similar flow patterns with the no slip cases for different gap ratios however due to the presence of slip more vortices after the cylinder b merge together for the full slip case than that for the no slip case with l d 7 as presented in the right side of fig 14 f the reason for this phenomenon is that the full slip boundary condition reduces the amplitude of the lift coefficient on the cylinder b refer to fig 15 making the vortices shed from the cylinder b in a not so violent way as a result vortices move with a little bit decreased velocities as the vortices shed from the cylinder b continuously more vortices merge together compared with the no slip case at l d 7 fig 15 shows the time evolution of the drag and lift coefficients for the cases with no slip and full slip at different gap ratios as displayed in fig 15 a c the flow fields suggest mode i pattern with nearly constant drag coefficients for the upstream cylinder a the amplitudes of the lift coefficients are very small in these cases since there are no vortices shed from the cylinder a the results imply that the cylinder a endures an almost constant drag force when it comes to the downstream cylinder b the drag coefficient approaches zero and the lift coefficient fluctuates sinusoidally the nearly zero drag coefficient is caused by the negative pressures on both the fore and aft side of the cylinder b zhao et al 2016 in fig 15 d f the flow fields suggest mode ii pattern both of the cylinder a and cylinder b endure larger amplitudes and mean values for the drag and lift coefficients compared with the cases in fig 15 a c undergoing such intenser forces in mode ii these two cylinders may have fatigue failure much easier in addition all the cases in fig 15 suggest that the amplitudes of the lift coefficients of the downstream cylinder b are larger than those of the upstream cylinder a that means the transverse vibrations of the vortices have more impact on the cylinder b since the vortices shed from the cylinder b at last compare the no slip and full slip cases shown in fig 15 we can see that the full slip boundary condition reduces the lift coefficients a little entirely fig 16 depicts the drag reduction for the flow past two tandem cylinders with full slip in fig 16 except for the downstream cylinder with l d 4 all the cases for the two cylinders gain positive drag reductions table 5 compares the average total drag pressure and friction on both cylinders for the no slip and the full slip cases at different gap ratios the numerical c d at l d 6 from open literatures sohankar and etminan 2009 chatterjee and mondal 2012 are also listed and good agreements are met take a look at the tables 3 and 5 we can find that the effect of the full slip on the upstream cylinder a is very similar to that of the single cylinder cases in section 3 2 1 the average c d of the upstream cylinder are generally lower than that for the single cylinder cases which suggests that the presence of the downstream cylinder alleviates the intense of the wake flow after the upstream cylinder to some extent setting a downstream cylinder might be a kind of efficient method to reduce drag when it comes to the downstream cylinder b at l d 4 the cylinder b endures a negative drag the full slip boundaries in these cases increase the pressure of the aft pressure e g l d 3 in fig 18 a leading to the augment of the pressure with a mildly changed friction drag the total drag increase when l d 4 the dr even reaches 64 when l d 4 however absolute value of the c d is relatively small for this case though with a dr of 64 the actual variation of the drag is relatively small in comparison with that of the cylinder a when l d 4 drs on the downstream cylinder become positive and generally higher than that of the downstream cylinder the effects of full slip boundaries on the pressure and friction drag are similar on both the cylinders from the above analysis the full slip benefits the dr for both the cylinders except the downstream cylinder when l d 4 therefore when l d 4 the full slip boundary conditions may be not a good choice for the downstream cylinder in the next subsection we will explore the impact of different slip distributions on the flow field on the drag and the lift coefficients of the two cylinders more deeply since the cases with l d 2 3 4 and l d 6 7 share similar flow patterns respectively we will investigate the influence of gap ratio l d 3 5 7 for the other slip distribution cases 3 3 2 the effect of different slip distributions at r e 100 next we investigate the influence of different slip distributions on the tandem square cylinders at r e 100 fig 17 displays the vorticity contours of the flow past two tandem cylinders with some typical slip distributions compared with the no slip case with corresponding gap ratios shown in fig 14 vorticity contours of various cases with different slip distributions show similar patterns but have minor differences in most of the cases for example phases of the vortex shedding are different for different slip distributions however for l d 7 the vortices after the cylinder b for the a aft a flank aft a fore flank and a full cases merge into longer chains than those for the no slip case especially for the a full case when l d 7 the a full case presents two long chains of vortices after the wake of the downstream cylinder b the reason for this phenomenon is similar to the explanation for the full slip case in section 3 3 1 vortices shed from the cylinder b with the a full case more gently compared with the full slip case and merge with the vortices in the wake flow successively as shown in table 6 we can see that the cylinder a endures generally higher average drag coefficients than the downstream cylinder b in each case with different gap ratios and slip distributions however the drag coefficients on the cylinder b vibrate more violently than those on the cylinder a similar to the full slip case shown in fig 15 the interactions between the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder cause the fluctuations on the downstream cylinder more severe sohankar and etminan 2009 moreover we focus on the average drag coefficients of some typical cases fig 19 displays the drag reduction for the tandem cylinders with different distributions at r e 100 fig 18 compares the normalized pressure coefficients on the fore and aft sides of the cylinder a and cylinder b with some typical slip distributions in general different slip distributions have similar effects on the upstream cylinder with the single cylinder cases however their performance on the dr are different on the downstream cylinder at different gap ratios l d as shown in fig 19 the a fore flank a full a flank full slip cases endure positive drs on both the cylinders except for the downstream cylinder when l d 3 on the contrary the b fore flank b full b flank b flank aft lead to negative drs on both the cylinders except for the downstream cylinder when l d 3 then we discuss the performance of the a full and b full cases on the downstream cylinder at l d 3 when l d 3 the a full case has a dr of 28 47 on the downstream cylinder while the b full cases has a dr of 13 18 at l d 3 the flow pattern is mode i in mode i there is no vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder and the downstream endures a negative pressure as shown in tables 5 and 6 the a full case has a relatively large augmentation in pressure which is mainly caused by the increase of the fore side pressure on the downstream cylinder fig 18 a this pressure augmentation contributes to the negative dr the b full case has a decrease in pressure which is mainly arisen by the reduction in the fore side pressure on the downstream cylinder fig 18 d this pressure reduction contributes to the large portion of the dr from the above analysis whether slip boundaries are applied to the upstream cylinder or the downstream cylinder larger impacts e g drag reduction on the downstream cylinder than on the upstream cylinder are observed that is to say the downstream cylinder is more sensitive to the change of slip configurations if the drag reduction on the upstream cylinder is the main focus the a fore flank a full and full slip cases are the recommended schemes if the drag reduction on the downstream cylinder is the main concern the b flank b flank aft and b full are the recommended schemes for l d 5 while the a fore flank a full and the full slip are recommended for l d 5 3 3 3 two typical slip distributions for the tandem cylinders at various reynolds numbers finally we investigate the a fore flank and full slip cases at various reynolds numbers and compare the results with the no slip cases fig 20 displays the average drag coefficient c d on the upstream and the downstream cylinders at various reynolds numbers and gap ratios in fig 20 a the general tendencies of the c d on the upstream cylinder a for the three cases no slip a fore flank full slip are similar to those of the single cylinder cases fig 10 at low reynolds numbers r e 50 as shown in fig 21 a the average drag coefficient c d on the upstream cylinder decreases with the augment of the gap ratio l d 3 5 7 for 50 r e 100 c d increases with the gap ratio when r e 100 c d at l d 5 goes higher than that at l d 7 and 3 on the other hand the a fore flank and full slip cases obtain very approaching dr performance for the upstream cylinder and their changing tendency are similar as the increase of the reynolds number when r e 125 drs of these two cases begin to descend and become negative very similar to the single cylinder cases discussed in section 3 2 2 it should be noticed that when r e 50 drs of the a fore flank and the full slip cases drop sharply which corresponds to a change of the flow state from a steady state to an unsteady state with karman vortex streets for the downstream cylinder as presented in fig 20 b when r e 75 c d increases as the gap ratio however when r e 75 maximum c d appears at l d 5 in addition c d of the downstream cylinder b has a greater change than that of the upstream cylinder a when l d 5 and 7 this phenomenon can also be observed in fig 21 b which suggests that with a fore flank and full slip boundary dr of the downstream cylinder at different gap ratios changes from nearly 50 to 100 the a fore flank boundary shows better dr than the full slip boundary in most cases especially at r e 75 and l d 3 when r e 75 and l d 3 the a fore flank case shows a dr of nearly 100 while the full slip case has a dr of nearly 50 in fact c d for these two cases are negative and have very small absolute values though with a dr approximating 100 the absolute value of drag reduction with a fore flank boundary is small nevertheless this phenomenon still suggests the pronounced impact introduced by different slip distributions under different flow configurations from the above analysis at different reynolds numbers the downstream cylinder is more sensitive to slip distributions similar to the conclusions at r e 100 in section 3 3 2 this feature can be utilized to control the flow near the downstream cylinder 4 conclusion in this paper we investigated the flows past a single square cylinder and two tandem square cylinders at low reynolds numbers 25 200 mainly at 100 under different slip distributions using the lattice boltzmann method the influences of the slip distributions were analyzed the following conclusions were made 1 slip on the flank side of the single cylinder commonly reduces the friction drag contributing to a large portion of the dr at r e 100 the full slip case gains the best dr of 3 5 however this dr of 3 5 is indeed not a big difference 2 the frequency of the vortex shedding is insensitive to the change of the slip distributions at r e 25 200 at higher reynolds number r e 125 the fore flank and full slip begin to increase drag which are mainly caused by the pressure augmentation 3 the upstream cylinder shares similar tendencies with the single cylinder cases as the reynolds number r e 25 200 the downstream cylinder is more sensitive to the change of slip distributions with a dr of nearly 50 in minimum 100 in maximum 4 at r e 100 the a full slip a fore flank and full slip have positive dr on both the upstream and downstream cylinders with different gap ratios except for the downstream cylinder when l d 4 on the contrary the b full slip b fore flank and b flank aft slip endure negative dr on both the cylinders except for the downstream cylinder when l d 4 these findings will serve as a guidance for the flow control through carefully distributing slip boundaries on the cylinders under different flow configurations we could explore the possibilities to achieve desired control to the flow however the slip boundary condition is applied on the full length of the edges of the cylinder in current study besides current research concentrates on a typical slip length thus the effect of the partial slip on edges of the cylinder and the influence of slip length will be explored in future studies on the other hand this work is implemented in two dimension the flow past bluff bodies at higher reynolds numbers usually indicts three dimensional characteristics future studies will proceed in three dimension with higher reynolds numbers credit authorship contribution statement yang yu methodology software writing original draft writing review editing liuming yang

20355,slip distributions have been proved to have significant influence on the flow past cylinder problems however rare studies focus on the square cylinders to obtain better understanding of the effect of slip distributions on the flow past square cylinder problems that widely appear in the engineering fields the flows past a single square cylinder and two tandem square cylinders under different slip distributions and gap ratios are numerically investigated using the lattice boltzmann method at low reynolds numbers 25 200 mainly at 100 the flow structures and drag properties including the friction drag and the pressure drag are analyzed various slip distributions are found to have minor impacts on the drag reduction of a single cylinder 3 5 in maximum but larger impacts on that of the tandem cylinders especially the downstream cylinder 100 in maximum in addition flank side slip is found to have important contributions to the drag reduction keywords slip distribution drag reduction flow control flow past cylinders tandem square cylinders lattice boltzmann 1 introduction during the past decades the flow past bluff bodies has attracted great attentions besides its academic interests this flow phenomenon associates with technical problems involving heat transfer energy conservation structural design and flow control which is related to many applications in ocean platforms buildings bridges submerged pipelines chimneys towers and so on sohankar et al 1998 square and circular cylinders are the most widely studied bluff bodies for the flow past a square cylinder the separation points are fixed on the corner points of the cylinder however the separation points of the flow past a circular cylinder are time dependent according to flow conditions yoon et al 2010 to realize the delay of separations for a circular cylinder is much more easily and could be used to fulfill the reduction of the drag lift or even vibrations recently researchers have found that slip boundaries e g superhydrophobic surfaces are good alternatives to achieve this end rothstein 2009 bixler and bhushan 2013 dey et al 2014 seo and garcía mayoral 2018 therefore various experimental studies have been performed to access the influence of slip boundaries on circular cylinders for example muralidhar et al 2011 examined the effect of superhydrophobic induced slip on the flow past a circular cylinder and found that the superhydrophobic cylinder can notably delay the onset of the vortex shedding and lengthen the recirculation region in the wake of the cylinder daniello et al 2013 also studied the influence of superhydrophobic surfaces on the vortex induced vibrations at r e 1300 2300 and obtained obvious reduction in rms root mean square lift up to 15 with an ignorable reduction in drag kim et al 2015 gained 40 reduction in the size of the recirculation bubble and less than 10 reduction in drag besides the experimental researches numerical investigations have also presented the probability of delaying separations and reducing drag around a circular cylinder with slip configurations legendre et al 2009 examined the impact of slip on the wake dynamics for the flow past a circular cylinder at r e 5 800 they found that slip can postpone the onset of recirculation and shedding in the wake reduce the drag and lift forces and increase the shedding frequency in addition you and moin 2007 accessed the effect of alternating slip boundaries on the circular cylinder seo and song 2012 studied the effect of partial slip boundaries on the circular cylinder and gruncell et al 2013 performed two phase simulations to investigate the laminar flow across a superhydrophobic sphere with surface textures plastron they all found that slip configurations could suppress flow separations and reduce drag furthermore li et al 2014 investigated the effect of five symmetric slip boundary configurations on the flow past a circular cylinder with the reynolds numbers in the range of 100 to 500 among the five slip boundaries the flank slip configuration shows the best effect for drag reduction more recently huang et al 2018 inspected the influence of the dimensionless slip length on the total friction and pressure drag coefficients for the flow r e 60 80 past a hydrophobic circular cylinder the friction drag are found to contribute major part of drag reduction at low reynolds r e 100 and small slip length l s 0 02 while the pressure drag at moderate reynolds number and slip length although some researchers have explored the effect of slip distributions on the flow past circular cylinders rare studies focus on the square cylinders since square cylinders have been widely used among the engineering fields investigations on the influence of slip distributions on the square cylinders will strengthen our understanding towards the mechanism of how slip affects the flow fields near the square cylinders and further fulfill desired control to flow fields for example adopting slip distributions on bluff bodies in a microfluidic device to improve the mixing and heat transfer efficiency you and moin 2007 as discussed above we can figure out that the key mechanism why slip boundaries on a circular cylinder can reduce drag is that slip can decrease the adverse pressure gradient in the boundary layer which leads to the delay or suppression of separations li et al 2014 however for a square cylinder no obvious mechanism is currently present since the separation of a square cylinder happens at fixed points which makes the research on the square cylinder with slip challenging even so we still can figure out useful information by carefully analyzing the flow structures the total drag including the friction and pressure drag for the flow past square cylinders problems under different slip distributions the interpretations of slip distributions with obvious influence on the drag or the flow state will provide valuable information to guide the fulfillment of desired flow control the lattice boltzmann lbm is a newly developed method and derived from the boltzmann equation lbm has now been extensively studied due to its kinetic nature nature parallelism and the ability to handle complex boundaries in an easy way chen and doolen 1998 owning to these merits lbm has been extended to various fields chen and doolen 1998 succi 2001 aidun and clausen 2009 it is also suitable for the simulation of the flow past bluff bodies with slip boundaries wang et al 2018b succi 2002 wang et al 2018a yang et al 2018 therefore in this work taking the advantages of the lattice boltzmann method we investigate the effect of slip distributions on the flows past a square cylinder and two tandem cylinders at low reynolds numbers 25 200 mainly at 100 we consider eight types of slip distributions namely no slip fore slip flank slip aft slip fore flank slip fore aft slip flank aft slip and full slip for the flow past a cylinder in addition sixteen kinds of slip distributions are studied for the flow past two tandem cylinders with these simulations we analyze how these slip configurations influence the wake vortex shedding and the drag including the pressure drag and the friction drag and lift coefficients of the flows past a cylinder and two tandem cylinders these studies may serve as a guidance for desired flow control e g reducing drag by carefully distributing slip boundaries on cylinders the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the general concepts of the lattice boltzmann method and the slip boundary conditions in lbm in section 3 numerical results with various types of slip distributions are shown and some discussions are presented section 4 makes the conclusion 2 numerical methods 2 1 the lattice boltzmann method different from the continuum nature of the conventional computational fluid dynamics cfd methods the lattice boltzmann method lbm derives from the discrete boltzmann equation aidun and clausen 2009 to model fluid flow field the physical space in lbm is evenly discretized as a regular grid called lattice the time step is dependent on the space step and is chosen to ensure that fluid particles can only stream to adjacent lattice nodes or stay stationary within one time step lbm has second order accuracy both in space and time chen and doolen 1998 in general a lattice boltzmann equation lbe model includes three elements an evolution equation discrete velocities of fluid particles and the lattice structure square regular grid in two dimension the lbe describes the movement of distribution functions of fluid particles on a fixed lattice guo and shu 2013 an evolution equation depicts the interactions between fluid particles the most common evolution equation is the bhatnagar gross krook bgk operator bhatnagar et al 1954 1 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t 1 τ f i x t f i e q x t where f i x t represents the distribution function df at position x and time t with a particle velocity e i along the i th direction of the lattice f i e q is the equilibrium distribution function δ t is the time step and τ is the relaxation time the movements of the particles on lattice nodes obey the rules determined by a lattice model which defines discrete velocities of these particles the most common model for a two dimension 2d simulation is the d2q9 model a square lattice with nine discrete velocity directions qian et al 1992 which has the following velocity directions e i for particles fig 1 2 e i 0 0 i 0 cos i 1 π 2 sin i 1 π 2 c i 1 4 2 cos 2 i 1 π 4 sin 2 i 1 π 4 c i 5 8 where c δ x δ t is the lattice speed and δ x is the space step the equilibrium distribution function adopted in the d2q9 model is qian et al 1992 3 f i e q ω i ρ 1 e i u c s 2 e i u 2 2 c s 4 u 2 2 c s 2 where ω i is the weight parameter ω i 4 9 i 0 1 9 i 1 4 1 36 i 5 8 ρ is the fluid density u is the fluid velocity and c s c 3 is the sound speed through the moments of the distribution functions macroscopic variables ρ and u on a lattice node can be obtained using 4 ρ i f i ρ u i e i f i in addition the pressure can be obtained 5 p ρ c s 2 utilizing the chapman enskog expansion multi scaling expansion we can derive the macro navier stokes equations from the lbm up to second order if setting the relaxation time τ in the eq 1 as guo et al 2000 6 τ ν c s 2 δ t 1 2 where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid we also have 7 ν τ 1 2 c s 2 δ t the evolution equation eq 1 is composed of two steps the collision step and the streaming step 8 collision f i x t f i x t 1 τ f i x t f i e q x t streaming f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t with appropriate boundary conditions related descriptions will be presented in section 2 2 lbm executes the collision and streaming steps repeatedly and the evolution of a fluid can be simulated 2 2 slip boundary conditions in the lbm lbm simulates the fluid flow through the evolution of distribution functions on a boundary node after a collision step some distribution functions are unknown to ensure the validness of the simulation these unknown distribution functions need to be reconstructed according to a specific boundary condition the most common boundary condition for a no slip wall is the bounce back scheme ziegler 1993 chen et al 1996 including the standard the modified and the half way methods slip boundary can be achieved on the basis of the bounce back scheme the combination of the half way bounce back and specular reflection hbsr scheme succi 2002 karimipour et al 2012 is one of these slip boundary schemes and has been successfully applied to various gas and liquid flows with slip wang et al 2018a yang et al 2018 2019 this paper adopts the hbsr scheme to realize slip boundary conditions fig 2 depicts the boundary arrangement of the hbsr scheme in the d2q9 model taking bottom boundary for example as we can see f 2 f 5 and f 6 are unknown and can be reconstructed with yang et al 2018 9 f 2 f 4 f 5 r f 7 1 r f 8 f 6 r f 8 1 r f 7 where r is the combination parameter in the liquid flow slip boundary conditions are usually achieved via the slip length the concept of the slip length fig 3 is firstly proposed by navier 1823 the navier s slip model is defined as navier 1823 10 u s b u n w a l l where u s represents the slip velocity on the wall b is the slip length and u n is the gradient of velocity along the normal direction of wall with the navier s slip model the following relationship between the combination parameter r in eq 9 and the slip length b can be obtained yang et al 2018 wang et al 2018a 11 r 1 1 2 b 2 τ 1 validations of the slip boundary conditions eqs 9 and 11 have been made by wang et al 2018a and yang et al 2018 through a series of numerical simulations including the couette flow the force driven poiseuille flow the unsteady womersley flow and the cylindrical couette flow 3 numerical results and discussions this section will implement and analyze the flow past square cylinder problems as confirmed by various researches that the flow past cylinders with a reynolds number r e 200 is still in a laminar state and shows two dimensional features jackson 1987 wen and lin 2001 sanyal and dhiman 2017 ma et al 2017 huang et al 2018 simulations in current study are all proceeded in two dimension 3 1 grid independence check in this section flow past a single square cylinder is considered with a reynolds number r e 100 the sketch of this flow is showed in fig 4 the size of the computational domain is 51 d 30 d d is the side length of the square cylinder the boundary conditions of the problem are inlet u u v 0 outlet u x v x 0 bottom and top u y 0 v 0 square cylinders u v 0 where u is the inlet velocity constant in current study u is the velocity along the x direction and v is the velocity along the y direction the reynolds number is 12 r e u d ν the drag and lift coefficients are defined as 13 c d f d 0 5 u 2 d c l f l 0 5 u 2 d where f d is the total drag force on the cylinder and f l is the total lift force on the cylinder f d and f l are calculated using the momentum exchange method ladd and verberg 2001 chen et al 2013 the average drag coefficient is defined as 14 c d 1 n i 1 n c d i where n is the number of samples and c d i is the i th selected drag coefficient the strouhal number is defined as 15 s t f l c u c where f is the frequency of the vortex shedding l c is the characteristic length and u c is the characteristic velocity in current study l c is taken as the side length of the square cylinder d and u c is taken as the inlet velocity u f can be obtained via the fast fourier transform fft of the lift coefficients all the parameters during the simulations are converted to lattice units δ x 1 δ t 1 u is set as 0 01 the initial density ρ of the flow field is set as 1 0 then we take the grid independence test with the dimension of the square cylinder side length d as 10 20 30 respectively the mean drag coefficients c d and the strouhal numbers are shown in table 1 from table 1 we can see that the cylinder with a grid of 20 has only 1 9 difference with the case of grid 30 and agrees well with the results in literatures shown in table 1 therefore we will adopt the grid of the cylinder side length d as 20 for r e 125 in the following simulations furthermore we adopt the recommended procedure by celik et al 2008 to analysis the discretization error for this problem since lbm uses a regular grid the representative grid size h is 2d 16 h 1 n i 1 n δ a i 1 2 1 n i 1 n δ x 2 1 2 δ x where δ a i is the area of the i th cell and n is the total number of cells used for the computation therefore the grid refinement factor r h c o a r s e h f i n e for the three cases are 17 r 21 1 20 1 30 1 5 r 32 1 10 1 20 2 0 the total number of cells for the three cases are 18 n 1 1 377 000 n 2 612 000 n 3 153 000 then the apparent order p is 19a p 1 l n r 21 l n ɛ 32 ɛ 21 q p 19b q p l n r 21 p s r 32 p s 19c s s g n ɛ 32 ɛ 21 where ɛ 32 ϕ 3 ϕ 2 ɛ 21 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 and p can solved using a fixed point iteration with p we can obtain the extrapolated values ϕ e x t 21 20 ϕ e x t 21 r 21 p ϕ 1 ϕ 2 r 21 p 1 the approximate relative error e α 21 21 e α 21 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 1 the extrapolated relative error e e x t 21 22 e e x t 21 ϕ e x t 21 ϕ 1 ϕ e x t 21 and the fine grid convergence index g c i f i n e 21 23 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e α 21 r 21 p 1 table 2 shows the above procedure to calculate the discretization error according to table 2 the numerical uncertainty in the fine grid solution for the average drag coefficient c d is 3 7 which is acceptable for the practical application as the same manner we implement the grid test for r e 150 200 for r e 150 the difference of mean c d between the grid of 30 and the grid of 40 is 1 53 for r e 200 the difference of mean c d between the grid of 40 and the grid of 50 is 1 48 therefore we adopt the grid of 30 for r e 150 and the grid of 40 for r e 175 200 in the following simulations 3 2 the effect of slip distributions on the flow past a square cylinder in this section the flow past a single square cylinder with different slip distributions is explored eight slip distributions no slip full slip fore slip flank slip aft slip fore flank fore aft slip and flank aft slip are considered in the following simulations which are shown in fig 5 all the cases are symmetrical to the center axis along the inflow direction for different slip distributions the slip length b is taken as 0 05 d the dimensionless slip length is defined as b b d b 0 05 for all the cases in this paper to analyze the influence of slip boundary on the drag of the single cylinder the relative drag reduction dr is defined as 24 d r 100 c d n o s l i p c d c d n o s l i p in addition the relative lift reduction lr is defined as 25 l r 100 c l n o s l i p c l c l n o s l i p the total drag coefficient c d is the combination of the friction drag coefficient c d f and the pressure drag coefficient c d p 26 c d c d f c d p the pressure drag coefficient is calculated by 27 c d p 0 d p f o r e p a f t d x 0 5 ρ u 2 d where the p f o r e and p a f t are the pressure on the fore side and the aft side edge of the cylinder respectively the sketch of the pressure drag calculation is shown in fig 6 the friction drag coefficient is obtained by c d f c d c d p in the following simulations the average c d f and c d p are denoted as c d f and c d p respectively similar to c d defined in eq 14 3 2 1 the effect of slip distributions at r e 100 instantaneous vorticity contours of the flow past a single cylinder with different slip distributions at r e 100 are presented in fig 7 from fig 7 we can observe that the shear layers separate from the up rear corner point and the down rear corner point alternately a group of karman vortex streets is formed and the vortices rotate vortices above rotate clockwise while vortices below counterclockwise sketched in fig 8 and move downstream separately without coalescence and disturbance between each other as we can see except for the slightly different phase of the shedding vortices the differences between the slip cases with the no slip case are not so obvious fig 9 displays the time evolution of the drag coefficients and lift coefficients for the flow past a single cylinder with different slip distributions from fig 9 observable influence of the slip distributions on the drag coefficients could be found for example in fig 9 g the drag coefficient curve of the full slip case in solid line is much lower than that of the no slip case in dashed line suggesting a positive dr when it comes to the lift coefficient curve in fig 9 g apparent phase lag is spotted in addition the amplitude of the lift coefficient curve also has evident change however the period of the lift coefficient curve is almost unchanged which confirmed by the nearly unchanged s t of various cases with different slip distributions in table 3 that is to say the vortex shedding frequency the strouhal number is insensitive to the change of the slip distributions in current simulations at r e 100 at r e 100 the separation points of the flow at different time periods are on the corners of the aft side of the cylinder sohankar et al 1999 sen et al 2011 slip boundary in current simulations cannot alter the positions of these separation points therefore the frequency of the vortex shedding keeps unchanged under the effect of slip table 3 compares the average drag coefficients with different slip distributions indicating that different slip configurations have a relatively obvious impact on the drag of the cylinder in detail the full slip case gains the largest dr while the fore case gains the smallest dr even negative for the cases with slip boundary on the fore side and the aft side negative drs are observed in contrary the flank case gains a positive dr the combination of the fore and aft slip boundary receives a negative dr between the fore case and the aft case the union of the fore slip and the flank slip boundary the aft slip and the flank slip boundary show positive drs the fore flank case gains a dr of 3 27 very close to the dr 3 49 of the full slip case slip boundary conditions could generate slip velocity on the boundary and decrease the velocity gradient along the normal direction of the boundary if the tangential direction of the boundary has a component along the direction of the friction drag the friction drag could be reduced in addition the velocity gradient can also alter the pressure distributions near the boundary leading to the variation of the pressure drag for the square cylinder with a horizontal inflow the total drag is contributed by the friction drag arisen on the flank top and bottom sides and the pressure drag arisen on the fore left and aft right sides the relative changes of the friction drag and the pressure drag determine whether the total drag increases or not as shown in table 4 the pressure drag takes up the most portion of the total drag 90 while the effect of the friction drag is relatively small as shown in table 4 a large portion of the dr for the flank case has been contributed by the friction reduction 73 since the flank edges are along the direction of drag for the square cylinder the flank slip on the cylinder mainly reduces the friction drag in addition to a slightly change on the pressure drag in the same manner with the presence of the flank side slip the fore flank the flank aft and the full slip cases are all have a relatively high amount friction reduction 40 slightly lower than that of the flank case the fore slip or the aft slip cases have mild but negative influence on the drag reduction the addition of the fore side slip or the aft side slip to the flank side slip slightly increases the velocity gradient along the normal direction of the flank boundary leading to the mildly decrease of the friction reduction compared with the flank case though the total drags of the fore flank and aft flank cases both reduce mainly due to the pressure reduction the fore flank case endures a higher pressure reduction having slip on the fore flank side is more benefit for the pressure reduction than on the flank aft side a possible reason for this phenomenon is that the uniform slip boundary conditions e g fore flank from the fore edge to the flank edge along the flow direction make the transition of the velocity and pressure relatively mild compared with the slip no slip e g fore or the no slip slip e g flank cases the pressure difference between the fore and aft side of the fore flank case is also lower than that of the flank aft case in the same manner the fore flank aft slip full slip should endure the highest pressure reduction which suggested in table 4 though the friction drag augments slightly compared with the fore flank case the total drag gains further reduction furthermore we can also see that the aforementioned cases with flank slip commonly reduce friction drags contributing to a large portion of the dr this observation agrees with the findings of li et al 2014 when exploring the influence of slip distributions on a circular cylinder table 3 also compares the maximum lift coefficients with different slip distributions from table 3 the maximum lift coefficients share the same trend with the drag coefficients except the fore aft case the fore aft case gains a negative dr but a positive lr in addition the flank case the fore flank case and the full slip case all obtains lr higher than 9 similar to the dr the flank side slip also contributes to a large portion of the lr lr 17 639 in maximum vs dr 3 489 in maximum from the above analysis we can find that imposing slip boundaries on the fore and flank side of the cylinder are more efficient to change the local flow field for the purpose of drag reduction the full slip and the fore flank slip are the most recommended schemes when it comes to the flow past a single cylinder still the full slip case gains the best dr and the best lr and the differences between the full slip and the fore flank are 0 22 for dr and 1 8 for lr respectively however since the numerical uncertainty for the c d obtained in section 3 1 is 3 7 and the numerical results cited in table 1 have a margin on c d approaching 3 5 the dr of 3 5 is indeed not a big difference even so the relative differences between different slip distributions are still good references for further examining the effect of slip distributions on the two tandem cases 3 2 2 two typical slip distributions for the single cylinder at various reynolds numbers then we investigate the fore flank and full slip cases at various reynolds numbers and compare the results with the no slip case fig 10 shows the average drag coefficients c d and the strouhal number s t for these slip distributions under the reynolds numbers from 25 to 200 comparisons of the current results with the experimental data okajima 1995 norberg 1993 and the numerical data franke et al 1990 sohankar et al 1995 ma et al 2017 are also presented in general our results can capture the similar tendencies for the average drag coefficient c d and the strouhal number s t within the simulated range of the reynolds numbers in addition c d of current simulation has a minimum within the range of 125 r e 175 just similar to the results in the literatures cited in fig 10 fig 10 b also suggests that the fore flank and full slip conditions have nearly no influence on the s t compared with the no slip cases within the simulated reynolds numbers from 25 to 200 which agrees with the conclusions for r e 100 in section 3 2 1 when it comes to the drag reduction shown in fig 11 the drs of the full slip cases are better than those of the fore flank cases in general and rise almost in a concurrent pace as the reynolds number when r e 125 suggesting a similar tendency with the results in section 3 2 1 however when r e 125 the dr of both cases begin to reduce quickly when r e 200 the full slip case with a dr of nearly 5 8 even obtains a much lower negative drag reduction compared with the fore flank case with a dr of nearly 3 8 as displayed in fig 12 a turning point for the friction drag coefficient c d f at 125 r e 175 can be observed at this point c d f becomes negative for the three cases which is caused by the shift of the separation points from the rear corners to the front corners sohankar et al 1998 this changing of separation points not only alters the flow patterns near the cylinder but also influences the pressure distributions near the cylinder as a result the pressure drag and the friction drag are affected in addition when r e 125 the presence of slip boundaries enlarge the pressure compared with the no slip case with slightly changed c d f the total drag increases for the fore flank and full slip case as we know the only difference between the fore flank case and the full slip is the absence of the slip boundary condition on the aft side of the cylinder as we have analyzed in section 3 2 1 that the aft side slip has negative effect on the pressure reduction this negative influences on the pressure reduction becomes larger when r e 125 leading to a much higher pressure for the full slip case than that for the fore flank case shown in fig 12 therefore though gains higher dr than the fore flank case when r e 125 the full slip obtains much lower negative dr compared with the fore flank case when r e 125 in the next section we will investigate the flow past two tandem square cylinders the presence of a downstream cylinder will affect the flow after the upstream cylinder with different gap ratios l d and slip distributions in a dissimilar way 3 3 flow past two square cylinders in tandem arrangement in the previous subsection we investigated the flow past a square cylinder with different slip distributions next we will consider the flow past two tandem square cylinders with different slip distributions the sketch of the flow past two tandem square cylinders is showed in fig 13 the computational domain the boundary conditions and the simulation parameters are the same with the single cylinder cases some surfaces of the cylinders will be set as slip boundaries during the simulations as shown in fig 13 the left cylinder upstream cylinder is marked as a and the right cylinder downstream cylinder is marked as b we apply the slip boundary condition to the cylinder a and cylinder b with different slip distributions similar to the single cylinder cases respectively for each of the square cylinders there is seven different slip distributions described in section 3 2 in addition to these cases the full slip all the edges of the a and b cylinders are imposed with slip boundary conditions and the no slip case are also simulated hence there are totally sixteen different slip distributions these cases are marked as a fore a cylinder with slip on its fore edge b fore b cylinder with slip on its fore edge and so on we also investigate the influence of different gap ratios l d where l is the center to center distance between two cylinders between the upstream cylinder a and the downstream cylinder b six kind of gap ratios l d 2 3 4 5 6 7 are considered for the full slip and the no slip cases three kind of gap ratios l d 3 5 7 are adopted for the other slip distributions 3 3 1 the effect of the full slip boundary condition at r e 100 to begin with we analyze the influence of the full slip boundary and gap ratios on the flow past two tandem cylinders the comparison of the vorticity contours between the no slip and full slip case are shown in fig 14 from fig 14 two flow patterns which are also confirmed by zhao et al 2016 can be observed for the cases with l d 2 3 4 the vortex shedding only arises behind the downstream cylinder and the two cylinders are enclosed by the shear layers this flow pattern is marked as mode i for the cases with l d 5 6 7 the vortex shedding is induced on both of the cylinders this flow pattern is marked as mode ii for the cases with l d 2 3 4 the gaps between the two cylinders are relatively small and confine the detachment and the shedding of the vortex zhang et al 2019 therefore two cylinders behave like a bluff body and the vortex sheds after the wake of the downstream cylinder b fig 14 a c illustrate the streamlines for l d 2 3 4 when l d 2 there is a steady recirculation region behind the cylinder a as the increase of the l d the length of the recirculation region becomes larger l d 3 and the region even becomes unsteady l d 4 which makes the vortex formation length shorter compared with the steady cases l d 2 3 when l d 5 the vortex sheds from the upstream cylinder a the gap between two cylinders in this case is not long enough for the vortex to fully develop thus before the vortex detaches from the cylinder a completely it arrives at the cylinder b then the vortex sheds from the cylinder b and forms a double vortex streets the intense interactions between the vortices generated in the gap and the flow near the cylinder b lead to the perturbed wake flow with vortices of irregular shapes when l d 6 the gap between the two cylinders becomes long enough allowing the full development of the vortex shedding from the rear sharp corners of the cylinder a then this vortex arrives at the cylinder b that is to say the initial vortex shedding does not influenced by the cylinder b the wake flow after cylinder b is also disturbed and the shapes of the vortices are more irregular near the cylinder b when l d 7 there is more room for the vortex shedding from the cylinder a to develop before arriving at the cylinder b in this case the vortices shed in a more fast frequency and the distance between the vortices in the downstream become smaller as a result merging between adjacent vortices occurs and a long chain of vortices forms as shown in fig 14 f by contrast from the vorticity contours and streamlines of fig 14 the full slip boundary only influences the local flow field near the cylinders therefore the full slip cases share similar flow patterns with the no slip cases for different gap ratios however due to the presence of slip more vortices after the cylinder b merge together for the full slip case than that for the no slip case with l d 7 as presented in the right side of fig 14 f the reason for this phenomenon is that the full slip boundary condition reduces the amplitude of the lift coefficient on the cylinder b refer to fig 15 making the vortices shed from the cylinder b in a not so violent way as a result vortices move with a little bit decreased velocities as the vortices shed from the cylinder b continuously more vortices merge together compared with the no slip case at l d 7 fig 15 shows the time evolution of the drag and lift coefficients for the cases with no slip and full slip at different gap ratios as displayed in fig 15 a c the flow fields suggest mode i pattern with nearly constant drag coefficients for the upstream cylinder a the amplitudes of the lift coefficients are very small in these cases since there are no vortices shed from the cylinder a the results imply that the cylinder a endures an almost constant drag force when it comes to the downstream cylinder b the drag coefficient approaches zero and the lift coefficient fluctuates sinusoidally the nearly zero drag coefficient is caused by the negative pressures on both the fore and aft side of the cylinder b zhao et al 2016 in fig 15 d f the flow fields suggest mode ii pattern both of the cylinder a and cylinder b endure larger amplitudes and mean values for the drag and lift coefficients compared with the cases in fig 15 a c undergoing such intenser forces in mode ii these two cylinders may have fatigue failure much easier in addition all the cases in fig 15 suggest that the amplitudes of the lift coefficients of the downstream cylinder b are larger than those of the upstream cylinder a that means the transverse vibrations of the vortices have more impact on the cylinder b since the vortices shed from the cylinder b at last compare the no slip and full slip cases shown in fig 15 we can see that the full slip boundary condition reduces the lift coefficients a little entirely fig 16 depicts the drag reduction for the flow past two tandem cylinders with full slip in fig 16 except for the downstream cylinder with l d 4 all the cases for the two cylinders gain positive drag reductions table 5 compares the average total drag pressure and friction on both cylinders for the no slip and the full slip cases at different gap ratios the numerical c d at l d 6 from open literatures sohankar and etminan 2009 chatterjee and mondal 2012 are also listed and good agreements are met take a look at the tables 3 and 5 we can find that the effect of the full slip on the upstream cylinder a is very similar to that of the single cylinder cases in section 3 2 1 the average c d of the upstream cylinder are generally lower than that for the single cylinder cases which suggests that the presence of the downstream cylinder alleviates the intense of the wake flow after the upstream cylinder to some extent setting a downstream cylinder might be a kind of efficient method to reduce drag when it comes to the downstream cylinder b at l d 4 the cylinder b endures a negative drag the full slip boundaries in these cases increase the pressure of the aft pressure e g l d 3 in fig 18 a leading to the augment of the pressure with a mildly changed friction drag the total drag increase when l d 4 the dr even reaches 64 when l d 4 however absolute value of the c d is relatively small for this case though with a dr of 64 the actual variation of the drag is relatively small in comparison with that of the cylinder a when l d 4 drs on the downstream cylinder become positive and generally higher than that of the downstream cylinder the effects of full slip boundaries on the pressure and friction drag are similar on both the cylinders from the above analysis the full slip benefits the dr for both the cylinders except the downstream cylinder when l d 4 therefore when l d 4 the full slip boundary conditions may be not a good choice for the downstream cylinder in the next subsection we will explore the impact of different slip distributions on the flow field on the drag and the lift coefficients of the two cylinders more deeply since the cases with l d 2 3 4 and l d 6 7 share similar flow patterns respectively we will investigate the influence of gap ratio l d 3 5 7 for the other slip distribution cases 3 3 2 the effect of different slip distributions at r e 100 next we investigate the influence of different slip distributions on the tandem square cylinders at r e 100 fig 17 displays the vorticity contours of the flow past two tandem cylinders with some typical slip distributions compared with the no slip case with corresponding gap ratios shown in fig 14 vorticity contours of various cases with different slip distributions show similar patterns but have minor differences in most of the cases for example phases of the vortex shedding are different for different slip distributions however for l d 7 the vortices after the cylinder b for the a aft a flank aft a fore flank and a full cases merge into longer chains than those for the no slip case especially for the a full case when l d 7 the a full case presents two long chains of vortices after the wake of the downstream cylinder b the reason for this phenomenon is similar to the explanation for the full slip case in section 3 3 1 vortices shed from the cylinder b with the a full case more gently compared with the full slip case and merge with the vortices in the wake flow successively as shown in table 6 we can see that the cylinder a endures generally higher average drag coefficients than the downstream cylinder b in each case with different gap ratios and slip distributions however the drag coefficients on the cylinder b vibrate more violently than those on the cylinder a similar to the full slip case shown in fig 15 the interactions between the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder cause the fluctuations on the downstream cylinder more severe sohankar and etminan 2009 moreover we focus on the average drag coefficients of some typical cases fig 19 displays the drag reduction for the tandem cylinders with different distributions at r e 100 fig 18 compares the normalized pressure coefficients on the fore and aft sides of the cylinder a and cylinder b with some typical slip distributions in general different slip distributions have similar effects on the upstream cylinder with the single cylinder cases however their performance on the dr are different on the downstream cylinder at different gap ratios l d as shown in fig 19 the a fore flank a full a flank full slip cases endure positive drs on both the cylinders except for the downstream cylinder when l d 3 on the contrary the b fore flank b full b flank b flank aft lead to negative drs on both the cylinders except for the downstream cylinder when l d 3 then we discuss the performance of the a full and b full cases on the downstream cylinder at l d 3 when l d 3 the a full case has a dr of 28 47 on the downstream cylinder while the b full cases has a dr of 13 18 at l d 3 the flow pattern is mode i in mode i there is no vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder and the downstream endures a negative pressure as shown in tables 5 and 6 the a full case has a relatively large augmentation in pressure which is mainly caused by the increase of the fore side pressure on the downstream cylinder fig 18 a this pressure augmentation contributes to the negative dr the b full case has a decrease in pressure which is mainly arisen by the reduction in the fore side pressure on the downstream cylinder fig 18 d this pressure reduction contributes to the large portion of the dr from the above analysis whether slip boundaries are applied to the upstream cylinder or the downstream cylinder larger impacts e g drag reduction on the downstream cylinder than on the upstream cylinder are observed that is to say the downstream cylinder is more sensitive to the change of slip configurations if the drag reduction on the upstream cylinder is the main focus the a fore flank a full and full slip cases are the recommended schemes if the drag reduction on the downstream cylinder is the main concern the b flank b flank aft and b full are the recommended schemes for l d 5 while the a fore flank a full and the full slip are recommended for l d 5 3 3 3 two typical slip distributions for the tandem cylinders at various reynolds numbers finally we investigate the a fore flank and full slip cases at various reynolds numbers and compare the results with the no slip cases fig 20 displays the average drag coefficient c d on the upstream and the downstream cylinders at various reynolds numbers and gap ratios in fig 20 a the general tendencies of the c d on the upstream cylinder a for the three cases no slip a fore flank full slip are similar to those of the single cylinder cases fig 10 at low reynolds numbers r e 50 as shown in fig 21 a the average drag coefficient c d on the upstream cylinder decreases with the augment of the gap ratio l d 3 5 7 for 50 r e 100 c d increases with the gap ratio when r e 100 c d at l d 5 goes higher than that at l d 7 and 3 on the other hand the a fore flank and full slip cases obtain very approaching dr performance for the upstream cylinder and their changing tendency are similar as the increase of the reynolds number when r e 125 drs of these two cases begin to descend and become negative very similar to the single cylinder cases discussed in section 3 2 2 it should be noticed that when r e 50 drs of the a fore flank and the full slip cases drop sharply which corresponds to a change of the flow state from a steady state to an unsteady state with karman vortex streets for the downstream cylinder as presented in fig 20 b when r e 75 c d increases as the gap ratio however when r e 75 maximum c d appears at l d 5 in addition c d of the downstream cylinder b has a greater change than that of the upstream cylinder a when l d 5 and 7 this phenomenon can also be observed in fig 21 b which suggests that with a fore flank and full slip boundary dr of the downstream cylinder at different gap ratios changes from nearly 50 to 100 the a fore flank boundary shows better dr than the full slip boundary in most cases especially at r e 75 and l d 3 when r e 75 and l d 3 the a fore flank case shows a dr of nearly 100 while the full slip case has a dr of nearly 50 in fact c d for these two cases are negative and have very small absolute values though with a dr approximating 100 the absolute value of drag reduction with a fore flank boundary is small nevertheless this phenomenon still suggests the pronounced impact introduced by different slip distributions under different flow configurations from the above analysis at different reynolds numbers the downstream cylinder is more sensitive to slip distributions similar to the conclusions at r e 100 in section 3 3 2 this feature can be utilized to control the flow near the downstream cylinder 4 conclusion in this paper we investigated the flows past a single square cylinder and two tandem square cylinders at low reynolds numbers 25 200 mainly at 100 under different slip distributions using the lattice boltzmann method the influences of the slip distributions were analyzed the following conclusions were made 1 slip on the flank side of the single cylinder commonly reduces the friction drag contributing to a large portion of the dr at r e 100 the full slip case gains the best dr of 3 5 however this dr of 3 5 is indeed not a big difference 2 the frequency of the vortex shedding is insensitive to the change of the slip distributions at r e 25 200 at higher reynolds number r e 125 the fore flank and full slip begin to increase drag which are mainly caused by the pressure augmentation 3 the upstream cylinder shares similar tendencies with the single cylinder cases as the reynolds number r e 25 200 the downstream cylinder is more sensitive to the change of slip distributions with a dr of nearly 50 in minimum 100 in maximum 4 at r e 100 the a full slip a fore flank and full slip have positive dr on both the upstream and downstream cylinders with different gap ratios except for the downstream cylinder when l d 4 on the contrary the b full slip b fore flank and b flank aft slip endure negative dr on both the cylinders except for the downstream cylinder when l d 4 these findings will serve as a guidance for the flow control through carefully distributing slip boundaries on the cylinders under different flow configurations we could explore the possibilities to achieve desired control to the flow however the slip boundary condition is applied on the full length of the edges of the cylinder in current study besides current research concentrates on a typical slip length thus the effect of the partial slip on edges of the cylinder and the influence of slip length will be explored in future studies on the other hand this work is implemented in two dimension the flow past bluff bodies at higher reynolds numbers usually indicts three dimensional characteristics future studies will proceed in three dimension with higher reynolds numbers credit authorship contribution statement yang yu methodology software writing original draft writing review editing liuming yang

20356,the pre swirl stator pss as a type of energy saving device has garnered increasing attention due to efforts aimed at global energy saving and emission reduction owing to the influence of the stern profile the wake field at the stern is complex and the installation of such energy saving appendages further increases its complexity to explore the flow mechanism of a ship s wake field and the working principles of energy saving appendages this study used a scale model of a bulk carrier as its research object and conducted a wake field experiment with the help of the large underwater stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system at harbin engineering university the wake field data of several sections were obtained including the axial velocity tangential velocity average kinetic energy vorticity swirl strength streamline pulsating velocity turbulent kinetic energy and axial velocity at different radii the wake field data with or without a pss in the bare hull condition and with or without a pss in the self propelled condition were compared the time averaged flow field clearly demonstrated a hook like velocity profile bilge vortex hub cap vortex and other flow structures as well as the flow details around the pss the results showed that the pss could destroy the contour structure of the axial velocity which mainly affects the range of 0 5 0 8r making the flow field more uniform the pss has a certain influence on the flow field on the side without the stator blade and a great influence on the tangential velocity by producing a pre swirl flow in a direction opposite to the propeller rotation in front of the propeller plane this pre swirl flow can increase the inflow of the propeller disk and improve the working conditions of the propeller the pss also has an influence on radial velocity however the influence degree and range are smaller than that on the tangential velocity the pss changed the water inflow direction increased the interaction angle between the water flow and propeller blade improved the wake conditions and propulsion performance and was conducive to improving the working efficiency of the propeller moreover the existence of a pss reduced the local pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy benefiting the structural strength of the propeller keywords pre swirl stator wake field experimental technology underwater

more than 80 of the world s international trade volume is fulfilled through shipping reducing operating costs has become one of the main objectives of the shipping industry and ship energy saving is on the agenda meanwhile the international maritime organization is promoting the concept of green ships clearly driving the energy efficiency design index and energy efficiency operation index and making provisions on greenhouse gas emissions mandatory improving the propulsion efficiency of propellers is one of the main energy saving and emission reduction methods and installing an energy saving device esd is an effective means of improving propulsion efficiency with its advantages including having a simple structure offering convenient installation exhibiting good energy saving effects and being low cost such energy saving devices are favored by the majority of shipowners over the past decade extensive research has been conducted on ship energy saving appendages and esds for large ships have also been designed in a joint industrial project named esd jili the maritime research institute netherlands marin studied the working principles of three types of esds pre duct with an inner stator a pre swirl stator and hub fins dang et al 2011 2012 terwisga 2013 zondervan et al 2011 busan national university of korea designed esds for several large ships and achieved good results lee et al 2016a 2019b shin et al 2016 yoo et al 2019 meanwhile a set of esd structural safety assessment methods was proposed lee et al 2016b lee et al 2019a based on the numerical variational method and a pre swirl stator pss optimization method was also proposed and applied to large container ships chen et al 2018 extended the research on energy saving appendages to river sea direct ships and designed energy saving appendages for a 20 000 dwt river sea direct cargo ship however owing to the scale effect on the wake flow field the experimental results at the model scale are often different from those at the real scale castro et al 2011 consequently in recent years extensive research has been conducted on the installation of energy saving appendages on real ships lin et al 2020 park et al 2015 su et al 2020 the pss which comprises several usually three to five blades is a type of energy saving appendage installed in front of the propeller it is designed to produce a pre swirl flow in front of the propeller reduce the energy loss of the propeller and improve the ship s propulsion performance koushan et al 2020 lee et al 1992 sakamoto et al 2019 because of their simple structure convenient installation and good energy saving outcomes psss have attracted the attention of many researchers most scholars use computational fluid dynamics cfd methods to study the working mechanism of psss but cfd cannot accurately simulate the phenomena of turbulence and breaking waves gougoulidis and vasileiadis 2015 the only way to obtain flow field information around a pss accurately is to perform a model test in a towing tank hence this study performed a wake field test of a 230 000 dwt bulk carrier with and without a pss and propeller using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry spiv to measure the wake field characteristics of the axial wake vorticity swirl strength pulsating velocity and kinetic energy that is to expound on the action mechanism of the pss from a fine flow field perspective 2 experimental facilities and setup 2 1 facility the piv test of the wake field of a 230 000 dwt bulk carrier was conducted in the model towing tank of harbin engineering

propeller flow field data at the same phase angle once every two revolutions of the propeller the time interval between two adjacent frames was adjusted to 400 μs to ensure that the maximum particle displacement did not exceed 1 4 of the interrogation area ia within this interval and the number of images collected during each measurement was controlled at 250 pairs to satisfy the requirements of data convergence seo et al 2016 yoon et al 2015 the correlation of particles and the generation of velocity vectors were obtained using the adaptive piv algorithm the adaptive piv method automatically calculates the velocity vectors based on particle images the method iteratively adjusts the size and shape of the individual interrogation areas to adapt to local seeding densities and flow gradients that is adjust the size and shape of the ia based on the particle density and the velocity gradient respectively the maximum ia was set at 64 64 pixels minimum ia was set at 32 32 pixels grid step was set to 16 16 pixels peak verification and global outlier detection were enabled verification and replacement were enabled in the last step of the iteration the neighborhood was set to be a 5 5 matrix and the outlier vector was replaced with the median of the effective neighborhood vector the test accuracy of the piv system was 2 5 and the confidence interval was u i 2 5 where u i is the instantaneous velocity of the i th sample and the uncertainty of the second order statistical moment of the corresponding statistical sample was 17 guo et al 2018 luo et al 2018 3 2 processing of data items we collected 250 pairs of instantaneous velocity fields and the time averaged velocity field was calculated from them the formula for calculating the time averaged velocity field is as follows 1 u 1 n n 1 n u n v 1 n n 1 n v n w 1 n n 1 n w n the average kinetic energy is calculated as follows 2 a k e 1 2 u u v v w w the instantaneous kinetic energy is calculated as follows 3 i k e 1 2 u n u

turbulent kinetic energy is calculated as follows 5 t k e 1 2 u u v v w w where n is the number of samples n 250 u v and w are the axial spanwise and vertical velocity components after the time average respectively and u n v n and w n are the axial spanwise and vertical transient velocity components of the n th measurement sample respectively u v and w represent the pulsating velocities in the axial spanwise and vertical directions respectively u rms v rms and w rms represent the root mean square of the axial spanwise and vertical velocities respectively the vorticity at a point is defined as the local rotation or curl of the 3d velocity field 6 ω r o t u c u r l u u w y v z i u z w x j v x u y k where the partial derivative of the velocity field can be calculated using the center difference and the terms on the right side of the equation describe the rotation around the x y and z axes respectively since the velocity field measured using the spiv measurement system in this study is a 2d plane with three directional velocity components the planar data gradients in the ship s traveling direction x direction cannot be calculated therefore only rotation around the x axis can be determined 7 ω x w y v z swirl strength is defined as the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor j adrian et al 2000 8 j u u x u y u z v x v y v z w x w y w z since the piv measurement data is a 2d 3c velocity field the planar data gradients in the x direction cannot be calculated and setting them to zero simplifies the eigenvalue calculation therefore the square of the imaginary part can be computed as follows 9 λ c i 2 1 4 v y 2 1 4 w z 2 1 2 v y w z w y v z which is returned as the swirl strength notably the corresponding eigenvalues will only be complex if this number is negative the local minima of the negative valued swirling strength can be used to identify the vortex cores while positive values indicate areas of the flow where shear may be present but with no swirling motion 4 results and discussion 4 1 axial velocity through the spiv tests the time averaged velocity field vorticity field vector and streamline information at different cross sectional positions at the stern of the bulk carrier were obtained fig 6 shows the comparison diagram of the axial velocity under the bare hull condition tests a and b and fig 7 shows the comparison diagram of the axial velocity under the self propelled condition tests c and d the dimensionless parameters y r and z r are used to represent the y and z axes respectively where r 80 mm is the propeller radius the towing speed u was used for the dimensionless processing of the axial velocity u the white area in the figure is due to the shading of the propeller shaft and laser reflection consequently some flow field results could not be obtained the higher pulsating velocity above the flow field on the right in fig 6 was caused by the lower particle concentration fig 6 shows that in the bare hull condition test a the x l pp 0 section has obvious hook like velocity contour profiles with the velocity ratio being u u 0 3 the contours of the hook like velocity cloud map are shown marked as a in the figure owing to the contraction of the stern profile and the existence of the propeller shaft a strong bilge vortex is gradually generated when the ship s incoming flow streams through the stern the fluid with lower kinetic energy is transferred to the center of the ship by the bilge vortex to weaken the original velocity and the axial velocity contour at the propeller plane exhibits a hook like shape kim et al 2001 at the section x l pp 0 0143 owing to the influence of the longitudinal bilge vortex there is still a hook like velocity contour compared to the propeller plane the extent of the hook like shape of this section is weaker and its range smaller with the velocity ratio being u u 0 4 at x l pp 0 0238 the hook like velocity contour disappears compared to the cases with or without the pss tests a and b pss has an interference effect on the wake flow with the main area of influence being located in the left half that is the side with the blades and the upper hook like velocity contour structure is destroyed showing that the flow field is more uniform for the right half that is the side without blades the wake field is roughly consistent with the bare hull conditions and the velocity contour has an obvious hook like structure however there is still a difference which is manifested in the increase in the uniformity of the flow field indicating that the pss will also affect the right half that is the side without blades fig 7 shows a comparison of the axial velocity of different sections in the self propelled condition because the propeller is constantly rotating the flow field data of the two sets of tests c and d cannot be collected under the same propeller phase however by adjusting the collection frequency to ensure that it matches the rotating speed of the propeller the system can collect data once every two revolutions of the propeller consequently the system collects the flow field information of the propeller at the same phase angle in each group of tests ensuring that the collected data are still of practical significance for exploring the working mechanism of the pss fig 7 shows that compared with the two sets of tests a and b no propeller condition the wake of the two sets of tests c and d increased by varying degrees which was caused by the suction effect of the propeller that is the wake was no longer symmetrical and the wake on the right side was higher than that on the left side which was caused by the rotation of the propeller compared with or without pss the pss reduced the high wake area u u 1 2 on the right hand side of the propeller plane and increased the area of 1 1 u u 1 2 which produced a more uniform propeller inflow to further observe the influence of the pss on the kinetic energy of the wake field the cross section x l pp 0 0143 was selected for data processing fig 8 shows the average kinetic energy distribution at 7 5 cm behind the propeller plane with u 2 being used to non dimensionalize the average kinetic energy ake fig 8 shows that the kinetic energy of the propeller disk surface is low the high rotational energy bilge vortex formed in the bilge of the bulk carrier with a fat and large stern transfers the low kinetic energy water flow to the vicinity of the propeller plane near the longitudinal section of the hull forming the low speed hook like velocity profile in fig 6 the comparison shows that the pss can reduce the kinetic energy on the side with blades which improves the efficiency of the propeller as the wake fields of x l pp 0 and x l pp 0 0048 sections were blocked the axial velocities at different radii of x l pp 0 0143 section were extracted and the position of 0 was defined as the 12 o clock direction pointing to the top of the stern and a point was taken every 10 looking from the stern to the bow with the clockwise direction being the positive direction and the direction of the points shown in fig 2 the axial velocity u is dimensionless using the towing speed u the axial velocity distribution at different radii is shown in fig 9 fig 9 shows that under the condition of the bare hull test a with the development of the wake direction at a larger radius the influence of the stern profile on the ship wake field was reduced and the speed at the ship keel corresponding to 180 increased noticeably before gradually returning to the flow velocity of the external flow field moreover affected by the hook like velocity distribution and based on the velocity distribution law it first increased and then decreased in the range of 0 45 and 315 360 from 0 6 to 1 0r by comparison the velocity distribution at the same position within the range of 0 3 0 5r was relatively gentle owing to the blowing effect of the propeller the axial wake of the working condition with a propeller tests c d was much larger than that of the working condition without a propeller tests a and b comparing the working conditions with or without a pss tests a and b the pss mainly affected the range of 0 5 0 8r the two curves of tests a and b in fig 9 that is 0 9 1 0r basically coincide indicating that the pss has a small effect on the external flow field around the propeller plane the main difference between 0 3r and 0 4r in the figure was in the range of 120 180 which shows the axial velocity of test b to be greater than that of test a making the flow field of the propeller plane more uniform and helping to improve the efficiency of the propeller the range of 0 5r 0 8r is also the range within which the flow field of the propeller disk is most affected by the pss the pss affects both the side with the blades 180 360 and the side without blades 0 180 more specifically the pss reduces the axial velocity on the side without blades whereas the low speed range of the flow field is expanded and the flow field is more uniform on the side with blades the axial velocity increases and the velocity gradient decreases compared with that without blades an increase in the inflow of the left side propeller improved the efficiency of the right handed propeller meanwhile the speed peak near 180 shifted forward by 10 20 which is explained in fig 6 the existence of the pss increased the low speed area of the flow field on the left side of the propeller plane the left isoline is compressed by the low speed area making it dense in the two groups of tests c and d each group of propeller flow fields is a time averaged flow field in a certain phase tests c and d are not in the same phase the curve in fig 9 still shows the same trend as tests a and b the two curves coincide in the range of 0 3 0 4r and 0 9 1 0r indicating that the pss slightly affects the peripheral flow field and the central flow field of the propeller plane with the main difference still being in the range of 0 5 0 8r the change in velocity in test d is more moderate compared with that in test c that is the pss can reduce the speed fluctuation and make the flow field more uniform by extracting the dimensionless axial velocity along the spanwise at the position z r 0 in the section x l pp 0 0143 as shown in fig 10 and comparing tests a and b the pss increased the axial velocity at the same position which is beneficial to the inflow of the right handed propeller on the side of y r 0 the two curves of tests a and b are quite different but the trend is the same it could have been caused by the pss squeezing the left flow field or the differences between the tests under different voyages tests c and d show that after pss the speed value on the left side of the propeller disk decreases the high wake area expands and the flow field on the propeller disk is more uniform which improved the working efficiency of the propeller further analysis of the characteristics of the velocity distribution in the spanwise and vertical directions at 0 5r in the section x l pp 0 0143 is shown in fig 11 on the side without the stator blade 0 180 the spanwise velocities of tests a and b are nearly the same at 190 corresponding to the angle of the bottom blade of the pss the spanwise velocity of test b has a peak value caused by the 20 deviation of the velocity peak value near 210 in test a in the region of 180 360 a comparison of tests a and b demonstrates that the pss increases the spanwise velocity making more water flow to the outside of the propeller disk and reducing the convergence of water flow caused by the stern profile on the left side of the propeller disk to the middle of the hull through tests c and d it is evident that the pss increases the tendency of the fluid flowing outward on the left side of the propeller disk to improve the working efficiency of the propeller similarly the influence of the pss on the vertical velocity is mainly reflected in the range of 180 360 it can be seen from tests a and b that the original peak value of the vertical velocity near 180 is shifted forward by 20 after pss in the range of 180 225 the absolute value of the vertical velocity in test b is larger than that in test a which indicates that the pss increased the inlet angle of attack of the wake field in the range of 225 360 the absolute value of the vertical velocity in test b is less than that in test a and the downward trend of the vertical velocity is decreased because the propeller is right handed the pss can reduce the power consumption and improve propeller efficiency for the test condition with a propeller tests c and d the vertical velocity decreases after the action of the pss in the range of 180 360 indicating the improved working condition of the propeller 4 2 tangential and radial velocity through vector coordinate transformation we transformed the spanwise and vertical velocities into tangential and radial velocities of the wake field at sections x lpp 0 and x lpp 0 0143 the tangential velocity vector and its magnitude are as shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively the tangential and radial velocity flow field structures of test a hull in both figures are completely symmetrical the tangential velocity value is the same but the direction is opposite comparing the tangential velocity of test a hull and test b hull pss it can be observed that the structure of the tangential velocity contour on the side without the stator blade in test b is nearly the same as that in test a on the side with the blade the pss can significantly increase the tangential velocity on the periphery of the propeller disk although it has little effect on the region near the center as the velocity contour around the propeller disk becomes dense the tangential velocity gradient increases and a pre swirl flow opposite to the propeller s rotation is produced this pre swirl flow can increase the propeller inflow and improve the working conditions of the propeller this confirms the results of studies by koushan and krasilnikov koushan et al 2020 who emphasized that the greatest portion of energy saving due to the pss comes from utilizing the kinetic energy associated with tangential velocities which is due to the effect of pre swirl 4 3 vorticity swirl strength and streamline the velocity field data were further processed and the vorticity field information was obtained using eqs 7 and 9 figs 14 20 show the vorticity field information at different sections in the bare hull and self propelled conditions respectively the radius r of the propeller is utilized to make the coordinate dimensionless figs 14 17 show that the bilge vortex b and the propeller hub cap vortex c can be easily identified the section covered by white or gray in the figure is due to the shielding of the propeller shaft and strong laser reflection here the flow field data could not be measured the erroneous vorticity near y r 1 on the left side of the vorticity diagram is caused by the local dead pixels of the ccd camera chip however it did not much affect the vorticity field inside the propeller plane nevertheless the experiment still has research significance the bilge vortex b in the image is a positive vorticity value indicating that the vortex rotates counterclockwise a negative value indicating that the vortex rotates clockwise the bilge vortex on the starboard of the ship model rotates counterclockwise and the bilge vortex on the port of the ship model rotates clockwise and is generated by the bilge in the middle of the hull and transmitted to the propeller plane the hub cap vortex c under the propeller shaft rotates clockwise on the starboard side and anticlockwise on the port side with the rotation direction of the hub cap vortex being opposite to that of the bilge vortex the hub cap vortex of the propeller was generated at the stern shaft and transferred to the propeller plane with the fluid the wake field on the stern of the ship equipped with a pss also shows two sets of vortices as a whole although there are some vortices of lower strength mixed around it the positive and negative vortices being mixed as per figs 14 17 the pss reduces the range of influence of the bilge vortex and expands the strength and range of influence of the hub cap vortex considering that the propeller s rotation direction is right handed this purple positive value vortex has a tendency to spread and its rotation direction is left handed the pss can generate a pre swirl flow in front of the propeller whose rotation direction is opposite to that of the propeller to improve the working conditions of the propeller and improve its propulsion efficiency the streamline diagram shows that the range of the hubcap vortex is enlarged and that the inflow direction of the fluid changes when there is no pss the streamline enters from the lower right corner when the pss is installed the flow direction enters from the lower left corner for the right handed propeller the installation of the pss increased the inflow angle of attack which is conducive to improving the working efficiency of the propeller in the self propelled condition as per figs 18 20 the bilge vortex and hubcap vortex can no longer be identified through the stirring effect of the propeller the port side propeller disk shows a positive counterclockwise vortex wrapped around a negative clockwise vortex and the counterclockwise vortex strength is low because the right handed propeller interacts with the counterclockwise high strength hubcap vortex inducing the latter to become a vortex with lower energy the strength of the bilge vortex generated at the bilge of the hull at the surface of the propeller plane is increased under the action of the propeller after the pss was installed a vortex with the rotation direction opposite to that of the propeller was generated in front of the propeller which was superimposed with the hub cap vortex after interaction with the propeller the positive and negative vortices were mixed which improved the energy utilization moreover the strength of the counterclockwise vortex was stronger than that of the counterclockwise vortex without the pss which also confirmed that a vortex with the rotation direction opposite to that of the propeller was generated by the pss in front of the propeller 4 4 pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy based on equations 4 and 5 shown in section 3 2 the axial pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy at the section x l pp 0 0143 of the wake field can be obtained the pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy are dimensionless using the towing speeds u and u 2 respectively and the coordinate axis is also dimensionless using the radius r of the propeller plane as shown in figs 21 and 22 the larger pulsating velocity at the top of the figures is due to the lower particle concentration fig 21 shows that a symmetrically distributed but large range of pulsating velocities in the wake field of test a and the strength range of turbulent kinetic energy are consistent with the pulsating velocity in test b with the addition of a pss the values of the pulsating velocity and the range of turbulent kinetic energy are reduced maximum value of the local pulsating velocity is reduced and the wake field is more uniform similarly fig 22 shows that the wake field with the pss test d is more uniform than that without the pss test c and the maximum value and range of the local pulsating velocity are reduced this phenomenon is more obvious in the turbulent kinetic energy the high kinetic energy area of the turbulent kinetic energy is significantly reduced and the uniformity of the flow field increases this shows that the pss can significantly improve the uniformity of the wake field and reduce both the local pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy which is beneficial to the structural strength of the propeller 5 conclusions in this study the underwater stereoscopic piv system designed by the dantec dynamics company was applied to the experimental study of a 230 000 dwt bulk carrier scale model in the towing tank at harbin engineering university the wake field data for different sections were obtained including the axial velocity tangential velocity average kinetic energy vorticity swirl strength streamline pulsating velocity turbulent kinetic energy and axial velocity at different radii the wake field data of the ship with or without a pss in the bare hull condition and the ship with or without a pss in the self propelled condition were compared respectively through the analysis and processing of the test data the following conclusions were drawn 1 piv technology is an important measurement technique in the field of naval architecture and ocean engineering in this study piv technology was used to accurately capture the flow field characteristics such as the bilge vortex hubcap vortex and hook like velocity profile in the wake field of a bulk carrier model the velocity value of the hook like velocity cloud contour at the propeller plane was approximately u u 0 30 as the cross sections were far away from the propeller plane the degree of hook weakened and its range decreased this suggests that piv technology has the advantages of transient global non contact and high precision measurements 2 under the condition of the bare hull at the position of the propeller plane the pss exhibited an interference effect on the stern flow the main area of influence was located in the left half of the propeller plane the side with blades and the upper hook like structure was destroyed for the right half the side without blades the velocity contour exhibited an obvious hook like structure but the pss still had an effect there reflected in the increase in the uniformity of the wake field in the self propelled condition the pss reduced the high wake area u u 1 2 on the right side of the propeller plane and at the same time increased the wake area 1 1 u u 1 2 making the propeller inflow more uniform 3 by comparing the axial velocity distribution at different radii it was found that the pss affected the range 0 5r 0 8r and had a negligible effect on the external wake field around the propeller plane the pss affected not only the side where the blades existed 180 360 but also the side without blades 0 180 more specifically the pss reduced the axial velocity on the side without blades that is the low speed range of the flow field was expanded and the flow field was more uniform on the side with blades the axial velocity was increased and the curve was relatively smooth for a right handed propeller it is beneficial to increase the inflow of the left side propeller to improve its efficiency 4 by comparing the dimensionless axial velocity in the spanwise direction at z r 0 in the section of x l pp 0 0143 it was found that the pss increased the axial velocity at the same position which was beneficial to the inflow of the right handed propeller in the self propelled condition the existence of the pss reduced the speed on the left side of the propeller disk and expanded the high wake area the flow field on the left side of the propeller disk was more uniform and improved the working efficiency of the propeller in our analysis of the influence of the pss on the spanwise and vertical velocity of 0 5r the pss increased the spanwise velocity allowed more water flow to the outside of the propeller disk and reduced the convergence of water flow to the middle of the hull caused by the stern profile on the left side of the propeller disk under the self propulsion condition the pss also increased the outward trend of the fluid on the left side of the propeller disk to improve the working efficiency of the propeller similarly because the influence of the pss on the vertical velocity was mainly reflected in the range of 180 360 the pss improved the inflow angle of attack and improved the efficiency of the propeller 5 the pss significantly increased the tangential velocity of the periphery of the propeller disk while having little influence on the region near the center it produced a pre swirl flow in a direction opposite to the propeller rotation in front of the propeller plane increased the inflow toward the propeller disk and improved the working conditions of the propeller on the side with blade the pss had the same effect where the radial velocity increased significantly however the influence range and degree were smaller than the tangential velocity 6 in the analysis the vorticity swirl strength streamline bilge vortex and propeller hub cap vortex were easily identified the bilge vortex on the starboard side of the ship model rotated counterclockwise while the bilge vortex on the port side rotated clockwise which was generated by the bilge in the middle of the ship and transmitted to the propeller plane by the wake the hubcap vortex under the propeller shaft rotated clockwise on the starboard side and counterclockwise on the port side the direction of rotation of the hubcap vortex was opposite to that of the bilge vortex the propeller hubcap vortex was generated at the stern shaft of the hull and transmitted to the propeller plane by the fluid after the pss was installed the positive and negative vortices were mixed in the wake field the pss reduced the influence range of the bilge vortex expanded the strength and influence range of the hubcap vortex and generated a pre swirl flow in which the rotation direction was opposite to the propeller rotation direction in front of the propeller thereby improving the working conditions of the propeller and increasing the propulsion efficiency meanwhile it was found from the streamline diagram that as the fluid inflow direction changed the pss increased the fluid inflow angle of attack which improves the working efficiency of the propeller 7 the pss reduced both the maximum value of the local pulsating velocity and the range of the high kinetic energy region of the turbulent kinetic energy this reduction of the local pulsating velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy shows that the pss significantly improved the uniformity of the wake field making it beneficial to the structural strength of the propeller although the self propulsion condition of the propeller was included in this study it was tested under calm water conditions in addition the environmental effects of wind waves and currents under real sea conditions were not considered although this study has certain limitations the research results clearly reveal the flow mechanism of the ship wake field and the working mechanism of the pss the installation of a pss can significantly improve the propulsion performance of the ship future research should focus on the influence of different environments on the working mechanism of the pss under real sea conditions this can be used to evaluate the propulsion performance of ships in different seas in addition owing to the existence of the propeller shaft and the problem of laser reflection the flow field data in the central area of the propeller plane were missing which was not conducive to observing the wake field structure this should be avoided as much as possible in future experimental designs on the other hand the scale effect has always been a very important and unsolved problem in the ship s flow field for two main reasons firstly regardless of the kind of device installed on the hull its longitudinal length is far less than the length of the hull and considering the actual test speed the reynolds number around the device can only correspond to the laminar flow secondly the boundary layer of the model differs from that of a real ship as do its thickness and velocity distribution consequently it is almost impossible for the mutual interference between the model hull and special devices to be the same as that of the real ship a study presented at the 25th international towing tank conference ittc predicted the energy saving efficiency by model test of an esd kim et al 2008 the results showed that the energy saving efficiency of a 2 m long model is 2 and that of an 8 m long model is 4 5 in contrast the actual energy saving efficiency of a real ship is about 7 statistical value of 12 real ships scholars have also conducted much research on the scale effect dang et al 2012 and dang et al 2011 used smart ship model technology wijngaarden 2011 to simulate the full scale wake field during model tests to gain insights into the scale effects of the esds park et al 2015 proposed a simple and efficient wake field prediction method considering the scale effect of energy saving devices the wake predicted by the proposed method was similar to that obtained in full scale computations schuiling et al 2017 discussed the influence of the scale effect on propeller performance in detail they stated that the scale effect may lead to a small decline in performance zhao 2017 studied the scale effect of energy saving devices by changing the viscosity coefficient of the fluid to make the model and the real ship have the same reynolds number koushan et al 2020 discussed the difference between the model and the full scale wake field by numerical simulation because of the convenience and efficiency of cfd technology the research into the scale effect is typically based on numerical simulation the main purpose of this study was to utilize piv technology to measure and reveal the flow characteristics and energy saving mechanism of the ship model with pss in the model scale as various researchers have stated it is very important to discuss and correct the scale effect the experimental data measured by piv at model scale can be used as the verification data of cfd numerical simulation we can use the cfd method verified by piv data to simulate the wakefield of ships at different scales and analyze the scale effect ascertain the change law of the scale effect and then explore the relevant correction method this is a very good and important topic and we will conduct more research in this area in future work funding this work was financially supported by the

20356,the pre swirl stator pss as a type of energy saving device has garnered increasing attention due to efforts aimed at global energy saving and emission reduction owing to the influence of the stern profile the wake field at the stern is complex and the installation of such energy saving appendages further increases its complexity to explore the flow mechanism of a ship s wake field and the working principles of energy saving appendages this study used a scale model of a bulk carrier as its research object and conducted a wake field experiment with the help of the large underwater stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system at harbin engineering university the wake field data of several sections were obtained including the axial velocity tangential velocity average kinetic energy vorticity swirl strength streamline pulsating velocity turbulent kinetic energy and axial velocity at different radii the wake field data with or without a pss in the bare hull condition and with or without a pss in the self propelled condition were compared the time averaged flow field clearly demonstrated a hook like velocity profile bilge vortex hub cap vortex and other flow structures as well as the flow details around the pss the results showed that the pss could destroy the contour structure of the axial velocity which mainly affects the range of 0 5 0 8r making the flow field more uniform the pss has a certain influence on the flow field on the side without the stator blade and a great influence on the tangential velocity by producing a pre swirl flow in a direction opposite to the propeller rotation in front of the propeller plane this pre swirl flow can increase the inflow of the propeller disk and improve the working conditions of the propeller the pss also has an influence on radial velocity however the influence degree and range are smaller than that on the tangential velocity the pss changed the water inflow direction increased the interaction angle between the water flow and propeller blade improved the wake conditions and propulsion performance and was conducive to improving the working efficiency of the propeller moreover the existence of a pss reduced the local pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy benefiting the structural strength of the propeller keywords pre swirl stator wake field experimental technology underwater

more than 80 of the world s international trade volume is fulfilled through shipping reducing operating costs has become one of the main objectives of the shipping industry and ship energy saving is on the agenda meanwhile the international maritime organization is promoting the concept of green ships clearly driving the energy efficiency design index and energy efficiency operation index and making provisions on greenhouse gas emissions mandatory improving the propulsion efficiency of propellers is one of the main energy saving and emission reduction methods and installing an energy saving device esd is an effective means of improving propulsion efficiency with its advantages including having a simple structure offering convenient installation exhibiting good energy saving effects and being low cost such energy saving devices are favored by the majority of shipowners over the past decade extensive research has been conducted on ship energy saving appendages and esds for large ships have also been designed in a joint industrial project named esd jili the maritime research institute netherlands marin studied the working principles of three types of esds pre duct with an inner stator a pre swirl stator and hub fins dang et al 2011 2012 terwisga 2013 zondervan et al 2011 busan national university of korea designed esds for several large ships and achieved good results lee et al 2016a 2019b shin et al 2016 yoo et al 2019 meanwhile a set of esd structural safety assessment methods was proposed lee et al 2016b lee et al 2019a based on the numerical variational method and a pre swirl stator pss optimization method was also proposed and applied to large container ships chen et al 2018 extended the research on energy saving appendages to river sea direct ships and designed energy saving appendages for a 20 000 dwt river sea direct cargo ship however owing to the scale effect on the wake flow field the experimental results at the model scale are often different from those at the real scale castro et al 2011 consequently in recent years extensive research has been conducted on the installation of energy saving appendages on real ships lin et al 2020 park et al 2015 su et al 2020 the pss which comprises several usually three to five blades is a type of energy saving appendage installed in front of the propeller it is designed to produce a pre swirl flow in front of the propeller reduce the energy loss of the propeller and improve the ship s propulsion performance koushan et al 2020 lee et al 1992 sakamoto et al 2019 because of their simple structure convenient installation and good energy saving outcomes psss have attracted the attention of many researchers most scholars use computational fluid dynamics cfd methods to study the working mechanism of psss but cfd cannot accurately simulate the phenomena of turbulence and breaking waves gougoulidis and vasileiadis 2015 the only way to obtain flow field information around a pss accurately is to perform a model test in a towing tank hence this study performed a wake field test of a 230 000 dwt bulk carrier with and without a pss and propeller using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry spiv to measure the wake field characteristics of the axial wake vorticity swirl strength pulsating velocity and kinetic energy that is to expound on the action mechanism of the pss from a fine flow field perspective 2 experimental facilities and setup 2 1 facility the piv test of the wake field of a 230 000 dwt bulk carrier was conducted in the model towing tank of harbin engineering

the end of the propeller hub cap x l pp 0 0238 in tests c and d which had propellers the flow field at the propeller plane could not be measured that is only the other three sections were measured the test conditions are shown in table 4 a photo of the different test groups is shown in fig 3 and the relative position of the measurement section is shown in fig 4 2 3 spiv system the two dimensional three component stereoscopic piv 2d 3c spiv measurement system used underwater in the measurement test of the ship wake field was customized by dantec dynamics for the ship model towing tank of harbin

underwater main body please refer to guo et al 2018 3 data acquisition and processing of measurement results 3 1 data acquisition and piv measurements to reduce the influence of the motion in different degrees of freedom on the image acquisition in the piv shooting area of the stern during navigation the degrees of freedom of the ship s heaving and pitching were measured before the test after the measurements the ballast was adjusted to the corresponding floating state and the motion in different degrees of freedom of the ship was locked the spiv system was calibrated before the test with the specific calibration details presented in the literature gong et al 2019 guo et al 2018 when the system operates the laser and two ccd cameras are controlled by a synchronizer with the camera being used in double frame shooting mode when the laser was emitted the two cameras shot the tracer particles illuminated by the laser at different angles to obtain two groups of planar two dimensional flow field vector results of different angles finally the three dimensional velocity vector of the planar measurement area was reconstructed using the calibration information the spiv measurement diagram of the ship wake field is shown in fig 5 polyamide seeding particles psp 50 of an average diameter of 50 μm and a density of 1 03 g cm3 which have good followability were used as tracer particles dantec studio software was used to batch process the spiv data the piv measurement area was 320 280 mm2 and the distance between the piv main body and the test model was 1215 mm during the test the camera captured images in two frames for the conditions without a propeller tests a and b the acquisition rate of the spiv system was adjusted to a maximum value of 7 5 owing to the camera limitations 7 5 hz was the maximum spiv system sampling frequency for which the maximum number of samples could be collected during the test for the conditions with a propeller tests c and d the acquisition rate of the spiv system was adjusted to 4 25 hz 4 25 510 60 2 so that the acquisition frequency of the system matched the rotational speed of the propeller the system collected the propeller flow field data at the same phase angle once every two revolutions of the propeller the time interval between two adjacent frames was adjusted to 400 μs to ensure that the maximum particle displacement did not exceed 1 4 of the interrogation area ia within this interval and the number of images collected during each measurement was controlled at 250 pairs to satisfy the requirements of data convergence seo et al 2016 yoon et al 2015 the correlation of particles and the generation of velocity vectors were obtained using the adaptive piv algorithm the adaptive piv method automatically calculates the velocity vectors based on particle images the method iteratively adjusts the size and shape of the individual interrogation areas to adapt to local seeding densities and flow gradients that is adjust the size and shape of the ia based on the particle density and the velocity gradient respectively the maximum ia was set at 64 64 pixels minimum ia was set at 32 32 pixels grid step was set to 16 16 pixels peak verification and global outlier detection were enabled verification and replacement were enabled in the last step of the iteration the neighborhood was set to be a 5 5 matrix and the outlier vector was replaced with the median of the effective neighborhood vector the test accuracy of the piv system was 2 5 and the confidence interval was u i 2 5 where u i is the instantaneous velocity of the i th sample and the uncertainty of the second order statistical moment of the corresponding statistical sample was 17 guo et al 2018 luo et al 2018 3 2 processing of data items we collected 250 pairs of instantaneous velocity fields and the time averaged velocity field was calculated from them the formula for calculating the time averaged velocity field is as follows 1 u 1 n n 1 n u n v 1 n n 1 n v n w 1 n n 1 n w n the average kinetic energy is calculated as follows 2 a k e 1 2 u u v v w w the instantaneous kinetic energy is calculated as follows 3 i k e 1 2 u n u n v n v n w n w n the root mean square of the velocity and pulsating velocity are calculated as follows 4 u r m s u 1 n n 1 n u n u 2 v r m s v 1 n n 1 n v n v 2 w r m s w 1 n n 1 n w n w 2 the turbulent kinetic energy is calculated as follows 5 t k e 1 2 u u v v w w where n is the number of samples n 250 u v and w are the axial spanwise and vertical velocity components after the time average respectively and u n v n and w n are the axial spanwise and vertical transient velocity components of the n th measurement sample respectively u v and w represent the pulsating velocities in the axial spanwise and vertical directions respectively u rms v rms and w rms represent the root mean square of the axial spanwise and vertical velocities respectively the vorticity at a point is defined as the local rotation or curl of the 3d velocity field 6 ω r o t u c u r l u u w y v z i u z w x j v x u y k where the partial derivative of the velocity field can be calculated using the center difference and the terms on the right side of the equation describe the rotation around the x y and z axes respectively since the velocity field measured using the spiv measurement system in this study is a 2d plane with three directional velocity components the planar data gradients in the ship s traveling direction x direction cannot be calculated therefore only rotation around the x axis can be determined 7 ω x w y v z swirl strength is defined as the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor j adrian et al 2000 8 j u u x u y u z v x v y v z w x w y w z since the piv measurement data is a 2d 3c velocity field the planar data gradients in the x direction cannot be calculated and setting them to zero simplifies the eigenvalue calculation therefore the square of the imaginary part can be computed as follows 9 λ c i 2 1 4 v y 2 1 4 w z 2 1 2 v y w z w y v z which is returned as the swirl strength notably the corresponding eigenvalues will only be complex if this number is negative the local minima of the negative valued swirling strength can be used to identify the vortex cores while positive values indicate areas of the flow where shear may be present but with no swirling motion 4 results and discussion 4 1 axial velocity through the spiv tests the time averaged velocity field vorticity field vector and streamline information at different cross sectional positions at the stern of the bulk carrier were obtained fig 6 shows the comparison diagram of the axial velocity under the bare hull condition tests a and b and fig 7 shows the comparison diagram of the axial velocity under the self propelled condition tests c and d the dimensionless parameters y r and z r are used to represent the y and z axes respectively where r 80 mm is the propeller radius the towing speed u was used for the dimensionless processing of the axial velocity u the white area in the figure is due to the shading of the propeller shaft and laser reflection consequently some flow field results could not be obtained the higher pulsating velocity above the flow field on the right in fig 6 was caused by the lower particle concentration fig 6 shows that in the bare hull condition test a the x l pp 0 section has obvious hook like velocity contour profiles with the velocity ratio being u u 0 3 the contours of the hook like velocity cloud map are shown marked as a in the figure owing to the contraction of the stern profile and the existence of the propeller shaft a strong bilge vortex is gradually generated when the ship s incoming flow streams through the stern the fluid with lower kinetic energy is transferred to the center of the ship by the bilge vortex to weaken the original velocity and the axial velocity contour at the propeller plane exhibits a hook like shape kim et al 2001 at the section x l pp 0 0143 owing to the influence of the longitudinal bilge vortex there is still a hook like velocity contour compared to the propeller plane the extent of the hook like shape of this section is weaker and its range smaller with the velocity ratio being u u 0 4 at x l pp 0 0238 the hook like velocity contour disappears compared to the cases with or without the pss tests a and b pss has an interference effect on the wake flow with the main area of influence being located in the left half that is the side with the blades and the upper hook like velocity contour structure is destroyed showing that the flow field is more uniform for the right half that is the side without blades the wake field is roughly consistent with the bare hull conditions and the velocity contour has an obvious hook like structure however there is still a difference which is manifested in the increase in the uniformity of the flow field indicating that the pss will also affect the right half that is the side without blades fig 7 shows a comparison of the axial velocity of different sections in the self propelled condition because the propeller is constantly rotating the flow field data of the two sets of tests c and d cannot be collected under the same propeller phase however by adjusting the collection frequency to ensure that it matches the rotating speed of the propeller the system can collect data once every two revolutions of the propeller consequently the system collects the flow field information of the propeller at the same phase angle in each group of tests ensuring that the collected data are still of practical significance for exploring the working mechanism of the pss fig 7 shows that compared with the two sets of tests a and b no propeller condition the wake of the two sets of tests c and d increased by varying degrees which was caused by the suction effect of the propeller that is the wake was no longer symmetrical and the wake on the right side was higher than that on the left side which was caused by the rotation of the propeller compared with or without pss the pss reduced the high wake area u u 1 2 on the right hand side of the propeller plane and increased the area of 1 1 u u 1 2 which produced a more uniform propeller inflow to further observe the influence of the pss on the kinetic energy of the wake field the cross section x l pp 0 0143 was selected for data processing fig 8 shows the average kinetic energy distribution at 7 5 cm behind the propeller plane with u 2 being used to non dimensionalize the average kinetic energy ake fig 8 shows that the kinetic energy of the propeller disk surface is low the high rotational energy bilge vortex formed in the bilge of the bulk carrier with a fat and large stern transfers the low kinetic energy water flow to the vicinity of the propeller plane near the longitudinal section of the hull forming the low speed hook like velocity profile in fig 6 the comparison shows that the pss can reduce the kinetic energy on the side with blades which improves the efficiency of the propeller as the wake fields of x l pp 0 and x l pp 0 0048 sections were blocked the axial velocities at different radii of x l pp 0 0143 section were extracted and the position of 0 was defined as the 12 o clock direction pointing to the top of the stern and a point was taken every 10 looking from the stern to the bow with the clockwise direction being the positive direction and the direction of the points shown in fig 2 the axial velocity u is dimensionless using the towing speed u the axial velocity distribution at different radii is shown in fig 9 fig 9 shows that under the condition of the bare hull test a with the development of the wake direction at a larger radius the influence of the stern profile on the ship wake field was reduced and the speed at the ship keel corresponding to 180 increased noticeably before gradually returning to the flow velocity of the external flow field moreover affected by the hook like velocity distribution and based on the velocity distribution law it first increased and then decreased in the range of 0 45 and 315 360 from 0 6 to 1 0r by comparison the velocity distribution at the same position within the range of 0 3 0 5r was relatively gentle owing to the blowing effect of the propeller the axial wake of the working condition with a propeller tests c d was much larger than that of the working condition without a propeller tests a and b comparing the working conditions with or without a pss tests a and b the pss mainly affected the range of 0 5 0 8r the two curves of tests a and b in fig 9 that is 0 9 1 0r basically coincide indicating that the pss has a small effect on the external flow field around the propeller plane the main difference between 0 3r and 0 4r in the figure was in the range of 120 180 which shows the axial velocity of test b to be greater than that of test a making the flow field of the propeller plane more uniform and helping to improve the efficiency of the propeller the range of 0 5r 0 8r is also the range within which the flow field of the propeller disk is most affected by the pss the pss affects both the side with the blades 180 360 and the side without blades 0 180 more specifically the pss reduces the axial velocity on the side without blades whereas the low speed range of the flow field is expanded and the flow field is more uniform on the side with blades the axial velocity increases and the velocity gradient decreases compared with that without blades an increase in the inflow of the left side propeller improved the efficiency of the right handed propeller meanwhile the speed peak near 180 shifted forward by 10 20 which is explained in fig 6 the existence of the pss increased the low speed area of the flow field on the left side of the propeller plane the left isoline is compressed by the low speed area making it dense in the two groups of tests c and d each group of propeller flow fields is a time averaged flow field in a certain phase tests c and d are not in the same phase the curve in fig 9 still shows the same trend as tests a and b the two curves coincide in the range of 0 3 0 4r and 0 9 1 0r indicating that the pss slightly affects the peripheral flow field and the central flow field of the propeller plane with the main difference still being in the range of 0 5 0 8r the change in velocity in test d is more moderate compared with that in test c that is the pss can reduce the speed fluctuation and make the flow field more uniform by extracting the dimensionless axial velocity along the spanwise at the position z r 0 in the section x l pp 0 0143 as shown in fig 10 and comparing tests a and b the pss increased the axial velocity at the same position which is beneficial to the inflow of the right handed propeller on the side of y r 0 the two curves of tests a and b are quite different but the trend is the same it could have been caused by the pss squeezing the left flow field or the differences between the tests under different voyages tests c and d show that after pss the speed value on the left side of the propeller disk decreases the high wake area expands and the flow field on the propeller disk is more uniform which improved the working efficiency of the propeller further analysis of the characteristics of the velocity distribution in the spanwise and vertical directions at 0 5r in the section x l pp 0 0143 is shown in fig 11 on the side without the stator blade 0 180 the spanwise velocities of tests a and b are nearly the same at 190 corresponding to the angle of the bottom blade of the pss the spanwise velocity of test b has a peak value caused by the 20 deviation of the velocity peak value near 210 in test a in the region of 180 360 a comparison of tests a and b demonstrates that the pss increases the spanwise velocity making more water flow to the outside of the propeller disk and reducing the convergence of water flow caused by the stern profile on the left side of the propeller disk to the middle of the hull through tests c and d it is evident that the pss increases the tendency of the fluid flowing outward on the left side of the propeller disk to improve the working efficiency of the propeller similarly the influence of the pss on the vertical velocity is mainly reflected in the range of 180 360 it can be seen from tests a and b that the original peak value of the vertical velocity near 180 is shifted forward by 20 after pss in the range of 180 225 the absolute value of the vertical velocity in test b is larger than that in test a which indicates that the pss increased the inlet angle of attack of the wake field in the range of 225 360 the absolute value of the vertical velocity in test b is less than that in test a and the downward trend of the vertical velocity is decreased because the propeller is right handed the pss can reduce the power consumption and improve propeller efficiency for the test condition with a propeller tests c and d the vertical velocity decreases after the action of the pss in the range of 180 360 indicating the improved working condition of the propeller 4 2 tangential and radial velocity through vector coordinate transformation we transformed the spanwise and vertical velocities into tangential and radial velocities of the wake field at sections x lpp 0 and x lpp 0 0143 the tangential velocity vector and its magnitude are as shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively the tangential and radial velocity flow field structures of test a hull in both figures are completely symmetrical the tangential velocity value is the same but the direction is opposite comparing the tangential velocity of test a hull and test b hull pss it can be observed that the structure of the tangential velocity contour on the side without the stator blade in test b is nearly the same as that in test a on the side with the blade the pss can significantly increase the tangential velocity on the periphery of the propeller disk although it has little effect on the region near the center as the velocity contour around the propeller disk becomes dense the tangential velocity gradient increases and a pre swirl flow opposite to the propeller s rotation is produced this pre swirl flow can increase the propeller inflow and improve the working conditions of the propeller this confirms the results of studies by koushan and krasilnikov koushan et al 2020 who emphasized that the greatest portion of energy saving due to the pss comes from utilizing the kinetic energy associated with tangential velocities which is due to the effect of pre swirl 4 3 vorticity swirl strength and streamline the velocity field data were further processed and the vorticity field information was obtained using eqs 7 and 9 figs 14 20 show the vorticity field information at different sections in the bare hull and self propelled conditions respectively the radius r of the propeller is utilized to make the coordinate dimensionless figs 14 17 show that the bilge vortex b and the propeller hub cap vortex c can be easily identified the section covered by white or gray in the figure is due to the shielding of the propeller shaft and strong laser reflection here the flow field data could not be measured the erroneous vorticity near y r 1 on the left side of the vorticity diagram is caused by the local dead pixels of the ccd camera chip however it did not much affect the vorticity field inside the propeller plane nevertheless the experiment still has research significance the bilge vortex b in the image is a positive vorticity value indicating that the vortex rotates counterclockwise a negative value indicating that the vortex rotates clockwise the bilge vortex on the starboard of the ship model rotates counterclockwise and the bilge vortex on the port of the ship model rotates clockwise and is generated by the bilge in the middle of the hull and transmitted to the propeller plane the hub cap vortex c under the propeller shaft rotates clockwise on the starboard side and anticlockwise on the port side with the rotation direction of the hub cap vortex being opposite to that of the bilge vortex the hub cap vortex of the propeller was generated at the stern shaft and transferred to the propeller plane with the fluid the wake field on the stern of the ship equipped with a pss also shows two sets of vortices as a whole although there are some vortices of lower strength mixed around it the positive and negative vortices being mixed as per figs 14 17 the pss reduces the range of influence of the bilge vortex and expands the strength and range of influence of the hub cap vortex considering that the propeller s rotation direction is right handed this purple positive value vortex has a tendency to spread and its rotation direction is left handed the pss can generate a pre swirl flow in front of the propeller whose rotation direction is opposite to that of the propeller to improve the working conditions of the propeller and improve its propulsion efficiency the streamline diagram shows that the range of the hubcap vortex is enlarged and that the inflow direction of the fluid changes when there is no pss the streamline enters from the lower right corner when the pss is installed the flow direction enters from the lower left corner for the right handed propeller the installation of the pss increased the inflow angle of attack which is conducive to improving the working efficiency of the propeller in the self propelled condition as per figs 18 20 the bilge vortex and hubcap vortex can no longer be identified through the stirring effect of the propeller the port side propeller disk shows a positive counterclockwise vortex wrapped around a negative clockwise vortex and the counterclockwise vortex strength is low because the right handed propeller interacts with the counterclockwise high strength hubcap vortex inducing the latter to become a vortex with lower energy the strength of the bilge vortex generated at the bilge of the hull at the surface of the propeller plane is increased under the action of the propeller after the pss was installed a vortex with the rotation direction opposite to that of the propeller was generated in front of the propeller which was superimposed with the hub cap vortex after interaction with the propeller the positive and negative vortices were mixed which improved the energy utilization moreover the strength of the counterclockwise vortex was stronger than that of the counterclockwise vortex without the pss which also confirmed that a vortex with the rotation direction opposite to that of the propeller was generated by the pss in front of the propeller 4 4 pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy based on equations 4 and 5 shown in section 3 2 the axial pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy at the section x l pp 0 0143 of the wake field can be obtained the pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy are dimensionless using the towing speeds u and u 2 respectively and the coordinate axis is also dimensionless using the radius r of the propeller plane as shown in figs 21 and 22 the larger pulsating velocity at the top of the figures is due to the lower particle concentration fig 21 shows that a symmetrically distributed but large range of pulsating velocities in the wake field of test a and the strength range of turbulent kinetic energy are consistent with the pulsating velocity in test b with the addition of a pss the values of the pulsating velocity and the range of turbulent kinetic energy are reduced maximum value of the local pulsating velocity is reduced and the wake field is more uniform similarly fig 22 shows that the wake field with the pss test d is more uniform than that without the pss test c and the maximum value and range of the local pulsating velocity are reduced this phenomenon is more obvious in the turbulent kinetic energy the high kinetic energy area of the turbulent kinetic energy is significantly reduced and the uniformity of the flow field increases this shows that the pss can significantly improve the uniformity of the wake field and reduce both the local pulsating velocity and turbulent kinetic energy which is beneficial to the structural strength of the propeller 5 conclusions in this study the underwater stereoscopic piv system designed by the dantec dynamics company was applied to the experimental study of a 230 000 dwt bulk carrier scale model in the towing tank at harbin engineering university the wake field data for different sections were obtained including the axial velocity tangential velocity average kinetic energy vorticity swirl strength streamline pulsating velocity turbulent kinetic energy and axial velocity at different radii the wake field data of the ship with or without a pss in the bare hull condition and the ship with or without a pss in the self propelled condition were compared respectively through the analysis and processing of the test data the following conclusions were drawn 1 piv technology is an important measurement technique in the field of naval architecture and ocean engineering in this study piv technology was used to accurately capture the flow field characteristics such as the bilge vortex hubcap vortex and hook like velocity profile in the wake field of a bulk carrier model the velocity value of the hook like velocity cloud contour at the propeller plane was approximately u u 0 30 as the cross sections were far away from the propeller plane the degree of hook weakened and its range decreased this suggests that piv technology has the advantages of transient global non contact and high precision measurements 2 under the condition of the bare hull at the position of the propeller plane the pss exhibited an interference effect on the stern flow the main area of influence was located in the left half of the propeller plane the side with blades and the upper hook like structure was destroyed for the right half the side without blades the velocity contour exhibited an obvious hook like structure but the pss still had an effect there reflected in the increase in the uniformity of the wake field in the self propelled condition the pss reduced the high wake area u u 1 2 on the right side of the propeller plane and at the same time increased the wake area 1 1 u u 1 2 making the propeller inflow more uniform 3 by comparing the axial velocity distribution at different radii it was found that the pss affected the range 0 5r 0 8r and had a negligible effect on the external wake field around the propeller plane the pss affected not only the side where the blades existed 180 360 but also the side without blades 0 180 more specifically the pss reduced the axial velocity on the side without blades that is the low speed range of the flow field was expanded and the flow field was more uniform on the side with blades the axial velocity was increased and the curve was relatively smooth for a right handed propeller it is beneficial to increase the inflow of the left side propeller to improve its efficiency 4 by comparing the dimensionless axial velocity in the spanwise direction at z r 0 in the section of x l pp 0 0143 it was found that the pss increased the axial velocity at the same position which was beneficial to the inflow of the right handed propeller in the self propelled condition the existence of the pss reduced the speed on the left side of the propeller disk and expanded the high wake area the flow field on the left side of the propeller disk was more uniform and improved the working efficiency of the propeller in our analysis of the influence of the pss on the spanwise and vertical velocity of 0 5r the pss increased the spanwise velocity allowed more water flow to the outside of the propeller disk and reduced the convergence of water flow to the middle of the hull caused by the stern profile on the left side of the propeller disk under the self propulsion condition the pss also increased the outward trend of the fluid on the left side of the propeller disk to improve the working efficiency of the propeller similarly because the influence of the pss on the vertical velocity was mainly reflected in the range of 180 360 the pss improved the inflow angle of attack and improved the efficiency of the propeller 5 the pss significantly increased the tangential velocity of the periphery of the propeller disk while having little influence on the region near the center it produced a pre swirl flow in a direction opposite to the propeller rotation in front of the propeller plane increased the inflow toward the propeller disk and improved the working conditions of the propeller on the side with blade the pss had the same effect where the radial velocity increased significantly however the influence range and degree were smaller than the tangential velocity 6 in the analysis the vorticity swirl strength streamline bilge vortex and propeller hub cap vortex were easily identified the bilge vortex on the starboard side of the ship model rotated counterclockwise while the bilge vortex on the port side rotated clockwise which was generated by the bilge in the middle of the ship and transmitted to the propeller plane by the wake the hubcap vortex under the propeller shaft rotated clockwise on the starboard side and counterclockwise on the port side the direction of rotation of the hubcap vortex was opposite to that of the bilge vortex the propeller hubcap vortex was generated at the stern shaft of the hull and transmitted to the propeller plane by the fluid after the pss was installed the positive and negative vortices were mixed in the wake field the pss reduced the influence range of the bilge vortex expanded the strength and influence range of the hubcap vortex and generated a pre swirl flow in which the rotation direction was opposite to the propeller rotation direction in front of the propeller thereby improving the working conditions of the propeller and increasing the propulsion efficiency meanwhile it was found from the streamline diagram that as the fluid inflow direction changed the pss increased the fluid inflow angle of attack which improves the working efficiency of the propeller 7 the pss reduced both the maximum value of the local pulsating velocity and the range of the high kinetic energy region of the turbulent kinetic energy this reduction of the local pulsating velocity and the turbulent kinetic energy shows that the pss significantly improved the uniformity of the wake field making it beneficial to the structural strength of the propeller although the self propulsion condition of the propeller was included in this study it was tested under calm water conditions in addition the environmental effects of wind waves and currents under real sea conditions were not considered although this study has certain limitations the research results clearly reveal the flow mechanism of the ship wake field and the working mechanism of the pss the installation of a pss can significantly improve the propulsion performance of the ship future research should focus on the influence of different environments on the working mechanism of the pss under real sea conditions this can be used to evaluate the propulsion performance of ships in different seas in addition owing to the existence of the propeller shaft and the problem of laser reflection the flow field data in the central area of the propeller plane were missing which was not conducive to observing the wake field structure this should be avoided as much as possible in future experimental designs on the other hand the scale effect has always been a very important and unsolved problem in the ship s flow field for two main reasons firstly regardless of the kind of device installed on the hull its longitudinal length is far less than the length of the hull and considering the actual test speed the reynolds number around the device can only correspond to the laminar flow secondly the boundary layer of the model differs from that of a real ship as do its thickness and velocity distribution consequently it is almost impossible for the mutual interference between the model hull and special devices to be the same as that of the real ship a study presented at the 25th international towing tank conference ittc predicted the energy saving efficiency by model test of an esd kim et al 2008 the results showed that the energy saving efficiency of a 2 m long model is 2 and that of an 8 m long model is 4 5 in contrast the actual energy saving efficiency of a real ship is about 7 statistical value of 12 real ships scholars have also conducted much research on the scale effect dang et al 2012 and dang et al 2011 used smart ship model technology wijngaarden 2011 to simulate the full scale wake field during model tests to gain insights into the scale effects of the esds park et al 2015 proposed a simple and efficient wake field prediction method considering the scale effect of energy saving devices the wake predicted by the proposed method was similar to that obtained in full scale computations schuiling et al 2017 discussed the influence of the scale effect on propeller performance in detail they stated that the scale effect may lead to a small decline in performance zhao 2017 studied the scale effect of energy saving devices by changing the viscosity coefficient of the fluid to make the model and the real ship have the same reynolds number koushan et al 2020 discussed the difference between the model and the full scale wake field by numerical simulation because of the convenience and efficiency of cfd technology the research into the scale effect is typically based on numerical simulation the main purpose of this study was to utilize piv technology to measure and reveal the flow characteristics and energy saving mechanism of the ship model with pss in the model scale as various researchers have stated it is very important to discuss and correct the scale effect the experimental data measured by piv at model scale can be used as the verification data of cfd numerical simulation we can use the cfd method verified by piv data to simulate the wakefield of ships at different scales and analyze the scale effect ascertain the change law of the scale effect and then explore the relevant correction method this is a very good and important topic and we will conduct more research in this area in future work funding this work was financially supported by the

20357,a modified acer method macer is proposed to study the short term extreme mooring tension in experimental and numerical results and an adaptive markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm based on bayesian inference is proposed to fit the parameters of the macer function to study the feasibility of the macer and acer methods two typical cases are considered one case is the taut mooring line of a deepwater semi submersible the other case is a slack mooring line for a point absorber in which it is found that the mooring tensions vary dramatically and snap loads frequently occur both the acer and macer methods are applied to model the 3 h extreme dynamic mooring tension and the estimated values are compared with the measured 3 h maximum dynamic tension fifty fully coupled dynamic analysis are carried out by using the calibrated numerical model the most probable maximum mpm mooring tension is then estimated by using the gumbel model to fit the 50 independent maximum mooring tensions the acer and macer methods are implemented to estimate 3 h extreme mooring tension based on fifty samples and the duration of each sample is 20 min the estimated extreme semi submersible mooring tensions are compared with the mpm value keywords extreme mooring tension macer experimental study bayesian inference adaptive mcmc 1 introduction the mooring system is an important component of floating systems which acts to keep the floating structure on station e g the floating oil gas platforms floating wave energy converters floating wind turbines and floating fish farms the mooring system design is one of the crucial components in floating system design since the mooring system is subjected to dramatic environmental loads and the mooring failure may give rise to the economy or even life loss as a consequence the dynamic responses of the floating system need to be predicted precisely the frequency domain approach is an efficient method for mooring floating system dynamic responses analysis low and langley 2006 however this method is not able to capture the nonlinearities in other words the frequency domain method is not rigorous enough for analysis of mooring dynamics when the nonlinearity is predominant the fully coupled dynamic method gives a good solution to this problem which solves the interactions between the mooring and floating system simultaneously sagrilo et al 2002 2012 the nonlinearity can then be fully captured and the dynamics of the floating system are estimated accurately xu and ji 2014a by noticing that the fully coupled dynamic simulations could be cumbersome low and langley 2008 proposed an efficient hybrid time frequency domain method and this method was successfully applied in extreme floating structure extreme responses low 2008 the wave basin model test is considered the most accurate method in predicting floating structure responses and related studies can be found in ji and xu 2014 xu et al 2018a 2018b 2018b xu and ji 2014b the estimation of the most probable maximum vázquez hernández et al 2011 or the extreme mooring tension analysis is considered an important step in the mooring system design process ma et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the extreme loads on the mooring lines need to be predicted precisely as overestimation would induce overdesign and increase the costs coe et al 2018 while the underestimation would lead to the failure of the mooring system the direct and accurate way to estimate design mooring loads is to repeat the 3 h model tests or numerical simulations n t times to consider the randomness of the environment and the most probable maximum mpm load in 3 h can then be estimated by the gumbel model based on these n t independent maximum tension peaks stanisic et al 2018 it was pointed out that n t should be greater than 30 to obtain accurate estimation stanisic et al 2017 this method is called the global maximum method the global maximum method is time consuming since the simulations need to be repeated several times while the extrapolation method which uses a suitable distribution to fit mooring tension peaks in a reduced duration and then extrapolate to 3 h is an effective alternative solution the weibull model is recommended for extreme mooring tension analysis based on tension time series dnvgl 2015 in other study the three parameter weibull rayleigh exponential and three parameter rayleigh distribution were applied to study the extreme mooring tensions and surge motion responses in shallow water and deepwater based on experimental results izadparast and duggal 2013 the results showed that the three parameter weibull distribution performed well in extreme responses analysis both the three parameter and two parameter weibull distribution were applied to study the extreme mooring tensions of different offshore structures and it was found that the two parameter weibull distribution showed better results for the highly nonlinear responses chen and mills 2010 the gumbel model weibull model and winterstein jensen model were applied to estimate the extreme responses of a spread moored fpso system in different water depths 250m 500m and 1000m cheng and kuang 2016 the results indicated that using 30 40 of the top peaks to fit the weibull distribution is close to the observed data however the weibull model failed to give consistent estimations of extreme tensions for all discussed cases from the review of the previous studies it is seen that most of the current extreme mooring tension studies rely on the weibull distribution and in most cases the weibull model can present accurate results however it fails to give accurate predictions of extreme mooring tension once the snap loads occur hsu et al 2017 as a consequence more advanced methods need to be developed and discussed e g the peak over threshold pot method which has been successfully used in other extreme problems such as wave height ferreira and guedes soares 1998 and dynamics of wind turbine ragan and manuel 2008 or ships wang and moan 2004 the accuracy of the pot method depends highly on the threshold value while it is not easy to determine the threshold value appropriately a too low threshold value would induce the pot not to satisfy the generalized pareto distribution gpd and increase bias on the other hand a high threshold implies the observations are few and the variance of the estimations are increased correspondingly the acer method is another advanced method for extreme value analysis and its estimation is not sensitive to the threshold value naess and gaidai 2009 this method has been successfully applied in different areas such as estimating extreme wind speed karpa and naess 2013 current profile liu et al 2018 sea level skjong et al 2013 and ice loads chai et al 2018 in addition to the application in the environmental study acer also shows good performance in predicting extreme structural dynamic responses naess et al 2012 sagrilo et al 2012 saha et al 2014 xu et al 2017 and structural strength gaspar et al 2012 2014 recently a bivariate acer method was developed to study extreme ship stress gaidai et al 2016 hui et al 2019 the acer method is applied to study mooring tension reliability xu et al 2020a as alternative to other more conventional approaches vázquez hernández et al 2006 in the process of applying the acer method the parameters of the acer function need to be fitted based on the observed data points the traditional method is to apply levenberg marquardt to optimize the mean square error function it is seen that the method for extreme mooring tension analysis still needs to be improved the acer method seems a powerful tool in the study of the extreme mooring tension and needs to be studied extensively however in the current acer method the parameters are estimated by the local optimization method the globally optimized solutions may be missed besides it is not possible to evaluate the uncertainties of fitted parameters in this study a macer method is proposed which is developed by introducing a location parameter to the traditional acer function to increase the versatility the parameters of the macer function are estimated via the bayesian inference and the uncertainties of sampled parameters are evaluated since the characteristic of mooring dynamics in shallow water and deepwater is different two special cases are studied in the present work to check the applicability of macer method the first case is 3 h extreme mooring tension analysis of taut mooring for semisubmersible the dynamic mooring tensions are simulated by a verified numerical tool xu et al 2018b the extreme mooring tension and its confidence interval are predicted by the acer and macer methods by repeating 50 times of the numerical simulations the accuracy of these two methods is checked by the global maximum methods the other case is the 3 h extreme dynamic mooring tension analysis of a slack mooring rope moored to a point absorber in which the snap loads can be found during tests which could introduce difficulty in accurately estimating extreme mooring tension xu et al 2020b xu and guedes soares 2020 2021 the performance of acer and macer methods in predicting extreme dynamic mooring tension under the influence of snap events is studied the analysis is based on the measured mooring tension time series because in this case not many time series are available it is difficult for acer method to estimate the confidence interval of extreme tension while this value is estimated by the macer method to account for the uncertainties of model parameters 2 methodologies 2 1 global maximum method the global maximum method is robust and accurate in extreme value analysis which is implemented by selecting the highest peak from each sample saha et al 2014 xu et al 2019 the extracted peaks are then fitted by the gumbel distribution which has a cumulative distribution as guedes soares and scotto 2011 1 f x μ β exp exp x μ σ where μ and σ denote the location factor and scale factor respectively in this study the parameters of gumbel distribution are fitted by the l moments method firstly sample x is ordered as 2 x 1 n x 2 n x n n where n is the sample size the unbiased estimator of probability weighted moment is calculated by the following formula 3 b r n 1 n 1 r 1 j r 1 n j 1 r x j n and the

the value that has the 1 1 e chance to be exceeded and can be calculated as 12 x mp μ β ln ln f 1 e μ 2 3 acer method the acer method is a powerful approach in extreme value analysis naess and gaidai 2009 saha et al 2014 the p η prob m n η is used to estimate the probability for large values of η m n is the maximum observation by assuming the observations are independent and identically distributed iid the p η is approximated as 13 p η j 1 n p x j η 2 4 the conditional exceedance probability is defined as 14 α k j prob x j η x j k 1 η x j 1 η where α kj denotes exceedance probability

defined as 16 ε k 1 n k 1 j k n α k j η k 1 2 for both stationary and non stationary time series the sample estimate of acer would be 17 ε ˆ k η 1 m m 1 m ε ˆ k m η where m is the number of samples index m refers to the realization no m assuming the samples are independent the 95 confidence interval ci for acer is given as 18 ci η ε ˆ k η 1 96 s k η m where s k η is the standard deviation of ε ˆ

a k b k c k and q k are the parameters related to k η 1 equals to the threshold the parameters a b c and q are determined by minimizing the following mean square error function with respect to all four arguments 21 f a b c q j 1 r w j log ε k η j log q a η j b c 2 where η 1 η r denotes the levels where acer function has been estimated w j denotes a weight factor it is given as 22 w j log c η j log c η j θ θ 1 or 2 in this study θ 2 is used the levenberg marquardt algorithm is applied to solve eq 21 to obtain parameters a b c and q 2 5 macer method to increase the versatility of acer method a modified acer macer method is proposed in this work a scale parameter is added to eq 20 i e the mean exceedance rate is approximated as 23 ε k η q k η exp a k η b k c k d k η η 1 the bayesian inference theory is applied to estimate the characteristics of macer parameters via adaptive mcmc am haario et al 2001 in comparison with the traditional metropolis hastings algorithm the am strategy does not need the recommended distribution to generate the parameters while a gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix depends on the history of the chain is created to obtain the markov chain

x 1 r 2 6 semi submersible 2 6 1 experimental set up the sixth generation semi submersible hysy 981 moored by different mooring systems were studied extensively by experimental and numerical methods ji and xu 2014 xu et al 2018a 2018b the length width and draft of this platform is 114 07m 78 68m and 16m respectively and the displacement is 48196t the mooring system is composed of taut wires which are fully symmetrically arranged and the azimuth angle between each group of mooring lines and x axis are 25 45 65 the schematic of mooring lines arrangement is given in fig 1 the 1 50 irregular wave model test was conducted in the seakeeping wave basin at china ship scientific research center cssrc to study the dynamic responses in 100 year wave condition in the south china sea ji and yuan 2015 the water depth was 4m fig 2 shows the semi submersible model in the head sea condition the sampling frequency of the data acquisition system was set as 50hz and the duration of each irregular wave model was 1800s which equals 3 5 h in full scale the irregular wave was simulated by jonswap spectrum the significant wave height was 13 7m peak period was 16s and peak enhancement factor was 2 4 in full scale in this work only the head sea condition is studied the coordinates of fairleads are tabulated in table 1 only fsa1 fsa3 are given because the fairleads are fully symmetrically arranged the origin of coordinates is located in the geometrical centre of the model bottom the index of fairlead is identical to the mooring line e g fsa1 is the fairlead of 1 mooring line the main parameters of the mooring model are listed in table 2 where ea is the axial stiffness sw and aw are weight per unit length in water and in air respectively the mooring radius r was set as 5 67m the characteristics of mooring models need to be calibrated before conducting irregular wave model tests the calibration results are shown in fig 3 where the measured results are converted to the full scale according to the froude scaling rule it is seen that the measured single mooring top tension is in good agreement with target one which indicates that the mooring statics are well modelled the measured mooring system restoring force matches well with the target one when the displacement is small and the discrepancies between the measured result and target are increased with the displacement e g when the horizontal displacement is 4 m and 20 m the relative error is 10 and 16 respectively it is seen the restoring force is underestimated by mooring models in the case when the displacement is large part of the reason could be the pretensions of mooring models were not well adjusted during the model tests since the water depth of the wave basin is 4 m and it is difficult to set the anchor points as the designed ones however it has been validated that the small discrepancies of pretension will not introduce great differences of mooring dynamics xu et al 2018b overall the discrepancies between modelled mooring statics and target ones are acceptable and the mooring models are qualified for the model tests the generated wave in the basin was calibrated before conducting an irregular wave model test and the result is shown in fig 4 and the measured result is changed to full scale from the comparison between the measured wave spectrum and target one it is seen these two spectra are in good agreement which validates that the wave was well modelled 2 7 validation of the numerical model during the extreme value analysis to consider the uncertainties of wave elevations experiments need to be carried out several times with different wave seeds this approach is computationally expensive while an alternative and efficient method is to apply the numerical method to simulate the dynamic responses of floating structure and mooring line before conducting numerical simulations the accuracy of the numerical model needs to be validated while calibration of vessel and mooring line hydrodynamic coefficients is one of the most important steps the importance of mooring drag coefficients on system dynamics can be found in xu et al 2020a the calibration procedure is introduced in xu et al 2018a and is used in this work the full coupled dynamic analysis was carried out in deepc dnvgl 2017 and the tangential and normal drag coefficients of the mooring line were determined as 0 6 and 1 85 respectively and the tangential and normal drag coefficients were determined as 1 4 and 1 8 the surge motion responses and 1 fairlead mooring tensions spectral densities obtained by the experimental method and numerical simulation are compared in fig 5 it is seen the numerical and experimental results are very close despite the discrepancies of spectral peaks and the spectral periods between these two results are similar to compare the results clearly the statistics of dynamic responses are concluded in table 3 it is observed that the numerical model shows good performance in estimating dynamic responses of floating systems both the simulated surge motion responses and mooring tensions are close to the measured ones the discrepancies between measured maximum responses and corresponding numerical ones are below 19 this indicates that the numerical tool is qualified for predicting the dynamic responses of the floating system which provides accurate estimations for vessel motion responses and mooring tensions 2 8 extreme responses analysis with random wave elevations considered 2 8 1 global maximum method the global maximum method is usually used as the benchmark for other extreme value analysis methods due to its high accuracy stanisic et al 2018 it was pointed out that the number of realizations for the global maximum method should be between 30 and 40 to obtain an accurate estimation stanisic et al 2017 in this study a total of 50 independent 3 h fully coupled dynamic simulations were carried out with the random wave seeds in head sea condition the 1 mooring line is the most loaded one and its fairlead tension will be studied the maximum 1 mooring tensions in each simulation are plotted in fig 6 where it is seen the effects of wave elevations on maximum mooring tension are significant the difference between the minimum and maximum value of these 50 independent maximum peaks are over 1000 kn the gumbel distribution is then used to estimate the probability distribution of these 50 independent observations and the parameters of gumbel distribution are fitted by the l moments method described above to check the performance of the fitted gumbel model in modelling the probability distribution of maximum mooring tensions the q q plot is shown in fig 7 it is observed that almost all the data are distributed along the reference line which validates that the parameters of the gumbel model are well fitted the mpm value is then obtained by applying eq 12 and the 95 confidence is evaluated by the non parametric bootstrapping technique the results are concluded in table 4 where it is seen the 3 h mpm of 1 mooring tension is 3470 kn and the 95 confidence interval is 3408 kn 3521 kn 2 8 2 acer method following the study of xu et al 2020a the duration of observations d s is determined as 20 min and the 3 h extreme value can be obtained by extrapolating the exceedance probability to 3 h the 3 h exceedance probability is estimated by the extrapolation method 48 prob x x r 1 1 λ ζ where ζ r k 1 d s r is the number of data point in 20 min λ 180 3 h and the return values can be obtained by invoking the exceedance probability to eq 20 the ensemble which includes 50 20 min simulations are used for determining the 3 h extreme 1 mooring tension since the acer method is insensitive to the threshold η 1 naess and gaidai 2009 a low threshold value is adopted to include more data and reduce uncertainty the η 1 is determined as 49 η 1 η 0 2 s η where s η denotes the standard deviation of η the empirical acer values conditional on different k values are compared in fig 8 where it is found that the influence of k on acer is limited in the following study the k 3 is used the 95 confidence interval of ε 3 η is calculated according to eq 18 ε 3 η and its corresponding 95 confidence interval is then fitted by applying eq 20 the fitted acers are then compared with the empirical ones and results are shown in fig 9 it is seen that the empirical values are well fitted by the acer method which validates that the acer method shows good performance in estimating the mooring tension exceedance probability the extreme tension can then be estimated and table 5 shows the results where it seen the extreme mooring tension predicted by the acer method is close to the mpm value the difference between these two values are 2 this indicates that the acer method is a good choice for extreme mooring tension analysis which provides an accurate estimation of the extreme mooring tension besides this method is much more efficient than the global maximum method 2 8 3 macer method the macer method is applied to study the 3 h extreme 1 mooring tension and the parameters are of macer are fitted by the bayesian inference theory described above and the return values can be obtained by invoking the exceedance probability to eq 23 in the following study the macer method is applied to analyse the extreme dynamic mooring tension by adopting the bayesian inference theory the uncertainties of macer parameters and 3 h return value are estimated by am approach to increase the convergence the levenberg marquardt algorithm is first applied to solve eq 23 and the solutions are acted as the initial chain then the upper bounds of q a and c are determined as 100 times to the corresponding initial value for example t q is calculated as 50 t q 100 q 0 where q 0 is calculated by the levenberg marquardt algorithm the c 0 is chosen according to prior information here in this study c 0 is determined empirically a relatively large value is used which equals 50 i n the am algorithm is applied to sample the parameters of macer the total iteration is set as 50 000 the corresponding results are shown in figs 10 15 where it is seen the markov chains converge to stable stages for all discussed parameters the parameters q a and d are rather stable while the parameters b and c walk in a wide range besides the error functions are found to be limited in a small range which is below 0 25 it indicates that the proposed am approach works well in sampling the parameters for the macer function in eq 23 the posterior statistics of ε 3 and its 95 confidence interval parameters are then concluded in tables 6 8 and the first 20 000 iterations are used for burn in it is seen that the uncertainties of q a and d are low all of these parameters are very stable while the b and c vary much more dramatically compared with the other three parameters it implies that the exceedance probability is more sensitive to the q a and d than b and c the estimated ε 3 by macer method are then compared with the corresponding empirical ones and the results are shown in fig 16 where good agreements between fitted curves and empirical curves are seen in other words the macer approach performs well in estimating the exceedance probability of 1 mooring tension the extreme mooring tension can be obtained by invoking the target exceedance probability to eq 23 and the 95 confidence interval of each estimated value is predicted according to eq 51 51 c i q q τ s q r where τ t 1 1 0 95 2 r 1 is the corresponding quantile of the student s t distribution with r 1 degrees of freedom the results are concluded in table 9 where it is seen the predicted 3 h extreme 1 mooring tension is 3543 kn and is extremely close to the benchmark value it implies that the macer is a competitive method for extreme mooring tension analysis which provides an accurate estimation of the extreme mooring tension by taking the uncertainties of calculating of ε ˆ 3 η and macer parameters fitting into consideration the 95 confidence interval can then be determined as 3512 kn 3575 kn 2 9 point absorber according to be the previous case it is seen that the uncertainties of the extreme value of the acer method is estimated by repeating the simulations or model tests however in most cases the experimental test will not be repeated due to the economic costs in other words the confidence interval of extreme value is difficult to be predicted by the acer method in this section the irregular wave model tests were conducted to capture the dynamics of a point absorber slack mooring system based on the measured mooring tension time series both the acer and macer method are applied to study the extreme dynamic mooring tensions the uncertainties of the parameters of the macer model are evaluated by the am algorithm 2 10 experimental set up a series of 1 100 scale model tests were carried out in the wave basin of the laboratory of the hydraulics of the university of porto to study the dynamics of a point absorber the wave basin is 28m long 12m wide and the maximum depth is 1 2m while the water depth was set as 0 8m in our tests a multidirectional multi directional wavemaker capable of generating regular and irregular waves in any direction is equipped only the head sea condition was considered during the model tests a cylinder buoy was acted as the point absorber and numerous circular rubber segments were put inside the buoy used as ballast the main parameters of buoy are listed in table 10 where d is buoy diameter h is height z g is the coordinate of the buoy gravity centre which is referenced to the bottom in fig 17 it is seen three moorings which were arranged with relative azimuth angles of 120 to keep the buoy on station the mooring line was composed of two segments bottom chain and top polyester the coordinates of fairleads are given in table 11 the length of chain and polyester is 0 7m and 1m the main parameters are shown in table 12 where wa and ws are the mass in air and submerged mass respectively the mooring radius was determined as 1 4m the qualisys optical motion tracking system with three cameras was used the measure six dof buoy motions and a load sensor was installed on the top of 1 mooring line to measure the mooring tension time series in this work only the mooring tension is studied the buoy motion responses were discussed xu et al 2018c the experimental set up is shown in fig 18 the irregular wave was modelled by jonswap spectrum the significant wave height and peak period were 0 107m and 1 16s respectively while the peak enhancement factor was 4 the generated wave in the wave basin needs to be calibrated before conducting irregular wave model tests the result is displayed in fig 19 it is seen the generated wave matches well with the target one which certificates that the wavemaker works well and qualified for the model tests 2 11 extreme dynamic mooring tension analysis the duration of the irregular wave model test was 1200s which equals 12000s in full scale since in ocean engineering 3 h is enough to represent a short term sea state the extreme value in 3 h is considered as the short term extreme value in the following study the mooring tension time series are sampled with 1130s durations while the first 50 s transient results are neglected the 1 mooring is the most loaded one in head sea condition and is chosen as the study object the 1 mooring tension time series are shown in fig 20 where it is seen that the maximum tension closes to 90n and most loads are snap loads the dynamic tension is defined as the range between peak tension and trough tension dnvgl 2015 52 t d j t max j t min j j 1 r where t max is the peak tension which is defined as the maximum tension between two mean up crossings t min is the trough tension which is defined as the minimum tension between two mean low crossings r is the total number of dynamic tension in the concerned duration 1080s in fig 21 the empirical acer ε k η is plotted versus the mooring tensions the effect of degree of conditioning on acer is clear the threshold value is determined according to eq 49 the figure reveals that k has a significant influence on acer when the mooring tensions are below 60n however the acer value is not sensitive to k value in the tail data it is seen the acer functions all converge in the tail data it indicates that the k 1 is a good choice in this study since it makes much more observations for extreme value analysis and the uncertainty is reduced accordingly once the k value is determined the acer parameters are determined by applying levenberg marquardt algorithm the fitted acer is then compared with the empirical one the result is given in fig 22 it is seen the fitted acer is in good agreement with the empirical one which demonstrates that the parameters are well fitted by invoking eq 47 to eq 20 the 3 h extreme dynamic mooring tension can be obtained the result is marked in fig 22 it is observed that the estimated extreme value is very close to the measured maximum value 86 23 n which validates the accuracy of the acer method in the application of snap load event however the confidence interval is not able to be estimated since the test was conducted once m 1 the am procedure is identical to section 3 fig 23 shows the results of estimated parameters and error function are calculated correspondingly it is seen a b and c are easier to be stable than q and d however all the parameters are varied in the small range no abrupt results are found to reveal the statistical properties of each parameter fig 24 gives the empirical probability densities of each macer parameter it is seen that the markov chains have converged well all the parameters are concentrated in limited range and the error function oscillates around 11 9 the posterior statistics of macer parameters are then shown in table 13 and the first 20 000 iterations are used for burn in where it is seen uncertainties of all parameters are low once the parameters are sampled the ε η can be estimated by inputting the mean values of each parameter to eq 23 in fig 25 the acer curve fitted by bayesian inference is compared with the empirical one where it is seen these two curves are in good agreement it indicates that the mcmc approach works well in parameters estimations besides it is observed that the confidence interval is narrow due to low uncertainties the estimated 3 h return values estimated by acer and macer method are listed in table 14 where it is found that the results are close to the measured maximum dynamic mooring tension and the uncertainty of estimated extreme value by macer method is low this implies that both the acer and macer method shows good performance in estimating extreme mooring tension for the case of snap loads 3 conclusions the current work studies the extreme mooring tension problem based on numerical and experimental results two typical cases are studied one case is the taut mooring line of a deepwater semi submersible and the mooring tensions are quite stable the other case is the slack mooring line for a point absorber which is found that the mooring tensions vary dramatically and snap loads frequently occur the acer method with the parameters solved by levenberg marquardt algorithm and macer method combined with bayesian inference theory are applied to study the short term extreme mooring tension of these two cases the numerical simulation and the experimental measurements are used to determine the short term extreme loads both the acer and macer methods give accurate predictions of the extreme mooring tension of the taut mooring of a semisubmersible but the acer method only considers uncertainties of extreme mooring tension due to random wave elevations in addition to random wave elevations the influence of uncertain model parameters on extreme mooring tension is also accounted for by the macer method for the case of the shallow water slack mooring line of a point absorber both the acer and macer methods provide precise estimations of the short term extreme dynamic mooring tension despite the influence of snap loads however the acer method is not able to consider the uncertainties of the estimated extreme value since there is only one tested time series overall the comparisons validate both the acer and macer methods as ideal tools for extreme mooring tension analysis as both present accurate estimations of short term extreme mooring tension despite the complexity of mooring tension variations the acer method is computationally more efficient than the macer method since the mcmc is needed to sample data for the macer function however acer can only handle the uncertainties of calculating empirical εk while the macer method can take both the uncertainties of εk and parameters fitting into consideration credit authorship contribution statement

20357,a modified acer method macer is proposed to study the short term extreme mooring tension in experimental and numerical results and an adaptive markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm based on bayesian inference is proposed to fit the parameters of the macer function to study the feasibility of the macer and acer methods two typical cases are considered one case is the taut mooring line of a deepwater semi submersible the other case is a slack mooring line for a point absorber in which it is found that the mooring tensions vary dramatically and snap loads frequently occur both the acer and macer methods are applied to model the 3 h extreme dynamic mooring tension and the estimated values are compared with the measured 3 h maximum dynamic tension fifty fully coupled dynamic analysis are carried out by using the calibrated numerical model the most probable maximum mpm mooring tension is then estimated by using the gumbel model to fit the 50 independent maximum mooring tensions the acer and macer methods are implemented to estimate 3 h extreme mooring tension based on fifty samples and the duration of each sample is 20 min the estimated extreme semi submersible mooring tensions are compared with the mpm value keywords extreme mooring tension macer experimental study bayesian inference adaptive mcmc 1 introduction the mooring system is an important component of floating systems which acts to keep the floating structure on station e g the floating oil gas platforms floating wave energy converters floating wind turbines and floating fish farms the mooring system design is one of the crucial components in floating system design since the mooring system is subjected to dramatic environmental loads and the mooring failure may give rise to the economy or even life loss as a consequence the dynamic responses of the floating system need to be predicted precisely the frequency domain approach is an efficient method for mooring floating system dynamic responses analysis low and langley 2006 however this method is not able to capture the nonlinearities in other words the frequency domain method is not rigorous enough for analysis of mooring dynamics when the nonlinearity is predominant the fully coupled dynamic method gives a good solution to this problem which solves the interactions between the mooring and floating system simultaneously sagrilo et al 2002 2012 the nonlinearity can then be fully captured and the dynamics of the floating system are estimated accurately xu and ji 2014a by noticing that the fully coupled dynamic simulations could be cumbersome low and langley 2008 proposed an efficient hybrid time frequency domain method and this method was successfully applied in extreme floating structure extreme responses low 2008 the wave basin model test is considered the most accurate method in predicting floating structure responses and related studies can be found in ji and xu 2014 xu et al 2018a 2018b 2018b xu and ji 2014b the estimation of the most probable maximum vázquez hernández et al 2011 or the extreme mooring tension analysis is considered an important step in the mooring system design process ma et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the extreme loads on the mooring lines need to be predicted precisely as overestimation would induce overdesign and increase the costs coe et al 2018 while the underestimation would lead to the failure of the mooring system the direct and accurate way to estimate design mooring loads is to repeat the 3 h model tests or numerical simulations n t times to consider the randomness of the environment and the most probable maximum mpm load in 3 h can then be estimated by the gumbel model based on these n t independent maximum tension peaks stanisic et al 2018 it was pointed out that n t should be greater than 30 to obtain accurate estimation stanisic et al 2017 this method is called the global maximum method the global maximum method is time consuming since the simulations need to be repeated several times while the extrapolation method which uses a suitable distribution to fit mooring tension peaks in a reduced duration and then extrapolate to 3 h is an effective alternative solution the weibull model is recommended for extreme mooring tension analysis based on tension time series dnvgl 2015 in other study the three parameter weibull rayleigh exponential and three parameter rayleigh distribution were applied to study the extreme mooring tensions and surge motion responses in shallow water and deepwater based on experimental results izadparast and duggal 2013 the results showed that the three parameter weibull distribution performed well in extreme responses analysis both the three parameter and two parameter weibull distribution were applied to study the extreme mooring tensions of different offshore structures and it was found that the two parameter weibull distribution showed better results for the highly nonlinear responses chen and mills 2010 the gumbel model weibull model and winterstein jensen model were applied to estimate the extreme responses of a spread moored fpso system in different water depths 250m 500m and 1000m cheng and kuang 2016 the results indicated that using 30 40 of the top peaks to fit the weibull distribution is close to the observed data however the weibull model failed to give consistent estimations of extreme tensions for all discussed cases from the review of the previous studies it is seen that most of the current extreme mooring tension studies rely on the weibull distribution and in most cases the weibull model can present accurate results however it fails to give accurate predictions of extreme mooring tension once the snap loads occur hsu et al 2017 as a consequence more advanced methods need to be developed and discussed e g the peak over threshold pot method which has been successfully used in other extreme problems such as wave height ferreira and guedes soares 1998 and dynamics of wind turbine ragan and manuel 2008 or ships wang and moan 2004 the accuracy of the pot method depends highly on the threshold value while it is not easy to determine the threshold value appropriately a too low threshold value would induce the pot not to satisfy the generalized pareto distribution gpd and increase bias on the other hand a high threshold implies the observations are few and the variance of the estimations are increased correspondingly the acer method is another advanced method for extreme value analysis and its estimation is not sensitive to the threshold value naess and gaidai 2009 this method has been successfully applied in different areas such as estimating extreme wind speed karpa and naess 2013 current profile liu et al 2018 sea level skjong et al 2013 and ice loads chai et al 2018 in addition to the application in the environmental study acer also shows good performance in predicting extreme structural dynamic responses naess et al 2012 sagrilo et al 2012 saha et al 2014 xu et al 2017 and structural strength gaspar et al 2012 2014 recently a bivariate acer method was developed to study extreme ship stress gaidai et al 2016 hui et al 2019 the acer method is applied to study mooring tension reliability xu et al 2020a as alternative to other more conventional approaches vázquez hernández et al 2006 in the process of applying the acer method the parameters of the acer function need to be fitted based on the observed data points the traditional method is to apply levenberg marquardt to optimize the mean square error function it is seen that the method for extreme mooring tension analysis still needs to be improved the acer method seems a powerful tool in the study of the extreme mooring tension and needs to be studied extensively however in the current acer method the parameters are estimated by the local optimization method the globally optimized solutions may be missed besides it is not possible to evaluate the uncertainties of fitted parameters in this study a macer method is proposed which is developed by introducing a location parameter to the traditional acer function to increase the versatility the parameters of the macer function are estimated via the bayesian inference and the uncertainties of sampled parameters are evaluated since the characteristic of mooring dynamics in shallow water and deepwater is different two special cases are studied in the present work to check the applicability of macer method the first case is 3 h extreme mooring tension analysis of taut mooring for semisubmersible the dynamic mooring tensions are simulated by a verified numerical tool xu et al 2018b the extreme mooring tension and its confidence interval are predicted by the acer and macer methods by repeating 50 times of the numerical simulations the accuracy of these two methods is checked by the global maximum methods the other case is the 3 h extreme dynamic mooring tension analysis of a slack mooring rope moored to a point absorber in which the snap loads can be found during tests which could introduce difficulty in accurately estimating extreme mooring tension xu et al 2020b xu and guedes soares 2020 2021 the performance of acer and macer methods in predicting extreme dynamic mooring tension under the influence of snap events is studied the analysis is based on the measured mooring tension time series because in this case not many time series are available it is difficult for acer method to estimate the confidence interval of extreme tension while this value is estimated by the macer method to account for the uncertainties of model parameters 2 methodologies 2 1 global maximum method the global maximum method is robust and accurate in extreme value analysis which is implemented by selecting the highest peak from each sample saha et al 2014 xu et al 2019 the extracted peaks are then fitted by the gumbel distribution which has a cumulative distribution as guedes soares and scotto 2011 1 f

defined as 16 ε k 1 n k 1 j k n α k j η k 1 2 for both stationary and non stationary time series the sample estimate of acer would be 17 ε ˆ k η 1 m m 1 m ε ˆ k m η where m is the number of samples

a k b k c k and q k are the parameters related to k η 1 equals to the threshold the parameters a b c and q are determined by minimizing the following mean square error function with respect to all four arguments 21 f a b c q j 1 r w j log ε k η j log q a η j b c 2 where η 1 η r denotes the levels where acer function has been estimated w j denotes a weight factor it is given as 22 w j log c η j

a modified acer macer method is proposed in this work a scale parameter is added to eq 20 i e the mean exceedance rate is approximated as 23 ε k η q k η exp a k η b k c k d k η η 1 the bayesian inference theory is applied to estimate the characteristics of macer parameters via adaptive mcmc am haario et al 2001 in comparison with the traditional metropolis hastings algorithm the am strategy does not need the recommended distribution to generate the parameters while a gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix depends on the history of the chain is created to obtain the markov chain

x 1 r 2 6 semi submersible 2 6 1 experimental set up the sixth generation semi submersible hysy 981 moored by different mooring systems were studied extensively by experimental and numerical methods ji and xu 2014 xu et al 2018a 2018b the length width and draft of this platform is 114 07m 78 68m and 16m respectively and the displacement is 48196t the mooring system is composed of taut wires which are fully symmetrically arranged and the azimuth angle between each group of mooring lines and x axis are 25 45 65 the schematic of mooring lines arrangement is given in fig 1 the 1 50 irregular wave model test was conducted in the seakeeping wave basin at china ship scientific research center cssrc to study the dynamic responses in 100 year wave condition in the south china sea ji and yuan 2015 the water depth was 4m fig 2 shows the semi submersible model in the head sea condition the sampling frequency of the data acquisition system was set as 50hz and the duration of each irregular wave model was 1800s which equals 3 5 h in full scale the irregular wave was simulated by jonswap spectrum the significant wave height was 13 7m peak period was 16s and peak enhancement factor was 2 4 in full scale in this work only the head sea condition is studied the coordinates of fairleads are tabulated in table 1 only fsa1 fsa3 are given because the fairleads are fully symmetrically arranged the origin of coordinates is located in the geometrical centre of the model bottom the index of fairlead is identical to the mooring line e g fsa1 is the fairlead of 1 mooring line the main parameters of the mooring model are listed in table 2 where ea is the axial stiffness sw and aw are weight per unit length in water and in air respectively the mooring radius r was set as 5 67m the characteristics of mooring models need to be calibrated before conducting irregular wave model tests the calibration results are shown in fig 3 where the measured results are converted to the full scale according to the froude scaling rule it is seen that the measured single mooring top tension is in good agreement with target one which indicates that the mooring statics are well modelled the measured mooring system restoring force matches well with the target one when the displacement is small and the discrepancies between the measured result and target are increased with the displacement e g when the horizontal displacement is 4 m and 20 m the relative error is 10 and 16 respectively it is seen the restoring force is underestimated by mooring models in the case when the displacement is large part of the reason could be the pretensions of mooring models were not well adjusted during the model tests since the water depth of the wave basin is 4 m and it is difficult to set the anchor points as the designed ones however it has been validated that the small discrepancies of pretension will not introduce great differences of mooring dynamics xu et al 2018b overall the discrepancies between modelled mooring statics and target ones are acceptable and the mooring models are qualified for the model tests the generated wave in the basin was calibrated before conducting an irregular wave model test and the result is shown in fig 4 and the measured result is changed to full scale from the comparison between the measured wave spectrum and target one it is seen these two spectra are in good agreement which validates that the wave was well modelled 2 7 validation of the numerical model during the extreme value analysis to consider the uncertainties of wave elevations experiments need to be carried out several times with different wave seeds this approach is computationally expensive while an alternative and efficient method is to apply the numerical method to simulate the dynamic responses of floating structure and mooring line before conducting numerical simulations the accuracy of the numerical model needs to be validated while calibration of vessel and mooring line hydrodynamic coefficients is one of the most important steps the importance of mooring drag coefficients on system dynamics can be found in xu et al 2020a the calibration procedure is introduced in xu et al 2018a and is used in this work the full coupled dynamic analysis was carried out in deepc dnvgl 2017 and the tangential and normal drag coefficients of the mooring line were determined as 0 6 and 1 85 respectively and the tangential and normal drag coefficients were determined as 1 4 and 1 8 the surge motion responses and 1 fairlead mooring tensions spectral densities obtained by the experimental method and numerical simulation are compared in fig 5 it is seen the numerical and experimental results are very close despite the discrepancies of spectral peaks and the spectral periods between these two results are similar to compare the results clearly the statistics of dynamic responses are concluded in table 3 it is observed that the numerical model shows good performance in estimating dynamic responses of floating systems both the simulated surge motion responses and mooring tensions are close to the measured ones the discrepancies between measured maximum responses and corresponding numerical ones are below 19 this indicates that the numerical tool is qualified for predicting the dynamic responses of the floating system which provides accurate estimations for vessel motion responses and mooring tensions 2 8 extreme responses analysis with random wave elevations considered 2 8 1 global maximum method the global maximum method is usually used as the benchmark for other extreme value analysis methods due to its high accuracy stanisic et al 2018 it was pointed out that the number of realizations for the global maximum method should be between 30 and 40 to obtain an accurate estimation stanisic et al 2017 in this study a total of 50 independent 3 h fully coupled dynamic simulations were carried out with the random wave seeds in head sea condition the 1 mooring line is the most loaded one and its fairlead tension will be studied the maximum 1 mooring tensions in each simulation are plotted in fig 6 where it is seen the effects of wave elevations on maximum mooring tension are significant the difference between the minimum and maximum value of these 50 independent maximum peaks are over 1000 kn the gumbel distribution is then used to estimate the probability distribution of these 50 independent observations and the parameters of gumbel distribution are fitted by the l moments method described above to check the performance of the fitted gumbel model in modelling the probability distribution of maximum mooring tensions the q q plot is shown in fig 7 it is observed that almost all the data are distributed along the reference line which validates that the parameters of the gumbel model are well fitted the mpm value is then obtained by applying eq 12 and the 95 confidence is evaluated by the non parametric bootstrapping technique the results are concluded in table 4 where it is seen the 3 h mpm of 1 mooring tension is 3470 kn and the 95 confidence interval is 3408 kn 3521 kn 2 8 2 acer method following the study of xu et al 2020a the duration of observations d s is determined as 20 min and the 3 h extreme value can be obtained by extrapolating the exceedance probability to 3 h the 3 h exceedance probability is estimated by the extrapolation method 48 prob x x r 1 1 λ ζ where ζ r k 1 d s r is the number of data point in 20 min λ 180 3 h and the return values can be obtained by invoking the exceedance probability to eq 20 the ensemble which includes 50 20 min simulations are used for determining the 3 h extreme 1 mooring tension since the acer method is insensitive to the threshold η 1 naess and gaidai 2009 a low threshold value is adopted to include more data and reduce uncertainty the η 1 is determined as 49 η 1 η 0 2 s η where s η denotes the standard deviation of η the empirical acer values conditional on different k values are compared in fig 8 where it is found that the influence of k on acer is limited in the following study the k 3 is used the 95 confidence interval of ε 3 η is calculated according to eq 18 ε 3 η and its corresponding 95 confidence interval is then fitted by applying eq 20 the fitted acers are then compared with the empirical ones and results are shown in fig 9 it is seen that the empirical values are well fitted by the acer method which validates that the acer method shows good performance in estimating the mooring tension exceedance probability the extreme tension can then be estimated and table 5 shows the results where it seen the extreme mooring tension predicted by the acer method is close to the mpm value the difference between these two values are 2 this indicates that the acer method is a good choice for extreme mooring tension analysis which provides an accurate estimation of the extreme mooring tension besides this method is much more efficient than the global maximum method 2 8 3 macer method the macer method is applied to study the 3 h extreme 1 mooring tension and the parameters are of macer are fitted by the bayesian inference theory described above and the return values can be obtained by invoking the exceedance probability to eq 23 in the following study the macer method is applied to analyse the extreme dynamic mooring tension by adopting the bayesian inference theory the uncertainties of macer parameters and 3 h return value are estimated by am approach to increase the convergence the levenberg marquardt algorithm is first applied to solve eq 23 and the solutions are acted as the initial chain then the upper bounds of q a and c are determined as 100 times to the corresponding initial value for example t q is calculated as 50 t q 100 q 0 where q 0 is calculated by the levenberg marquardt algorithm the c 0 is chosen according to prior information here in this study c 0 is determined empirically a relatively large value is used which equals 50 i n the am algorithm is applied to sample the parameters of macer the total iteration is set as 50 000 the corresponding results are shown in figs 10 15 where it is seen the markov chains converge to stable stages for all discussed parameters the parameters q a and d are rather stable while the parameters b and c walk in a wide range besides the error functions are found to be limited in a small range which is below 0 25 it indicates that the proposed am approach works well in sampling the parameters for the macer function in eq 23 the posterior statistics of ε 3 and its 95 confidence interval parameters are then concluded in tables 6 8 and the first 20 000 iterations are used for burn in it is seen that the uncertainties of q a and d are low all of these parameters are very stable while the b and c vary much more dramatically compared with the other three parameters it implies that the exceedance probability is more sensitive to the q a and d than b and c the estimated ε 3 by macer method are then compared with the corresponding empirical ones and the results are shown in fig 16 where good agreements between fitted curves and empirical curves are seen in other words the macer approach performs well in estimating the exceedance probability of 1 mooring tension the extreme mooring tension can be obtained by invoking the target exceedance probability to eq 23 and the 95 confidence interval of each estimated value is predicted according to eq 51 51 c i q q τ s q r where τ t 1 1 0 95 2 r 1 is the corresponding quantile of the student s t distribution with r 1 degrees of freedom the results are concluded in table 9 where it is seen the predicted 3 h extreme 1 mooring tension is 3543 kn and is extremely close to the benchmark value it implies that the macer is a competitive method for extreme mooring tension analysis which provides an accurate estimation of the extreme mooring tension by taking the uncertainties of calculating of ε ˆ 3 η and macer parameters fitting into consideration the 95 confidence interval can then be determined as 3512 kn 3575 kn 2 9 point absorber according to be the previous case it is seen that the uncertainties of the extreme value of the acer method is estimated by repeating the simulations or model tests however in most cases the experimental test will not be repeated due to the economic costs in other words the confidence interval of extreme value is difficult to be predicted by the acer method in this section the irregular wave model tests were conducted to capture the dynamics of a point absorber slack mooring system based on the measured mooring tension time series both the acer and macer method are applied to study the extreme dynamic mooring tensions the uncertainties of the parameters of the macer model are evaluated by the am algorithm 2 10 experimental set up a series of 1 100 scale model tests were carried out in the wave basin of the laboratory of the hydraulics of the university of porto to study the dynamics of a point absorber the wave basin is 28m long 12m wide and the maximum depth is 1 2m while the water depth was set as 0 8m in our tests a multidirectional multi directional wavemaker capable of generating regular and irregular waves in any direction is equipped only the head sea condition was considered during the model tests a cylinder buoy was acted as the point absorber and numerous circular rubber segments were put inside the buoy used as ballast the main parameters of buoy are listed in table 10 where d is buoy diameter h is height z g is the coordinate of the buoy gravity centre which is referenced to the bottom in fig 17 it is seen three moorings which were arranged with relative azimuth angles of 120 to keep the buoy on station the mooring line was composed of two segments bottom chain and top polyester the coordinates of fairleads are given in table 11 the length of chain and polyester is 0 7m and 1m the main parameters are shown in table 12 where wa and ws are the mass in air and submerged mass respectively the mooring radius was determined as 1 4m the qualisys optical motion tracking system with three cameras was used the measure six dof buoy motions and a load sensor was installed on the top of 1 mooring line to measure the mooring tension time series in this work only the mooring tension is studied the buoy motion responses were discussed xu et al 2018c the experimental set up is shown in fig 18 the irregular wave was modelled by jonswap spectrum the significant wave height and peak period were 0 107m and 1 16s respectively while the peak enhancement factor was 4 the generated wave in the wave basin needs to be calibrated before conducting irregular wave model tests the result is displayed in fig 19 it is seen the generated wave matches well with the target one which certificates that the wavemaker works well and qualified for the model tests 2 11 extreme dynamic mooring tension analysis the duration of the irregular wave model test was 1200s which equals 12000s in full scale since in ocean engineering 3 h is enough to represent a short term sea state the extreme value in 3 h is considered as the short term extreme value in the following study the mooring tension time series are sampled with 1130s durations while the first 50 s transient results are neglected the 1 mooring is the most loaded one in head sea condition and is chosen as the study object the 1 mooring tension time series are shown in fig 20 where it is seen that the maximum tension closes to 90n and most loads are snap loads the dynamic tension is defined as the range between peak tension and trough tension dnvgl 2015 52 t d j t max j t min j j 1 r where t max is the peak tension which is defined as the maximum tension between two mean up crossings t min is the trough tension which is defined as the minimum tension between two mean low crossings r is the total number of dynamic tension in the concerned duration 1080s in fig 21 the empirical acer ε k η is plotted versus the mooring tensions the effect of degree of conditioning on acer is clear the threshold value is determined according to eq 49 the figure reveals that k has a significant influence on acer when the mooring tensions are below 60n however the acer value is not sensitive to k value in the tail data it is seen the acer functions all converge in the tail data it indicates that the k 1 is a good choice in this study since it makes much more observations for extreme value analysis and the uncertainty is reduced accordingly once the k value is determined the acer parameters are determined by applying levenberg marquardt algorithm the fitted acer is then compared with the empirical one the result is given in fig 22 it is seen the fitted acer is in good agreement with the empirical one which demonstrates that the parameters are well fitted by invoking eq 47 to eq 20 the 3 h extreme dynamic mooring tension can be obtained the result is marked in fig 22 it is observed that the estimated extreme value is very close to the measured maximum value 86 23 n which validates the accuracy of the acer method in the application of snap load event however the confidence interval is not able to be estimated since the test was conducted once m 1 the am procedure is identical to section 3 fig 23 shows the results of estimated parameters and error function are calculated correspondingly it is seen a b and c are easier to be stable than q and d however all the parameters are varied in the small range no abrupt results are found to reveal the statistical properties of each parameter fig 24 gives the empirical probability densities of each macer parameter it is seen that the markov chains have converged well all the parameters are concentrated in limited range and the error function oscillates around 11 9 the posterior statistics of macer parameters are then shown in table 13 and the first 20 000 iterations are used for burn in where it is seen uncertainties of all parameters are low once the parameters are sampled the ε η can be estimated by inputting the mean values of each parameter to eq 23 in fig 25 the acer curve fitted by bayesian inference is compared with the empirical one where it is seen these two curves are in good agreement it indicates that the mcmc approach works well in parameters estimations besides it is observed that the confidence interval is narrow due to low uncertainties the estimated 3 h return values estimated by acer and macer method are listed in table 14 where it is found that the results are close to the measured maximum dynamic mooring tension and the uncertainty of estimated extreme value by macer method is low this implies that both the acer and macer method shows good performance in estimating extreme mooring tension for the case of snap loads 3 conclusions the current work studies the extreme mooring tension problem based on numerical and experimental results two typical cases are studied one case is the taut mooring line of a deepwater semi submersible and the mooring tensions are quite stable the other case is the slack mooring line for a point absorber which is found that the mooring tensions vary dramatically and snap loads frequently occur the acer method with the parameters solved by levenberg marquardt algorithm and macer method combined with bayesian inference theory are applied to study the short term extreme mooring tension of these two cases the numerical simulation and the experimental measurements are used to determine the short term extreme loads both the acer and macer methods give accurate predictions of the extreme mooring tension of the taut mooring of a semisubmersible but the acer method only considers uncertainties of extreme mooring tension due to random wave elevations in addition to random wave elevations the influence of uncertain model parameters on extreme mooring tension is also accounted for by the macer method for the case of the shallow water slack mooring line of a point absorber both the acer and macer methods provide precise estimations of the short term extreme dynamic mooring tension despite the influence of snap loads however the acer method is not able to consider the uncertainties of the estimated extreme value since there is only one tested time series overall the comparisons validate both the acer and macer methods as ideal tools for extreme mooring tension analysis as both present accurate estimations of short term extreme mooring tension despite the complexity of mooring tension variations the acer method is computationally more efficient than the macer method since the mcmc is needed to sample data for the macer function however acer can only handle the uncertainties of calculating empirical εk while the macer method can take both the uncertainties of εk and parameters fitting into consideration credit authorship contribution statement

established drag coefficient models show higher accuracy than the traditional drag coefficient models namely g j model vt model and mit model by comparing with the towing tank tests of suboff model the present research provides an important reference for realizing the rapid and efficient design of uvs with the same hydrodynamic shapes keywords underwater vehicles rapid design hull shape genealogy drag coefficient model drag coefficient map 1 introduction the diversification of ocean tasks the large scale of demands and the trend of ocean exploration towards deeper and further sea areas pose important challenges to the design of underwater vehicles uvs including diversified functions and rapid design the genealogical design of hull shapes for uvs is one of the key steps to deal with these challenges as an important part of the uvs the hull shape will directly affect the hydrodynamic performance and further affect the cruising range endurance maneuverability and stability of the uvs many studies have been done on this and some useful universal conclusions have been achieved to guide the hull shape design of the uvs focused on the streamlined axisymmetric shape without parallel midbody gertler and hagen 1967 studied influences of the length to diameter ratio ldr prismatic coefficient head diameter tail diameter and distance between the nose and the maximum cross section on the drag and concluded that the optimal ldr should be 5 8 and the optimal prismatic coefficient 0 61 sherman et al 2001 concluded that the slender hull has lower drag under low reynolds numbers and the laminar flow shaped hull has more advantages in terms of drag under high reynolds numbers with the critical point of reynolds number for so called the drag crisis being about 6 105 hu et al 2005 deemed that a slender shape with ellipse head and tail has lower drag than the one with hemispherical head and tail does and has more uniform pressure distribution bai 2007 studied the drag of the slender shapes with hemispherical head and tail ellipsoid head and tail and myring shape and concluded that the myring shape has the lowest drag song 2011 studied the influence of ldr on drag of the slender hull and obtained two optimal ranges 5 5 6 75 and 9 12 of drag coefficient huang 2013 analyzed the motion stability of uvs with three different cross sections of round ellipse and rectangle ignacio et al 2019 improved the drag performance of a variant of torpedo shaped uv using cfd with computer aided geometric definition cagd method and an empirical estimation method for the

vasudev et al 2018 used genetic algorithm and cfd simulation method to optimize teardrop shaped hull and the propeller under specific geometric parameter constraints to achieve the minimum propulsion power liu et al 2018 used the power flow i e energy flow indicating the magnitude and direction of the energy or power of any location in a structure hambric 1990 method to optimize the hull shape of an uv through the propagation characteristics of vibration power flow excited by the propeller of the uv chen et al 2018 introduced the multidisciplinary design optimization mdo method to optimize the hydrodynamic shape of an uv with the purpose of minimizing the energy consumption zhang et al 2019 also used the mdo method to design a small uv s hull shape with elliptic nose and parabolic tail mirzaeia and taghvaeib mirzaei and taghvaei 2019 conducted the configuration optimization of a supercavitating uv to achieve the optimal cavitator diameter speed and the ventilation rate using the augmented lagrangian pattern search alps algorithm to sum up in terms of design of uvs a preliminary hull shape is firstly chosen according to the task requirements and then it is modified through tank tests or field trials finally the drag of uvs is obtained this process is inevitably time consuming labor intensive and costly the emergence of various optimal design methods has greatly shortened the development cycle of uvs however the current researches mostly carried out specific shape optimization for a specific hull shape which is not universal and can hardly meet the requirements of functional diversity and rapid design of uvs so in order to realize quick design of the uv s hull shape for different task requirements the paper will survey the relationship between the uv s hull shape and its hydrodynamic characteristics and form drag coefficient maps of the hull shape genealogy rest of the paper is divided into four parts section 2 reviews the hull shapes currently applied to uvs and establishes the genealogical tree of hull shapes of uvs in section 3 the drag coefficient model of the hull shape genealogy for uvs are presented and then verified in section 4 section 5 shows the conclusions of the present work 2 genealogy of hull shape for uvs the hull shapes currently applied to uvs are mainly spherical spheroidal shape slender axisymmetric shape including teardrop shape myring shape conical tail shape and spindle shape round dish shape and slender flat shape gertler and hagen 1967 hambric 1990 sherman et al 2001 hu et al 2005 lin 2008 mcphail 2009 pelland et al 2017 liu et al 2017a vasudev et al 2018 liu et al 2018 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 mirzaei and taghvaei 2019 table 1 lists the various hull shapes of uvs currently in use and their hydrodynamic characteristics according to the characteristics of cross section and their hydrodynamic performance hull shapes of uvs can be divided into axisymmetric shape and flat shape the axisymmetric shape has a circular cross section and the flat shape shows an elliptic or ellipse like cross section with a greater characteristic dimension in the width direction than in the height direction then according to the shape of the longitudinal section the axisymmetric shape can be subdivided into spherical spheroidal shape 1 l d 2 and slender axisymmetric shape l d 2 here l and d refer to the length and maximum diameter of the vehicle the flat shape is subdivided into round dish shape l w 1 and slender flat shape l w 1 here w is the width of the vehicle the slender axisymmetric shape has a cylindrical body with head and tail tapering of various degrees of fineness according to the profile equation of head and tail the slender axisymmetric shape can further be subdivided into teardrop shape myring shape conical tail shape spindle shape etc fig 1 shows the genealogical tree of hull shapes for uvs 3 drag coefficient model of hull shape genealogy 3 1 method of obtaining the drag coefficient computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used to obtain the drag coefficient the drag calculated by cfd was converted into volumetric drag coefficient c dv which is regarded as consisting of volumetric pressure drag coefficient c pv and volumetric friction drag coefficient c fv therefore the formula of volumetric drag coefficient c dv can be 1 c d v c p v c f v d p v 1 2 ρ v 2 2 3 d f v 1 2 ρ v 2 2 3 where ρ the fluid density v the cruising speed the displacement of the vehicle d pv the pressure drag and d fv the friction drag the cfd simulation models was established by using a commercial code of ansys 16 0 in which ansys icem is for the calculation domain meshing and ansys fluent is for the cfd calculation take the spheroidal shape for example as shown in fig 2 the calculation domain of the cfd simulation is a cylinder which had a diameter 10 times that of the vehicle body the upstream boundary viz the velocity inlet was set as 3l away from the leading end of the body while the downstream boundary viz the free outflow was 5l away from the trailing end of the body the other surfaces of the domain were symmetric boundary and the body surface was non slip wall for the sake of ensuring calculation accuracy the triangular prismatic grids were used to capture the characteristics of boundary layer flows in the area near the wall while the tetrahedral unstructured grids were used in the rest the height δ y of the first layer of grids from the wall was determined according to the formula y 0 172 δ y l re 0 9 schlichting 1966 where y 1 for the k k l ω transition model and y 45 for other turbulence models the standard wall function was adopted and the computational domain was discretized by the finite volume method according to the results of grid independence study table 2 the maximum gird size on the body surface was chosen to be 10 mm with grid quantities about 1 5 million to balance the calculation accuracy and calculation cost for the reynolds numbers concerned in this paper some cases are laminar flow in theory the laminar model should be used to solve the computational domain of those laminar flow cases however the complex 3 d flow around the spherical spheroidal body and the boundary layer separation made the calculation not convergence in our investigations therefore for the cases of laminar flow in theory the transition sst model with low re correction was used to close the n s equation for its higher accuracy in solving the separation flow and the low reynolds numbers flow and the k k l ω transition model for transition flow was used to those cases in transition reynolds number flow while for those with high reynolds numbers flow after the transition reynolds number the rsm reynolds stress model turbulence model with seven transport equations was selected for it accounting for the effects of streamline curvature swirl rotation and rapid changes in strain rate versteeg and malalasekera 2011 moreover studies showed that the rsm can give more accurate predictions for complex flows with high reynolds numbers song 2011 all the cases were assumed as steady flow for which the pressure velocity field was coupled by simple algorithm both convection and diffusion terms were discretized by a second order upwind difference scheme the convergence residual value was set as 10 5 3 2 drag coefficient model of the spherical spheroidal shape the main factors influencing the drag coefficient of the spherical spheroidal shapes are ldr l d and reynolds number re since uvs in engineering application are generally small and medium sized ones range of the re was determined to be from 6 0 104 to 107 in the present work fig 3 shows changes of drag coefficient of the spherical shape under different reynolds numbers re ρ v l μ where v the is velocity of the vehicle l is the total length ρ 1020 kg m 3 is the density of sea water and μ 1 003 10 4 pa s is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of sea water as can be seen from fig 3 the pressure drag coefficient drops sharply at the transition point with the reynolds number about re 4 105 which is meets the typical transition reynolds number obtained from experimental m white 2009 however it is obvious that the drag coefficients before re 2 5 105 are quite different from those from the classical experiments m white 2009 it shows that the present cfd model is hard to reproduce the flow state before the transition reynolds number re 2 5 105 but it has a perfect prediction at and after the transition region from fig 3 it also can be seen that the pressure drag coefficient is much larger than the friction drag coefficient which makes the total drag coefficient have the same variation trend with the pressure drag coefficient near the transition reynolds number re 4 105 namely 2 5 105 re 5 5 105 the drag coefficients fluctuates sharply and after that they decrease regularly with increasing the reynolds numbers it is just that the drop in friction drag coefficient is much more gradual and the pressure drag coefficient subjects to a quadratic functions due to the large fluctuation of the drag coefficients in the range of transition reynolds number the fitting calculation of this region was also not performed so only data after the transition region with re 5 5 105 was used to fit the drag coefficient model while the laminar flow with high reynolds numbers past the spherical spheroidal shape will be involved in the future work the common ldr of uvs with spherical spheroidal shape is between 1 and 2 fig 4 shows the drag coefficient of spherical spheroidal shape at different ldrs when the reynolds number is 6 105 from fig 4 the pressure drag coefficient fast decreases with the increase of ldr and the friction drag coefficient increases slightly with the increase of ldr the total drag coefficient also decreases with the increase of ldr quickly and subjects to the cubic function the total drag coefficient of the spheroidal shape with l d 1 5 is 49 77 smaller than the spherical one with l d 1 which confirms that the spheroidal shape has better drag reduction performance than the spherical one the obtained drag coefficients of the spherical spheroidal shape were plotted as a fitting surface shown in fig 5 with the fitting rate being larger than 0 99 by fitting data in fig 5 the drag coefficient model of the spherical spheroidal shape with re 6 105 107 and 1 l d 2 can be given as 2 c dvs 3 103 0 5288 lg re 2 853 l d 0 02824 lg re 2 0 324 lg re l d 0 9898 l d 2 0 01181 lg re 2 l d 0 04963 lg re l d 2 0 1217 l d 3 where the subscript s represents the drag coefficient related to the spherical spheroidal shape for the convenience of reference the drag coefficient map with different ldrs was drawn according to eq 2 as shown in fig 6 3 3 drag coefficient model of the teardrop shape the teardrop shape is the most widely used shape of uvs with low drag its profile parametric equation is 3 r x r max 1 l n x l n n n 1 n n 0 x l n r max l n x l n l m r max 1 x l n l m l t n t l n l m x l where l n is the head length l t the tail length and l m the midbody length the specific profile of teardrop shape is actually determined by the head shape factor n n and the tail shape factor n t when n n n t 1 the shapes of head and tail are both conical when n n 2 the head shape is an ellipse with the increase of n n and n t the head and tail profiles become more and more blunt as n n and n t approach infinity the head and tail profiles approach rectangle so for the teardrop shape the n n and n t are generally less than 2 to ensure a better streamline according to the structure characteristics of teardrop shape the main factors influencing the drag coefficient are the head shape factor n n tail shape factor n t ldrs l d l n d l t d and reynolds number re studies by liu et al 2017b showed that the drag coefficients change slightly with the increase of the shape indexes n n and n t especially when n n and n t is less than 2 the drag coefficients basically remain unchanged so in the paper the effects of n n and n t on drag coefficient were ignored only the influence of the parameters of ldrs and re on the drag coefficients of the teardrop shape were discussed fig 7 illustrates the drag coefficients of teardrop shape with l d and re from fig 7 a the pressure drag coefficient c pv decreases while increasing the l d with a rational function while the friction drag coefficient c fv increases linearly with increasing the l d from fig 7 b the c pv decreases with increasing the lgre as a quadratic function and the c fv decrease with increasing the lgre as a rational function in order to obtain the relationship between the drag coefficient with ldrs and re the drag coefficients of the teardrop shapes under different ldrs and re were calculated ldrs of the uvs are generally in the range of from 4 to 12 with l n d between 0 75 and 2 and l t d between 1 and 2 25 length of the auvs autonomous underwater vehicles is usually between 1 5 m and 10 m and the cruising velocity is between 4 knots and 20 knots length of the ugs underwater gliders is between 1 5 m and 3 m and the gliding velocity is between 0 5 knots and 1 5 knots so range of the reynolds number in the present work is chosen as 4 105 re 108 with the density of sea water being 1020 kg m3 and the dynamic viscosity being 1 003 10 3 pa s2 table 3 shows the value range of each parameter determined in the present work from fig 7 the relationships between c pv and c fv with ldr and re can be fitted as the following expressions 4 c p v r l d s 5 c f v k l d b 6 c p v p 1 lg re 2 p 2 lg re p 3 7 c f v q 1 lg re q 2 where r s k b p 1 p 2 p 3 q 1 and q 2 are factors related with ldr since the coupling relationship between the l d and the l n d and l t d the coefficients r s k and b are related to the l n d and l t d the coefficients p 1 p 2 p 3 q 1 and q 2 are determined by l d l n d and l t d since the coupling between l n d l t d and re is very weak the influences of the l n d and l t d on p 1 p 2 p 3 q 1 and q 2 are ignored in the present work values of r s k and b under different l n d and l t d were calculated respectively with re 1 525 106 the fitting results were obtained as follows 8a r n 0 02072 l n d 1 218 0 06382 8b s n 0 9165 l n d 1 977 8c r t 0 05431 l t d 3 428 0 0712

the parameters associated with the head and tail respectively substitute eqs 8 and 9 into eqs 4 and 5 respectively to obtain the mathematical expressions of the pressure drag coefficient c pv and friction drag coefficient c fv with the l d l n d and l t d they are 10 c p v 0 02072 l n d 1 218 0 05431 l t d 3 428 0 05864 l d 0 0 9165 l n d 1 258 l t d 0 9354 11 c f v 0 0 2297 l n d 0 0 6834 l t d 1 11129 l d 0 2251 l n d 0 4971 l t d 23 757 10 3 the coefficients p 1 p 2 p 3 q 1 and q 2 were fitted based on the calculation results under l d from 4 to 12 with increment of 1 when l n d 1 5 and l t d 2 it gives 12a p 1 0 003496 l d 3 354 12b p 2 0 0 5629 l d 3 339 12c p 3 0 2907 l d 3 62 13a q 1 0 002338 l d 0 05575 13b q 2 3 87 there is only a slight difference in the denominators in eq 12 for a particular l d so the mean value of l d 3 352 of the three denominators was used for the sake of simplifying the modeling process then substituting eqs 12 and 13 into eqs 6 and 7 respectively the mathematical expressions of the pressure drag coefficient c pv and friction drag coefficient c fv with re and l d can be described as 14 c p v 0 003496 l g r e 2 0 0 5629 lg re 0 2907 l d 3 352 15 c f v 0 002338 l d 0 05575 lg re 3 87 it is easy to see that eqs 10 and 11 are the special cases of eqs 14 and 15 respectively when re is 1 525 106 l n d 1 5 and l t d 2 so the general form of the pressure drag coefficient c pv can be obtained by combining eqs 10 and 14 16 c pvt 20 72 l n d 1 218 54 31 l t d 3 428 3 496 lg r e 2 56 29 lg re 273 03 l d 0 9165 l n d 1 258 l t d 0 5394 10 3 similarly from eqs 11 and 15 the general form of the friction drag coefficient c fv can be 17 c fvt 0 053136 l n d 0 1581 l t d 2 5744 l d 5 2072 l n d 1 1499 l t d 54 59 lg re 3 87 10 3 where the subscript t represents the drag coefficient related to the teardrop shape taking lgre as the x coordinate the pressure drag coefficient maps under different ldrs of head and tail were drawn and shown in fig 8 since the ldrs of head and tail have little influence on the friction drag coefficient map of the drag coefficient can be obtained through defining specific ldrs of head and tail in this paper the head ldr l n d 1 5 and tail ldr l t d 2 were taken as the example to map the friction drag coefficient as shown in fig 9 3 4 drag coefficient models of other slender axisymmetric shapes in order to achieve more simple and accurate calculation for the drag coefficient of other slender axisymmetric shapes the drag coefficient models of myring shape conical tail shape spindle shape and slender flat shape in the hull shape genealogy were also studied based on the drag coefficient model of the teardrop shape 3 4 1 drag coefficient model of myring shape the myring shape was proposed in 1976 myring 1976 and its profile parametric equation is 18 r x r max 1 x l n l n 2 1 n n 0 x l n r max l n x l n l m r max 3 r max l t 2 tan θ l t x l n l m 2 2 r max l t 3 tan θ l t 2 x l n l m 3 l n l m x l the myring shape bears the closest resemblance to the teardrop shape the former differs from the latter in the head shape factor n n and the tail angle θ which are the two main parameters influencing the profile of myring shape as n n and θ increase the head and tail become more and more blunt when n n 1 the head profile is a parabola and it is an ellipse when n n 2 therefore the two parameters of n n and θ were focused and their influence on the drag coefficient was studied the value ranges of the two parameters were limited to n n 1 3 and θ 25 in the present work because studies showed that the uvs show good hydrodynamic performance in such ranges when n n 2 heads of both myring shape and teardrop shape are ellipses with long axis length l n and short axis length d 2 the drag coefficients of myring shape with head shape factors of 1 1 5 2 5 and 3 were calculated respectively at l d 10 and θ 25 and compared with those of the teardrop shape at n n n t 2 the results were listed in table 4 similarly the drag coefficients of myring shape with different tail angles θ 5 10 15 20 and 25 were calculated at n n 2 and compared with those of the teardrop shape at n n n t 2 as shown in table 5 it can be seen from tables 4 and 5 that n n and θ mainly affect the pressure drag coefficient but barely influence the friction drag coefficient when 1 n n 2 and 10 θ 25 the differences between the total drag coefficients of myring shape and those of teardrop shape at n n n t 2 are within 1 therefore in this range the drag coefficient of myring shape can be calculated by the drag coefficient model of teardrop shape so do the drag coefficient maps therefore the drag coefficient model of myring shape can be written as 19 c dvm c dvt 1 n n 2 10 θ 25 where the subscript m represents the drag coefficient related to the myring shape it is natural that figs 8 and 9 can be used as the drag coefficient maps of myring shape 3 4 2 drag coefficient model of conical tail shape in practice the tail of an uv is often designed as a cone for ease of assembly the difference between conical tail shape and the teardrop shape is the tail angle therefore concerning the drag coefficient model of conical tail shape we only need to focus on the drag coefficients at different tail angles fig 10 shows the drag coefficients of the hull with a conical tail at different tail angles α from fig 10 the friction drag coefficient basically remains unchanged when α is between 3 and 14 the pressure drag coefficient decreases sharply with the increase of α when α is within 3 and 10 then gradually flattens out when α 10 since the friction drag coefficient is basically unchanged the total drag coefficient is consistent with the pressure drag coefficient under the same shape parameters of the head and midbody the drag coefficients of the conical tail shape with α 10 are almost equal to those of the teardrop shape with n t 2 it shows that the drag of conical tail shape with α 10 is only related to the displacement of uvs however when α 10 the drag coefficients of the conical tail shape are significantly different from those of the teardrop shape therefore it is necessary to adopt piecewise fitting for the drag coefficient model of the conical tail shape when α 10 the drag coefficient model of the teardrop shape can be adopted as shown in eqs 16 and 17 and so do the drag coefficient maps when α 10 the curve fitting of the total drag coefficient at different tail angles α was made to obtain the drag coefficient model of the conical tail shape it gives 20 c dvc 0 0003598 α 2 0 007218 α 0 07699 the subscript c represents the drag coefficient associated with the conical tail shape the correction coefficient k c is introduced based on α 10 which is given as 21 k c 0 008821 α 2 0 176955 α 1 887472 with the combination of eqs 16 17 20 and 21 the drag coefficient of the conical tail shape with α 10 can be the drag coefficient of the teardrop shape with the same shape parameter multiplied by the correction coefficient k c in summary the drag coefficient model of the conical tail shape is 22 c dvc c dvt α 10 k c c dvt α 10 3 4 3 drag coefficient model of the spindle shape the spindle shape which is also known as the low drag laminar flow shape was proposed by huggins and packwood in 1994 huggins and packwood 1995 the profile equations of the spindle shape are as follows the head profile is 23a r l 2 f n r n f 1 x k 1 f 2 x g x 1 2 where x x l n f 1 x 2x x 1 3 f 2 x x 2 x 1 2 and g x x 2 3x 2 8x 6 the midbody profile is 23b r l 2 f n r i 1 r i k 1 m f 1 x s i f 2 x g x where x l m x l m l n f 1 x 1 2x 3 x 1 2 f 2 x x x 3 3x 2 8x 6 g x x 3 6x 2 15x 10 k 1m l m l n 1 2 k 1 1 r i the tail profile is 23c r l r t 2 f n 1 t r i 1 f 1 x s i a f 2 x where x l x l l m f 1 x 1 x 3 6x 2 15x 10 f 2 x x 3 3x 2 7x 4 and s ia 1 r i 1 x i s i x i x m r i in eqs 23a 23b and 23c f n x r i r n x i s i and s ia are all intermediate variables while f 1 x f 2 x and g x are all intermediate variables about x x is the value of x coordinate l n the length of head and l m the length of midbody each parameter of spindle shape has its value range such as r n 0 k 1 0 x m x i f n 2 5 0 t r i 1 and s i 0 meanwhile each parameter has its specific recommended value as shown in table 6 that is to say the profile parameters of the spindle shape are generally fixed therefore it can be considered that the drag coefficient of the spindle shape is only related to the reynolds number fig 11 shows the changes of drag coefficients of the spindle shape with l 3 m and d 600 mm under different reynolds numbers represented by the black curves with red logos and the symbols with subscript of sp from fig 11 both pressure and friction drag coefficients decrease with the increase of reynolds number because of the small proportion of the pressure drag coefficient in the total drag coefficient its variation trend has little effect on that of the total drag coefficient the drag coefficient model of the spindle shape was obtained by fitting the data shown in fig 11 it gives 24 c dvsp 0 004088 l g r e 2 0 06593 lgre 0 2922 where the subscript sp represents the drag coefficient related to the spindle shape fig 11 also shows the drag coefficients of the teardrop shape with the same ldr of 5 as the spindle shape represented by the blue curves with yellow logos and the symbols with subscript t it is obvious that the drag coefficients of both spindle shape and teardrop shape have the same variation trend with the increase of re however the drag coefficients of the spindle shape are always higher than the counterparts of the teardrop shape 3 5 drag coefficient model of the slender flat shape the flat shape has a larger width to height ratio whr than the axisymmetric shape does in order to obtain the drag coefficient model of the flat shape the body with elliptic section was taken as the example to investigate influences of the whr and ldr on the drag coefficient the all factor test was conducted by choosing the whrs from 1 to 4 with the growth rate of 0 25 and the ldr from 4 to 12 with the growth rate of 1 fig 12 a and b show the fitting surfaces of pressure and friction drag coefficients with whr and ldr respectively the black dots in fig 12 indicate results of c pv and c fv obtained from cfd calculations at different whr and ldr as shown in fig 12 a the pressure drag coefficient decreases with the increase of l d and increases gradually with the increase of w h from fig 12 b the friction drag coefficient increases linearly with the increase of both l d and w h by fitting the data in fig 12 the relationship among pressure drag coefficient l d and w h can be expressed as 25 c pvf 0 006 0 7 w h 0 07026 l d 3 351 where the subscript f represents the drag coefficient related to the slender flat shape the relationship among the friction drag coefficient l d and w h is 26 c fvf 0 0010499 l d 0 003874 w h 0 01727 comparing the pressure drag coefficient model of teardrop shape i e eq 16 and that of the slender flat shape i e eq 25 it shows that eqs 16 and 25 have the same form when the l n d l t d and re in eq 16 have a certain value on this basis eq 16 is a special case of eq 25 when w h 1 therefore eq 16 and eq 25 can be superimposed to obtain the pressure drag coefficient model of the slender flat shape it gives 27 c pvf 20 72 l n d 1 218 54 31 l t d 3 428 3 496 lg r e 2 56 29 lg re 6 0 7 w h 266 96 l d 0 9165 l n d 1 258 l t d 0 5394 10 3 similarly the friction drag coefficient model of the slender flat shape can be obtained based on eqs 17 and 26 it is 28 c fvf 0 0 5136 l n d 0 1581 l t d 2 665 l d 5 2072 l n d 1 15 l t d 8 9616 w h 45 46 lg re 3 87 10 3 for the convenient reference to the drag coefficient maps of the pressure drag coefficient and the friction drag coefficient of the slender flat shape were drawn according to eqs 27 and 28 under the conditions of l n d 1 5 and l t d 2 respectively as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 4 validation of the drag coefficient models 4 1 validation by cfd simulation for spherical spheroidal shape teardrop shape and slender flat shape five sets of shape data exclusive of the shape data used previously for the drag coefficient models which were listed in tables 7 9 respectively were taken to calculate the drag coefficients of the three shapes by cfd simulations and the established drag coefficient models respectively tables 7 9 also show the relative differences between the drag coefficients of the three shapes from the established drag coefficient models and the cfd simulations respectively it can be seen from table 7 that the relative differences between the calculated values from the drag coefficient model viz eq 2 and the cfd simulations are within 11 from tables 8 and 9 the relative differences between the drag coefficients obtained from the drag coefficient models viz eqs 16 and 17 for the teardrop shapes eqs 27 and 28 for the slender flat shapes and those from the cfd simulations remains within 6 it shows that the drag coefficient models established in this paper provide a good estimation for the drag of uvs calculated by the present cfd simulation 4 2 validation by towing tank tests of petrel l ug the petrel l is an underwater glider developed by tianjin university china its hull shape follows myring shape with the total length of 2 6 m the maximum diameter of 0 24 m both of the head and tail length being 0 45 m midbody length being 1 7 m the head shape factor n n being 2 and the tail angle θ being 9 76 yang 2021 the displacement is 0 394 m3 and the wetted surface area is 3 5565 m2 from the towing tank tests the drag coefficient based on the front area of petrel l hull model was 0 423 based on eqs 16 and 17 the volumetric drag coefficient of petrel l hull model was calculated to be 0 0378 which was converted to the drag coefficient based on the front area being 0 449 the relative error between the drag coefficient from the drag coefficient models established in the paper and from the towing tank tests is 6 14 4 3 validation by towing tank tests of suboff model the suboff model groves et al 1989 which was proposed by defense advanced research projects agency darpa was used to verify the accuracy of the drag coefficient models established in this paper the hull of suboff model is almost like a teardrop shape with the total length of 4 356 m head length of 1 016 m midbody length of 2 229 m tail length of 1 111 m and maximum diameter of 0 508 m groves et al 1989 huang et al 1992 the prismatic coefficient c p of suboff model is 0 789 the displacement is 0 699 m3 and the wetted surface area is 5 989 m2 huang et al 1992 the pressure drag coefficients and friction drag coefficients were calculated by introducing the shape dimensions of the suboff model into the drag coefficient models shown as eqs 16 and 17 then according to the drag formula d 1 2 ρ v 2 c d v 2 3 1 2 ρ v 2 c p v c f v 2 3 the total drags of suboff model were calculated and compared with those from towing tank tests of suboff model as shown in table 10 it is shown that the total drags obtained from the drag coefficient models established in this paper are larger than those from the towing tank tests but the relative errors between them are within 10 which is much lower than the error requirement of 20 in engineering application 4 4 comparison with the existing empirical formulas at present drag coefficient of uvs is generally estimated according the formula recommended by ittc international towing tank conference it is 29a c v s 1 k c f s 29b c f s 0 075 l o g 10 r e 2 2 where c v s and c f s are the viscous pressure drag coefficient and friction drag coefficient based on wetted surface area respectively and k is the form factor in general there are three ways to obtain k namely g j method gillmer and johnson 1982 vt method brown 2007 martz 2008 and mit method jackson 1992 in g j method the scaling factor k involves the influence of the ratio of the maximum diameter and characteristic length of the hull on the pressure drag it is expressed as gillmer and johnson 1982 30 k gj 0 5 d l 3 d l 3 on the basis of g j method vt method introduces the influence of the head shape parameter n n and the tail shape parameter n t on the pressure drag it has brown 2007 martz 2008 31 k vt 0 5 d l 3 d l 7 n n n t 2 in mit method the scaling factor k is described as a function of the diameter characteristic length and prismatic coefficient it gives jackson 1992 32 k mit 1 5 d l 3 2 7 d l 3 0 002 c p 0 6 where c p is the prismatic coefficient c p 4 π d 2 l and is the displacement of the vehicle in the present work the drag coefficients of suboff model were calculated by the empirical formulas i e eqs 29 32 and compared with those of the towing tank tests of suboff model as listed in table 11 in table 11 c d s denotes the total drag coefficient based on wetted surface area c d v is the total volumetric drag coefficient obtained indirectly from c d s data of c dv t was obtained by using d t in table 10 it can be seen that the relative errors between the drag coefficients obtained from the empirical formulas i e g j method vt method and mit and those from the towing tank tests of suboff model are larger than 75 which far exceeds those see table 10 of the drag coefficient models established in this paper it shows that the empirical formulas for drag coefficient based on ship hulls are not suitable for the streamlined hull of the immersed bodies 5 summary and future work 1 genealogy classification theory was introduced to classify hydrodynamic shapes of uvs the hull shape genealogy of uvs was proposed and established based on the analysis of hull shape characteristics of uvs the genealogy can provide a programmatic guidance for establishing the mathematical model of the drag coefficients and shape parameters of uvs 2 focused on the spherical sphroidal shape teardrop shape myring shape conical tail shape spindle shape and slender flat shape in the hull shape genealogy of uvs this paper established the mathematical models of drag coefficients shape parameters and reynolds number through investigating the variation law of drag coefficients with shape parameters and reynolds numbers the established models were verified by cfd simulations with the relative differences being no more than 11 and by the towing tank tests of petrel l model developed by tianjin university and suboff model with the relative errors being less than 10 the drag coefficient models of the spherical spheroidal shape teardrop shape myring shape conical tail shape spindle shape and slender flat shape established in the paper can provide a quick reference for the drag coefficients of uvs in engineering 3 for the spherical spheroidal shapes it is found that there are big errors between the drag coefficients obtained from cfd simulations and from the classical experiment tests before the transition reynolds number moreover the laminar model also cannot obtain the convergent results in high laminar reynolds numbers in the future modeling the laminar flow with high reynolds numbers and its flow mechanism such as 1000 re 2 5 104 past the spherical spheroidal shapes will be involved in our work credit authorship contribution statement

20358,the increasingly diverse mission requirements result in challenges to the rapid design and functional diversification of underwater vehicles uvs the genealogical design of uvs shape is one of the key steps to deal with these challenges in the present work based on the hydrodynamic characteristics with different shape features of uvs the hull shape genealogy including the spherical spheroidal shape slender axisymmetric shape slender flat shape and round dish shape was established according to the genealogy classification theory influence of the hull shape parameters and reynolds

established drag coefficient models show higher accuracy than the traditional drag coefficient models namely g j model vt model and mit model by comparing with the towing tank tests of suboff model the present research provides an important reference for realizing the rapid and efficient design of uvs with the same hydrodynamic shapes keywords underwater vehicles rapid design hull shape genealogy drag coefficient model drag coefficient map 1 introduction the diversification of ocean tasks the large scale of demands and the trend of ocean exploration towards deeper and further sea areas pose important challenges to the design of underwater vehicles uvs including diversified functions and rapid design the genealogical design of hull shapes for uvs is one of the key steps to deal with these challenges as an important part of the uvs the hull shape will directly affect the hydrodynamic performance and further affect the cruising range endurance maneuverability and stability of the uvs many studies have been done on this and some useful universal conclusions have been achieved to guide the hull shape design of the uvs focused on the streamlined axisymmetric shape without parallel midbody gertler and hagen 1967 studied influences of the length to diameter ratio ldr prismatic coefficient head diameter tail diameter and distance between the nose and the maximum cross section on the drag and concluded that the optimal ldr should be 5 8 and the optimal prismatic coefficient 0 61 sherman et al 2001 concluded that the slender hull has lower drag under low reynolds numbers and the laminar flow shaped hull has more advantages in terms of drag under high reynolds numbers with the critical point of reynolds number for so called the drag crisis being about 6 105 hu et al 2005 deemed that a slender shape with ellipse head and tail has lower drag than the one with hemispherical head and tail does and has more uniform pressure distribution bai 2007 studied the drag of the slender shapes with hemispherical head and tail ellipsoid head and tail and myring shape and concluded that the myring shape has the lowest drag song 2011 studied the influence of ldr on drag of the slender hull and obtained two optimal ranges 5 5 6 75 and 9 12 of drag coefficient huang 2013 analyzed the motion stability of uvs with three different cross sections of round ellipse and rectangle ignacio et al 2019 improved the drag performance of a variant of torpedo shaped uv using cfd with computer aided geometric definition cagd method and an empirical estimation method for the drag of uvs with the development of research various optimization design methods have been applied to the hull shape design of uvs alam et al 2014 proposed a non dominant genetic algorithm to optimize a torpedo shaped hull for the minimization of the drag nouri et al 2016 obtained the optimal uv hull shape through optimizing the pressure distribution for the minimum drag based on artificial neural network algorithm gao et al 2016 used a simulation platform composed of several commercial software packages to optimize the myring shape with a reynolds number of 3 6 105 4 2 106 for the least drag vasudev et al 2018 used genetic algorithm and cfd simulation method to optimize teardrop shaped hull and the propeller under specific geometric parameter constraints to achieve the minimum propulsion power liu et al 2018 used the power flow i e energy flow indicating the magnitude and direction of the energy or power of any location in a structure hambric 1990 method to optimize the hull shape of an uv through the propagation characteristics of vibration power flow excited by the propeller of the uv chen et al 2018 introduced the multidisciplinary design optimization mdo method to optimize the hydrodynamic shape of an uv with the purpose of minimizing the energy consumption zhang et al 2019 also used the mdo method to design a small uv s hull shape with elliptic nose and parabolic tail mirzaeia and taghvaeib mirzaei and taghvaei 2019 conducted the configuration optimization of a supercavitating uv to achieve the optimal cavitator diameter speed and the ventilation rate using the augmented lagrangian pattern search alps algorithm to sum up in terms of design of uvs a preliminary hull shape is firstly chosen according to the task requirements and then it is modified through tank tests or field trials finally the drag of uvs is obtained this process is inevitably time consuming labor intensive and costly the emergence of various optimal design methods has greatly shortened the development cycle of uvs however the current researches mostly carried out specific shape optimization for a specific hull shape which is not universal and can hardly meet the requirements of functional diversity and rapid design of uvs so in order to realize quick design of the uv s hull shape for different task requirements the paper will survey the relationship between the uv s hull shape and its hydrodynamic characteristics and form drag coefficient maps of the hull shape genealogy rest of the paper is divided into four parts section 2 reviews the hull shapes currently applied to uvs and establishes the genealogical tree of hull shapes of uvs in section 3 the drag coefficient model of the hull shape genealogy for uvs are presented and then verified in section 4 section 5 shows the conclusions of the present work 2 genealogy of hull shape for uvs the hull shapes currently applied to uvs are mainly spherical spheroidal shape slender axisymmetric shape including teardrop shape myring shape conical tail shape and spindle shape round dish shape and slender flat shape gertler and hagen 1967 hambric 1990 sherman et al 2001 hu et al 2005 lin 2008 mcphail 2009 pelland et al 2017 liu et al 2017a vasudev et al 2018 liu et al 2018 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 mirzaei and taghvaei 2019 table 1 lists the various hull shapes of uvs currently in use and their hydrodynamic characteristics according to the characteristics of cross section and their hydrodynamic performance hull shapes of uvs can be divided into axisymmetric shape and flat shape the axisymmetric shape has a circular cross section and the flat shape shows an elliptic or ellipse like cross section with a greater characteristic dimension in the width direction than in the height direction then according to the shape of the longitudinal section the axisymmetric shape can be subdivided into spherical spheroidal shape 1 l d 2 and slender axisymmetric shape l d 2 here l and d refer to the length and maximum diameter of the vehicle the flat shape is subdivided into round dish shape l w 1 and slender flat shape l w 1 here w is the width of the vehicle the slender axisymmetric shape has a cylindrical body with head and tail tapering of various degrees of fineness according to the profile equation of head and tail the slender axisymmetric shape can further be subdivided into teardrop shape myring shape conical tail shape spindle shape etc fig 1 shows the genealogical tree of hull shapes for uvs 3 drag coefficient model of hull shape genealogy 3 1 method of obtaining the drag coefficient computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation was used to obtain the drag coefficient the drag calculated by cfd was converted into volumetric drag coefficient c dv which is regarded as consisting of volumetric pressure drag coefficient c pv and volumetric friction drag coefficient c fv therefore the formula of volumetric drag coefficient c dv can be 1 c d v c p v c f v d p v 1 2 ρ v 2 2 3 d f v 1 2 ρ v 2 2 3 where ρ the fluid density v the cruising speed the displacement of the vehicle d pv the pressure drag and d fv the friction drag the cfd simulation models was established by using a commercial code of ansys 16 0 in which ansys icem is for the calculation domain meshing and ansys fluent is for the cfd calculation take the spheroidal shape for example as shown in fig 2 the calculation domain of the cfd simulation is a cylinder which had a diameter 10 times that of the vehicle body the upstream boundary viz the velocity inlet was set as 3l away from the leading end of the body while the downstream boundary viz the free outflow was 5l away from the trailing end of the body the other surfaces of the domain were symmetric boundary and the body surface was non slip wall for the sake of ensuring calculation accuracy the triangular prismatic grids were used to capture the characteristics of boundary layer flows in the area near the wall while the tetrahedral unstructured grids were used in the rest the height δ y of the first layer of grids from the wall was determined according to the formula y 0 172 δ y l re 0 9 schlichting 1966 where y 1 for the k k l ω transition model and y 45 for other turbulence models the standard wall function was adopted and the computational domain was discretized by the finite volume method according to the results of grid independence study table 2 the maximum gird size on the body surface was chosen to be 10 mm with grid quantities about 1 5 million to balance the calculation accuracy and calculation cost for the reynolds numbers concerned in this paper some cases are laminar flow in theory the laminar model should be used to solve the computational domain of those laminar flow cases however the complex 3 d flow around the spherical spheroidal body and the boundary layer separation made the calculation not convergence in our investigations therefore for the cases of laminar flow in theory the transition sst model with low re correction was used to close the n s equation for its higher accuracy in solving the separation flow and the low reynolds numbers flow and the k k l ω transition model for transition flow was used to those cases in transition reynolds number flow while for those with high reynolds numbers flow after the transition reynolds number the rsm reynolds stress model turbulence model with seven transport equations was selected for it accounting for the effects of streamline curvature swirl rotation and rapid changes in strain rate versteeg and malalasekera 2011 moreover studies showed that the rsm can give more accurate predictions for complex flows with high reynolds numbers song 2011 all the cases were assumed as steady flow for which the pressure velocity field was coupled by simple algorithm both convection and diffusion terms were discretized by a second order upwind difference scheme the convergence residual value was set as 10 5 3 2 drag coefficient model of the spherical spheroidal shape the main factors influencing the drag coefficient of the spherical spheroidal shapes are ldr l d and reynolds number re since uvs in engineering application are generally small and medium sized ones range of the re was determined to be from 6 0 104 to 107 in the present work fig 3 shows changes of drag coefficient of the spherical shape under different reynolds numbers re ρ v l μ where v the is velocity of the vehicle l is the total length ρ 1020 kg m 3 is the density of sea water and μ 1 003 10 4 pa s is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of sea water as can be seen from fig 3 the pressure drag coefficient drops sharply at the transition point with the reynolds number about re 4 105 which is meets the typical transition reynolds number obtained from experimental m white 2009 however it is obvious that the drag coefficients before re 2 5 105 are quite different from those from the classical experiments m white 2009 it shows that the present cfd model is hard to reproduce the flow state before the transition reynolds number re 2 5 105 but it has a perfect prediction at and after the transition region from fig 3 it also can be seen that the pressure drag coefficient is much larger than the friction drag coefficient which makes the total drag coefficient have the same variation trend with the pressure drag coefficient near the transition reynolds number re 4 105 namely 2 5 105 re 5 5 105 the drag coefficients fluctuates sharply and after that they decrease regularly with increasing the reynolds numbers it is just that the drop in friction drag coefficient is much more gradual and the pressure drag coefficient subjects to a quadratic functions due to the large fluctuation of the drag coefficients in the range of transition reynolds number the fitting calculation of this region was also not performed so only data after the transition region with re 5 5 105 was used to fit the drag coefficient model while the laminar flow with high reynolds numbers past the spherical spheroidal shape will be involved in the future work the common ldr of uvs with spherical spheroidal shape is between 1 and 2 fig 4 shows the drag coefficient of spherical spheroidal shape at different ldrs when the reynolds number is 6 105 from fig 4 the pressure drag coefficient fast decreases with the increase of ldr and the friction drag coefficient increases slightly with the increase of ldr the total drag coefficient also decreases with the increase of ldr quickly and subjects to the cubic function the total drag coefficient of the spheroidal shape with l d 1 5 is 49 77 smaller than the spherical one with l d 1 which confirms that the spheroidal shape has better drag reduction performance than the spherical one the obtained drag coefficients of the spherical spheroidal shape were plotted as a fitting surface shown in fig 5 with the fitting rate being larger than 0 99 by fitting data in fig 5 the drag coefficient model of the spherical spheroidal shape with re 6 105 107 and 1 l d 2 can be given as 2 c dvs 3 103 0 5288 lg re 2 853 l d 0 02824 lg re 2 0 324 lg re l d 0 9898 l d 2 0 01181 lg re 2 l d 0 04963 lg re l d 2 0 1217 l d 3 where the subscript s represents the drag coefficient related to the spherical spheroidal shape for the convenience of reference the drag coefficient map with different ldrs was drawn according to eq 2 as shown in fig 6 3 3 drag coefficient model of the teardrop shape the teardrop shape is the most widely used shape of uvs with low drag its profile parametric equation is 3 r x r max 1 l n x l n n n 1 n n 0 x l n r max l n x l n l m r max 1 x l n l m l t n t l n l m x l where l n is the head length l t the tail length and l m the midbody length the specific profile of teardrop shape is actually determined by the head shape factor n n and the tail shape factor n t when n n n t 1 the shapes of head and tail are both conical when n n 2 the head shape is an ellipse with the increase of n n and n t the head and tail profiles become more and more blunt as n n and n t approach infinity the head and tail profiles approach rectangle so for the teardrop shape the n n and n t are generally less than 2 to ensure a better streamline according to the structure characteristics of teardrop shape the main factors influencing the drag coefficient are the head shape factor n n tail shape factor n t ldrs l d l n d l t d and reynolds number re studies by liu et al 2017b showed that the drag coefficients change slightly with the increase of the shape indexes n n and n t especially when n n and n t is less than 2 the drag coefficients basically remain unchanged so in the paper the effects of n n and n t on drag coefficient were ignored only the influence of the parameters of ldrs and re on the drag coefficients of the teardrop shape were discussed fig 7 illustrates the drag coefficients of teardrop shape with l d and re from fig 7 a the pressure drag coefficient c pv decreases while increasing the l d with a rational function while the friction drag coefficient c fv increases linearly with increasing the l d from fig 7 b the c pv decreases with increasing the lgre as a quadratic function and the c fv decrease with increasing the lgre as a rational function in order to obtain the relationship between the drag coefficient with ldrs and re the drag coefficients of the teardrop shapes under different ldrs and re were calculated ldrs of the uvs are generally in the range of from 4 to 12 with l n d between 0 75 and 2 and l t d between 1 and 2 25 length of the auvs autonomous underwater vehicles is usually between 1 5 m and 10 m and the cruising velocity is between 4 knots and 20 knots length of the ugs underwater gliders is between 1 5 m and 3 m and the gliding velocity is between 0 5 knots and 1 5 knots so range of the reynolds number in the present work is chosen as 4 105 re 108 with the density of sea water being 1020 kg m3 and the dynamic viscosity being 1 003 10 3 pa s2 table 3 shows the value range of each parameter determined in the present work from fig 7 the relationships between c pv and c fv with ldr and re can be fitted as the following expressions 4 c p v r l d s 5 c f v k l d b 6 c p v p 1 lg re 2 p 2 lg re p 3 7 c f v q 1 lg re q 2 where r s k b p 1 p 2 p 3 q 1 and q 2 are factors related with ldr since the coupling relationship between the l d and the l n d and l t d the coefficients r s k and b are related to the l n d and l t d the coefficients p 1 p 2 p 3 q 1 and q 2 are determined by l d l n d and l t d since the coupling between l n d l t d and re is very weak the influences of the l n d and l t d on p 1 p 2 p 3 q 1 and q 2 are ignored in the present work values of r s k and b under different l n d and l t d were calculated respectively with re 1 525 106 the fitting results were obtained as follows 8a r n 0 02072 l n d 1 218 0 06382 8b s n 0 9165 l n d 1 977 8c r t 0 05431 l t d 3 428 0 0712

the parameters associated with the head and tail respectively substitute eqs 8 and 9 into eqs 4 and 5 respectively to obtain the mathematical expressions of the pressure drag coefficient c pv and friction drag coefficient c fv with the l d l n d and l t d they are 10 c p v 0 02072 l n d 1 218 0 05431 l t d 3 428 0 05864 l d 0 0 9165 l n d 1 258 l t d 0 9354 11 c f v 0 0 2297 l n d 0 0 6834 l t d 1 11129 l d 0 2251 l n d 0 4971 l t d 23 757 10 3 the coefficients p 1 p 2 p 3 q 1 and q 2 were fitted based on the calculation results under l d from 4 to 12 with increment of 1 when l n d 1 5 and l t d 2 it gives 12a p 1 0 003496 l d 3 354 12b p 2 0 0 5629 l d 3 339 12c p 3 0 2907 l d 3 62 13a q 1 0 002338 l d 0 05575 13b q 2 3 87 there is only a slight difference in the denominators in eq 12 for a particular l d so the mean value of l d 3 352 of the three denominators was used for the sake of simplifying the modeling process then substituting eqs 12 and 13 into eqs 6 and 7 respectively the mathematical expressions of the pressure drag coefficient c pv and friction drag coefficient c fv with re and l d can be described as 14 c p v 0 003496 l g r e 2 0 0 5629 lg re 0 2907 l d 3 352 15 c f v 0 002338 l d 0 05575 lg re 3 87 it is easy to see that eqs 10 and 11 are the special cases of eqs 14 and 15 respectively when re is 1 525 106 l n d 1 5 and l t d 2 so the general form of the pressure drag coefficient c pv can be obtained by combining eqs 10 and 14 16 c pvt 20 72 l n d 1 218 54 31 l t d 3 428 3 496 lg r e 2 56 29 lg re 273 03 l d 0 9165 l n d 1 258 l t d 0 5394 10 3 similarly from eqs 11 and 15 the general form of the friction drag coefficient c fv can be 17 c fvt 0 053136 l n d 0 1581 l t d 2 5744 l d 5 2072 l n d 1 1499 l t d 54 59 lg re 3 87 10 3 where the subscript t represents the drag coefficient related to the teardrop shape taking lgre as the x coordinate the pressure drag coefficient maps under different ldrs of head and tail were drawn and shown in fig 8 since the ldrs of head and tail have little influence on the friction drag coefficient map of the drag coefficient can be obtained through defining specific ldrs of head and tail in this paper the head ldr l n d 1 5 and tail ldr l t d 2 were taken as the example to map the friction drag coefficient as shown in fig 9 3 4 drag coefficient models of other slender axisymmetric shapes in order to achieve more simple and accurate calculation for the drag coefficient of other slender axisymmetric shapes the drag coefficient models of myring shape conical tail shape spindle shape and slender flat shape in the hull shape genealogy were also studied based on the drag coefficient model of the teardrop shape 3 4 1 drag coefficient model of myring shape the myring shape was proposed in 1976 myring 1976 and its profile parametric equation is 18 r x r max 1 x l n l n 2 1 n n 0 x l n r max l n x l n l m r max 3 r max l t 2 tan θ l t x l n l m 2 2 r max l t 3 tan θ l t 2 x l n l m 3 l n l m x l the myring shape bears the closest resemblance to the teardrop shape the former differs from the latter in the head shape factor n n and the tail angle θ which are the two main parameters influencing the profile of myring shape as n n and θ increase the head and tail become more and more blunt when n n 1 the head profile is a parabola and it is an ellipse when n n 2 therefore the two parameters of n n and θ were focused and their influence on the drag coefficient was studied the value ranges of the two parameters were limited to n n 1 3 and θ 25 in the present work because studies showed that the uvs show good hydrodynamic performance in such ranges when n n 2 heads of both myring shape and teardrop shape are ellipses with long axis length l n and short axis length d 2 the drag coefficients of myring shape with head shape factors of 1 1 5 2 5 and 3 were calculated respectively at l d 10 and θ 25 and compared with those of the teardrop shape at n n n t 2 the results were listed in table 4 similarly the drag coefficients of myring shape with different tail angles θ 5 10 15 20 and 25 were calculated at n n 2 and compared with those of the teardrop shape at n n n t 2 as shown in table 5 it can be seen from tables 4 and 5 that n n and θ mainly affect the pressure drag coefficient but barely influence the friction drag coefficient when 1 n n 2 and 10 θ 25 the differences between the total drag coefficients of myring shape and those of teardrop shape at n n n t 2 are within 1 therefore in this range the drag coefficient of myring shape can be calculated by the drag coefficient model of teardrop shape so do the drag coefficient maps therefore the drag coefficient model of myring shape can be written as 19 c dvm c dvt 1 n n 2 10 θ 25 where the subscript m represents the drag coefficient related to the myring shape it is natural that figs 8 and 9 can be used as the drag coefficient maps of myring shape 3 4 2 drag coefficient model of conical tail shape in practice the tail of an uv is often designed as a cone for ease of assembly the difference between conical tail shape and the teardrop shape is the tail angle therefore concerning the drag coefficient model of conical tail shape we only need to focus on the drag coefficients at different tail angles fig 10 shows the drag coefficients of the hull with a conical tail at different tail angles α from fig 10 the friction drag coefficient basically remains unchanged when α is between 3 and 14 the pressure drag coefficient decreases sharply with the increase of α when α is within 3 and 10 then gradually flattens out when α 10 since the friction drag coefficient is basically unchanged the total drag coefficient is consistent with the pressure drag coefficient under the same shape parameters of the head and midbody the drag coefficients of the conical tail shape with α 10 are almost equal to those of the teardrop shape with n t 2 it shows that the drag of conical tail shape with α 10 is only related to the displacement of uvs however when α 10 the drag coefficients of the conical tail shape are significantly different from those of the teardrop shape therefore it is necessary to adopt piecewise fitting for the drag coefficient model of the conical tail shape when α 10 the drag coefficient model of the teardrop shape can be adopted as shown in eqs 16 and 17 and so do the drag coefficient maps when α 10 the curve fitting of the total drag coefficient at different tail angles α was made to obtain the drag coefficient model of the conical tail shape it gives 20 c dvc 0 0003598 α 2 0 007218 α 0 07699 the subscript c represents the drag coefficient associated with the conical tail shape the correction coefficient k c is introduced based on α 10 which is given as 21 k c 0 008821 α 2 0 176955 α 1 887472 with the combination of eqs 16 17 20 and 21 the drag coefficient of the conical tail shape with α 10 can be the drag coefficient of the teardrop shape with the same shape parameter multiplied by the correction coefficient k c in summary the drag coefficient model of the conical tail shape is 22 c dvc c dvt α 10 k c c dvt α 10 3 4 3 drag coefficient model of the spindle shape the spindle shape which is also known as the low drag laminar flow shape was proposed by huggins and packwood in 1994 huggins and packwood 1995 the profile equations of the spindle shape are as follows the head profile is 23a r l 2 f n r n f 1 x k 1 f 2 x g x 1 2 where x x l n f 1 x 2x x 1 3 f 2 x x 2 x 1 2 and g x x 2 3x 2 8x 6 the midbody profile is 23b r l 2 f n r i 1 r i k 1 m f 1 x s i f 2 x g x where x l m x l m l n f 1 x 1 2x 3 x 1 2 f 2 x x x 3 3x 2 8x 6 g x x 3 6x 2 15x 10 k 1m l m l n 1 2 k 1 1 r i the tail profile is 23c r l r t 2 f n 1 t r i 1 f 1 x s i a f 2 x where x l x l l m f 1 x 1 x 3 6x 2 15x 10 f 2 x x 3 3x 2 7x 4 and s ia 1 r i 1 x i s i x i x m r i in eqs 23a 23b and 23c f n x r i r n x i s i and s ia are all intermediate variables while f 1 x f 2 x and g x are all intermediate variables about x x is the value of x coordinate l n the length of head and l m the length of midbody each parameter of spindle shape has its value range such as r n 0 k 1 0 x m x i f n 2 5 0 t r i 1 and s i 0 meanwhile each parameter has its specific recommended value as shown in table 6 that is to say the profile parameters of the spindle shape are generally fixed therefore it can be considered that the drag coefficient of the spindle shape is only related to the reynolds number fig 11 shows the changes of drag coefficients of the spindle shape with l 3 m and d 600 mm under different reynolds numbers represented by the black curves with red logos and the symbols with subscript of sp from fig 11 both pressure and friction drag coefficients decrease with the increase of reynolds number because of the small proportion of the pressure drag coefficient in the total drag coefficient its variation trend has little effect on that of the total drag coefficient the drag coefficient model of the spindle shape was obtained by fitting the data shown in fig 11 it gives 24 c dvsp 0 004088 l g r e 2 0 06593 lgre 0 2922 where the subscript sp represents the drag coefficient related to the spindle shape fig 11 also shows the drag coefficients of the teardrop shape with the same ldr of 5 as the spindle shape represented by the blue curves with yellow logos and the symbols with subscript t it is obvious that the drag coefficients of both spindle shape and teardrop shape have the same variation trend with the increase of re however the drag coefficients of the spindle shape are always higher than the counterparts of the teardrop shape 3 5 drag coefficient model of the slender flat shape the flat shape has a larger width to height ratio whr than the axisymmetric shape does in order to obtain the drag coefficient model of the flat shape the body with elliptic section was taken as the example to investigate influences of the whr and ldr on the drag coefficient the all factor test was conducted by choosing the whrs from 1 to 4 with the growth rate of 0 25 and the ldr from 4 to 12 with the growth rate of 1 fig 12 a and b show the fitting surfaces of pressure and friction drag coefficients with whr and ldr respectively the black dots in fig 12 indicate results of c pv and c fv obtained from cfd calculations at different whr and ldr as shown in fig 12 a the pressure drag coefficient decreases with the increase of l d and increases gradually with the increase of w h from fig 12 b the friction drag coefficient increases linearly with the increase of both l d and w h by fitting the data in fig 12 the relationship among pressure drag coefficient l d and w h can be expressed as 25 c pvf 0 006 0 7 w h 0 07026 l d 3 351 where the subscript f represents the drag coefficient related to the slender flat shape the relationship among the friction drag coefficient l d and w h is 26 c fvf 0 0010499 l d 0 003874 w h 0 01727 comparing the pressure drag coefficient model of teardrop shape i e eq 16 and that of the slender flat shape i e eq 25 it shows that eqs 16 and 25 have the same form when the l n d l t d and re in eq 16 have a certain value on this basis eq 16 is a special case of eq 25 when w h 1 therefore eq 16 and eq 25 can be superimposed to obtain the pressure drag coefficient model of the slender flat shape it gives 27 c pvf 20 72 l n d 1 218 54 31 l t d 3 428 3 496 lg r e 2 56 29 lg re 6 0 7 w h 266 96 l d 0 9165 l n d 1 258 l t d 0 5394 10 3 similarly the friction drag coefficient model of the slender flat shape can be obtained based on eqs 17 and 26 it is 28 c fvf 0 0 5136 l n d 0 1581 l t d 2 665 l d 5 2072 l n d 1 15 l t d 8 9616 w h 45 46 lg re 3 87 10 3 for the convenient reference to the drag coefficient maps of the pressure drag coefficient and the friction drag coefficient of the slender flat shape were drawn according to eqs 27 and 28 under the conditions of l n d 1 5 and l t d 2 respectively as shown in fig 13 and fig 14 4 validation of the drag coefficient models 4 1 validation by cfd simulation for spherical spheroidal shape teardrop shape and slender flat shape five sets of shape data exclusive of the shape data used previously for the drag coefficient models which were listed in tables 7 9 respectively were taken to calculate the drag coefficients of the three shapes by cfd simulations and the established drag coefficient models respectively tables 7 9 also show the relative differences between the drag coefficients of the three shapes from the established drag coefficient models and the cfd simulations respectively it can be seen from table 7 that the relative differences between the calculated values from the drag coefficient model viz eq 2 and the cfd simulations are within 11 from tables 8 and 9 the relative differences between the drag coefficients obtained from the drag coefficient models viz eqs 16 and 17 for the teardrop shapes eqs 27 and 28 for the slender flat shapes and those from the cfd simulations remains within 6 it shows that the drag coefficient models established in this paper provide a good estimation for the drag of uvs calculated by the present cfd simulation 4 2 validation by towing tank tests of petrel l ug the petrel l is an underwater glider developed by tianjin university china its hull shape follows myring shape with the total length of 2 6 m the maximum diameter of 0 24 m both of the head and tail length being 0 45 m midbody length being 1 7 m the head shape factor n n being 2 and the tail angle θ being 9 76 yang 2021 the displacement is 0 394 m3 and the wetted surface area is 3 5565 m2 from the towing tank tests the drag coefficient based on the front area of petrel l hull model was 0 423 based on eqs 16 and 17 the volumetric drag coefficient of petrel l hull model was calculated to be 0 0378 which was converted to the drag coefficient based on the front area being 0 449 the relative error between the drag coefficient from the drag coefficient models established in the paper and from the towing tank tests is 6 14 4 3 validation by towing tank tests of suboff model the suboff model groves et al 1989 which was proposed by defense advanced research projects agency darpa was used to verify the accuracy of the drag coefficient models established in this paper the hull of suboff model is almost like a teardrop shape with the total length of 4 356 m head length of 1 016 m midbody length of 2 229 m tail length of 1 111 m and maximum diameter of 0 508 m groves et al 1989 huang et al 1992 the prismatic coefficient c p of suboff model is 0 789 the displacement is 0 699 m3 and the wetted surface area is 5 989 m2 huang et al 1992 the pressure drag coefficients and friction drag coefficients were calculated by introducing the shape dimensions of the suboff model into the drag coefficient models shown as eqs 16 and 17 then according to the drag formula d 1 2 ρ v 2 c d v 2 3 1 2 ρ v 2 c p v c f v 2 3 the total drags of suboff model were calculated and compared with those from towing tank tests of suboff model as shown in table 10 it is shown that the total drags obtained from the drag coefficient models established in this paper are larger than those from the towing tank tests but the relative errors between them are within 10 which is much lower than the error requirement of 20 in engineering application 4 4 comparison with the existing empirical formulas at present drag coefficient of uvs is generally estimated according the formula recommended by ittc international towing tank conference it is 29a c v s 1 k c f s 29b c f s 0 075 l o g 10 r e 2 2 where c v s and c f s are the viscous pressure drag coefficient and friction drag coefficient based on wetted surface area respectively and k is the form factor in general there are three ways to obtain k namely g j method gillmer and johnson 1982 vt method brown 2007 martz 2008 and mit method jackson 1992 in g j method the scaling factor k involves the influence of the ratio of the maximum diameter and characteristic length of the hull on the pressure drag it is expressed as gillmer and johnson 1982 30 k gj 0 5 d l 3 d l 3 on the basis of g j method vt method introduces the influence of the head shape parameter n n and the tail shape parameter n t on the pressure drag it has brown 2007 martz 2008 31 k vt 0 5 d l 3 d l 7 n n n t 2 in mit method the scaling factor k is described as a function of the diameter characteristic length and prismatic coefficient it gives jackson 1992 32 k mit 1 5 d l 3 2 7 d l 3 0 002 c p 0 6 where c p is the prismatic coefficient c p 4 π d 2 l and is the displacement of the vehicle in the present work the drag coefficients of suboff model were calculated by the empirical formulas i e eqs 29 32 and compared with those of the towing tank tests of suboff model as listed in table 11 in table 11 c d s denotes the total drag coefficient based on wetted surface area c d v is the total volumetric drag coefficient obtained indirectly from c d s data of c dv t was obtained by using d t in table 10 it can be seen that the relative errors between the drag coefficients obtained from the empirical formulas i e g j method vt method and mit and those from the towing tank tests of suboff model are larger than 75 which far exceeds those see table 10 of the drag coefficient models established in this paper it shows that the empirical formulas for drag coefficient based on ship hulls are not suitable for the streamlined hull of the immersed bodies 5 summary and future work 1 genealogy classification theory was introduced to classify hydrodynamic shapes of uvs the hull shape genealogy of uvs was proposed and established based on the analysis of hull shape characteristics of uvs the genealogy can provide a programmatic guidance for establishing the mathematical model of the drag coefficients and shape parameters of uvs 2 focused on the spherical sphroidal shape teardrop shape myring shape conical tail shape spindle shape and slender flat shape in the hull shape genealogy of uvs this paper established the mathematical models of drag coefficients shape parameters and reynolds number through investigating the variation law of drag coefficients with shape parameters and reynolds numbers the established models were verified by cfd simulations with the relative differences being no more than 11 and by the towing tank tests of petrel l model developed by tianjin university and suboff model with the relative errors being less than 10 the drag coefficient models of the spherical spheroidal shape teardrop shape myring shape conical tail shape spindle shape and slender flat shape established in the paper can provide a quick reference for the drag coefficients of uvs in engineering 3 for the spherical spheroidal shapes it is found that there are big errors between the drag coefficients obtained from cfd simulations and from the classical experiment tests before the transition reynolds number moreover the laminar model also cannot obtain the convergent results in high laminar reynolds numbers in the future modeling the laminar flow with high reynolds numbers and its flow mechanism such as 1000 re 2 5 104 past the spherical spheroidal shapes will be involved in our work credit authorship contribution statement

20359,optimizing the configuration of risers is a challenging task it requires numerous nonlinear dynamic finite element analyses to evaluate each candidate configuration regarding its structural behavior in such an optimization procedure the computational time is commonly dominated by the structural analysis step therefore reducing the number of simulations required to find feasible candidates is paramount to reduce the overall computational cost in this work we propose applying the bayesian optimization bo algorithm to optimize steel risers initial configuration efficiently the performance of bo measured as the number of objective function evaluations is shown to be competitive in selected problems of steel lazy wave risers and catenary risers with hydrodynamic dampers compared to other optimization methods found in the literature i e midaco commercial code globalized bounded nelder mead and genetic algorithms in particular we demonstrate the superior performance of bo compared to genetic algorithms the most commonly found method in riser literature representative examples which illustrate the capabilities of the proposed strategy are presented and discussed keywords optimal design riser configuration bayesian optimization ant colony optimization globalized bounded nelder mead genetic algorithm 1 introduction recent discoveries in water depths that exceed 2000 m have brought to attention the challenges in terms of operation security and economics of exploring oil in deep water and harsh environments many engineering design activities require reasonable designer experience as they are traditionally performed basically through trial and error the riser configuration design is one of the most impacted of these activities with reduced variety of feasible solutions in a vast parameter space requiring a considerable amount of time to accomplish the design tasks therefore optimization initiatives are welcome in the sense of improving design quality and reducing the amount of time required in terms of operational and installation costs the free hanging catenary riser is the preferred solution as the riser is connected to the floating production unit fpu and freely laid on the seabed naturally forming a catenary with no further accessories required however with increasing water depths challenges have become more evident since the increased riser length represents an increased weight and vessel payload leading to much higher mechanical stresses throughout the structure installation of buoyancy elements have been adopted as a solution providing an uplifting distributed force and also partially decoupling the movement of the fpu at the top from the catenary in the lower section alleviating the mechanical stresses in the touch down zone tdz the lazy wave configuration illustrated in fig 1 is based on this premise and has become a reliable solution in such extreme environments due to the higher economical cost and complex logistics associated to the lazy wave installation alternative configurations have been studied such as the catenary riser with hydrodynamic dampers crhd aguiar et al 2010 the dampers consist of a low density material applied to different segments of the riser which reduce the stress and the propagation of compressive waves along the riser the riser design problem can be solved through mathematical optimization which several scholars have implemented using techniques such as simplex methods cardoso et al 2019 genetic algorithm andrade et al 2010 and other bio inspired methods nascimento vieira et al 2009 vieira et al 2012 such tools could be used to rapidly and consistently find viable and potentially optimal configurations in difficult situations alleviating the necessity of human expertise and reducing design cycle time this can result in lower engineering and personnel costs from the perspective of the optimization algorithm each queried point entails the generation of a riser configuration that commonly is simulated using a finite element software to evaluate its behavior performing such simulations can be considerably costly especially when several loading conditions are investigated moreover it is not unusual for these simulations to dominate the execution time of the entire optimization problem it is also extremely complex if not unfeasible to compute gradients of the constraints with respect to the optimization design variables therefore precluding the direct use of more efficient gradient based optimization methods which usually are more efficient than gradient free alternatives all these restrictions characterize the problem as an optimization of expensive black box functions the major drawback of evolutionary algorithms which are the most used optimization algorithms in riser design is the considerably high number of function evaluations required to achieve an acceptable solution which in turn represents one of the major problems that forestalls the adoption of mathematical optimization in the daily routine of riser engineers considering these requirements the ideal method would be a black box optimization technique focused on finding optimal solutions that are compliant with all constraints and using the least amount of function evaluations even if the generation of query points takes more time than simpler alternatives the bayesian optimization method originated from the work of kushner 1964 zhilinskas 1975 mockus et al 1978 and mockus 1974 1989 however it gained considerably more attention since the study of jones et al 1998 on the efficient global optimization algorithm bayesian optimization is a surrogate based global optimization method that utilizes the gaussian process gp regression shahriari 2016 which is a machine learning technique to estimate both the value and uncertainty of the objective function as well as its constraints based on previously evaluated points from this regression process the method creates an acquisition function that is then optimized using traditional gradient based methods the use of gp regression makes it possible to propose considerably good points to be queried and therefore allows for an efficient search of the global minimum over the parameter space in recent years the bayesian optimization method has received considerable attention from the machine learning community especially after the observation made by snoek et al 2012 that this method is extremely useful for the hyper parameter tuning of deep neural networks other examples in this regard include those of mendoza et al 2016 and shahriari 2016 a comprehensive review can be found in shahriari et al 2016 with frazier 2018 and brochu et al 2010 as alternatives bayesian optimization has been successfully used for engineering design problems including antenna design inman et al 2004 materials design frazier and wang 2016 aerospace engineering lam et al bartoli et al 2019 seawater intrusion prediction kopsiaftis et al 2019 robotics and autonomous systems calandra et al martinez cantin 2019 contaminant source localization pirot et al 2019 investment portfolio

hydraulic fracturing operations wang and chen 2017 the foregoing demonstrates the applicability of this method in solving difficult problems in a wide range of subjects with varying characteristics and bottlenecks these problems include several cases in which the evaluation of the objective function depends on a considerably time consuming or expensive resource procedure such as a computational fluid dynamics simulation for aerospace application alternative surrogate based methods exist queipo et al 2005 simpson et al 2008 which have similar overall structure but have different prescriptions on how to perform the regression process and how to perform the sampling of the next point to be queried the regression can use for example radial basis functions rbfs or support vector regression to perform the interpolation auxiliary functions to guide the sampling process exist such as the bumpiness function for rbfs gutmann 2001 reviews on alternative surrogate based methods can be found in wang and shan 2006 and also bhosekar and ierapetritou 2018 in this work the application of the bayesian optimization method is investigated to solve the problem in riser configuration design the remainder of this paper is structured as follows an overview of the global optimization problem is presented in section 2 followed by a review of the bayesian optimization algorithm in section 2 1 a discussion on handling constraints in a bayesian framework is presented in section 2 2 section 3 summarizes the models used to benchmark the optimization algorithms with operational constraints discussed in section 3 1 after that the methodology of this work is presented in section 4 with the definition of the objective function the results obtained are presented in section 5 the practical implications of the work and future research avenues are discussed in section 6 with conclusions putting our work in practical perspective in section 7 the details of the implementations aspects are elaborated in appendix with references to the libraries and hardware utilized 2 optimization the optimization problem can be written as follows find point x which may possibly be the global minimum of the function f x as follows 1 x argmin x a f x a j 0 n l j u j r n g k x 0 k 1 2 k this problem is subjected to a family of constraints g k x 0 defined in the box domain a j 0 n l j u j the function and constraints can be queried at any point in the domain however because the cost of such query is high it should be taken into account by the optimization algorithm an efficient optimization algorithm minimizes the required number of queries to obtain an optimal solution an optimization algorithm can be regarded as producing a sequence s x 0 x 1 x 2 x n such that in a certain sense the sequence converges either to the global minimum or to a family of local minima for example the genetic algorithm ga performs this by running a synthetic evolution on a population that screens the parameter space the globalized bounded nelder mead gbnm luersen and riche 2004 algorithm runs several simplex local optimizations and select the best solutions obtained the above methods are characterized by the relatively high number of objective function evaluations required to converge in the case of ga and inconsistent convergence timings in the case of gbnm this inconsistency results from the nelder mead simplex algorithm behavior which depends on the starting position of the simplex that is if it starts in a local bowl it can converge considerably fast however if it starts in a plateau away from a local minima it can take a significantly long time until it finds a good direction to search because the starting point is random the foregoing may lead to simplex searches with drastically different numbers of iterations this behavior is especially difficult for the efficient parallelization of the gbnm method these limitations particularly the inefficient choice of the starting point in the gbnm lead us to search for a smart sampling method that could be used for global optimization the bayesian optimization method 2 1 bayesian optimization the problem posed by the expensive black box function can be explained as follows several black box optimization algorithms rely only on the points queried during the optimization procedure to decide on the next point to query because the function is expensive this restricts the number of points available as a basis for the decision in particular it is difficult to balance the trade off between exploration and exploitation which are both necessary for any global optimization algorithm in the case of gbnm the exploration is fully governed by the random choice of the initial point and the exploitation is performed solely by the simplex algorithm the relative balance between the two is controlled by the ratio of the number of restarts to the length of the maximum iteration each simplex search is allowed to perform before termination the performance of most methods is enhanced when more information is available such as the one obtained through the use of the gradient of the objective function this is one reason why gradient based methods such as the newton and bfgs methods are in general more efficient than gradient free techniques one approach to extend such methods to black box functions is through the use of surrogate functions sometimes called proxy model and kriging or meta model these can provide an estimation of the objective function and gradients on the points of domain a not yet known this is the approach applied by the bayesian optimization method which is an iterative technique it solves the global possibly noisy minimization problem by executing a smaller minimization problem on an associated function at each step based on the information from previously observed points bayesian optimization incorporates the information from previous points by using a surrogate function to interpolate the available data the typical choice for the surrogate function is the gaussian process regression rasmussen and williams 2005 or kriging which offers an efficient technique for interpolations that approach arbitrary functions while providing estimations for both the objective function and the uncertainty in such estimation alternative interpolation methods are also explored for cases where a considerable number of function evaluations are necessary snoek et al 2015 the gaussian process regression expresses the problem of estimating the function value by assuming that the objective function is drawn from a gaussian process this means that the distribution over any set of values of the function on n points d n f x 1 f x 2 f x n is a joint multivariate normal distribution n μ n σ n with the mean vector and covariance matrix defined as μ n k m x k m x k and σ n i j k x x i j k x i x j respectively the function m x is the mean and k x x the covariance of the gaussian process the statement that f x is modeled by the gaussian process is written as f x gp m x k x x the gaussian process for regression is performed by computing the conditional probability p f x d n of the value of a point f x given the value of the previous n points d n the conditional probability is itself a normal distribution its parameters are given by 2 f x d n n μ n x σ n x 3 μ n x m x k x x k x x 1 y m x 4 σ n x k x x k x x k x x 1 k x x where y is the vector of observed evaluations y k f x k or y k f x k ϵ k in the case of noisy evaluations with iid noise ϵ k n 0 σ 2 k x x is a column vector in k x x k k x k x k x x is the transpose vector and given the covariance k used to model the objective function k x x σ n is the covariance matrix associated with dataset d n the quality of the interpolation practically depends on the choice between functions m and k in encoding the assumption on the behavior especially the smoothness degree of the modeled function f x frequently the covariance alone is sufficiently powerful to model the entire function hence a common choice is to set m x 0 nonetheless the choice of covariance function k x x cannot be avoided and constitutes one of the modeling building blocks for the gaussian process regression and in turn the bayesian optimization the use of an online regression method that allows for the incorporation of previously seen data to the decision of the next query provides the method its bayesian qualification equation 2 is regarded as the bayes theorem for the case of a conditional distribution f x d n of the value of the next point f x based on the known values of the previous points d n f x 1 f x 2 f x n the concept behind improving the vanilla black box methods is to leverage the additional information from the interpolation and minimize an analytical function built upon the conditional probability p f x d n the associated function is usually referred to as acquisition function of bayesian optimization a i x d n it constitutes the other building block for the algorithm based on the acquisition function it is possible to determine the next candidate for evaluation by finding the maximum of the acquisition function x n 1 argmax a i x d n moreover by crafting the appropriate acquisition function the sequence can be made to converge to the global minimum if the original function interpolation μ n x m x k x x k x x 1 y m x is sufficiently close to the objective function f x the global minimum can be found by simply running a gradient based optimization directly over μ n x again this is typically not the case because the information is insufficient as a result of the small number of evaluations the alternative to direct interpolation optimization is to optimize functions that encode information in the best places to search for the improvement over the previously seen points writing x argmin x x 1 x 2 x n f x as the best from the already evaluated points two common choices for the acquisition functions can be constructed these are typically called probability of improvement kushner 1964 and expected improvement mockus et al 1978 the choice expressed in the probability of improvement poi entails the computation of the function 5 pi x p f x f x d n φ f x μ n x σ n x where φ is the cumulative distribution function for the unit gaussian distribution i e the normalized error function the caveat to this choice is that it is a pure exploitation method that is the sequences generated from this acquisition function will prioritize points that have a high probability of improvement even if such enhancement is very small an approach to eliminate this problem is to introduce a hedge parameter sometimes called jitter to eq 5 i e 6 pi x p f x f x ξ d n φ f x ξ μ n x σ n x parameter ξ allows pi x to be used as an acquisition function for a global optimization method by balancing exploration and exploitation it might be necessary to adjust ξ dynamically a common recommendation is starting with a large ξ and shrinking it during the evolution of the optimization in this way ξ would behave as the temperature parameter in the algorithm of simulated annealing the expected improvement ei which considers not only the probability of improvement but also the extent of improvement relative to uncertainty is typically the common choice this allows for some unknown points in which the probability of improvement is low and yet uncertainty is high to be considered augmenting the exploratory capability of the method the original function proposed by mockus et al 1978 is defined as follows 8 ei x e max 0 f x ξ f x d n f x ξ μ n x φ z σ n x ϕ z σ n x 0 0 σ n x 0 where e d n denotes the expected value conditioned to the a posteriori distribution p f x d n in which z f x μ n x ξ σ n x is the z score corrected by the best observed value and the jitter is included an acquisition function based on maximizing the expected improvement produces the next point to be evaluated by solving the optimization problem 9 x n 1 argmax x a ei x argmax x a e max 0 f x f x ξ d n such an optimization problem can be solved by a gradient based method such as newton raphson or bfgs method because ei x for any given fixed d n is an analytical function with a readily computable gradient a common choice is using the l bfgs b version of the bfgs method in the case of ei x the acquisition function balances exploitation in which the improvement is expressed in the first term f x μ n x ξ and exploration encoded in the second term size σ n x which is large in unexplored regions as previously mentioned there are several options for the acquisition functions such as lower confidence bound knowledge gradient entropy search and multi step optimal acquisition therefore similar to the covariance function which is necessary for a successful regression the choice of acquisition function is extremely important for a successful optimization in the absence of noise pi and ei are the two most common choices because both have a more straightforward implementation and they produce results that are mostly equivalent to the other acquisition function in this scenario given these two main building blocks the gp regression and acquisition function the overall structure of bayesian optimization is described in algorithm 1 it is important to note that bayesian optimization is an iterative algorithm in which each iteration is comprised of a step that incorporates data from previous steps and a second step that contains a non convex optimization problem of an analytic function based on previously observed data in this sense each step attempts to produce the next smartest point to be queried in practice this is accomplished by running a gradient based optimization algorithm e g l bfgs b on multiple randomly selected restart points this allows the search of several local minima of the acquisition function the best is used as the next query point as an alternative choosing more than one local minima for investigation provides a possible parallelization path to the algorithm the basic version described in algorithm 1 can be organically extended to include black box constraints into the bayesian setting using the technique probability of feasibility which is described in section 2 2 some works extend the bayesian optimization framework to handle multi objective optimizations couckuyt et al 2014 because of the interpolation provided by the gaussian process the main caveat of the method is the necessity of solving the linear systems k x x 1 y and k x x 1 k x x which can be of complexity o n 3 in a naïve implementation where n is the number of data points this is typically not a problem even in this case because the aim is to use the smallest number of data points possible hence they usually remain less than 1 0 4 points in these dataset sizes matrix inversion does not constitute a problem for modern day computers especially when compared to the evaluation of the objective function and constraints nevertheless approaches to circumvent this steep computational cost increase with the number of points and dimensionality have been proposed these include the use of sparse gaussian processes mcintire et al 2016 deep neural networks snoek et al 2015 projection models li et al 2016 and additive models kandasamy et al 2015 2 2 probability of feasibility the method of the probability of feasibility developed initially by schonlau 1997 and after that by gardner et al 2014 and gelbart et al 2014 implements constraints to the bayesian optimization through the acquisition function starting from the ei acquisition example if one was able to exactly write the constraint in a problem subjected to a constraint of the form c x 0 the constrained acquisition function would be written as follows 10 e i c x h c x 0 e max 0 f x f x ξ d n δ x ei x where h is the heaviside step function 1 and 0 for non negative and negative arguments respectively as mentioned in section 1 it might not be feasible to exactly track where the constraint is satisfied this motivates treating the black box constraints similar to the objective function i e modeling using a gaussian process c x gp m c x k c x x in which data for the constraint on the first n points is d n c c x 1 c x 2 c x n in this approach similar to the objective function the constraint is treated as a random variable this transforms δ x into a bernoulli random variable this is implemented by calculating the probability of the constraint being satisfied at any given point as given by the following expression 12 e δ x d n c p c x 0 d n c 0 p c x d n c d c x μ n c 2 σ n c d z 1 π e z 2 φ μ n c 2 σ n c pf x therefore the full acquisition function for the constrained problem is ei c x e δ x max 0 f x f x ξ d n d n c pf x ei x this is of special interest for the present work because although the objective function is relatively simple the constraints are extremely complex since they result from finite element simulations on flexible riser dynamics multiple constraints can be extended by multiplication p f x k 1 n c p c k x 0 d k n c k 1 n c φ μ k n c x 2 σ k n c x which indicates that each constraint is handled separately 3 case study because the lazy wave and crhd configurations are designed for deep waters and harsh environments in this research two cases of lazy wave configuration with different water depth ranges are investigated the third case focuses on the crhd configuration in all cases a rigid steel riser is considered according to the properties listed in table 1 the horizontal projection that represents the horizontal distance from the floating production storage and offloading fpso unit and the wellhead is 2861 m in all cases the loads are those that produce the worst results in terms of stress distribution along the riser under all the combinations of environmental conditions waves and currents these are analyzed through an extreme load assessment a triangular velocity profile represents the sea current with a maximum of 1 15 m s at the surface the simulation time is equivalent to two wave periods with a build up period of a single wave and spans a total of three wave periods 37 23 s table 2 summarizes the fpso motion imposed to the riser s top end 3 1 operational constraints the constraints are based on operational and structural criteria which are obtained through finite element simulations on different riser configurations for the crhd configuration the minimum vertical clearance from the seabed to the deepest damper section fig 3 c m i n is above 10 m this is to prevent any riser section equipped with dampers from touching the seabed furthermore for the crhd design the total length of the riser should not exceed the sum of the water depth and horizontal projection this avoids a slack pipeline at the tdz neither of these two restrictions is applied to the slwr designs for both the crhd and slwr designs the top angle at the point where the riser connects to the floating unit should lie in the interval θ θ m i n θ m a x this constraint prevents increased suspended lengths that could limit the presence of other supporting vessels and induce larger stresses as a structural constraint pipe members subjected to bending moment and effective tension shall satisfy the combined loading criteria clc defined by offshore standard dnvgl st f201 det norske veritas as 2018 as follows 13 γ s c γ m m d m k 1 p i p 0 p b 2 t e t k 2 p i p o p b 2 1 if p i p o γ s

slwr configuration two scenarios with different water depths are investigated 1200 and 2150 m the riser is represented similarly with those reported in previous works such as in vieira et al 2008 with three different sections and buoyancy modules considered in the intermediate section l 2 only three parameters must be determined to define a buoyancy module diameter d f length l f and spacing between the modules sp these six parameters define the riser s configuration and are chosen as the design variables of the optimization problem as shown in fig 2 the variation range of each variable is listed in table 3 the buoyancy module s specific weight is 750 kg m 3 and the design variable lower bounds allow the buoyancy module diameter to be equal to the outer diameter of the steel riser or its length to be equal to zero these cases imply a non existent buoyancy module leading to a free hanging catenary configuration the operational constraints are listed in table 4 3 3 catenary riser with hydrodynamic dampers in the crhd configuration the riser is installed at a water depth of 2150 m the riser is divided into 11 steel pipe segments five of these have low density coatings that are appropriate for the hds previous studies suggest that five is the ideal number of segments for hydrodynamic dampers brito et al 2017 the crhd is defined in the study of aguiar et al 2010 the input variables of the optimization of the crhd configuration are as follows length of five sections with dampers l2 l4 l6 l8 and l10 length of section spacing between adjacent dampers l3 l5 l7 and l9 and length of the top and bottom sections of the riser l1 and l11 respectively as shown in fig 3 the variation ranges of each previously described design variable are listed in table 5 the physical properties of hydrodynamic dampers thickness and density are summarized in table 6 in terms of boundary conditions the base of the riser anchor is fixed to the seabed and the top is connected to the fpso i e the movements of the floating unit are transferred to the top of the riser the operational constraints are listed in table 7 4 methodology this study aims to verify the application of bayesian optimization as a consistent and competitive optimization method compared to commonly found methods in riser literature the chosen methods are compared based on the speed they can consistently find a desired minimum the speed is measured based on the number of objective function evaluations bayesian optimization is compared with the commercial code midaco schlueter et al 2013 globalized bounded nelder mead gbnm and genetic algorithm ga midaco uses a modified version of the ant colony optimization schlueter et al 2009 which includes a penalty method named the oracle penalty schlueter and gerdts 2010 to handle constraints recalling the optimization problem formulation in eq 1 the objective is to find an optimal x vector of design variables for steel lazy wave risers slwr this vector components are the normalized sections lengths and the parameters that specify the buoyancy modules and for catenary risers with hydrodynamic dampers crhd are the lengths of the sections with and without dampers for slwr the dimensionality is n 7 and for crhd the dimensionality is n 11 a realistic configuration can range from a few parameters up to more than ten realistic multi line systems can have up to several dozen dimensions which would represent a very challenging problem the configuration space can have section lengths and buoy geometry as separate dimensions however only section lengths contribute to the objective function for the crhd configuration described in section 3 3 given that all dimensions correspond to riser section lengths the number of sections is n l 11 for the length of section i given by x i l i u i the objective function is a normalized notion of riser length given by the following 14 f x i 0 n l 1 x i l i i 0 n l 1 u i l i for the slwr configuration described in section 3 2 n l 3 because the latter three variables do not correspond to riser section lengths these correspond to relatively simple objective functions which are not particularly difficult to optimize however the practical difficulty lies in handling the constraints and not the objective function although several factors such as pipe material and installation method impact the final cost of the riser the amount of pipe necessary for the riser configuration is a good basis for the cost estimate in this sense the riser length is the objective function to be minimized in the three proposed cases the problem is that extremely short riser can lead to increased stresses in design that in turn can violate the structural integrity criteria therefore to comply with different goals the proper handling of constraints is of utmost importance the constraints are of the form g k x a k or g k x a k converted to the form g k x g k x a k a k 0 and g k x a k g k x a k 0 the constraints explored in section 3 1 include feasibility of the configuration the lower and upper limits on the top angle and maximum effective load for both types of risers for the crhd configuration two extra constraints are considered one related to the minimum clearance on the first hydro damper and another for the maximum value of the total riser length 5 results the performance comparison among all the four algorithms is summarized in table 8 which reports the best cases for each algorithm regarding the slwr case in both water depths the optima configuration found by the four optimization methods present nonzero buoyancy module lengths which is reasonable since otherwise it would result in free hanging catenaries instead of lazy waves in a scenario of high amplitude heave motion on the riser top such as in harsh environments and deep waters free hanging catenary risers would present unfeasible values for the structural integrity criterion clc in the touchdown zone for the crhd case the found optima configurations present fairly similar results regarding the riser lengths and structural behavior the dampers are able to attenuate the tensions on the touchdown zone which is the most critical with respect to the clc values for further discussion regarding the crhd configuration see cardoso et al 2019 three dimensional visualizations of the optima found by each of the optimization methods are presented in figs 4 to 6 finding riser configurations that satisfy all constraints is not an easy task as shown in table 8 regarding the failure ga to comply with the top angle constraint for the slwr configurations the use of optimization is the best way to consistently find feasible configurations which if done manually would usually require compromising in the value of the objective function such as the riser length it is observed that the overall performance of bayesian optimization is comparable to the commercial code midaco with the best found parameters selected for both there is also a distinct performance gap between the first two and the last two algorithms in which more than 1000 objective function evaluations were necessary to obtain a good result the results obtained here are in a good agreement with those presented by nascimento vieira et al 2009 it is noteworthy that the ga which is the first go to algorithm for several engineering optimization problems is found to have the worst performance by a considerable margin both bayesian optimization and midaco provide an improvement of at least ten times that of the ga for riser design problems this shows that the choice of algorithm is extremely important and can represent the difference in terms of time or resource between the feasibility or infeasibility of a given test it should also be noted that even when considerably more function evaluations are used the ga does not necessarily produce solutions that satisfy all constraints two cases violate the maximum top angle constraint from a practical perspective the results in table 8 shows that the bayesian optimization algorithm provides an open source alternative to midaco hence it is more accessible for the slwr configuration which is most commonly employed for riser systems in ultra deepwater environments the performance of the bayesian optimization algorithm is significantly better than that of the midaco code even if the early stopping criterion used for it is factored in for engineering design teams this represents the possibility of running optimization algorithms in the daily routine of riser design with relatively modest computational resources regarding the convergence behavior for both bayesian optimization and midaco the results can be seen in fig 7 we observe a relatively quick convergence between 20 and 60 iterations for slwr to obtain a good configuration and around 100 to 200 iterations for crhd which is compatible with the results presented in table 8 it is important to mention that the normalization of both design variables and constraints plays a crucial role in the performance of the bo method the gp regression is based on kernel functions that usually assume that the data being interpolated has zero mean and unitary variance if non normalized values are used in the interpolation the regression can and usually will produce a poor approximation for the desired functions directly affecting the optimization process also by using a relatively short to medium range covariance function behavior implied by the gp regression is that there are no fat tails on the data the normalization of the objective function and the re scaling of the constraints solve this compatibility with the gp regression for the specific case of the clc the normalization the logarithm addresses the problem of fat tails which can interfere with the interpolation due to order of magnitude difference between values of clc in some configurations not normalizing the data can sometimes work but it will do so much more slowly than when the data is normalized another solution to this problem would be to adjust the values σ and ρ on the matérn 5 2 covariance function this should be made differently for each variable which would essentially be equivalent to normalize the variables before using it in the interpolation scheme the implementation of this approach is more involved because it requires crafting a non standard kernel function by multiplying kernels with different parameters the normalization scheme used in this work was enough to obtain convergence and good performance for all three cases presented the results related to total execution times are shown in fig 8 a it can be observed that the aggregate objective function evaluation time is considerably higher than the proposal time for the bo algorithm as expected moreover even without any parallelization strategy the bo can compete with midaco in the slwr configurations which are the most important for industrial use the average time to run the simulation remains more or less constant as a function of the step of the loop whereas the time to suggest the next point increases although it remains below the average simulation times this is the expected behavior of the bo as the number of points used to create the gp regression which is necessary to generate the acquisition function increases the overall time is dominated by the simulation which is considered good it could even be better if more numerous or complicated simulations are required like that in the case with multiple loading cases nevertheless the possibility that the proposal time can become exceedingly large for the next point impends this can pose a problem for the scalability of the algorithm for extremely large problems 6 discussion in this work we proposed applying the bayesian optimization algorithm in the search for optimal riser configurations among the selected problems and methods bayesian optimization exhibited the most efficient performance in finding optimal solutions for steel lazy wave risers in the 1200 m and 2150 m respectively such type of configuration is the most common configuration employed in ultra deepwater and harsh environments it is worth reiterating that the optimization of riser configurations presented in this work does not represent the complete design of a rigid riser further detailed analyses would be required such as fatigue interference and vortex induced vibration notwithstanding the optimization methods presented notably bo could be adopted in the riser detailed design activities due to its computational efficiency this substantiates the competitiveness of the bayesian optimization algorithm for solving traditional engineering problems even when compared with state of the art evolutionary algorithms the settings used to perform the bayesian optimization algorithm are close to standard recommendations found in the literature this indicates a potential for tuning the bo for specific riser design problems in the future it is presumed that possible algorithmic improvements can be achieved by combining multiple acquisition functions with different trade offs and by intelligently choosing the best algorithm at any given step hoffman et al 2011 the two best performing cases are achieved within a 1 h execution time using a modest desktop computer with six physical cores in terms of time and cost the foregoing resources are considerably affordable moreover apart from such benefits other potential gains remain it is further presumed that there are considerably substantial potential gains from extending the available computing capability to typical technique users currently commercial cloud environments can provide practically unlimited computing power particularly for capacity tasks similar to those presented in this work the results of this study could be used in conjunction with local resources to execute hybrid local remote computing loads at relatively low costs this is because the execution model of bayesian optimization can be easily adapted to this type of software architecture kandasamy et al 2018 pokuri et al 2018 recently cloud apis for bayesian optimization have also been available in the form of services mind foundry 2018 golovin et al 2017 the execution times for both the bo and midaco demonstrate that although there remains room for improvement the bo is a competitive alternative to midaco in terms of sheer performance for this type of optimization problem the worst case for the bo is that the crhd remains substantially dominated by simulation time which can be improved by implementing parallel simulations similar to that implemented in midaco the best output which is the optimization of the 1200 m slwr exhibits the importance of the number of function evaluations the serial implementation of bo demonstrates that it can match or even outperform the parallel midaco implementation timings this also provides an overview of time scales that are attainable in cases with larger problems and with the possibility of running realistic cases within a day using relatively modest computer hardware in the past few years the combination of machine learning methods with typical simulation and numerical methods revolutionized in several areas such as active control computer vision life sciences and engineering learning techniques are becoming more actively used in solving oil and gas problems it is anticipated that investigations such as the present study which uses machine learning assisted methodologies can be more actively utilized by engineers for their daily work it is presumed that this study effectively demonstrates the potential of such techniques for their application to real life global optimization problems in riser design 7 conclusions this work demonstrated that bayesian optimization in conjunction with finite element simulation codes is an efficient method to provide optimal riser configurations that can be used in real world scenarios the performance obtained by the bayesian optimization method allows it to be used as a standard tool in the daily routine for riser design its considerable optimization efficiency with a minimal number of function evaluations makes it possible to optimize preliminary designs in a standard desktop environment this could represent a shift in the perspective on the development of preliminary riser designs and prototyping in production environments at the very least a

implementation details dynamic analysis which is necessary for the evaluation of engineering constraints is performed using the orcaflex program orcina ltd 2019 this program is the industry standard software package for nonlinear static and dynamic analyses of offshore marine systems in the time and frequency domains the optimization process is performed in python scripting for bayesian optimization bo genetic algorithm ga and globalized bounded nelder mead gbnm by calling the orcaflex python api the midaco schlueter et al 2013 results are obtained using its c api and the corresponding orcaflex c api for the genetic algorithm the distributed evolutionary algorithm in python fortin et al 2012 a standard library for evolutionary optimization algorithms for the python programming language is used the implementation described in cardoso et al 2019 is adopted for the gbnm bayesian optimization is conducted by the gpyopt library the gpyopt authors 2016 and the actual application is written using jupyter notebooks thomas et al 2016 an extension to the library mentioned above is developed to implement the probability of feasibility black box constraint handling as described in section 2 2 gpyopt is an open source library that implements the bayesian optimization algorithm in python under the bsd 3 clause license which makes it easily available for commercial use in all cases each point generated by the optimization code is converted into a riser configuration the case analyses are performed using orcaflex api the simulation result is then processed to obtain the maximum and minimum top angles with the maximum value of the combined loading criterion described in section 3 1 the crhd also requires maximum length and minimum clearance constraints the feasibility or non feasibility of the solution is also handled as a separate constraint over the configuration space all variables involved in the bayesian optimization are re scaled to be of order 1 the design variables are computed in the interval x 0 1 and converted to x through x i u i l i x i l i therefore normalizing the design variable with respect to the gpyopt library the objective function is already normalized with the exception of the clc the constraints are re scaled according to the formulas g k x g k x a k a k 0 and g k x a k g k x a k 0 so to keep the values around 1 the clc is re scaled by setting c c l c log 10 clc which is positive in the range clc 1 the normalization for the constraints is necessary to allow for a proper interpolation using the gp regression for bayesian optimization the algorithm is initialized with 50 function evaluations for both slwr configurations that follow latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 on the configuration space it is 0 1 6 in this case for the crhd configurations initialization is also performed using latin hypercube sampling but with 150 points on a configuration space 0 1 11 this requires more points to initialize than the slwr because it is of higher dimensionality the initialization strategy is found to be considerably important for the bo when the performances of latin hypercube initialization against random initialization and sobol sequence sobol 1967 initialization are compared both perform considerably worse than latin hypercube which is the standard recommended initialization method found in the literature related to bayesian optimization the expected improvement acquisition function used is that described in eq 8 the constraint handling is done using the p f x function defined in eq 12 for each operational constraint the main loop of the optimization is iterated 200 times for the crhd case and 65 times for the slwr configurations these numbers are found to be the smallest to obtain considerably good minima that are consistent with all constraints therefore they provide the reference number of evaluations that the algorithm requires to find a good minimum the interpolation kernel utilized is the matérn 5 2 covariance function which is the standard kernel in the gpyopt library it is given by k x x c 5 2 r x x σ 2 1 5 r ρ 5 r 2 3 ρ 2 exp 5 r ρ where σ 2 is the variance and ρ is the length scale of the kernel we attempted to use the exponential kernel σ 2 exp r ρ and gaussian kernel σ 2 exp r 2 2 ρ 2 however in our tests both exhibited worse performances than the matérn 5 2 kernel moreover it is tested by running the optimization with different length scales ρ 1 1 2 1 3 1 10 it yields approximately the same results regardless of the length scale utilized as previously mentioned the objective function lies in the interval 0 f x 1 the jitter parameter ξ 2 5 1 0 4 is utilized for the expected improvement acquisition the midaco code has several stopping criteria to be selected by the user for this study evalstop 100 is chosen as the stopping criterion this means that until the current solution does not further improve the midaco can perform its optimization for 100 consecutive function evaluations by default the code considers a solution feasible if a constraint is violated by no more than 10 3 however to improve the algorithm accuracy this number is reduced to 10 7 all other parameters are set to default values which are found in the midaco user manual schlueter and munetomo 2013 the parameters used for the gbnm algorithm are set as follows any randomly generated simplex can have a length between 5 and 10 of any domain size in any direction the coefficients related to the nelder mead algorithm are set to standard values of α 1 0 β 0 5 γ 2 0 and δ 0 5 as employed in cardoso et al 2019 in which α β γ and δ correspond to the simplex s reflection contraction expansion and shrinkage operations coefficients respectively the chosen expansion value is α g 1 0 2 which covers 20 of the domain in case it is within one standard deviation away from the mean the maximum number of iterations for each restart of the nelder mead algorithm is limited to 120 objective function evaluations with an extension of up to 150 evaluations in case the violation of constraints is less than 3 the number of restarts to consistently obtain good minima is found to be 20 which is adopted in this study it is important to note that these values may vary according to the problem being investigated the penalization of the solution is conducted through the augmented lagrangian method whose initial parameters are set to λ 1000 and μ 1000 in which λ and μ are the lagrange multiplier and the penalty parameter for the problem respectively these are updated whenever there is convergence with solutions that violate constraints the genetic algorithm is performed using a population of 200 individuals over 35 generations for all three cases based on the work of nascimento vieira et al 2009 the selection criterion is implemented in a tournament manner in which trios of individuals are randomly selected and the most suitable individual is selected the number of times the tournament is implemented is equal to the population in this way 200 new candidates for mating possibly with repetitions are produced for every two candidates an 80 crossover probability is applied with a two point crossover in the genes the probability of one of the sired descendants to suffer an additional mutation is 10 which is implemented as a normal zero average random number added to the value of the gene the stopping criterion is based on the standard deviation of the fitness value over the population it should be lower than 1 or after 35 generations in terms of the aptitude function a penalized version of the objective function using the augmented lagrangian method is used the parameters are set to μ 1000 and λ 1000 which are the same as those used for the gbnm method although not the focus of this study the performance considerations related to the acceleration of code execution are included the ga and midaco implement block parallelization in which the evaluation of each generation or step is performed in parallel at the population level using python multiprocessing for ga and openmp openmp architecture review board 2008 for midaco the gbnm code is parallelized by implementing a master slave architecture which is an asynchronous load balancing strategy at the simplex restart level the mpi4py library dalcín et al 2005 2008 dalcin et al 2011 which is a python interface for the mpi communication protocol is used for the parallelization such parallelization strategy is not readily applicable for the bo at the time of this work however it supports both synchronous and asynchronous parallelization strategies wang et al 2016 kandasamy et al 2018 the execution environment for bayesian optimization and midaco codes is a desktop core i7 8700 six cores 3 2 ghz and 16 gb of ddr4 with all executions performed in a cpu and without gpu acceleration for any of the codes for the gbnm and ga codes in addition to the core i7 8700 it was also utilized a dual socket xeon e5 2650v4 with 2 12 cores 2 2 ghz and 128 gb of ddr4 memory which is not used by either bo or midaco 
20359,optimizing the configuration of risers is a challenging task it requires numerous nonlinear dynamic finite element analyses to evaluate each candidate configuration regarding its structural behavior in such an optimization procedure the computational time is commonly dominated by the structural analysis step therefore reducing the number of simulations required to find feasible candidates is paramount to reduce the overall computational cost in this work we propose applying the bayesian optimization bo algorithm to optimize steel risers initial configuration efficiently the performance of bo measured as the number of objective function evaluations is shown to be competitive in selected problems of steel lazy wave risers and catenary risers with hydrodynamic dampers compared to other optimization methods found in the literature i e midaco commercial code globalized bounded nelder mead and genetic algorithms in particular we demonstrate the superior performance of bo compared to genetic algorithms the most commonly found method in riser literature representative examples which illustrate the capabilities of the proposed strategy are presented and discussed keywords optimal design riser configuration bayesian optimization ant colony optimization globalized bounded nelder mead genetic algorithm 1 introduction recent discoveries in water depths that exceed 2000 m have brought to attention the challenges in terms of operation security and economics of exploring oil in deep water and harsh environments many engineering design activities require reasonable designer experience as they are traditionally performed basically through trial and error the riser configuration design is one of the most impacted of these activities with reduced variety of feasible solutions in a vast parameter space requiring a considerable amount of time to accomplish the design tasks therefore optimization initiatives are welcome in the sense of improving design quality and reducing the amount of time required in terms of operational and installation costs the free hanging catenary riser is the preferred solution as the riser is connected to the floating production unit fpu and freely laid on the seabed naturally forming a catenary with no further accessories required however with increasing water depths challenges have become more evident since the increased riser length represents an increased weight and vessel payload leading to much higher mechanical stresses throughout the structure installation of buoyancy elements have been adopted as a solution providing an uplifting distributed force and also partially decoupling the movement of the fpu at the top from the catenary in the lower section alleviating the mechanical stresses in the touch down zone tdz the lazy wave configuration illustrated in fig 1 is based on this premise and has become a reliable solution in such extreme environments due to the higher economical cost and complex logistics associated to the lazy wave installation alternative configurations have been studied such as the catenary riser with hydrodynamic dampers crhd aguiar et al 2010 the dampers consist of a low density material applied to different segments of the riser which reduce the stress and the propagation of compressive waves along the riser the riser design problem can be solved through mathematical optimization which several scholars have implemented using techniques such as simplex methods cardoso et al 2019 genetic algorithm andrade et al 2010 and other bio inspired methods nascimento vieira et al 2009 vieira et al 2012 such tools could be used to rapidly and consistently find viable and potentially optimal configurations in difficult situations alleviating the necessity of human expertise and reducing design cycle time this can result in lower engineering and personnel costs from the perspective of the optimization algorithm each queried point entails the generation of a riser configuration that commonly is simulated using a finite element software to evaluate its behavior performing such simulations can be considerably costly especially when several loading conditions are investigated moreover it is not unusual for these simulations to dominate the execution time of the entire optimization problem it is also extremely complex if not unfeasible to compute gradients of the constraints with respect to the optimization design variables therefore precluding the direct use of more efficient gradient based optimization methods which usually are more efficient than gradient free alternatives all these restrictions characterize the problem as an optimization of expensive black box functions the major drawback of evolutionary algorithms which are the most used optimization algorithms in riser design is the considerably high number of function evaluations required to achieve an acceptable solution which in turn represents one of the major problems that forestalls the adoption of mathematical optimization in the daily routine of riser engineers considering these requirements the ideal method would be a black box optimization technique focused on finding optimal solutions that are compliant with all constraints and using the least amount of function evaluations even if the generation of query points takes more time than simpler alternatives the bayesian optimization method originated from the work of kushner 1964 zhilinskas 1975 mockus et al 1978 and mockus 1974 1989 however it gained considerably more attention since the study of jones et al 1998 on the efficient global optimization algorithm bayesian optimization is a surrogate based global optimization method that utilizes the gaussian process gp regression shahriari 2016 which is a machine learning technique to estimate both the value and uncertainty of the objective function as well as its constraints based on previously evaluated points from this regression process the method creates an acquisition function that is then optimized using traditional gradient based methods the use of gp regression makes it possible to propose considerably good points to be queried and therefore allows for an efficient search of the global minimum over the parameter space in recent years the bayesian optimization method has received considerable attention from the machine learning community especially after the observation made by snoek et al 2012 that this method is extremely useful for the hyper parameter tuning of deep neural networks other examples in this regard include those of mendoza et al 2016 and shahriari 2016 a comprehensive review can be found in shahriari et al 2016 with frazier 2018 and brochu et al 2010 as alternatives bayesian optimization has been successfully used for engineering design problems including antenna design inman et al 2004 materials design frazier and wang 2016 aerospace engineering lam et al bartoli et al 2019 seawater intrusion prediction kopsiaftis et al 2019 robotics and autonomous systems calandra et al martinez cantin 2019 contaminant source localization pirot et al 2019 investment portfolio allocation nyikosa et al quantum computing zhu et al 2018 chemistry häse et al 2018 and biochemistry wang 2017 in oil and gas applications it is applied in the optimization of drilling parameters in hydraulic fracturing operations wang and chen 2017 the foregoing demonstrates the applicability of this method in solving difficult problems in a wide range of subjects with varying characteristics and bottlenecks these problems include several cases in which the evaluation of the objective function depends on a considerably time consuming or expensive resource procedure such as a computational fluid dynamics simulation for aerospace application alternative surrogate based methods exist queipo et al 2005 simpson et al 2008 which have similar overall structure but have different prescriptions on how to perform the regression process and how to perform the sampling of the next point to be queried the regression can use for example radial basis functions rbfs or support vector regression to perform the interpolation auxiliary functions to guide the sampling process exist such as the bumpiness function for rbfs gutmann 2001 reviews on alternative surrogate based methods can be found in wang and shan 2006 and also bhosekar and ierapetritou 2018 in this work the application of the bayesian optimization method is investigated to solve the problem in riser configuration design the remainder of this paper is structured as follows an overview of the global optimization problem is presented in section 2 followed by a review of the bayesian optimization algorithm in section 2 1 a discussion on handling constraints in a bayesian framework is presented in section 2 2 section 3 summarizes the models used to benchmark the optimization algorithms with operational constraints discussed in section 3 1 after that the methodology of this work is presented in section 4 with the definition of the objective function the results obtained are presented in section 5 the practical implications of the work and future research avenues are discussed in section 6 with conclusions putting our work in practical perspective in section 7 the details of the implementations aspects are elaborated in appendix with references to the libraries and hardware utilized 2 optimization the optimization problem can be written as follows find point x which may possibly be the global minimum of the function f x as follows 1 x argmin x a f x a j 0 n l j u j r n g k x 0 k 1 2 k this problem is subjected to a family of constraints g k x 0 defined in the box domain a j 0 n l j u j the function and constraints can be queried at any point in the domain however because the cost of such query is high it should be taken into account by the optimization algorithm an efficient optimization algorithm minimizes the required number of queries to obtain an optimal solution an optimization algorithm can be regarded as producing a sequence s x 0 x 1 x 2 x n such that in a certain sense the sequence converges either to the global minimum or to a family of local minima for example the genetic algorithm ga performs this by running a synthetic evolution on a population that screens the parameter space the globalized bounded nelder mead gbnm luersen and riche 2004 algorithm runs several simplex local optimizations and select the best solutions obtained the above methods are characterized by the relatively high number of objective function evaluations required to converge in the case of ga and inconsistent convergence timings in the case of gbnm this inconsistency results from the nelder mead simplex algorithm behavior which depends on the starting position of the simplex that is if it starts in a local bowl it can converge considerably fast however if it starts in a plateau away from a local minima it can take a significantly long time until it finds a good direction to search because the starting point is random the foregoing may lead to simplex searches with drastically different numbers of iterations this behavior is especially difficult for the efficient parallelization of the gbnm method these limitations particularly the inefficient choice of the starting point in the gbnm lead us to search for a smart sampling method that could be used for global optimization the bayesian optimization method 2 1 bayesian optimization the problem posed by the expensive black box function can be explained as follows several black box optimization algorithms rely only on the points queried during the optimization procedure to decide on the next point to query because the function is expensive this restricts the number of points available as a basis for the decision in particular it is difficult to balance the trade off between exploration and exploitation which are both necessary for any global optimization algorithm in the case of gbnm the exploration is fully governed by the random choice of the initial point and the exploitation is performed solely by the simplex algorithm the relative balance between the two is controlled by the ratio of the number of restarts to the length of the maximum iteration each simplex search is allowed to perform before termination the performance of most methods is enhanced when more information is available such as the one obtained through the use of the gradient of the objective function this is one reason why gradient based methods such as the newton and bfgs methods are in general more efficient than gradient free techniques one approach to extend such methods to black box functions is through the use of surrogate functions sometimes called proxy model and kriging or meta model these can provide an estimation of the objective function and gradients on the points of domain a not yet known this is the approach applied by the bayesian optimization method which is an iterative technique it solves the global possibly noisy minimization problem by executing a smaller minimization problem on an associated function at each step based on the information from previously observed points bayesian optimization incorporates the information from previous points by using a surrogate function to interpolate the available data the typical choice for the surrogate function is the gaussian process regression rasmussen and williams 2005 or kriging which offers an efficient technique for interpolations that approach arbitrary functions while providing estimations for both the objective function and the uncertainty in such estimation alternative interpolation methods are also explored for cases where a considerable number of function evaluations are necessary snoek et al 2015 the gaussian process regression expresses the problem of estimating the function value by assuming that the objective function is drawn from a gaussian process this means that the distribution over any set of values of the function on n points d n f x 1 f x 2 f x n is a joint multivariate normal distribution n μ n σ n with the mean vector and covariance matrix defined as μ n k m x k m x k and σ n i j k x x i j k x i x j respectively the function m x is the mean and k x x the covariance of the gaussian process the statement that f x is modeled by the gaussian process is written as f x gp m x k x x the gaussian process for regression is performed by computing the conditional probability p f x d n of the value of a point f x given the value of the previous n points d n the conditional probability is itself a normal distribution its parameters are given by 2 f x d n n μ n x σ n x 3 μ n x m x k x x k x x 1 y m x 4 σ n x k x x k x x k x x 1 k x x where y is the vector of observed evaluations y k f x k or y k f x k ϵ k in the case of noisy evaluations with iid noise ϵ k n 0 σ 2 k x x is a column vector in k x x k k x k x k x x is the transpose vector and given the covariance k used to model the objective function k x x σ n is the covariance matrix associated with dataset d n the quality of the interpolation practically depends on the choice between functions m and k in encoding the assumption on the behavior especially the smoothness degree of the modeled function f x frequently the covariance alone is sufficiently powerful to model the entire function hence a common choice is to set m x 0 nonetheless the choice of covariance function k x x cannot be avoided and constitutes one of the modeling building blocks for the gaussian process regression and in turn the bayesian optimization the use of an online regression method that allows for the incorporation of previously seen data to the decision of the next query provides the method its bayesian qualification equation 2 is regarded as the bayes theorem for the case of a conditional distribution f x d n of the value of the next point f x based on the known values of the previous points d n f x 1 f x 2 f x n the concept behind improving the vanilla black box methods is to leverage the additional information from the interpolation and minimize an analytical function built upon the conditional probability p f x d n the associated function is usually referred to as acquisition function of bayesian optimization a i x d n it constitutes the other building block for the algorithm based on the acquisition function it is possible to determine the next candidate for evaluation by finding the maximum of the acquisition function x n 1 argmax a i x d n moreover by crafting the appropriate acquisition function the sequence can be made to converge to the global minimum if the original function interpolation μ n x m x k x x k x x 1 y m x is sufficiently close to the objective function f x the global minimum can be found by simply running a gradient based optimization directly over μ n x again this is typically not the case because the information is insufficient as a result of the small number of evaluations the alternative to direct interpolation optimization is to optimize functions that encode information in the best places to search for the improvement over the previously seen points writing x argmin x x 1 x 2 x n f x as the best from the already evaluated points two common choices for the acquisition functions can be constructed these are typically called probability of improvement kushner 1964 and expected improvement mockus et al 1978 the choice expressed in the probability of improvement poi entails the computation of the function 5 pi x p f x f x d n φ f x μ n x σ n x where φ is the cumulative distribution function for the unit gaussian distribution i e the normalized error function the caveat to this choice is that it is a pure exploitation method that is the sequences generated from this acquisition function will prioritize points that have a high probability of improvement even if such enhancement is very small an approach to eliminate this problem is to introduce a hedge parameter sometimes called jitter to eq 5 i e 6 pi x p f x f x ξ d n φ f x ξ μ n x σ n x parameter ξ allows pi x to be used as an acquisition function for a global optimization method by balancing exploration and exploitation it might be necessary to adjust ξ dynamically a common recommendation is starting with a large ξ and shrinking it during the evolution of the optimization in this way ξ would behave as the temperature parameter in the algorithm of simulated annealing the expected improvement ei which considers not only the probability of improvement but also the extent of improvement relative to uncertainty is typically the common choice this allows for some unknown points in which the probability of improvement is low and yet uncertainty is high to be considered augmenting the exploratory capability of the method the original function proposed by mockus et al 1978 is defined as follows 8 ei x e max 0 f x ξ f x d n f x ξ μ n x φ z σ n x ϕ z σ n x 0 0 σ n x 0 where e d n denotes the expected value conditioned to the a posteriori distribution p f x d n in which z f x μ n x ξ σ n x is the z score corrected by the best observed value and the jitter is included an acquisition function based on maximizing the expected improvement produces the next point to be evaluated by solving the optimization problem 9 x n 1 argmax x a ei x argmax x a e max 0 f x f x ξ d n such an optimization problem can be solved by a gradient based method such as newton raphson or bfgs method because ei x for any given fixed d n is an analytical function with a readily computable gradient a common choice is using the l bfgs b version of the bfgs method in the case of ei x the acquisition function balances exploitation in which the improvement is expressed in the first term f x μ n x ξ and exploration encoded in the second term size σ n x which is large in unexplored regions as previously mentioned there are several options for the acquisition functions such as lower confidence bound knowledge gradient entropy search and multi step optimal acquisition therefore similar to the covariance function which is necessary for a successful regression the choice of acquisition function is extremely important for a successful optimization in the absence of noise pi and ei are the two most common choices because both have a more straightforward implementation and they produce results that are mostly equivalent to the other acquisition function in this scenario given these two main building blocks the gp regression and acquisition function the overall structure of bayesian optimization is described in algorithm 1 it is important to note that bayesian optimization is an iterative algorithm in which each iteration is comprised of a step that incorporates data from previous steps and a second step that contains a non convex optimization problem of an analytic function based on previously observed data in this sense each step attempts to produce the next smartest point to be queried in practice this is accomplished by running a gradient based optimization algorithm e g l bfgs b on multiple randomly selected restart points this allows the search of several local minima of the acquisition function the best is used as the next query point as an alternative choosing more than one local minima for investigation provides a possible parallelization path to the algorithm the basic version described in algorithm 1 can be organically extended to include black box constraints into the bayesian setting using the technique probability of feasibility which is described in section 2 2 some works extend the bayesian optimization framework to handle multi objective optimizations couckuyt et al 2014 because of the interpolation provided by the gaussian process the main caveat of the method is the necessity of solving the linear systems k x x 1 y and k x x 1 k x x which can be of complexity o n 3 in a naïve implementation where n is the number of data points this is typically not a problem even in this case because the aim is to use the smallest number of data points possible hence they usually remain less than 1 0 4 points in these dataset sizes matrix inversion does not constitute a problem for modern day computers especially when compared to the evaluation of the objective function and constraints nevertheless approaches to circumvent this steep computational cost increase with the number of points and dimensionality have been proposed these include the use of sparse gaussian processes mcintire et al 2016 deep neural networks snoek et al 2015 projection models li et al 2016 and additive models kandasamy et al 2015 2 2 probability of feasibility the method of the probability of feasibility developed initially by schonlau 1997 and after that by gardner et al 2014 and gelbart et al 2014 implements constraints to the bayesian optimization through the acquisition function starting from the ei acquisition example if one was able to exactly write the constraint in a problem subjected to a constraint of the form c x 0 the constrained acquisition function would be written as follows 10 e i c x h c x 0 e max 0 f x f x ξ d n δ x ei x where h is the heaviside step function 1 and 0 for non negative and negative arguments respectively as mentioned in section 1 it might not be feasible to exactly track where the constraint is satisfied this motivates treating the black box constraints similar to the objective function i e modeling using a gaussian process c x gp m c x k c x x in which data for the constraint on the first n points is d n c c x 1 c x 2 c x n in this approach similar to the objective function the constraint is treated as a random variable this transforms δ x into a bernoulli random variable this is implemented by calculating the probability of the constraint being satisfied at any given point as given by the following expression 12 e δ x d n c p c x 0 d n c 0 p c x d n c d c x μ n c 2 σ n c d z 1 π e z 2 φ μ n c 2 σ n c pf x therefore the full acquisition function for the constrained problem is ei c x e δ x max 0 f x f x ξ d n d n c pf x ei x this is of special interest for the present work because although the objective function is relatively simple the constraints are extremely complex since they result from finite element simulations on flexible riser dynamics multiple constraints can be extended by multiplication p f x k 1 n c p c k x 0 d k n c k 1 n c φ μ k n c x 2 σ k n c x which indicates that each constraint is handled separately 3 case study because the lazy wave and crhd configurations are designed for deep waters and harsh environments in this research two cases of lazy wave configuration with different water depth ranges are investigated the third case focuses on the crhd configuration in all cases a rigid steel riser is considered according to the properties listed in table 1 the horizontal projection that represents the horizontal distance from the floating production storage and offloading fpso unit and the wellhead is 2861 m in all cases the loads are those that produce the worst results in terms of stress distribution along the riser under all the combinations of environmental conditions waves and currents these are analyzed through an extreme load assessment a triangular velocity profile represents the sea current with a maximum of 1 15 m s at the surface the simulation time is equivalent to two wave periods with a build up period of a single wave and spans a total of three wave periods 37 23 s table 2 summarizes the fpso motion imposed to the riser s top end 3 1 operational constraints the constraints are based on operational and structural criteria which are obtained through finite element simulations on different riser configurations for the crhd configuration the minimum vertical clearance from the seabed to the deepest damper section fig 3 c m i n is above 10 m this is to prevent any riser section equipped with dampers from touching the seabed furthermore for the crhd design the total length of the riser should not exceed the sum of the water depth and horizontal projection this avoids a slack pipeline at the tdz neither of these two restrictions is applied to the slwr designs for both the crhd and slwr designs the top angle at the point where the riser connects to the floating unit should lie in the interval θ θ m i n θ m a x this constraint prevents increased suspended lengths that could limit the presence of other supporting vessels and induce larger stresses as a structural constraint pipe members subjected to bending moment and effective tension shall satisfy the combined loading criteria clc defined by offshore standard dnvgl st f201 det norske veritas as 2018 as follows 13 γ s c γ m m d m k 1 p i p 0 p b 2 t e t k 2 p i p o p b 2 1 if p i p o γ s

slwr configuration two scenarios with different water depths are investigated 1200 and 2150 m the riser is represented similarly with those reported in previous works such as in vieira et al 2008 with three different sections and buoyancy modules considered in the intermediate section l 2 only three parameters must be determined to define a buoyancy module diameter d f length l f and spacing between the modules sp these six parameters define the riser s configuration and are chosen as the design variables of the optimization problem as shown in fig 2 the variation range of each variable is listed in table 3 the buoyancy module s specific weight is 750 kg m 3 and the design variable lower bounds allow the buoyancy module diameter to be equal to the outer diameter of the steel riser or its length to be equal to zero these cases imply a non existent buoyancy module leading to a free hanging catenary configuration the operational constraints are listed in table 4 3 3 catenary riser with hydrodynamic dampers in the crhd configuration the riser is installed at a water depth of 2150 m the riser is divided into 11 steel pipe segments five of these have low density coatings that are appropriate for the hds previous studies suggest that five is the ideal number of segments for hydrodynamic dampers brito et al 2017 the crhd is defined in the study of aguiar et al 2010 the input variables of the optimization of the crhd configuration are as follows length of five sections with dampers l2 l4 l6 l8 and l10 length of section spacing between adjacent dampers l3 l5 l7 and l9 and length of the top and bottom sections of the riser l1 and l11 respectively as shown in fig 3 the variation ranges of each previously described design variable are listed in table 5 the physical properties of hydrodynamic dampers thickness and density are summarized in table 6 in terms of boundary conditions the base of the riser anchor is fixed to the seabed and the top is connected to the fpso i e the movements of the floating unit are transferred to the top of the riser the operational constraints are listed in table 7 4 methodology this study aims to verify the application of bayesian optimization as a consistent and competitive optimization method compared to commonly found methods in riser literature the chosen methods are compared based on the speed they can consistently find a desired minimum the speed is measured based on the number of objective function evaluations bayesian optimization is compared with the commercial code midaco schlueter et al 2013 globalized bounded nelder mead gbnm and genetic algorithm ga midaco uses a modified version of the ant colony optimization schlueter et al 2009 which includes a penalty method named the oracle penalty schlueter and gerdts 2010 to handle constraints recalling the optimization problem formulation in eq 1 the objective is to find an optimal x vector of design variables for steel lazy wave risers slwr this vector components are the normalized sections lengths and the parameters that specify the buoyancy modules and for catenary risers with hydrodynamic dampers crhd are the lengths of the sections with and without dampers for slwr the dimensionality is n 7 and for crhd the dimensionality is n 11 a realistic configuration can range from a few parameters up to more than ten realistic multi line systems can have up to several dozen dimensions which would represent a very challenging problem the configuration space can have section lengths and buoy geometry as separate dimensions however only section lengths contribute to the objective function for the crhd configuration described in section 3 3 given that all dimensions correspond to riser section lengths the number of sections is n l 11 for the length of section i given by x i l i u i the objective function is a normalized notion of riser length given by the following 14 f x i 0 n l 1 x i l i i 0 n l 1 u i l i for the slwr configuration described in section 3 2 n l 3 because the latter three variables do not correspond to riser section lengths these correspond to relatively simple objective functions which are not particularly difficult to optimize however the practical difficulty lies in handling the constraints and not the objective function although several factors such as pipe material and installation method impact the final cost of the riser the amount of pipe necessary for the riser configuration is a good basis for the cost estimate in this sense the riser length is the objective function to be minimized in the three proposed cases the problem is that extremely short riser can lead to increased stresses in design that in turn can violate the structural integrity criteria therefore to comply with different goals the proper handling of constraints is of utmost importance the constraints are of the form g k x a k or g k x a k converted to the form g k x g k x a k a k 0 and g k x a k g k x a k 0 the constraints explored in section 3 1 include feasibility of the configuration the lower and upper limits on the top angle and maximum effective load for both types of risers for the crhd configuration two extra constraints are considered one related to the minimum clearance on the first hydro damper and another for the maximum value of the total riser length 5 results the performance comparison among all the four algorithms is summarized in table 8 which reports the best cases for each algorithm regarding the slwr case in both water depths the optima configuration found by the four optimization methods present nonzero buoyancy module lengths which is reasonable since otherwise it would result in free hanging catenaries instead of lazy waves in a scenario of high amplitude heave motion on the riser top such as in harsh environments and deep waters free hanging catenary risers would present unfeasible values for the structural integrity criterion clc in the touchdown zone for the crhd case the found optima configurations present fairly similar results regarding the riser lengths and structural behavior the dampers are able to attenuate the tensions on the touchdown zone which is the most critical with respect to the clc values for further discussion regarding the crhd configuration see cardoso et al 2019 three dimensional visualizations of the optima found by each of the optimization methods are presented in figs 4 to 6 finding riser configurations that satisfy all constraints is not an easy task as shown in table 8 regarding the failure ga to comply with the top angle constraint for the slwr configurations the use of optimization is the best way to consistently find feasible configurations which if done manually would usually require compromising in the value of the objective function such as the riser length it is observed that the overall performance of bayesian optimization is comparable to the commercial code midaco with the best found parameters selected for both there is also a distinct performance gap between the first two and the last two algorithms in which more than 1000 objective function evaluations were necessary to obtain a good result the results obtained here are in a good agreement with those presented by nascimento vieira et al 2009 it is noteworthy that the ga which is the first go to algorithm for several engineering optimization problems is found to have the worst performance by a considerable margin both bayesian optimization and midaco provide an improvement of at least ten times that of the ga for riser design problems this shows that the choice of algorithm is extremely important and can represent the difference in terms of time or resource between the feasibility or infeasibility of a given test it should also be noted that even when considerably more function evaluations are used the ga does not necessarily produce solutions that satisfy all constraints two cases violate the maximum top angle constraint from a practical perspective the results in table 8 shows that the bayesian optimization algorithm provides an open source alternative to midaco hence it is more accessible for the slwr configuration which is most commonly employed for riser systems in ultra deepwater environments the performance of the bayesian optimization algorithm is significantly better than that of the midaco code even if the early stopping criterion used for it is factored in for engineering design teams this represents the possibility of running optimization algorithms in the daily routine of riser design with relatively modest computational resources regarding the convergence behavior for both bayesian optimization and midaco the results can be seen in fig 7 we observe a relatively quick convergence between 20 and 60 iterations for slwr to obtain a good configuration and around 100 to 200 iterations for crhd which is compatible with the results presented in table 8 it is important to mention that the normalization of both design variables and constraints plays a crucial role in the performance of the bo method the gp regression is based on kernel functions that usually assume that the data being interpolated has zero mean and unitary variance if non normalized values are used in the interpolation the regression can and usually will produce a poor approximation for the desired functions directly affecting the optimization process also by using a relatively short to medium range covariance function behavior implied by the gp regression is that there are no fat tails on the data the normalization of the objective function and the re scaling of the constraints solve this compatibility with the gp regression for the specific case of the clc the normalization the logarithm addresses the problem of fat tails which can interfere with the interpolation due to order of magnitude difference between values of clc in some configurations not normalizing the data can sometimes work but it will do so much more slowly than when the data is normalized another solution to this problem would be to adjust the values σ and ρ on the matérn 5 2 covariance function this should be made differently for each variable which would essentially be equivalent to normalize the variables before using it in the interpolation scheme the implementation of this approach is more involved because it requires crafting a non standard kernel function by multiplying kernels with different parameters the normalization scheme used in this work was enough to obtain convergence and good performance for all three cases presented the results related to total execution times are shown in fig 8 a it can be observed that the aggregate objective function evaluation time is considerably higher than the proposal time for the bo algorithm as expected moreover even without any parallelization strategy the bo can compete with midaco in the slwr configurations which are the most important for industrial use the average time to run the simulation remains more or less constant as a function of the step of the loop whereas the time to suggest the next point increases although it remains below the average simulation times this is the expected behavior of the bo as the number of points used to create the gp regression which is necessary to generate the acquisition function increases the overall time is dominated by the simulation which is considered good it could even be better if more numerous or complicated simulations are required like that in the case with multiple loading cases nevertheless the possibility that the proposal time can become exceedingly large for the next point impends this can pose a problem for the scalability of the algorithm for extremely large problems 6 discussion in this work we proposed applying the bayesian optimization algorithm in the search for optimal riser configurations among the selected problems and methods bayesian optimization exhibited the most efficient performance in finding optimal solutions for steel lazy wave risers in the 1200 m and 2150 m respectively such type of configuration is the most common configuration employed in ultra deepwater and harsh environments it is worth reiterating that the optimization of riser configurations presented in this work does not represent the complete design of a rigid riser further detailed analyses would be required such as fatigue interference and vortex induced vibration notwithstanding the optimization methods presented notably bo could be adopted in the riser detailed design activities due to its computational efficiency this substantiates the competitiveness of the bayesian optimization algorithm for solving traditional engineering problems even when compared with state of the art evolutionary algorithms the settings used to perform the bayesian optimization algorithm are close to standard recommendations found in the literature this indicates a potential for tuning the bo for specific riser design problems in the future it is presumed that possible algorithmic improvements can be achieved by combining multiple acquisition functions with different trade offs and by intelligently choosing the best algorithm at any given step hoffman et al 2011 the two best performing cases are achieved within a 1 h execution time using a modest desktop computer with six physical cores in terms of time and cost the foregoing resources are considerably affordable moreover apart from such benefits other potential gains remain it is further presumed that there are considerably substantial potential gains from extending the available computing capability to typical technique users currently commercial cloud environments can provide practically unlimited computing power particularly for capacity tasks similar to those presented in this work the results of this study could be used in conjunction with local resources to execute hybrid local remote computing loads at relatively low costs this is because the execution model of bayesian optimization can be easily adapted to this type of software architecture kandasamy et al 2018 pokuri et al 2018 recently cloud apis for bayesian optimization have also been available in the form of services mind foundry 2018 golovin et al 2017 the execution times for both the bo and midaco demonstrate that although there remains room for improvement the bo is a competitive alternative to midaco in terms of sheer performance for this type of optimization problem the worst case for the bo is that the crhd remains substantially dominated by simulation time which can be improved by implementing parallel simulations similar to that implemented in midaco the best output which is the optimization of the 1200 m slwr exhibits the importance of the number of function evaluations the serial implementation of bo demonstrates that it can match or even outperform the parallel midaco implementation timings this also provides an overview of time scales that are attainable in cases with larger problems and with the possibility of running realistic cases within a day using relatively modest computer hardware in the past few years the combination of machine learning methods with typical simulation and numerical methods revolutionized in several areas such as active control computer vision life sciences and engineering learning techniques are becoming more actively used in solving oil and gas problems it is anticipated that investigations such as the present study which uses machine learning assisted methodologies can be more actively utilized by engineers for their daily work it is presumed that this study effectively demonstrates the potential of such techniques for their application to real life global optimization problems in riser design 7 conclusions this work demonstrated that bayesian optimization in conjunction with finite element simulation codes is an efficient method to provide optimal riser configurations that can be used in real world scenarios the performance obtained by the bayesian optimization method allows it to be used as a standard tool in the daily routine for riser design its considerable optimization efficiency with a minimal number of function evaluations makes it possible to optimize preliminary designs in a standard desktop environment this could represent a shift in the perspective on the development of preliminary riser designs and prototyping in production environments at the very least a

implementation details dynamic analysis which is necessary for the evaluation of engineering constraints is performed using the orcaflex program orcina ltd 2019 this program is the industry standard software package for nonlinear static and dynamic analyses of offshore marine systems in the time and frequency domains the optimization process is performed in python scripting for bayesian optimization bo genetic algorithm ga and globalized bounded nelder mead gbnm by calling the orcaflex python api the midaco schlueter et al 2013 results are obtained using its c api and the corresponding orcaflex c api for the genetic algorithm the distributed evolutionary algorithm in python fortin et al 2012 a standard library for evolutionary optimization algorithms for the python programming language is used the implementation described in cardoso et al 2019 is adopted for the gbnm bayesian optimization is conducted by the gpyopt library the gpyopt authors 2016 and the actual application is written using jupyter notebooks thomas et al 2016 an extension to the library mentioned above is developed to implement the probability of feasibility black box constraint handling as described in section 2 2 gpyopt is an open source library that implements the bayesian optimization algorithm in python under the bsd 3 clause license which makes it easily available for commercial use in all cases each point generated by the optimization code is converted into a riser configuration the case analyses are performed using orcaflex api the simulation result is then processed to obtain the maximum and minimum top angles with the maximum value of the combined loading criterion described in section 3 1 the crhd also requires maximum length and minimum clearance constraints the feasibility or non feasibility of the solution is also handled as a separate constraint over the configuration space all variables involved in the bayesian optimization are re scaled to be of order 1 the design variables are computed in the interval x 0 1 and converted to x through x i u i l i x i l i therefore normalizing the design variable with respect to the gpyopt library the objective function is already normalized with the exception of the clc the constraints are re scaled according to the formulas g k x g k x a k a k 0 and g k x a k g k x a k 0 so to keep the values around 1 the clc is re scaled by setting c c l c log 10 clc which is positive in the range clc 1 the normalization for the constraints is necessary to allow for a proper interpolation using the gp regression for bayesian optimization the algorithm is initialized with 50 function evaluations for both slwr configurations that follow latin hypercube sampling mckay et al 1979 on the configuration space it is 0 1 6 in this case for the crhd configurations initialization is also performed using latin hypercube sampling but with 150 points on a configuration space 0 1 11 this requires more points to initialize than the slwr because it is of higher dimensionality the initialization strategy is found to be considerably important for the bo when the performances of latin hypercube initialization against random initialization and sobol sequence sobol 1967 initialization are compared both perform considerably worse than latin hypercube which is the standard recommended initialization method found in the literature related to bayesian optimization the expected improvement acquisition function used is that described in eq 8 the constraint handling is done using the p f x function defined in eq 12 for each operational constraint the main loop of the optimization is iterated 200 times for the crhd case and 65 times for the slwr configurations these numbers are found to be the smallest to obtain considerably good minima that are consistent with all constraints therefore they provide the reference number of evaluations that the algorithm requires to find a good minimum the interpolation kernel utilized is the matérn 5 2 covariance function which is the standard kernel in the gpyopt library it is given by k x x c 5 2 r x x σ 2 1 5 r ρ 5 r 2 3 ρ 2 exp 5 r ρ where σ 2 is the variance and ρ is the length scale of the kernel we attempted to use the exponential kernel σ 2 exp r ρ and gaussian kernel σ 2 exp r 2 2 ρ 2 however in our tests both exhibited worse performances than the matérn 5 2 kernel moreover it is tested by running the optimization with different length scales ρ 1 1 2 1 3 1 10 it yields approximately the same results regardless of the length scale utilized as previously mentioned the objective function lies in the interval 0 f x 1 the jitter parameter ξ 2 5 1 0 4 is utilized for the expected improvement acquisition the midaco code has several stopping criteria to be selected by the user for this study evalstop 100 is chosen as the stopping criterion this means that until the current solution does not further improve the midaco can perform its optimization for 100 consecutive function evaluations by default the code considers a solution feasible if a constraint is violated by no more than 10 3 however to improve the algorithm accuracy this number is reduced to 10 7 all other parameters are set to default values which are found in the midaco user manual schlueter and munetomo 2013 the parameters used for the gbnm algorithm are set as follows any randomly generated simplex can have a length between 5 and 10 of any domain size in any direction the coefficients related to the nelder mead algorithm are set to standard values of α 1 0 β 0 5 γ 2 0 and δ 0 5 as employed in cardoso et al 2019 in which α β γ and δ correspond to the simplex s reflection contraction expansion and shrinkage operations coefficients respectively the chosen expansion value is α g 1 0 2 which covers 20 of the domain in case it is within one standard deviation away from the mean the maximum number of iterations for each restart of the nelder mead algorithm is limited to 120 objective function evaluations with an extension of up to 150 evaluations in case the violation of constraints is less than 3 the number of restarts to consistently obtain good minima is found to be 20 which is adopted in this study it is important to note that these values may vary according to the problem being investigated the penalization of the solution is conducted through the augmented lagrangian method whose initial parameters are set to λ 1000 and μ 1000 in which λ and μ are the lagrange multiplier and the penalty parameter for the problem respectively these are updated whenever there is convergence with solutions that violate constraints the genetic algorithm is performed using a population of 200 individuals over 35 generations for all three cases based on the work of nascimento vieira et al 2009 the selection criterion is implemented in a tournament manner in which trios of individuals are randomly selected and the most suitable individual is selected the number of times the tournament is implemented is equal to the population in this way 200 new candidates for mating possibly with repetitions are produced for every two candidates an 80 crossover probability is applied with a two point crossover in the genes the probability of one of the sired descendants to suffer an additional mutation is 10 which is implemented as a normal zero average random number added to the value of the gene the stopping criterion is based on the standard deviation of the fitness value over the population it should be lower than 1 or after 35 generations in terms of the aptitude function a penalized version of the objective function using the augmented lagrangian method is used the parameters are set to μ 1000 and λ 1000 which are the same as those used for the gbnm method although not the focus of this study the performance considerations related to the acceleration of code execution are included the ga and midaco implement block parallelization in which the evaluation of each generation or step is performed in parallel at the population level using python multiprocessing for ga and openmp openmp architecture review board 2008 for midaco the gbnm code is parallelized by implementing a master slave architecture which is an asynchronous load balancing strategy at the simplex restart level the mpi4py library dalcín et al 2005 2008 dalcin et al 2011 which is a python interface for the mpi communication protocol is used for the parallelization such parallelization strategy is not readily applicable for the bo at the time of this work however it supports both synchronous and asynchronous parallelization strategies wang et al 2016 kandasamy et al 2018 the execution environment for bayesian optimization and midaco codes is a desktop core i7 8700 six cores 3 2 ghz and 16 gb of ddr4 with all executions performed in a cpu and without gpu acceleration for any of the codes for the gbnm and ga codes in addition to the core i7 8700 it was also utilized a dual socket xeon e5 2650v4 with 2 12 cores 2 2 ghz and 128 gb of ddr4 memory which is not used by either bo or midaco
