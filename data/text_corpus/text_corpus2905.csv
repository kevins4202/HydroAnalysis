which may be tapped for food cosmetics and pharmaceutical applications recovery of these compounds from distillery wastewater could thus lead to products of commercial interest while improving the conventional biological anaerobic treatment step three processes viz ultrafiltration uf adsorption desorption and solvent extraction were investigated for antioxidants recovery from distillery wastewater and selected fractions were subjected to biomethanation anaerobic digestion the effect of different adsorbents and solvents as well as operational parameters on antioxidants recovery was

antioxidants fraction is required to ascertain the content of specific commercially viable polyphenols keywords sugarcane molasses distillery wastewater antioxidants recovery ultrafiltration adsorption desorption solvent extraction biomethanation 1 introduction sugarcane molasses based alcohol distilleries generate 7 15 l effluent l alcohol that is characterized by high chemical oxygen demand cod of 80 000 1 40 000 mg l and biochemical oxygen demand bod of 40 000 65 000 mg l low ph and intense brown color 1 the dark color is imparted by complex compounds like melanoidins caramel polyphenols as well as carotenoids chlorophyll anthocyanins tannins etc that are recalcitrant difficult to biodegrade and inhibit biological activity 2 4 owing to the high cod bod ratio 1 11 1 25 5 biomethanation anaerobic digestion with biogas generation is conventionally employed as the primary treatment step however anaerobic conditions cause the melanoidins color to intensify 6 making decolourization of the effluent even more difficult melanoidins are formed through maillard reaction between sugars and amino acids in the sugar manufacturing process they are a key component in sugarcane molasses used for ethanol production melanoidins are difficult to characterize due to their varying sizes and types of sugars and amino acids involved in their formation there has been extensive work on degradation and removal of melanoidins from biomethanated molasses distillery effluent exploring both biological 7 8 4 and physico chemical methods 9 10 other options such as microbial fuel cell for electricity generation have also been tested with distillery wastewater diluted with sewage 11 it is established that phenolic compounds in wastewater are major contributors to toxicity and antibacterial activity 12 13 limiting its microbial degradability melanoidins isolated from various sources have shown antimicrobial activity against different microbial species 14 15 in molasses distillery wastewater polyphenols are present in lower concentration 7467 mg l compared to melanoidins 16 600 g l 16 however at a given concentration the polyphenols exhibit higher antimicrobial effect than melanoidins 4 presence of polyphenols above 1 g l is known to inhibit methanogenesis 17 thereby negatively affecting cod removal and methane production therefore removal of melanoidins and polyphenols prior to rather than after biomethanation would be more appropriate melanoidins and polyphenols obtained from various sources exhibit useful biological effects besides antioxidant and antimicrobial properties melanoidins obtained from coffee brews etc and polyphenols obtained from artichoke kiwifruit juice apple waste etc have shown antihypertensive 14 18 anti inflammatory 19 anticarcinogenic 20 21 and antiglycative 22 properties these properties make melanoidins and polyphenols valuable for food cosmetics and pharmaceutical applications thus the recovery of these compounds from natural botanic sources and agro industrial wastewaters becomes of interest several approaches have been investigated for isolation of melanoidins and polyphenols synthetic

simbhaoli sugars limited u p india the mixture was incubated at 35 c cod and biogas composition was measured on 25th day 45th day and 65th day of biomethanation process overall cod reduction after antioxidants recovery and biomethanation was calculated for all samples the normalized cod reduction was reported as per eqn 4 4 normalized cod reduction codo codbm codo where codo is initial cod of as is distillery wastewater before antioxidants recovery and codbm is cod of sample after biomethanation 2 4 analytical procedures melanoidins content g l was determined spectrophotometrically at 475

and the detector were 100 c 50 c and 150 c respectively all the experiments were done in triplicate under similar conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 ultrafiltration of distillery wastewater the properties of high and low molecular weight distillery wastewater fractions obtained through serial uf are summarized in table 2 separation of the antioxidants took place by size exclusion the high molecular weight fraction retained on 100 kda membrane showed highest antioxidant activity 245 mm with correspondingly high melanoidins 74 066 g l and polyphenols 52 g l content the antioxidant activity of the 100 kda fraction is around 5 fold higher than that of the 100 kda and 10 kda fractions which shows similar values the antioxidant compounds are thus spread over a wide molecular weight range but the activity is concentrated mostly in the high molecular weight 100 kda fraction 3 2 solid phase extraction of distillery wastewater using resins fig 1 a shows normalized solid phase concentration of melanoidins and polyphenols for different resins xad16 showed maximum solid phase concentration 0 78 for melanoidins and polyphenols closely followed by fpx66 0 7 xad7 and fpa98cl showed relatively lower selective adsorption for the antioxidants the adsorption capacity of xad16 was 27 g g dry weight melanoidins and 38 mg g dry weight polyphenols similarly fpx66 showed high adsorption capacity of 28 g g dry weight for melanoidins and 25 mg g dry weight for polyphenols fig 1b the large particle size of xad16 and fpx66 resins table 1 may have contributed to high rate of mass exchange between the solid and the liquid phases thereby facilitating the transportation of the antioxidants resins with larger particle sizes tend to have higher mass exchange rates and allow more material to be transferred to and from the resin 42 desorption of antioxidants from the resins using acidified ethanol resulted in 66 melanoidins and 85 polyphenols recovery for xad16 and 16 melanoidins and 54 polyphenols recovery for fpx66 fig 1c antioxidant activity was correspondingly higher for fraction recovered with xad16 192 mm teac compared to that obtained with fpx66 10 mm teac owing to higher recovery and antioxidant activity achieved with xad16 further studies were done with this resin the results over five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles is shown in fig 1d melanoidins and polyphenols content as adsorbed mass g co ce x v and desorbed mass g cd v in each cycle indicates that the adsorbed melanoidins content in each cycle decreased steadily from 383 g in c1 to 298 g in c5 while the desorbed mass remained approximately the same in all the 5 cycles 260 g thus for melanoidins the decrease in the adsorption efficiency was about 25 from the initial value till the end of 5 cycles fig 1d in the case of polyphenols 400 mg was adsorbed in the first cycle while the adsorption decreased by only 9 at the end of 5th cycle nearly complete desorption of polyphenols was observed the results indicate high efficiency of xad16 for recovery of antioxidants from distillery wastewater the effect of varying contact time 2 h to 8 h and temperature 25 c 35 c 45 c on adsorption of melanoidins m25 m35 m45 and polyphenols p25 p35 p45 using xad16 indicated that equilibrium was attained within 2 h at all the temperatures studied fig 1f 3 3 solvent extraction of distillery wastewater fig 2 a shows the normalized concentration of melanoidins and polyphenols for different solvents solvent to wastewater ratio of 2 1 highest extraction of melanoidins and polyphenols was obtained with the most polar solvent mek followed by mibk higher solvent polarity favors extraction of melanoidins and polyphenols in the organic phase increasing the solvent concentration improved the phase separation for melanoidins fig 2b mek and mibk outperformed all other solvents and exhibited maximum melanoidins separation at solvent wastewater ratio of 4 1 almost similar trend was obtained for polyphenols separation fig 2c the antioxidant activity of the mek extracted fraction was higher than that of other solvents for all the solvent wastewater ratios studied fig 2d the antioxidant activity increased from 85 mm teac for 1 1 ratio of mek wastewater to 100 mm teac for the higher ratios of 3 1 4 1 and 6 1 for subsequent experiments mek wastewater ratio of 4 1 was used 3 4 comparison of antioxidant recovery processes fig 3 summarizes the antioxidant compounds recovery from distillery wastewater by uf adsorption desorption and solvent extraction significant antioxidant activity 245 mm was obtained in 100 kda uf fraction followed by the fraction obtained through adsorption desorption 192 mm fractions recovered through solvent extraction showed relatively lower antioxidant activity 113 mm to further purify the antioxidant fractions from 100 kda uf retentate serial extraction was performed with mek 4 1 cumulative antioxidant activity of 155 mm was obtained in the organic phase after two consecutive extractions further it was observed that the concentration of melanoidins 980 g l and polyphenols 1550 mg l in the aqueous phase remaining after distillery wastewater adsorption through xad16 was nearly an order of magnitude lower than the content in the aqueous phase obtained by mek solvent extraction 11 933 g l melanoidins and 12 108 mg l polyphenols this establishes adsorption through xad16 as a more effective option for recovering antioxidant compounds from distillery wastewater however antioxidant compounds in distillery wastewater constitute a complex mixture so each recovered fraction would be characterized by a specific composition hence further analysis is required to understand which of these fractions are enriched in specific commercially viable polyphenols 3 5 biomethanation of distillery wastewater after antioxidants recovery different distillery wastewater samples after antioxidants recovery were subjected to biomethanation the initial cod content of each sample varied depending upon the antioxidant recovery process uf adsorption or solvent extraction from which it was obtained fig 4 a shows the normalized cod reduction and the corresponding ch4 content in the generated biogas on days 25 45 and 65 of the biomethanation process compared to 45 cod reduction after 45th day in the control sample the cod reduction was more than 60 in samples r uf10 and uf100 in 25 days sample r shows 74 cod reduction after 45 days of the biomethanation process high cod reduction indicates ultrafiltration uf10 and xad16 adsorption r are better methods for antioxidants separation from distillery wastewater than solvent extraction process further fig 4b shows that ch4 content of the control sample was 23 after 25 days and reached a maximum of 51 after 65 days of biomethanation however after separation of the antioxidants ch4 content rapidly increased to 48 for uf10 sample and 70 for r sample on 25th day of the biomethanation process thus removal of recalcitrant difficult to biodegrade compounds facilitated the biomethanation process antimicrobial effect of melanoidins is attributed to inhibition of enzymes involved in the breakdown of proteins 15 or chelating with metals like fe zn cu that are essential for microbial growth 43 the radical of reduced metal in the complex can tear the dna strands thereby resulting in genotoxicity in microbes further polyphenols owing to their structure and lipophilicity can disrupt the bacterial cell membranes causing the cell contents nucleus proteins and inorganic ions to diffuse out 44 some polyphenols in molasses distillery wastewater have been reported to adversely affect microbial growth 45 47 the aqueous fraction from mek extraction se showed lower cod removal and ch4 content compared to the control sample after 65 days fig 4a this could be due to the presence of residual mek in the aqueous phase which inhibited the biomethanation of aqueous phase se sample this indicates that though removal of antioxidant compounds facilitates the biomethanation process the antioxidants recovery method affects the biomethanation performance combination of ultrafiltration and biomethanation as shown in uf100 and uf10 shows high cod reduction and ch4 generation however low permeance 10 10 9 m3 m2s kpa through 100 kda membrane and 5 10 9 m3 m2s kpa through 10 kda membrane would limit the throughput requiring correspondingly large filtration area that would translate to high cost of membranes adsorption using xad16 followed by biomethanation appears more promising owing to its high cod reduction and high ch4 generation in a short span of 25 days following desorption with acidified ethanol the resin can be used repeatedly as shown over 5 adsorption desorption cycles further investigations are required to understand the composition of the recovered antioxidant fractions for the presence of specific commercially viable polyphenols 4 conclusions antioxidants melanoidins and polyphenols present in sugarcane distillery wastewater can be recovered using uf adsorption desorption or solvent extraction the recovery was as follows uf through 100 kda 245 mm teac adsorption on xad16 resin followed by desorption with acidified ethanol 192 mm teac solvent extraction with mek 113 mm teac further investigations are required to understand the composition of the recovered antioxidant fractions for the presence of specific commercially viable polyphenols biomethanation of the wastewater after antioxidants removal was improved and adsorption on xad16 was best among the tested options hence for improving the conventional anaerobic facility in sugarcane molasses distilleries adsorption on xad16 prior to biomethanation seems a promising option acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge support under the water4crops project bt in eu 06spw 2012 from department of biotechnology ministry of science and technology

as is distillery wastewater before antioxidants recovery and codbm is cod of sample after biomethanation 2 4 analytical procedures melanoidins content g l was determined spectrophotometrically at 475

acid l antioxidant activity expressed as trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity teac was measured in terms of radical scavenging activity by abts assay 40 using trolox 150 1150 μm as the calibration standard a mixture of 7 mm abts stock solution and 2 45 mm potassium persulphate was allowed to stand in dark at room temperature for 12 16 h to generate abts the abts was diluted with 5 mm pbs at ph

stainless steel column 2 m 2 mm id nucon india and a thermal conductivity detector tcd ar was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 5 ml min the operating temperatures of the injection port oven and the detector were 100 c 50 c and 150 c respectively all the experiments were done in triplicate under similar conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 ultrafiltration of distillery wastewater the properties of high and low molecular weight distillery wastewater fractions obtained through serial uf are summarized in table 2 separation of the antioxidants took place by size exclusion the high molecular weight fraction retained on 100 kda membrane showed highest antioxidant activity 245 mm with correspondingly high melanoidins 74 066 g l and polyphenols 52 g l content the antioxidant activity of the 100 kda fraction is around 5 fold higher than that of the 100 kda and 10 kda fractions which shows similar values the antioxidant compounds are thus spread over a wide molecular weight range but the activity is concentrated mostly in the high molecular weight 100 kda fraction 3 2 solid phase extraction of distillery wastewater using resins fig 1 a shows normalized solid phase concentration of melanoidins and polyphenols for different resins xad16 showed maximum solid phase concentration 0 78 for melanoidins and polyphenols closely followed by fpx66 0 7 xad7 and fpa98cl showed relatively lower selective adsorption for the antioxidants the adsorption capacity of xad16 was 27 g g dry weight melanoidins and 38 mg g dry weight polyphenols similarly fpx66 showed high adsorption capacity of 28 g g dry weight for melanoidins and 25 mg g dry weight for polyphenols fig 1b the large particle size of xad16 and fpx66 resins table 1 may have contributed to high rate of mass exchange between the solid and the liquid phases thereby facilitating the transportation of the antioxidants resins with larger particle sizes tend to have higher mass exchange rates and allow more material to be transferred to and from the resin 42 desorption of antioxidants from the resins using acidified ethanol resulted in 66 melanoidins and 85 polyphenols recovery for xad16 and 16 melanoidins and 54 polyphenols recovery for fpx66 fig 1c antioxidant activity was correspondingly higher for fraction recovered with xad16 192 mm teac compared to that obtained with fpx66 10 mm teac owing to higher recovery and antioxidant activity achieved with xad16 further studies were done with this resin the results over five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles is shown in fig 1d melanoidins and polyphenols content as adsorbed mass g co ce x v and desorbed mass g cd v in each cycle indicates that the adsorbed melanoidins content in each cycle decreased steadily from 383 g in c1 to 298 g in c5 while the desorbed mass remained approximately the same in all the 5 cycles 260 g thus for melanoidins the decrease in the adsorption efficiency was about 25 from the initial value till the end of 5 cycles fig 1d in the case of polyphenols 400 mg was adsorbed in the first cycle while the adsorption decreased by only 9 at the end of 5th cycle nearly complete desorption of polyphenols was observed the results indicate high efficiency of xad16 for recovery of antioxidants from distillery wastewater the effect of varying contact time 2 h to 8 h and temperature 25 c 35 c 45 c on adsorption of melanoidins m25 m35 m45 and polyphenols p25 p35 p45 using xad16 indicated that equilibrium was attained within 2 h at all the temperatures studied fig 1f 3 3 solvent extraction of distillery wastewater fig 2 a shows the normalized concentration of melanoidins and polyphenols for different solvents solvent to wastewater ratio of 2 1 highest extraction of melanoidins and polyphenols was obtained with the most polar solvent mek followed by mibk higher solvent polarity favors extraction of melanoidins and polyphenols in the organic phase increasing the solvent concentration improved the phase separation for melanoidins fig 2b mek and mibk outperformed all other solvents and exhibited maximum melanoidins separation at solvent wastewater ratio of 4 1 almost similar trend was obtained for polyphenols separation fig 2c the antioxidant activity of the mek extracted fraction was higher than that of other solvents for all the solvent wastewater ratios studied fig 2d the antioxidant activity increased from 85 mm teac for 1 1 ratio of mek wastewater to 100 mm teac for the higher ratios of 3 1 4 1 and 6 1 for subsequent experiments mek wastewater ratio of 4 1 was used 3 4 comparison of antioxidant recovery processes fig 3 summarizes the antioxidant compounds recovery from distillery wastewater by uf adsorption desorption and solvent extraction significant antioxidant activity 245 mm was obtained in 100 kda uf fraction followed by the fraction obtained through adsorption desorption 192 mm fractions recovered through solvent extraction showed relatively lower antioxidant activity 113 mm to further purify the antioxidant fractions from 100 kda uf retentate serial extraction was performed with mek 4 1 cumulative antioxidant activity of 155 mm was obtained in the organic phase after two consecutive extractions further it was observed that the concentration of melanoidins 980 g l and polyphenols 1550 mg l in the aqueous phase remaining after distillery wastewater adsorption through xad16 was nearly an order of magnitude lower than the content in the aqueous phase obtained by mek solvent extraction 11 933 g l melanoidins and 12 108 mg l polyphenols this establishes adsorption through xad16 as a more effective option for recovering antioxidant compounds from distillery wastewater however antioxidant compounds in distillery wastewater constitute a complex mixture so each recovered fraction would be characterized by a specific composition hence further analysis is required to understand which of these fractions are enriched in specific commercially viable polyphenols 3 5 biomethanation of distillery wastewater after antioxidants recovery different distillery wastewater samples after antioxidants recovery were subjected to biomethanation the initial cod content of each sample varied depending upon the antioxidant recovery process uf adsorption or solvent extraction from which it was obtained fig 4 a shows the normalized cod reduction and the corresponding ch4 content in the generated biogas on days 25 45 and 65 of the biomethanation process compared to 45 cod reduction after 45th day in the control sample the cod reduction was more than 60 in samples r uf10 and uf100 in 25 days sample r shows 74 cod reduction after 45 days of the biomethanation process high cod reduction indicates ultrafiltration uf10 and xad16 adsorption r are better methods for antioxidants separation from distillery wastewater than solvent extraction process further fig 4b shows that ch4 content of the control sample was 23 after 25 days and reached a maximum of 51 after 65 days of biomethanation however after separation of the antioxidants ch4 content rapidly increased to 48 for uf10 sample and 70 for r sample on 25th day of the biomethanation process thus removal of recalcitrant difficult to biodegrade compounds facilitated the biomethanation process antimicrobial effect of melanoidins is attributed to inhibition of enzymes involved in the breakdown of proteins 15 or chelating with metals like fe zn cu that are essential for microbial growth 43 the radical of reduced metal in the complex can tear the dna strands thereby resulting in genotoxicity in microbes further polyphenols owing to their structure and lipophilicity can disrupt the bacterial cell membranes causing the cell contents nucleus proteins and inorganic ions to diffuse out 44 some polyphenols in molasses distillery wastewater have been reported to adversely affect microbial growth 45 47 the aqueous fraction from mek extraction se showed lower cod removal and ch4 content compared to the control sample after 65 days fig 4a this could be due to the presence of residual mek in the aqueous phase which inhibited the biomethanation of aqueous phase se sample this indicates that though removal of antioxidant compounds facilitates the biomethanation process the antioxidants recovery method affects the biomethanation performance combination of ultrafiltration and biomethanation as shown in uf100 and uf10 shows high cod reduction and ch4 generation however low permeance 10 10 9 m3 m2s kpa through 100 kda membrane and 5 10 9 m3 m2s kpa through 10 kda membrane would limit the throughput requiring correspondingly large filtration area that would translate to high cost of membranes adsorption using xad16 followed by biomethanation appears more promising owing to its high cod reduction and high ch4 generation in a short span of 25 days following desorption with acidified ethanol the resin can be used repeatedly as shown over 5 adsorption desorption cycles further investigations are required to understand the composition of the recovered antioxidant fractions for the presence of specific commercially viable polyphenols 4 conclusions antioxidants melanoidins and polyphenols present in sugarcane distillery wastewater can be recovered using uf adsorption desorption or solvent extraction the recovery was as follows uf through 100 kda 245 mm teac adsorption on xad16 resin followed by desorption with acidified ethanol 192 mm teac solvent extraction with mek 113 mm teac further investigations are required to understand the composition of the recovered antioxidant fractions for the presence of specific commercially viable polyphenols biomethanation of the wastewater after antioxidants removal was improved and adsorption on xad16 was best among the tested options hence for improving the conventional anaerobic facility in sugarcane molasses distilleries adsorption on xad16 prior to biomethanation seems a promising option acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge support under the water4crops project bt in eu 06spw 2012 from department of biotechnology ministry of science and technology

14526,methanogenesis process is usually inhibited in the presence of sulfate because sulfate induces the sulfate reducing bacteria srb to compete with methanogenic bacteria for the same substrate and the produced sulfide has toxicity to the anaerobic microorganisms therefore the possibility for controlling the competition is important for practical application of anaerobic treatment processes of sulfate containing sludge in this study the activated sludge was enriched with sulfate concentration and was treated with various concentrations of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi in order to evaluate the potential of nzvi for alleviating the methanogenesis inhibitation of sulfate containing activated anaerobic sludge generally due to sulfate anions the outcomes of this study showed that a rapid accumulation of partially stabilized organic materials was observed which indicates that the whole anaerobic digestion process was ceased the results also reveal that nzvi contributed to significant increases in methane yield meanwhile srb in the presence of nzvi can react with sulfate to produce sulfide and subsequently can be precipitated as iron insoluble sulfides due to the sulfate reduction by nzvi the results demonstrate that nzvi was readily utilized as an electron donor for methanogenic bacteria and sulfate reduction and hence has an assuring potential in waste sludge treatment applications keywords nzvi anaerobic digestion sulfate reduction methane yield 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is now universally applied to stabilize and reduce the organic matter into biogas this process is attracting attention for energy and resource recovery energy recovery from the biomass will gain more importance and credibility in the future anaerobic digestion which involves the breakdown of organic matters under anoxic conditions is considered as a biological complicated process that can transform the organic fraction of sludge into biogas which can be used for generating heat and electricity 1 2 sulfate anions are found abundantly in the environment and it s commonly generated from many industrial processes such as food production and coal burning power plants the generated wastewater of these industries contains a high concentration of sulfate species 3 the soluble organic matter of sulfate containing sludge can usually be biodegraded to methane carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide through an interaction of acetogenic and fermentative bacteria with sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic bacteria 4 during the anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge sulfate acts as an electron acceptor for srb in order to digest the hydrogen and acetates 5 6 meanwhile the anaerobic digestion of sludge that contains a high concentration of sulfate methane yield is being the unfavorable result due to the competition between the srb which competes with methanogenic bacteria for the same substrate 7 basically during the anaerobic digestion of sludge that contains a high concentration of sulfate srb competes strongly with methanogenic bacteria srb has a faster growth rate than methanogenic bacteria and has a higher affinity for the same substrates in aqueous media 8 the competition status is ascribed to the limitation of available substrates such as acetates and hydrogen eventually the end product of methane and sulfide will be determined as a result of the competition condition sulfide is considered as an inhibiting compound for anaerobic bacteria including methanogenic bacteria therefore the accumulation of sulfide in the wastewater into the networks might even cause corrosion problems and decrease the lifetime of pipelines and combustion engines installations additionally discharging excessive loads of sulfate is harmful to the public water supplies and can disrupt the cycle of the natural sulfur 9 through anaerobic digestion srb can reduce sulfate and produce sulfide meanwhile hydrogen sulfide h2s which is generated during the sulfate reduction can poison the methanogenic bacteria and can lead to the faliure failure of the anaerobic digestion process even at relatively low concentrations of sulfate sulfide is very odorous corrosive and is toxic to methanogenic bacteria 10 the appropriate controlling methods of sulfide are mainly by oxygenation precipitation or a combination of both therefore sludge conditioning and treatment process is essential for decreasing the sulfide generation in biogas subsequently lowering its toxicity and overcome the limitations of methane utilization 11 currently zero valent iron zvi which has a relatively low oxidation reduction potential e0 0 44 v and it has attracted increasing interest in the wastewater treatment field zvi has been extensively applied in remediation of contaminated groundwater 12 13 under anaerobic conditions the nanoscale of zero valent iron metal ions which was abbreviated by nzvi in the aqueous solutions can be easily oxidized 14 when nzvi is oxidized fe ii two electrons 2e and h is reduced to h2 srb use the emitted electons and the formed h2 to reduce the sulfate anions thus precipitating the sulfate by dosing nzvi metal ions during the anaerobic treatment of sulfate containing sludge is significant to conduct zhang et al reported that zvi when utilized in an anaerobic reactor it serves as an electron donor besides it can enhance the anaerobic environment that may improve the performance of reactors used for treating the wastewater 15 similarly karri et al found that nzvi as an electron donor can increase the hydrolysis rate of sludge fermentation and can support the microorganisms for converting the contaminants 16 using zvi uasb sludge reactor zvi alleviates the inhibition effect of h2s on acetogens methanogenic bacteria and srb through iron sulfide precipitation and ph buffering 17 the effects of nzvi performance on anaerobic digestion of domestic activated sludge have not been well documented and the studies outcomes sometimes provide inconsistent observations in term of methane production 18 19 moreover there has been very limited information about the anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge therefore a comprehensive investigation would be essential especially when the sulfate enriched sludge is fed with different nzvi concentrations accordingly controlling the competition status between the srb and methanogenic bacteria is possible for a practical application of anaerobic treatment processes with nzvi in fact the questions remain as to whether and how the nzvi will affect the biochemical process and overcome the inhibitation of methanogenesis process in anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge the anaerobic digestion performance of domestic activated sludge was observed under various sulfate concentrations and various nzvi doses under fixed conditions the study s main objective is to assess the performance of anaerobic digestion process for the treatment of sulfate containing sludge in presence of nzvi daily biogas prodcution methane content ph total alkalinity total ammonia nitrogen iron ions release and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations were tracked to examine the anaerobic digestion performance in order to provide the evidence for enhancement of anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge by the addition of nzvi assuredly in this study the impact of various concentrations of nzvi on methanogenic activities in anaerobic digestion will be determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 h2o 6 was purchased from sigma company germany while sodium borohydride nabh4 was obtained from sigma aldrich usa anhydrous sodium sulfate na2so4 was purchased from wako pure chemical industries japan all solutions were prepared using deionized water and all the chemicals used in this research were of chemical grade for controlling the ph during experiments sodium hydroxide naoh 97 and hydrochloric acid hcl with a concentration of 35 were bought from wako company japan 2 2 preparation of nzvi and sludge waste samples nzvi was synthesized in aqueous solution by borohydride reduction of ferric chloride following our last published study procedures 18 the synthesis experimental setup was carried out by applying n2 atmosphere gas and the fresh synthesized nzvi slurry was kept in 100 ethanol medium in sealed bottle prior to use waste activated sludge samples were collected from the influent point of the anaerobic digester at mikasagawa treatment center fukuoka japan the anaerobic digester of the treatment center receives mixtures of thickened activated sludge and the samples were collected in a plastic container and were immediately analyzed and characterized 2 3 lab scale biochemical methane potential tests in order to observe the role of nzvi particles in controlling the methanogenic inhabitation of the sulfate containing sludge anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted based on biochemical methane potential procedures 11 the activated sludge samples enriched with sulfate concentration were treated with various concentrations of nzvi based on table 1 seven different bioreactors were assembled and operated and 500 ml of sludge samples were added to each bioreactor bottle all the bottles were flushed with n2 gas to ensure n2 atmosphere the bottles were then placed in a water bath at 37 1 c for 20 days the operational mixing of all bottles was 150 r min for five minutes long and two times every day the samples were withdrawn and immediately filtered using a 0 45 μm pore size cellulose membrane for analysis of sulfate ions ammonia nitrogen cod concentrations total alkalinity and iron ions 2 4 adsorption characteristics of sulfates onto nzvi particles 2 4 1 sorption kinetics experiment sulfate solution with 500 mg l sulfate as initial concentration was prepared for sorption kinetics experiments 100 ml of the prepared sulfate solution was added to erlenmeyer flask a concentration of 1000 mg l of freshly prepared nzvi was added to the sulfate containing flask the sulfate solution in the experiment was mixed with nzvi for 1200 min at certain conditions temperature 25 c agitation speed 200 r min and ph 7 2 at predetermined time intervals samples were extracted with a syringe and filtered through 0 45 μm membranes for analyzing the final concentration of sulfates 2 4 2 isotherm experiment groups of batch experiments were conducted with an initial sulfate concentration ranging from 0 to 500 mg l in erlenmeyer flasks each sulfate solution was mixed with nzvi at ambient temperature and 200 r min stirring each flask was immediately sealed and the equilibrium concentrations of sulfate were determined at equilibrium time and the adsorption capacity of nzvi was measured 2 4 3 factors affecting sulfide adsorption at equilibrium in order to study the factors affecting the adsorption of sulfates onto nzvi particles adsorption experiments were repeated with changing various parameters the adsorption experiments were conducted under various temperatures of 5 c 25 c 50 c and 90 c initial ph 3 5 7 10 and 12 initial sulfates concentration of 50 mg l 100 mg l 250 mg l 500 mg l and 1000 mg l and agitating speed of 50 r min 100 r min 150 r min and 200 r min 2 4 4 sampling and chemical analysis the ph was adjusted by the addition of 0 1 m hcl or naoh solutions all parameters were analyzed in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 20 using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer dr 3900 hach company usa sulfate anions were determined using power pillows reagents cod was determined using reactor digestion method ammonia nitrogen nh4 n was determined using a colorimetric method and the concentrations of total iron ion s and ferrous fe ii ions were determined by the ferrover and 1 10 phenanthroline method respectively the ph was recorded using a ph analyzer laqua japan the daily biogas volume was measured using a reversible device having liquid displacement connected directly to the bioreactors the compositions of generated biogas including methane and carbon dioxide were analyzed by a gas chromatograph gc gl sciences inc japan equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and with two different stainless steel packed columns the first column can separate methane while the second column can separate carbon dioxide the temperatures of the gc injector detector and column were kept at 60 c 100 c and 80 c argon gas was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 and 30 ml min for separation carbon dioxide and methane respectively 2 4 5 characterization of nzvi nzvi synthesized particles were filtered under nitrogen atmosphere prior to determining the morphology and structure crystallinity x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained on x ray diffractometer ttr rigaku japan using graphite monochromatic cu kd radiation and the goniometer scanning range was from 3 to 90 the particle size and morphology were observed by transmission electron microscopy tem jem arm 200 f jeol co japan using copper mounted holey carbon grids 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal characteristics of dissolved sulfates in aqueous solution by nzvi 3 1 1 removal kinetics the adsorption kinetic line graph of sulfate by nzvi is presented in fig 1 within the first 20 min the amount of sulfate adsorption increased sharply and almost the maximum adsorption capacity was reached after 30 min with adsorption capacity of 15 45 mg g the adsorption capacity was increased sharply due to available adsorption sites on nzvi particles at the beginning of interaction time indicating that the adsorption sites on the nzvi particles gradually interacted with the sulfates thus the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing reaction time therefore 30 min duration was selected for the following adsorption isotherm experiments the pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticular diffusion models were employed to study the adsorption process and the correlation coefficients r2 were listed in table 2 r2 coefficient of the pseudo second order model r2 0 9960 was higher than the other models indicated that the removal of sulfate followed the pseudo second order kinetic model this result suggests that the uptake process of sulfate can be broken down into two or more steps the first step is the adsorption onto the nzvi surface whereas the second step is the gradual adsorption step and the final step is the equilibrium step 3 1 2 adsorption isotherm the adsorption of sulfate by nzvi results provide obviously better fitting to the three parameter isotherm model of redlich peterson among the various isotherm models which show the maximum agreement with the experimental data which is indicated by the highest value of r2 which exceeded 0 994 as listed in table 3 redlich peterson isotherm consists of both langmuir and freundlich isotherms therefore the sulfate isotherm on nzvi can be applied either in heterogeneous and homogeneous systems due to its adaptability 21 3 1 3 affecting factors at equilibrium different key factors were applied in order to study its effects on the amounts of adsorbed sulfate at equilibrium time the effects of changing the initial ph on the amount of sulfate were investigated by changing the ph in the range from 3 to 12 fig 2 a over the aqueous solutions the ph value was considered as an important factor controlling the adsorption process of sulfate by nzvi due to ion competitive adsorption 22 the highest adsorption capacity was observed at strong acidic conditions in contrast both strong and weak alkaline conditions are unfavorable for nzvi to adsorb sulfate ions at ph equal to 10 and 12 the adsorption capacities were only 3 1 and 2 8 mg g respectively this phenomenon is due to the existence of hydroxyl ions that compete with hydrogen sulfide ions and sulfide ions however at the same time the sulfate adsorption amounts increased clearly to 10 7 mg g at ph 3 moreover the results of changing the agitation speed on the adsorption capacity of nzvi particles were depicted in fig 2b the agitation speed was raised from 50 to 200 r min and the adsorption capacities increased notably when the speed increased to 100 r min giving 7 7 mg g sulfate ions adsorbed by nzvi compared with only 3 3 mg g that can be adsorbed under the low agitating speed of 50 r min this is because that increases the agitation speed boost the species transfer between the sulfate ions and nzvi as adsorbent 23 fig 2c exhibits the adsorption capacity under modifying the initial sulfate concentrations the adsorption amounts of sulfate by nzvi were increased by increasing the initial sulfate concentration to a certain extent the equilibrium nzvi adsorption capacity of sulfate was 5 9 6 1 7 4 7 6 and 7 7 mg g at initial sulfate concentrations of 50 100 200 500 and 1000 mg l respectively these outcomes are due to the increase of active molecules with higher sulfides concentrations 24 eventually the influence of varying the reaction temperature on the amounts of adsorbed sulfate at equilibrium time is shown in fig 2d the temperature range was from 5 to 90 c and the adsorbed sulfate amounts were 12 5 7 2 9 4 and 7 7 mg g at 5 25 50 and 90 c respectively it can be said that the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing the temperature therefore the negative correlation between the adsorption capacity and temperature guides that the sulfate ions adsorption onto nzvi is a physical adsorption process rather than a chemical adsorption process 3 2 characterizations of nzvi fig 3 display the tem microscopic morphologies of prepared nzvi the images recognize clearly chain like aggregate distribution of the nzvi particles the rough estimate of particle size of representative single particle size has around appeared smaller than 60 nm as identified in other research work 25 the nzvi particles were largely spherical and in general were formed as a core shell structure for the iron nanoparticles fig 3b the chemical crystallinity and composition were studied by xrd analysis as shown in fig 4 the xrd pattern obviously shows separated peaks and the main reflection was at 44 7 indicating the presence of zero valent iron from the combined tem and xrd results it can be concluded that the laboratory prepared nzvi likely having a core of main zero valent iron while a shell is largely made of iron oxides 3 3 overall anaerobic digestion performance fig 5 a shows the cumulative biogas production over 20 days of anaerobic digestion experiments operation compared with control bioreactor r1 the generated biogas of r2 was inhibited significantly when the influent sulfate was 500 mg l and the nzvi particles were not added specifically the cumulative biogas production decreased from 293 to 249 ml comparatively the sulfate containing sludge bioreactors were exposed to nzvi particles were less affected by the increase in sulfate concentrations with biogas production fluctuating at 389 368 266 448 and 492 ml for r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 respectively overall the presence of sulfate anions dramatically decreased the biogas production and the decrease in the generated biogas volume of sulfate containing sludge was due to the competition status between the methanogenic bacteria and srb for the same substrate degradation 26 moreover the sulfate existence in the sludge would increase the production of h2s which is considered as a toxic gas to anaerobic microorganisms and later it caused a decrease in biogas production as in bioreactor r2 the fewer effects of sulfate present in the other bioreactors are attributed to the function of nzvi when preventing the negative effects on sulfate anions by buffering the ph value and subsequently decreased the un dissociated h2s concentrations 26 27 concretely during the operation period no significant differences were detected between the bioreactors r3 and r4 nevertheless over the 20 day period a substantial increase from 293 ml to 492 ml 68 was detected when the nzvi concentration was increased to a concentration of 1000 mg l and the ph was fixed at 12 in bioreactor r7 on the other hand comparing with r7 the biogas production decreased by 9 8 when the initial ph was controlled to be not more than 3 in bioreactor r6 generally for all the operated bioreactors from the day 4 there was negligible biogas production in the treated bioreactors indicating the completion of methanogenesis while it was strongly inhibited with the sulfate ions various biogas samples were withdrawn from each bioreactor and then analyzed in order to determine the methane and carbon dioxide content it was found that the major components of biogas in the anaerobic sludge were nitrogen carbon dioxide methane and a small amount of hydrogen 28 the content of methane and carbon dioxide produced are shown respectively in fig 3b and c the amended bioreactors r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 released respectively more carbon dioxide with 82 76 64 66 68 and 68 than the bioreactor without the addition of neither sulfate nor nzvi particles by the end of biogas production period the carbon dioxide concentration in the treated bioreactors was almost the same fig 3b which were in the range of 75 90 in contrast there was a little methane generated during the digestion period which points out the low methanogenic activities particularly at the low nzvi dosage as in r4 and r5 or r2 without nzvi dosage however when further increasing the nzvi dosage the methane yield was relatively high which indicates that the nzvi particles decrease the inhabitation of methanogenic activities of sulfate containing sludge and sulfate plays a clear role in the inhabitation of methanogenic bacteria as a result of sulfate addition two forms primary and secondary of inhibition existed primary inhibition form exists due to the competition of different microorganisms for the same substrate besides secondary inhibition form was observed from the toxicity of sulfide ions to various bacteria groups 29 3 4 dynamic changes in ph and alkalinity ph is considered as one of the substantial indicators for marking the anaerobic digestion status stability 30 the ph measurements exhibit that the final ph values were not appropriate for generating methane as listed in table 4 the methane is produced in the ph range 7 0 8 5 31 thus the final ph dropped to values between 5 2 and 5 5 since the volatile fatty acids were accumulated and the activities of acidogenic and methanogenic bacteria were inhibited and subsequently the whole anaerobic digestion performance may be disrupted therefore when the medium is not favorable to methanogenesis the volatile fatty acids consequently will be accumulated and the alkalinity will be raised as it will be clearly discussed in fig 6 the no additive bioreactor r1 has the lowest final ph due to the relatively slow organic acids degradation 32 ordinarily alkalinity rate increased together with the volatile fatty acids accumulation due to incomplete methanogenic activities therefore all the bioreactors showed total alkalinity values more than the blank bioreactor r1 fig 6 from the beginning of anaerobic digestion until day 4 the apparent raise in total alkalinity in r3 r6 and r7 which achieved 2 11 1 79 and 1 71 times more than what r1 achieved points out to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids 18 it can be clearly seen that the alkalinity shows a similar trend for all the bioreactors regardless the sulfate or nzvi concentrations reaching the highest level of 950 1732 1347 1074 1290 and 1447 mg caco3 l on the last day of digestion process duration for the bioreactors r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 respectively 3 5 fate of iron ions release to a large extent the formation of various fe ii or fe iii species controls the reactivity of nzvi 33 as seen in fig 7 the iron release was mainly in fe ii form and raising the nzvi load resulted in an increase of iron ions concentration in the sludge samples during microbial sulfate reduction iron sulfides fes are also expected to form obviously the fe ii concentration decreased as the concentration of the sulfate increased this occurred distinctly at bioreactor r5 with only 100 mg l nzvi where fe ii was precipitated into fes which indicate that the addition of nzvi to precipitate sulfide could relieve the inhibition of sulfide 26 34 therefore the existence of fe ii and the formation of fes in some extent were benefited for anaerobic bacteria 34 and the formation of an optimized environment for the microbial activities in the reactor might be responsible for the enhanced performance of methanogensis that was reflected by increasing the methane yeild fig 5c according to yang y et al 19 the higher dissolved iron concentrations as in the bioreactors r3 r6 and r7 pointed out the iron containing cellular component emissions during the fermentation process of anaerobic sludge in which the cod trends are increased undoubtedly fig 9 3 6 ammonia nitrogen and cod ammonia is produced mainly by the biological degradation of proteins as nitrogenous matter and it has been assigned to be the main inhibition cause of anaerobic digestion performance and responsible for ceasing the methanogenesis process ammonia can disturb the methanogenic bacteria via the bacterial cell membrane pentration causing proton imbalance and ions deficiency into the bacterial cells 7 ammonia concentrations were gradually increased for the blank reactor and the ammonia concentration was increased from 85 mg nh3 n l to reach more than 400 mg nh3 n l as an average concentration from the day 6 bioreactors r2 and r5 showed a remarkable ammonia generation from the beginning of digestion period which reflects the reduction in biogas production fig 5a generally when the ammonia concentrations were below 200 mg l the anaerobic digestion process was enhanced as in bioreactors r6 and r7 the low ammonia concentrations express nitrogen as a necessary nutrient for the methanogenic microorganisms the high methane production could be related to the srb and methanogenic bacteria kinetics variations in acetate and hydrogen utilization because srb has kinetic advantages over methanogenic bacteria on their common substrates 27 35 as ammonia concentrations were increased in the range of 313 581 mg nh3 n l after 6 days of digestion the methanogenic bacteria simultaneously lost most of its activity fig 8 these outcomes come in agreement with methanogenesis inhibitation by facilitating the reactions between the hydrochloric acid and amino acid and may be increasing the ammonium release 36 the likely explanation is that srb is anaerobic bacteria that utilize sulfate as an electron acceptor resulting in an increase in alkalinity this is in agreement of dar et al outcomes 4 fig 9 shows cod concentrations for all bioreactors the initial cod concentration was increased effectually to reach the average of 7 51 times at day 20 compared to the amended bioreactors the r2 bioreactor was less affected by the existence of sulfate and its cod increasing ranging was from 11 6 to 20 34 over the digestion period during the anaerobic digestion treatment of sulfate containing sludge the presence of sulfate would increase the h2s which caused toxicity to the anaerobic microorganisms therefore the performance declination of bioreactors exposed to sulfate concentrations it was observed that the cod concentrations were maintained higher than the initial cod 1954 mg l for all the bioreactors along the batch test period which suggests a rapid accumulation of partially stabilizied organic materials 37 which indicates that the whole anaerobic digestion process was ceased during anaerobic digestion the dynamic kinetics of the cod reflected a negative performance of methanogenic bacteria by the end of anaerobic digestion the cod concentrations in all bioreactors increased to 10 156 11 764 18 768 15 228 12 310 16 333 and 17 684 mg l for r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 probably as a result of the continued endogenous biomass decay 19 3 7 sulfate reduction under anaerobic conditions and because nzvi particles in water oxidized nzvi produce fe ii and two electrons eq 1 srb use these electrons to reduce the sulfate via hydrogen formation eq 2 1 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 h 2 2 o h 2 s o 4 2 4 h 2 h h s 4 h 2 o sulfide ions in the aqueous medium have various forms s2 hs dissolved h2s and these forms appeared due to sulfate reduction process and are considered as toxic species to srb and methanogenic bacteria therefore controlling and precipitating sulfide forms in the sludge media will enhance the methane production fig 10 clarifies the time course of the sulfate concentration for each amended bioreactor it can be seen that sulfate concentrations were eliminated slowly from the bioreactors exposed to small amounts of nzvi as in r2 r3 and r4 however a more rapid removal rate of sulfate was detected in the highest nzvi concentration bioreactors r6 and r7 these experimental results clearly reveal that srb can utilize nzvi the reaction between iron and sulfate species can take these following reaction pathways 3 2 c h 2 o s o 4 2 h 2 s 2 h c o 3 4 f e 2 h 2 s f e s 2 h 5 2 f e 3 h s 2 f e 2 s 0 h 6 f e 2 h s f e s h 7 f e s h 2 s f e s 2 h 2 during the biodegradation of sulfate srb can react with sulfate to produce sulfide and alkalinity eq 3 whereas fe ii can remove sulfide by precipitation and form fes according to eq 4 or fe iii can remove sulfide by oxidizing it chemically to elemental sulfur while being reduced to fe ii which can subsequently produce fes eqs 5 6 the fes can further react with h2s and form iron disulfide precipitate fes2 eq 7 the schematic graphical abstract of sulfate containg sludge biodegration in the presence of nzvi is presented in fig 11 these results were confirmed by rickard d et al study that clearly demonstrates that sulfate is attached to the phosphate of adenosine triphosphate forming adenosine phosphosulfate and subsequently sulfate moiety is reduced to sulfide 38 this process involves a noticeable fractionation of the sulfur forms and most of the sulfate ions present in the activated sludge can be precipitated as iron insoluble sulfides using biogenic sulfide produced due to the sulfate reduction by nzvi it was indicated that srb played a major role in the sulfate reduction and the sulfate removal by nzvi is mainly due to biodegradation rather than adsorption 16 4 conclusions mesophilic anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge is clearly affected by the increasing concentration of sulfate the nzvi presence tration could effectively improve the performance of sulfate containing sludge digestion because it can serve as an electron donor that could mitigate the competition between srb and methanogenic bacteria for the same substrates also it can precipitate the content of un dissociated h2s that is the main factor inhibiting anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge we predicted that this kind of treatment technology may hold promise to be applied in the anaerobic treatment of sulfate containing wastewater and decrease the high costs of construction and operation of normal treatment plants and these outcomes are very interesting for carrying out the full scale treatment of sludge substrates with a high concentration of sulfate acknowledgement this research was

14526,methanogenesis process is usually inhibited in the presence of sulfate because sulfate induces the sulfate reducing bacteria srb to compete with methanogenic bacteria for the same substrate and the produced sulfide has toxicity to the anaerobic microorganisms therefore the possibility for controlling the competition is important for practical application of anaerobic treatment processes of sulfate containing sludge in this study the activated sludge was enriched with sulfate concentration and was treated with various concentrations of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi in order to evaluate the potential of nzvi for alleviating the methanogenesis inhibitation of sulfate containing activated anaerobic sludge generally due to sulfate anions the outcomes of this study showed that a rapid accumulation of partially stabilized organic materials was observed which indicates that the whole anaerobic digestion process was ceased the results also reveal that nzvi contributed to significant increases in methane yield meanwhile srb in the presence of nzvi can react with sulfate to produce sulfide and subsequently can be precipitated as iron insoluble sulfides due to the sulfate reduction by nzvi the results demonstrate that nzvi was readily utilized as an electron donor for methanogenic bacteria and sulfate reduction and hence has an assuring potential in waste sludge treatment applications keywords nzvi anaerobic digestion sulfate reduction methane yield 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is now universally applied to stabilize and reduce the organic matter into biogas this process is attracting attention for energy and resource recovery energy recovery from the biomass will gain more importance and credibility in the future anaerobic digestion which involves the breakdown of organic matters under anoxic conditions is considered as a biological complicated process that can transform the organic fraction of sludge into biogas which can be used for generating heat and electricity 1 2 sulfate anions are found abundantly in the environment and it s commonly generated from many industrial processes such as food production and coal burning power plants the generated wastewater of these industries contains a high concentration of sulfate species 3 the soluble organic matter of sulfate containing sludge can usually be biodegraded to methane carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide through an interaction of acetogenic and fermentative bacteria with sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogenic bacteria 4 during the anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge sulfate acts as an electron acceptor for srb in order to digest the hydrogen and acetates 5 6 meanwhile the anaerobic digestion of sludge that contains a high concentration of sulfate methane yield is being the unfavorable result due to the competition between the srb which competes with methanogenic bacteria for the same substrate 7 basically during the anaerobic digestion of sludge that contains a high concentration of sulfate srb competes strongly with methanogenic bacteria srb has a faster growth rate than methanogenic bacteria and has a higher affinity for the same substrates in aqueous media 8 the competition status is ascribed to the limitation of available substrates such as acetates and hydrogen eventually the end product of methane and sulfide will be determined as a result of the competition condition sulfide is considered as an inhibiting compound for anaerobic bacteria including methanogenic bacteria therefore the accumulation of sulfide in the wastewater into the networks might even cause corrosion problems and decrease the lifetime of pipelines and combustion engines installations additionally discharging excessive loads of sulfate is harmful to the public water supplies and can disrupt the cycle of the natural sulfur 9 through anaerobic digestion srb can reduce sulfate and produce sulfide meanwhile hydrogen sulfide h2s which is generated during the sulfate reduction can poison the methanogenic bacteria and can lead to the faliure failure of the anaerobic digestion process even at relatively low concentrations of sulfate sulfide is very odorous corrosive and is toxic to methanogenic bacteria 10 the appropriate controlling methods of sulfide are mainly by oxygenation precipitation or a combination of both therefore sludge conditioning and treatment process is essential for decreasing the sulfide generation in biogas subsequently lowering its toxicity and overcome the limitations of methane utilization 11 currently zero valent iron zvi which has a relatively low oxidation reduction potential e0 0 44 v and it has attracted increasing interest in the wastewater treatment field zvi has been extensively applied in remediation of contaminated groundwater 12 13 under anaerobic conditions the nanoscale of zero valent iron metal ions which was abbreviated by nzvi in the aqueous solutions can be easily oxidized 14 when nzvi is oxidized fe ii two electrons 2e and h is reduced to h2 srb use the emitted electons and the formed h2 to reduce the sulfate anions thus precipitating the sulfate by dosing nzvi metal ions during the anaerobic treatment of sulfate containing sludge is significant to conduct zhang et al reported that zvi when utilized in an anaerobic reactor it serves as an electron donor besides it can enhance the anaerobic environment that may improve the performance of reactors used for treating the wastewater 15 similarly karri et al found that nzvi as an electron donor can increase the hydrolysis rate of sludge fermentation and can support the microorganisms for converting the contaminants 16 using zvi uasb sludge reactor zvi alleviates the inhibition effect of h2s on acetogens methanogenic bacteria and srb through iron sulfide precipitation and ph buffering 17 the effects of nzvi performance on anaerobic digestion of domestic activated sludge have not been well documented and the studies outcomes sometimes provide inconsistent observations in term of methane production 18 19 moreover there has been very limited information about the anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge therefore a comprehensive investigation would be essential especially when the sulfate enriched sludge is fed with different nzvi concentrations accordingly controlling the competition status between the srb and methanogenic bacteria is possible for a practical application of anaerobic treatment processes with nzvi in fact the questions remain as to whether and how the nzvi will affect the biochemical process and overcome the inhibitation of methanogenesis process in anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge the anaerobic digestion performance of domestic activated sludge was observed under various sulfate concentrations and various nzvi doses under fixed conditions the study s main objective is to assess the performance of anaerobic digestion process for the treatment of sulfate containing sludge in presence of nzvi daily biogas prodcution methane content ph total alkalinity total ammonia nitrogen iron ions release and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations were tracked to examine the anaerobic digestion performance in order to provide the evidence for enhancement of anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge by the addition of nzvi assuredly in this study the impact of various concentrations of nzvi on methanogenic activities in anaerobic digestion will be determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 h2o 6

solutions were prepared using deionized water and all the chemicals used in this research were of chemical grade for controlling the ph during experiments sodium hydroxide naoh 97 and hydrochloric acid hcl with a concentration of 35 were bought from wako company japan 2 2 preparation of nzvi and sludge waste samples nzvi was synthesized in aqueous solution by borohydride reduction of ferric chloride following our last published study procedures 18 the synthesis experimental setup was carried out by applying n2 atmosphere gas and the fresh synthesized nzvi slurry was kept in 100 ethanol medium in sealed bottle prior to use waste activated sludge samples were collected from the influent point of the anaerobic digester at mikasagawa treatment center fukuoka japan the anaerobic digester of the treatment center receives mixtures of thickened activated sludge and the samples were collected in a plastic container and were immediately analyzed and characterized 2 3 lab scale biochemical methane potential tests in order to observe the role of nzvi particles in controlling the methanogenic inhabitation of the sulfate containing sludge anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted based on biochemical methane potential procedures 11 the activated sludge samples enriched with sulfate concentration were treated with various concentrations of nzvi based on table 1 seven different bioreactors were assembled and operated and 500 ml of sludge samples were added to each bioreactor bottle all the bottles were flushed with n2 gas to ensure n2 atmosphere the bottles were then placed in a water bath at 37 1 c for 20 days the operational mixing of all bottles was 150 r min for five minutes long and two times every day the samples were withdrawn and immediately filtered using a 0 45 μm pore size cellulose membrane for analysis of sulfate ions ammonia nitrogen cod concentrations total alkalinity and iron ions 2 4 adsorption characteristics of sulfates onto nzvi particles 2 4 1 sorption kinetics experiment sulfate solution with 500 mg l sulfate as initial concentration was prepared for sorption kinetics experiments 100 ml of the prepared sulfate solution was added to erlenmeyer flask a concentration of 1000 mg l of freshly prepared nzvi was added to the sulfate containing flask the sulfate solution in the experiment was mixed with nzvi for 1200 min at certain conditions temperature 25 c agitation speed 200 r min and ph 7 2 at predetermined time intervals samples were extracted with a syringe and filtered through 0 45 μm membranes for analyzing the final concentration of sulfates 2 4 2 isotherm experiment groups of batch experiments were conducted with an initial sulfate concentration ranging from 0 to 500 mg l in erlenmeyer flasks each sulfate solution was mixed with nzvi at ambient temperature and 200 r min stirring each flask was immediately sealed and the equilibrium concentrations of sulfate were determined at equilibrium time and the adsorption capacity of nzvi was measured 2 4 3 factors affecting sulfide adsorption at equilibrium in order to study the factors affecting the adsorption of sulfates onto nzvi particles adsorption experiments were repeated with changing various parameters the adsorption experiments were conducted under various temperatures of 5 c 25 c 50 c and 90 c initial ph 3 5 7 10 and 12 initial sulfates concentration of 50 mg l 100 mg l 250 mg l 500 mg l and 1000 mg l and agitating speed of 50 r min 100 r min 150 r min and 200 r min 2 4 4 sampling and chemical analysis the ph was adjusted by the addition of 0 1 m hcl or naoh solutions all parameters were analyzed in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 20 using ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer

daily biogas volume was measured using a reversible device having liquid displacement connected directly to the bioreactors the compositions of generated biogas including methane and carbon dioxide were analyzed by a gas chromatograph gc gl sciences inc japan equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and with two different stainless steel packed columns the first column can separate methane while the second column can separate carbon dioxide the temperatures of the gc injector detector and column were kept at 60 c 100 c and 80 c argon gas was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 20 and 30 ml min for separation carbon dioxide and methane respectively 2 4 5 characterization of nzvi nzvi synthesized particles were filtered under nitrogen atmosphere prior to determining the morphology and structure crystallinity x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained on x ray diffractometer ttr rigaku japan using graphite monochromatic cu kd radiation and the goniometer scanning range was from 3 to 90 the particle size and morphology were observed by transmission electron microscopy tem jem arm 200 f jeol co japan using copper mounted holey carbon grids 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal characteristics of dissolved sulfates in aqueous solution by nzvi 3 1 1 removal kinetics the adsorption kinetic line graph of sulfate by nzvi is presented in fig 1 within the first 20 min the amount of sulfate adsorption increased sharply and almost the maximum adsorption capacity was reached after 30 min with adsorption capacity of 15 45 mg g the adsorption capacity was increased sharply due to available adsorption sites on nzvi particles at the beginning of interaction time indicating that the adsorption sites on the nzvi particles gradually interacted with the sulfates thus the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing reaction time therefore 30 min duration was selected for the following adsorption isotherm experiments the pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticular diffusion models were employed to study the adsorption process and the correlation coefficients r2 were listed in table 2 r2 coefficient of the pseudo second order model r2 0 9960 was higher than the other models indicated that the removal of sulfate followed the pseudo second order kinetic model this result suggests that the uptake process of sulfate can be broken down into two or more steps the first step is the adsorption onto the nzvi surface whereas the second step is the gradual adsorption step and the final step is the equilibrium step 3 1 2 adsorption isotherm the adsorption of sulfate by nzvi results provide obviously better fitting to the three parameter isotherm model of redlich peterson among the various isotherm models which show the maximum agreement with the experimental data which is indicated by the highest value of r2 which exceeded 0 994 as listed in table 3 redlich peterson isotherm consists of both langmuir and freundlich isotherms therefore the sulfate isotherm on nzvi can be applied either in heterogeneous and homogeneous systems due to its adaptability 21 3 1 3 affecting factors at equilibrium different key factors were applied in order to study its effects on the amounts of adsorbed sulfate at equilibrium time the effects of changing the initial ph on the amount of sulfate were investigated by changing the ph in the range from 3 to 12 fig 2 a over the aqueous solutions the ph value was considered as an important factor controlling the adsorption process of sulfate by nzvi due to ion competitive adsorption 22 the highest adsorption capacity was observed at strong acidic conditions in contrast both strong and weak alkaline conditions are unfavorable for nzvi to adsorb sulfate ions at ph equal to 10 and 12 the adsorption capacities were only 3 1 and 2 8 mg g respectively this phenomenon is due to the existence of hydroxyl ions that compete with hydrogen sulfide ions and sulfide ions however at the same time the sulfate adsorption amounts increased clearly to 10 7 mg g at ph 3 moreover the results of changing the agitation speed on the adsorption capacity of nzvi particles were depicted in fig 2b the agitation speed was raised from 50 to 200 r min and the adsorption capacities increased notably when the speed increased to 100 r min giving 7 7 mg g sulfate ions adsorbed by nzvi compared with only 3 3 mg g that can be adsorbed under the low agitating speed of 50 r min this is because that increases the agitation speed boost the species transfer between the sulfate ions and nzvi as adsorbent 23 fig 2c exhibits the adsorption capacity under modifying the initial sulfate concentrations the adsorption amounts of sulfate by nzvi were increased by increasing the initial sulfate concentration to a certain extent the equilibrium nzvi adsorption capacity of sulfate was 5 9 6 1 7 4 7 6 and 7 7 mg g at initial sulfate concentrations of 50 100 200 500 and 1000 mg l respectively these outcomes are due to the increase of active molecules with higher sulfides concentrations 24 eventually the influence of varying the reaction temperature on the amounts of adsorbed sulfate at equilibrium time is shown in fig 2d the temperature range was from 5 to 90 c and the adsorbed sulfate amounts were 12 5 7 2 9 4 and 7 7 mg g at 5 25 50 and 90 c respectively it can be said that the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing the temperature therefore the negative correlation between the adsorption capacity and temperature guides that the sulfate ions adsorption onto nzvi is a physical adsorption process rather than a chemical adsorption process 3 2 characterizations of nzvi fig 3 display the tem microscopic morphologies of prepared nzvi the images recognize clearly chain like aggregate distribution of the nzvi particles the rough estimate of particle size of representative single particle size has around appeared smaller than 60 nm as identified in other research work 25 the nzvi particles were largely spherical and in general were formed as a core shell structure for the iron nanoparticles fig 3b the chemical crystallinity and composition were studied by xrd analysis as shown in fig 4 the xrd pattern obviously shows separated peaks and the main reflection was at 44 7 indicating the presence of zero valent iron from the combined tem and xrd results it can be concluded that the laboratory prepared nzvi likely having a core of main zero valent iron while a shell is largely made of iron oxides 3 3 overall anaerobic digestion performance fig 5 a shows the cumulative biogas production over 20 days of anaerobic digestion experiments operation compared with control bioreactor r1 the generated biogas of r2 was inhibited significantly when the influent sulfate was 500 mg l and the nzvi particles were not added specifically the cumulative biogas production decreased from 293 to 249 ml comparatively the sulfate containing sludge bioreactors were exposed to nzvi particles were less affected by the increase in sulfate concentrations with biogas production fluctuating at 389 368 266 448 and 492 ml for r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 respectively overall the presence of sulfate anions dramatically decreased the biogas production and the decrease in the generated biogas volume of sulfate containing sludge was due to the competition status between the methanogenic bacteria and srb for the same substrate degradation 26 moreover the sulfate existence in the sludge would increase the production of h2s which is considered as a toxic gas to anaerobic microorganisms and later it caused a decrease in biogas production as in bioreactor r2 the fewer effects of sulfate present in the other bioreactors are attributed to the function of nzvi when preventing the negative effects on sulfate anions by buffering the ph value and subsequently decreased the un dissociated h2s concentrations 26 27 concretely during the operation period no significant differences were detected between the bioreactors r3 and r4 nevertheless over the 20 day period a substantial increase from 293 ml to 492 ml 68 was detected when the nzvi concentration was increased to a concentration of 1000 mg l and the ph was fixed at 12 in bioreactor r7 on the other hand comparing with r7 the biogas production decreased by 9 8 when the initial ph was controlled to be not more than 3 in bioreactor r6 generally for all the operated bioreactors from the day 4 there was negligible biogas production in the treated bioreactors indicating the completion of methanogenesis while it was strongly inhibited with the sulfate ions various biogas samples were withdrawn from each bioreactor and then analyzed in order to determine the methane and carbon dioxide content it was found that the major components of biogas in the anaerobic sludge were nitrogen carbon dioxide methane and a small amount of hydrogen 28 the content of methane and carbon dioxide produced are shown respectively in fig 3b and c the amended bioreactors r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 released respectively more carbon dioxide with 82 76 64 66 68 and 68 than the bioreactor without the addition of neither sulfate nor nzvi particles by the end of biogas production period the carbon dioxide concentration in the treated bioreactors was almost the same fig 3b which were in the range of 75 90 in contrast there was a little methane generated during the digestion period which points out the low methanogenic activities particularly at the low nzvi dosage as in r4 and r5 or r2 without nzvi dosage however when further increasing the nzvi dosage the methane yield was relatively high which indicates that the nzvi particles decrease the inhabitation of methanogenic activities of sulfate containing sludge and sulfate plays a clear role in the inhabitation of methanogenic bacteria as a result of sulfate addition two forms primary and secondary of inhibition existed primary inhibition form exists due to the competition of different microorganisms for the same substrate besides secondary inhibition form was observed from the toxicity of sulfide ions to various bacteria groups 29 3 4 dynamic changes in ph and alkalinity ph is considered as one of the substantial indicators for marking the anaerobic digestion status stability 30 the ph measurements exhibit that the final ph values were not appropriate for generating methane as listed in table 4 the methane is produced in the ph range 7 0 8 5 31 thus the final ph dropped to values between 5 2 and 5 5 since the volatile fatty acids were accumulated and the activities of acidogenic and methanogenic bacteria were inhibited and subsequently the whole anaerobic digestion performance may be disrupted therefore when the medium is not favorable to methanogenesis the volatile fatty acids consequently will be accumulated and the alkalinity will be raised as it will be clearly discussed in fig 6 the no additive bioreactor r1 has the lowest final ph due to the relatively slow organic acids degradation 32 ordinarily alkalinity rate increased together with the volatile fatty acids accumulation due to incomplete methanogenic activities therefore all the bioreactors showed total alkalinity values more than the blank bioreactor r1 fig 6 from the beginning of anaerobic digestion until day 4 the apparent raise in total alkalinity in r3 r6 and r7 which achieved 2 11 1 79 and 1 71 times more than what r1 achieved points out to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids 18 it can be clearly seen that the alkalinity shows a similar trend for all the bioreactors regardless the sulfate or nzvi concentrations reaching the highest level of 950 1732 1347 1074 1290 and 1447 mg caco3 l on the last day of digestion process duration for the bioreactors r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 respectively 3 5 fate of iron ions release to a large extent the formation of various fe ii or fe iii species controls the reactivity of nzvi 33 as seen in fig 7 the iron release was mainly in fe ii form and raising the nzvi load resulted in an increase of iron ions concentration in the sludge samples during microbial sulfate reduction iron sulfides fes are also expected to form obviously the fe ii concentration decreased as the concentration of the sulfate increased this occurred distinctly at bioreactor r5 with only 100 mg l nzvi where fe ii was precipitated into fes which indicate that the addition of nzvi to precipitate sulfide could relieve the inhibition of sulfide 26 34 therefore the existence of fe ii and the formation of fes in some extent were benefited for anaerobic bacteria 34 and the formation of an optimized environment for the microbial activities in the reactor might be responsible for the enhanced performance of methanogensis that was reflected by increasing the methane yeild fig 5c according to yang y et al 19 the higher dissolved iron concentrations as in the bioreactors r3 r6 and r7 pointed out the iron containing cellular component emissions during the fermentation process of anaerobic sludge in which the cod trends are increased undoubtedly fig 9 3 6 ammonia nitrogen and cod ammonia is produced mainly by the biological degradation of proteins as nitrogenous matter and it has been assigned to be the main inhibition cause of anaerobic digestion performance and responsible for ceasing the methanogenesis process ammonia can disturb the methanogenic bacteria via the bacterial cell membrane pentration causing proton imbalance and ions deficiency into the bacterial cells 7 ammonia concentrations were gradually increased for the blank reactor and the ammonia concentration was increased from 85 mg nh3 n l to reach more than 400 mg nh3 n l as an average concentration from the day 6 bioreactors r2 and r5 showed a remarkable ammonia generation from the beginning of digestion period which reflects the reduction in biogas production fig 5a generally when the ammonia concentrations were below 200 mg l the anaerobic digestion process was enhanced as in bioreactors r6 and r7 the low ammonia concentrations express nitrogen as a necessary nutrient for the methanogenic microorganisms the high methane production could be related to the srb and methanogenic bacteria kinetics variations in acetate and hydrogen utilization because srb has kinetic advantages over methanogenic bacteria on their common substrates 27 35 as ammonia concentrations were increased in the range of 313 581 mg nh3 n l after 6 days of digestion the methanogenic bacteria simultaneously lost most of its activity fig 8 these outcomes come in agreement with methanogenesis inhibitation by facilitating the reactions between the hydrochloric acid and amino acid and may be increasing the ammonium release 36 the likely explanation is that srb is anaerobic bacteria that utilize sulfate as an electron acceptor resulting in an increase in alkalinity this is in agreement of dar et al outcomes 4 fig 9 shows cod concentrations for all bioreactors the initial cod concentration was increased effectually to reach the average of 7 51 times at day 20 compared to the amended bioreactors the r2 bioreactor was less affected by the existence of sulfate and its cod increasing ranging was from 11 6 to 20 34 over the digestion period during the anaerobic digestion treatment of sulfate containing sludge the presence of sulfate would increase the h2s which caused toxicity to the anaerobic microorganisms therefore the performance declination of bioreactors exposed to sulfate concentrations it was observed that the cod concentrations were maintained higher than the initial cod 1954 mg l for all the bioreactors along the batch test period which suggests a rapid accumulation of partially stabilizied organic materials 37 which indicates that the whole anaerobic digestion process was ceased during anaerobic digestion the dynamic kinetics of the cod reflected a negative performance of methanogenic bacteria by the end of anaerobic digestion the cod concentrations in all bioreactors increased to 10 156 11 764 18 768 15 228 12 310 16 333 and 17 684 mg l for r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 probably as a result of the continued endogenous biomass decay 19 3 7 sulfate reduction under anaerobic conditions and because nzvi particles in water oxidized nzvi produce fe ii and two electrons eq 1 srb use these electrons to reduce the sulfate via hydrogen formation eq 2 1 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 h 2 2 o h 2 s o 4 2 4 h 2 h h s 4 h 2 o sulfide ions in the aqueous medium have various forms s2 hs dissolved h2s and these forms appeared due to sulfate reduction process and are considered as toxic species to srb and methanogenic bacteria therefore controlling and precipitating sulfide forms in the sludge media will enhance the methane production fig 10 clarifies the time course of the sulfate concentration for each amended bioreactor it can be seen that sulfate concentrations were eliminated slowly from the bioreactors exposed to small amounts of nzvi as in r2 r3 and r4 however a more rapid removal rate of sulfate was detected in the highest nzvi concentration bioreactors r6 and r7 these experimental results clearly reveal that srb can utilize nzvi the reaction between iron and sulfate species can take these following reaction pathways 3 2 c h 2 o s o 4 2 h 2 s 2 h c o 3 4 f e 2 h 2 s f e s 2 h 5 2 f e 3 h s 2 f e 2 s 0 h 6 f e 2 h s f e s h 7 f e s h 2 s f e s 2 h 2 during the biodegradation of sulfate srb can react with sulfate to produce sulfide and alkalinity eq 3 whereas fe ii can remove sulfide by precipitation and form fes according to eq 4 or fe iii can remove sulfide by oxidizing it chemically to elemental sulfur while being reduced to fe ii which can subsequently produce fes eqs 5 6 the fes can further react with h2s and form iron disulfide precipitate fes2 eq 7 the schematic graphical abstract of sulfate containg sludge biodegration in the presence of nzvi is presented in fig 11 these results were confirmed by rickard d et al study that clearly demonstrates that sulfate is attached to the phosphate of adenosine triphosphate forming adenosine phosphosulfate and subsequently sulfate moiety is reduced to sulfide 38 this process involves a noticeable fractionation of the sulfur forms and most of the sulfate ions present in the activated sludge can be precipitated as iron insoluble sulfides using biogenic sulfide produced due to the sulfate reduction by nzvi it was indicated that srb played a major role in the sulfate reduction and the sulfate removal by nzvi is mainly due to biodegradation rather than adsorption 16 4 conclusions mesophilic anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge is clearly affected by the increasing concentration of sulfate the nzvi presence tration could effectively improve the performance of sulfate containing sludge digestion because it can serve as an electron donor that could mitigate the competition between srb and methanogenic bacteria for the same substrates also it can precipitate the content of un dissociated h2s that is the main factor inhibiting anaerobic digestion of sulfate containing sludge we predicted that this kind of treatment technology may hold promise to be applied in the anaerobic treatment of sulfate containing wastewater and decrease the high costs of construction and operation of normal treatment plants and these outcomes are very interesting for carrying out the full scale treatment of sludge substrates with a high concentration of sulfate acknowledgement this research was

and reduces environmental impact due to wastewater discharges 6 16 19 reuse of treated produced water can also alleviate concerns related to probable seismic activity induced by deep well injection 20 the quality of non traditional waters is highly variable for example urban wastewater constituents include suspended and dissolved solids nitrogen phosphorus organics and pathogens produced water quality varies depending on the geographic location geologic formation and type of hydrocarbons produced major constituents in produced water include suspended solids salts oil and grease sometimes naturally occurring radioactive materials and other organic and inorganic compounds benko and drewes reported that total dissolved solids tds concentrations in produced water vary between 1000 and 400 000 mg l 21 a thorough understanding of water quality is essential for selecting water treatment technologies to reclaim water to target quality for different end uses various treatment processes and systems are capable of removing contaminants from non traditional waters to meet end use requirements thus a set of selection criteria must be applied to narrow down the number of effective treatment processes and trains 22 23 the selection criteria may include capital cost operating and maintenance o m costs space footprint requirement commercial availability mobility and energy demand based on the criteria selected and prioritized by a user a decision support tool dst that combines a large number of selection criteria can suggest efficient treatment trains capable of treating non traditional waters to the target water quality required for beneficial use or discharge to the environment 1 2 overview of dsts for selection of treatment technologies in recent years several methods dsts were developed to select technologies that achieve the required level of treatment and prioritize treatment methods considering multiple factors 24 25 some of the methods considered only technical aspects some included both technical and economic factors and others used more integrated systems to account for social environmental economic and institutional features 26 28 in most cases the technical problems e g effective removal of contaminants are given a priority in decision making economic viability and cost are usually the second major objective 26 29 the more comprehensive approaches include the interactions among technical economic institutional regulatory social and environmental factors 26 30 multi criteria decision analysis mcda and multi objective optimization moo methods have been developed for the selection of treatment trains 27 mcda methods are applied to discrete problems with relatively fewer sets of alternatives in contrast to moo approaches that are applicable to continuous problems with a large set of alternatives defined by a set of constraints and objective functions a wide range of mcda methods such as the analytical hierarchy process ahp 31 the elimination and choice expressing the reality electre and the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee have been used for treatment process selection 32 ahp applies trade off method that assigns weights to different objectives and a pair wise comparison of alternatives and electre and promethee use outranking techniques mcda methods such as ahp could be unsuitable for selection of a treatment train because of the very large number of comparisons involved based on the moo approach various models were applied to wastewater treatment train selection such as a linear programming model 33 35 dynamic programming model 36 and nonlinear programming models 33 integer programming is another moo method for multi criteria rating of alternatives 37 more sophisticated linear and non linear programming methods have also been used in water treatment problems 38 39 linear programming is often initially used to get good starting points for the non linear optimization models 40 41 other moo approaches include evolutionary 42 and genetic algorithms ga 43 1 3 development of a user friendly integrated decision support tool idst in this study the moo approach was adopted in the development of idst to optimize the decision process from a large set of alternatives with multiple constraints and objective functions another critical feature of an idst is the need to have a user friendly interface to allow users to input data and view outputs for this purpose the excel visual basic for applications vba can be used numerous dsts have been developed however only few have been applied to solve real world problems 44 some models are too complicated for non expert users and some operate in a black box mode which makes it difficult for users to effectively execute the models or trust the modeling output 45 one way to enhance the usability of a dst is to develop a simple to use but a rigorous model with a user friendly interface 46 47 the idst graphical user interface allows users to modify or assign weights to selection criteria include or exclude treatment processes define feed water quality and quantity choose intended reuse options and visualize results including treatment trains and cost and energy requirements several of the existing dsts consider only major technical and economic factors such as contaminant removal efficiency capital cost or both for selecting a water treatment process however many recognize that designing a water treatment process should consider an integrated system analysis approach where other factors are also considered 26 30 therefore we developed an idst that considers comprehensive technical economic and environmental criteria in addition to conventional and emerging treatment technologies the idst includes considerations for nutrient and energy recovery from wastewater non quantifiable criteria such as modularity and operator oversight are treated subjectively through user scoring and ranking while quantifiable criteria such as energy demand and cost are determined quantitatively the idst provides flexibility to users by changing weights to treatment method selection criteria users can also limit the number of treatment technologies to be included or excluded in the selection process to those that are applicable to their site for existing wastewater treatment plants users can utilize the idst to determine if additional technologies are needed to meet improved water quality requirements 2 methodology this section describes the conceptual framework or the logic model for the idst development inputs to the tool a comprehensive list of state of the science treatment methods and corresponding treatment capacities the logic model includes an optimization module that determines an effective treatment train iteratively until target water quality and other user defined constraints are met considering cost energy demand and other criteria the conceptual framework of development of the idst and details about water quality database treatment methods beneficial use water quality requirements and the optimization approach are presented 2 1 conceptual framework logic model the idst selects the best treatment train with respect to economic and technical criteria that meets water quality requirements for user specified beneficial use option the first version of the tool 48 was developed for produced water treatment and reuse based on mcda with a simple additive weighting saw approach this method required defining alternatives i e treatment trains in advance by selecting a treatment method or a combination of treatment methods that can provide treatment to each water quality constituent the selected treatment methods were then organized into a master list of treatment trains by performing a permutation with a procedure to remove duplicates this master list can be quite long if a large number of treatment methods are capable of meeting the treatment goals once the alternatives were identified the saw method was applied to rank the alternatives the saw method is an mcda approach that requires listing alternatives in advance and are applicable to a relatively fewer sets of alternatives the upgraded idst uses an alternative moo approach in contrast to the mcda method moo approaches are applicable to a large set of alternatives and attempt to find solutions to multi objective problems defined by a set of constraints and do not require defining alternatives in advance in addition moo models have robust gradient based algorithms and built in global optimization solvers to search for the global optimum solution the moo approach provides better flexibility because it allows defining constraints discussed in section 2 6 that limit the selection of certain treatment technologies and an objective function the idst has a built in water quality database for several oil and gas production sites for sites not included in the database the tool has an option for users to use site specific data the tool includes water quality requirements for each of the constituents required for different beneficial use options based on feed and target water quality contaminants requiring treatment are identified and the level of treatment required is calculated the idst includes a list of conventional and state of the science treatment technologies outputs from the tool include selected treatment trains costs and energy requirements and list of constituents that should be treated to meet reuse water quality the conceptual framework for the treatment selection process is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 water quality database the idst has a built in water quality database for i unconventional oil and gas produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback water including coalbed methane cbm and shale gas across different regions of the united states ii water associated or in the vicinity of geothermal resources iii domestic and industrial wastewater iv seawater v surface water and vi brackish groundwater the database includes 46 constituents and their respective concentrations the cbm produced water database is comprised of wellhead data from coalbed methane wells across the rocky mountain region including the powder river raton and san juan basins 48 49 data sources include public records private historical data from producers and data from hundreds of sampled wells and discharge points in the different states producing basins and coal formations the water quality data for shale gas produced water were collected from collaborative producers the u s geological survey s usgs national produced waters geochemical database v2 1 provisional marcellus shale coalition shale gas produced water database new mexico water and infrastructure data system and new mexico oil conservation division the idst also includes water quality data from geothermal sites including geothermal brines and impaired water co located with geothermal resource with the purpose of assessing the viability of desalination using low grade geothermal heat data from geothermal basins in regions of texas new mexico colorado arizona utah nevada and southern california are included 50 53 the spatial and temporal average concentrations are used in the treatment selection process however when a large number of datasets are available the tool provides the 25th percentile median and 75th percentile values 2 3 treatment technologies the idst includes 62 standalone and hybrid configurations of treatment technologies table 1 and their removal capacities for each water quality constituent for the selection of pre treatment physical chemical biological desalination and post treatment processes the comprehensive literature review and detailed technical assessment of the treatment technologies can be found in the report published by the u s department of energy 54 this technical assessment includes generic treatment processes and commercial packages developed for treatment of oil and gas produced water and zero liquid discharge zld the results of literature review and technical assessment were used as basis in the development of the idst 2 4 treatment selection a multi objective optimization moo approach the idst selects water treatment technologies using an moo approach for defined objective functions and constraints in idst the multiple objectives include the economic and technical criteria used in the selection process moo techniques may involve conflicting objectives and thus involve to a certain extent a trade off between different objectives some judgment therefore is needed to set up the priorities for the various objective functions e g economic versus technical moo schemes are usually converted to a single objective function and the resulting problem is solved as a single optimization problem the solution in single objective optimization can be regarded as optimal when the objective function achieves the smallest or largest value minimization or maximization problems respectively within the solution space defined by constraints when dealing with conflicting objective functions the solution can be seen as optimal when no objective function value can be improved without compromising some other objectives for example a relatively lower cost treatment process may not require a higher operator skill but may require a larger footprint when quantities in the objective function are different e g technical versus economic normalization is used to ensure consistency the normalized objective functions can then be defined using a weighted sum approach weights are usually applied to each objective function criterion based on professional judgment regarding the importance of each criterion to the decision making the weighted sum method allows the moo problem to be casted as a single objective optimization problem 2 5 idst objective function the idst objective function is formulated from treatment selection criteria the idst selects the best treatment train with respect to quantifiable and non quantifiable criteria while meeting water quality requirements there is a total of 15 criteria included in the objective function of which four are quantifiable and eleven are non quantifiable table 2 facility capital costs and operation and maintenance o m costs are calculated for each treatment process the capital costs for each treatment process are calculated as a function of treatment capacity daily flow rate using empirical relations obtained from literature and experience from engineering firms for design and construction of water works 55 the capital costs are amortized to annual costs based on user defined interest rate and period of service for each treatment technology annual o m costs include costs for energy labor chemicals treatment supplies and for leasing public land the total annual cost is calculated as the sum of annualized capital costs and annual o m costs a general description of capital o m and other costs is listed in table 3 in the formulation of the objective function weights and rankings are used to define preference among treatment processes the weights assigned by the user are used to define the importance of each criterion in table 2 in the treatment selection process while ranks pre defined by experts in the tool are used to reflect the merit of each treatment method with respect to a criterion thus weights consider the relative importance of a criterion while rankings compare the relative suitability of each treatment method with respect to a criterion weights ranging from 1 to 5 are assigned qualitatively for all the 15 criteria in table 2 a different approach is used for quantifiable and non quantifiable criteria in ranking the treatment methods with respect to a criterion for non quantifiable criteria an approach similar to weighting is used the treatment technologies are ranked from 1 to 5 based on the merits of the treatment methods with respect to a criterion for the quantifiable criteria costs energy and chemical demand are calculated for each treatment method and the outputs are normalized between 1 and 5 so all criteria are treated the same way in the objective function weights defined by users indicate the relative importance of each criterion while the ranks defined by expert and built in the model compare the treatment methods based on each criterion users can assign a weight of zero to one or more of the criteria to exclude the criteria this way user can use only one criterion e g capital cost or energy requirement or more in the decision making by assigning the rest of the criteria a value of zero for example if the user has a site where space is freely available they would assign a lower weight to footprint criteria or zero if it is totally irrelevant however if space is limited they would score this as 5 in contrast the expert ranks are assigned to each treatment method based on the merits of the specific technology with respect to a criterion thus the expert ranking is assigned to each treatment method depending on relative footprint requirement of specific treatment method regardless of availability of space a total score s is calculated for each treatment method based on both rankings and weights the combined score for each treatment method with respect to a criterion i is defined as the sum product of rankings and weights 1 s i 1 m w i r i where s represents a score based on both user assigned weights and expert assigned scores for each treatment method wi is weight assigned by the user to criteria i ri is expert assigned ranking to criteria i i varies from 1 to m where m is the number of criteria listed in table 2 eq 1 provides a score for each treatment method a method that has a lower combined score s is preferred to a method with relatively high total score providing that both methods satisfy required removal efficiency the total score for all treatment methods given by the sum product of the scores of individual treatment methods given by eq 2 is the final score used in decision making thus the multi objective function is defined as 2 o b j v a l u e min j 1 n s j x j o r min j 1 n i 1 m w i r i x j where objvalue is the value of the objective function total scores considering all treatment methods sj is the score calculated for one treatment method using eq 1 xj is a binary decision variable with a value of 0 or 1 during the optimization process xj becomes zero if a treatment method is not selected and 1 if selected a treatment train is selected based on achieving minimum objvalue the goal is to minimize objvalue e g cost if cost is the only criteria and select a combination of treatment methods that minimizes objvalue note that this is subject to constraints that are chosen by the user as discussed in section 2 6 2 6 model constraints the objective function is formulated such that the best treatment method is selected with respect to quantifiable and non quantifiable criteria equally important is meeting the treatment efficiency or end use water quality requirements for selected use options and other constraints defined by the user thus the approach forces the idst to select a combination of effective treatment methods with lower total score as defined by eq 2 while meeting the constraints besides the constraint to meet the target water quality selected by the user there are other constrains included in the idst to provide further flexibility to the user for example 1 some contaminants that may cause scaling and fouling should be removed before a desalination process 2 users utilities may want to retain existing treatment methods and optimize others alternatively they may want to exclude and include a treatment method because of some site specific reasons and 3 some treatment methods cannot be used for some salinity levels or water temperature range the inclusion of such functionality defined as constraints in the optimization model makes the idst a flexible and robust tool model constraints and equations used to implement these constraints are discussed here in more details 2 6 1 constraint 1 meeting water quality requirements for selected beneficial use options the treatment efficiency provided by the treatment train should be greater than or equal to the efficiency required to meet water quality requirement for user specified beneficial use options the water quality database has a list of contaminants and concentrations for different types of unconventional water and locations and water quality concentration goals for a variety of end use options the tool also provides options for the users to define input and output concentrations the contaminants requiring treatment are selected based on comparison of concentration in the input cinput and concentration required for intended use option coutput the required removal efficiency r is calculated as 3 r c i n p u t c o u t p u t c i n p u t 100 treatment methods selected through the optimization process should have a combined treatment efficiency greater than r for the number of treatment methods n the combined treatment efficiency e from several treatment methods in series can be calculated as 4 1 1 1 e 1 1 e 2 1 e n 1 j 1 n 1 e j thus constraint for pretreatment requirement for each contaminant can be written as 5 1 j 1 n 1 e j x j r where the left side of the equation represents the combined removal efficiency provided by the treatment train ej is the treatment efficiency for each treatment method xj is the decision variable n is the number of treatment methods evaluated and r is removal efficiency required by a user selected reuse option thus eq 5 implies the combined treatment capacity efficiency provided by all processes should be greater than removal efficiency required by a user selected end use option 2 6 2 constraint 2 meeting scaling and fouling requirements scaling and fouling are primary concerns when desalination processes are used for treatment scaling occurs on membranes when the concentration of scale forming species exceeds saturation fouling occurs when suspended solids microbes and organic materials deposit on the membrane surface 56 the idst includes a step by step process to determine 1 if desalination would be needed and 2 if concentration of constituents exceeds the limit required to protect membrane or heat exchanger surface from fouling and scaling and determines methods to avoid fouling and scaling i e pre treatment the pretreatment efficiency required to protect membranes is calculated using the total flux and scalant program tfsp 57 the tfsp program calculates solubility conditions for the feed and concentrate streams the program returns the ionic concentration of each stream and calculates the scaling index for the potential scaling species using either standard practice for calculation and adjustment of the langelier saturation index 58 methods or methods based on ion complex calculations the tfsp module calculates the langelier saturation index lsi and saturation degrees for caso4 srso4 baso4 and sio2 the module was adapted to identify contaminants with concentrations that may cause scaling required input concentrations for calculation of scaling potential include ionic strength ph barium calcium silica strontium sulfate carbonate bicarbonate and iron for number of pretreatment methods n combined treatment efficiency from several pre treatment methods in series can be calculated as 6 1 1 1 f 1 1 f 2 1 f n 1 j 1 n 1 f j thus constraint for pretreatment requirement for constituent k can be written as 7 1 j 1 n 1 f j x j p k where fj is the treatment efficiency for each pretreatment method xj is the decision variable xj is zero if a pretreatment method is not selected and 1 if selected and pk is removal efficiency for constituent k needed before the water goes to the desalination step eq 7 implies the combined treatment efficiency percent removal provided by pretreatment methods should be greater than removal efficiency needed to minimize scaling before the desalination step the required percent removal p for each constituent depends on the treatment efficiency required to protect membranes from scaling and fouling for the non linear constraints such as constraint 2 a non linear programming option generalized reduced gradient grg solver option was used to solve the optimization problem unlike the simplex lp linear programing solver option a poorly scaled non linear problem may generate results that are suboptimal or otherwise very different from expectations this could be improved using automatic scaling options or by using starting values for the variables so that the solver does not get trapped in a region of slow improvement linear programming is often initially used to get good starting points for the non linear model variables 41 to ensure a faster convergence a linear model was applied prior to running the grg non linear option by defining the combined treatment efficiency from the different treatment methods as the sum of treatment capacities instead of a product this has considerably reduced the time required for convergence and the results the treatment train were evaluated in the context of the constituents treated that is also an output from the idst the results are then compared to outputs from the general algebraic modeling system gams model gams is a high level modeling system for mathematical optimization designed for solving linear nonlinear and mixed integer optimization problems 2 6 3 constraint 3 including and excluding specific treatment methods in final treatment train the optimization model selects treatment methods that are preferred with respect to criteria discusses earlier however it may happen that a user may need to include a specific pre treatment or desalination method for other reasons like mobility cost or because it is an existing treatment method already in use at the site the constraint defined below allows the user to include a treatment method of interest in the final treatment train 8 j 1 n t j x j t where tj is a user preference parameter the user sets tj to 1 to include a treatment j in the final treatment otherwise zero t is the total number of user selected treatment methods the constraint forces the treatment method selected by the user to be included in the final train a user may want to exclude one of the treatment methods pretreatment or desalination process for some site specific reason the approach used to exclude a treatment method is assigning a treatment capacity of zero to the treatment method so the tool will automatically exclude the treatment method from the final solution because selecting it will not improve treatment instead it increases cost 2 6 4 other constraints the structure of the optimization model allows addition of constraints to add flexibility of the tool to adapt it to new user or expert defined rules the following constraints are included to improve the flexibility of the idst in addition to the constraints discussed above 1 it may not be desirable to have treatment methods with similar purpose in series e g ceramic and polymeric microfiltration ultrafiltration or media filter and green sand filter the tool has a constraint function that limits overlapping treatment methods with the same purpose 2 for thermal and membrane process the tool applies threshold values for temperature and brine concentration to select a thermal process over a membrane process when temperature and brine concentration thresholds are exceeded regardless of cost or other criteria 3 the idst has a constraint to preclude or include the selection of some treatment methods depending on source water type and intended beneficial use and 4 the idst gives flexibility to choose one source of energy over another depending on the availability for example the idst may select a membrane process requiring electrical energy because of cost the user can constrain the tool to choose a thermal process that requires heat energy if heat energy is the preferred or an available energy source these constraints give the tool flexibility and feedbacks from the user additional constraints can easily be added 2 7 user interface the user interface design and the level of interactivity are important factors for broader use of any dst a user interface should facilitate easy quantitative data input in addition to allowing user intervention to change alternatives 46 47 usually little attention is given to the user interface when a dst is intended as a conceptual demonstration or evaluation of approaches 42 or when it is intended for a highly specific use or for expert users who are more concerned with the theory behind the decision process 59 60 for a dst intended to be used by a wide range of users who may not be modelers it is preferred that the user interface allows easy and active interaction interactivity can be in the form of adding the ability to monitor the decision process and or set constraints or rules that reflect the user s preferences or giving a warning message if any design standards are violated 46 61 62 it is important that the user interface integrates the various underlying modules often it is also important to have a help tool to guide the user through the system 61 63 the design of the idst shown in fig 2 is organized to include attributes of a simple to use user interface the user can easily modify the input including such as water quality inputs units flow rate beneficial use inputs and others within each input the user has the ability to change and modify various factors that affect the outcome of the idst user can then run idst and visualize the outputs also from the user interface 3 idst test cases performance evaluation four scenarios were studied to evaluate the performance of the idst including treating municipal wastewater for potable use and agricultural irrigation and treating geothermal water for surface discharge and power plant cooling water produced water case study is described in detail in part ii of the idst series papers 64 the current version of the idst does not have an automatic sensitivity and uncertainty analysis module users can manually change some of the inputs to evaluate how model outputs change sensitivity of treatment costs versus feed water quality and flow rate is shown in the supplementary content as an example 3 1 water quality water qualities of each source water and end use requirements are summarized in table 4 and 5 it should be noted agricultural water quality requirement is for general uses depending on the crops and soil types other specific water quality parameters may be required such as different values of sodium adsorption ratio sar specific ions and ph 65 potable use water quality requirements are based on the primary and secondary drinking water standards set by the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2 66 power plant cooling water quality requirements were extracted from the reports by consulting companies and published by the department of energy national energy technology laboratory doe netl 67 68 it should be noted that the water quality parameters listed in tables 4 and 5 are for the case study purpose to demonstrate the use of the idst the water quality considerations are more complex such as including the removal of organic contaminants of emerging concern e g pharmaceuticals personnel care products etc heavy metals volatile and semi volatile organic compounds and disinfection byproducts 3 2 case study assumptions the case studies were conducted for a 3785 m3 day 1 million gallons per day mgd treatment capacity with a series of assumptions on economic factors annualized capital costs were estimated by assuming 15 year lifetime of facilities and 8 5 annual interest rate in addition to equipment costs the capital costs included footprint cost by assigning footprint requirement of each treatment technology with land purchase rate at 20 000 acre land leasing option was also available at 10 000 acre per year labor cost was assumed at 40 000 year for un skilled labors a multiply factor of 2 88 was assigned for skilled labors working in treatment facilities electrical and thermal energy unit costs were assumed at 0 08 kwh an example of modeling parameters and cost information is shown in fig 3 idst screenshot 3 3 case study results the modeling results of treatment trains and product water qualities for the four case study scenarios are summarized in tables 6 and 7 respectively to reuse municipal wastewater for potable application a list of contaminants that exceed targeted water quality requirements and need to be removed included suspended solids ammonia organic matter in terms of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 bacteria and viruses the idst selected a treatment train with primary sedimentation activated sludge system denitrification media filtration and chemical disinfection activated sludge degrades organic contaminants in wastewater and reduces bod5 ammonia was removed through nitrification by oxidizing ammonia to nitrate followed by denitrification and turned into nitrogen gas media filtration removes suspended solids in wastewater potable water strictly requires low number of bacteria and no virus thus chemical disinfection is mandatory in this study the removal of contaminants of emerging concern cecs was not considered because many of them are not regulated in the current primary or secondary drinking water standards for direct or indirect potable water reuse high pressure membrane such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation processes would be selected if the cecs are included in the feed water and targeted water quality requirements to reuse municipal wastewater for irrigation the treatment train including primary sedimentation biological aerated filter baf media filtration clarifier and chemical disinfection was selected by the idst no desalination process was required as the salinity level of municipal wastewater is lower than irrigation requirement standards baf was selected by the idst to remove bod5 from source water for irrigation instead of activated sludge for potable use activated sludge had higher cost of operation and resulted in the higher annualized cost 4 1 kgal besides activated sludge required larger footprint than baf media filtration and clarifier were selected to further remove the suspended solids in the secondary effluent no specific bacteria and virus standards are listed in default crop irrigation water requirement but they should be required for fruits and vegetable irrigation thus disinfection was required municipal wastewater has sodium adsorption ratio sar value of 16 which is acceptable to moderate tolerance crops such as rice oats and beans high sar may result in dispersion of soil particles and reduces water and air infiltration rates for more sensitive crops such as fruits and nuts desalination processes will be required for reuse of reclaimed municipal water which will result in higher costs the geothermal water chosen for the case study was produced water from hidalgo county in east texas with salinity level at approximately 23 600 mg l for surface discharge of this geothermal water desalination process was required mechanical vapor compression mvc was selected by the idst considering its higher salinity and higher temperature the high temperature of feed geothermal water reduced energy demand for mvc process by reducing the energy required to vaporize the water chemical softening and media filtration were adopted as pretreatment processes to reduce total hardness and suspended solids for desalination process because mvc process removed all dissolved salts from feed water and the product water became corrosive post treatment was required by either adding alkalinity into the product water or by blending the product water with brackish water at a proper ratio to reduce the impact on surface water systems power plant cooling system requires water quality with low hardness but has higher tolerance of tds at 70 000 mg l no tds removal was required to reuse geothermal water for power plant cooling system chemical softening was selected to reduce total hardness followed by media filtration to prevent excessive suspended solids generated by chemical softening going into the cooling system a cooling tower would be required to cool down the geothermal water for power plant cooling the costs and energy consumptions of the four scenarios are summarized in table 8 energy consumption for reusing municipal wastewater was primarily for pumping and aeration reusing municipal wastewater for potable use had higher capital cost and energy demand than for agricultural irrigation because denitrification process was required for other cases with higher bod in source municipal wastewater baf might not be capable of achieving the water quality requirements and activated sludge would be adopted resulting in lower overall cost for irrigation reuse different soil types also require different sars to prevent high sodium impact and thus higher reuse costs use of geothermal water for surface discharge required desalination which increased the capital cost o m cost and energy requirement mvc was selected to treat the highly saline geothermal water for surface discharge the actual electric energy consumption and unit cost would be lower than the idst result because geothermal water provides low grade heat thus reducing the energy requirement to vaporize feed water the cost of reusing for power plant cooling system was much lower than for surface discharge because desalination was not required however the overall cost would increase as extra cooling process was required to cool down the geothermal water 4 summary and conclusions decision support tools dsts are critical to integrate multiple criteria and objective functions in decision making process however most dsts involve only a limited number of criteria particularly costs the idst developed in this study is a comprehensive tool that considers multiple factors including technical energy demand and economic criteria that are quantifiable and non quantifiable in the selection of treatment methods for unconventional water treatment management and beneficial uses the tool has a built in water quality database for various types of source waters and end use water quality requirements the water quality database includes cbm and shale gas produced water hydraulic fracturing flowback water impaired water co located with geothermal resources domestic wastewater and saline water the tool also allows users to input their own feed and target water quality data a constrained multi objective optimization moo approach is implemented with a graphical user interface for users to change inputs such as criteria weights costs and energy demand allowing a higher level of interactivity the graphical user interface allows altering constraints that may result in a different set of treatment trains the case studies demonstrated that the tool was capable of suggesting appropriate treatment trains for various unconventional water supplies while the current version of the tool can be implemented to generate useful information on the treatment methods required for beneficial use of non traditional waters and associated costs improvements could be made to future version that considers indirect benefits from use of alternative waters translated to monetary values the indirect social and environmental benefits can be assessed such as using triple bottom line tbl approach and should be integrated to the next version of the idst the translation of the social and additional environmental benefits into monetary values may further increase the overall net benefits and can give better insight to the decision making process regarding disposal and other end use options acknowledgements the authors thank the funding agencies including research partnership to secure energy for america program administered by

14527,the treatment and use of non traditional water supplies such as saline water domestic wastewater and produced water from the oil and gas industry has been recognized as a viable solution to address water scarcity a visual basic for applications vba based integrated decision support tool idst was developed to select a combination of treatment technologies or treatment trains for different types of alternative water and beneficial use options such as potable use crop irrigation livestock watering hydraulic fracturing well drilling environmental restoration and other industrial applications the tool integrates costs and treatment capacities of a broad range of treatment technologies from pretreatment conventional to advanced technologies and post treatment the idst is fully automated and selects treatment trains based on input data such as feed water quality target water quality requirements and treatment selection criteria including technical energy demand and economic criteria the idst starts with a comprehensive water quality database then selects the most effective treatment trains that could meet water quality requirement for user selected beneficial use options with respect to multiple technical and economic criteria the idst was evaluated based on four case studies including municipal wastewater for potable reuse and irrigation and geothermal water for surface discharge and power plant cooling the idst selected cost effective treatment trains capable of producing the water quality required for end uses given site specific conditions and feed water quality the idst provides a comprehensive tool to evaluate potential water treatment and end use options with consideration of multiple criteria functions objectives and constraints keywords integrated decision support tool treatment technology multi objective optimization non traditional water supplies produced water 1 introduction 1 1 use of non traditional water supplies intensive industrial agricultural and urban development along with frequently occurring droughts and population growth have increased pressure on limited fresh water resources 1 4 use of non traditional water supplies is becoming a viable solution to address water scarcity and with advances in treatment technologies reuse of municipal wastewater has extended beyond the traditional irrigation to other applications such as drinking and industrial uses 5 7 for a community of one million reuse of reclaimed water can offset water supply by about 285 000 m3 75 million gallons per day 8 in addition 2 4 3 2 billion m3 15 20 6 billion barrels of produced water is generated per year in the united states during oil and gas extraction 9 10 reuse of treated produced water and fracking flowback water for hydraulic fracturing irrigation and even drinking water supply has been investigated 11 15 in addition to augmenting water supply water reuse decreases the diversion of water from sensitive ecosystems and reduces environmental impact due to wastewater discharges 6 16 19 reuse of treated produced water can also alleviate concerns related to probable seismic activity induced by deep well injection 20 the quality of non traditional waters is highly variable for example urban wastewater constituents include suspended and dissolved solids nitrogen phosphorus organics and pathogens produced water quality varies depending on the geographic location geologic formation and type of hydrocarbons produced major constituents in produced water include suspended solids salts oil and grease sometimes naturally occurring radioactive materials and other organic and inorganic compounds benko and drewes reported that total dissolved solids tds concentrations in produced water vary between 1000 and 400 000 mg l 21 a thorough understanding of water quality is essential for selecting water treatment technologies to reclaim water to target quality for different end uses various treatment processes and systems are capable of removing contaminants from non traditional waters to meet end use requirements thus a set of selection criteria must be applied to narrow down the number of effective treatment processes and trains 22 23 the selection criteria may include capital cost operating and maintenance o m costs space footprint requirement commercial availability mobility and energy demand based on the criteria selected and prioritized by a user a decision support tool dst that combines a large number of selection criteria can suggest efficient treatment trains capable of treating non traditional waters to the target water quality required for beneficial use or discharge to the environment 1 2 overview of dsts for selection of treatment technologies in recent years several methods dsts were developed to select technologies that achieve the required level of treatment and prioritize treatment methods considering multiple factors 24 25 some of the methods considered only technical aspects some included both technical and economic factors and others used more integrated systems to account for social environmental economic and institutional features 26 28 in most cases the technical problems e g effective removal of contaminants are given a priority in decision making economic viability and cost are usually the second major objective 26 29 the more comprehensive approaches include the interactions among technical economic institutional regulatory social and environmental factors 26 30 multi criteria decision analysis mcda and multi objective optimization moo methods have been developed for the selection of treatment trains 27 mcda methods are applied to discrete problems with relatively fewer sets of alternatives in contrast to moo approaches that are applicable to continuous problems with a large set of alternatives defined by a set of constraints and objective functions a wide range of mcda methods such as the analytical hierarchy process ahp 31 the elimination and choice expressing the reality electre and the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee have been used for treatment process selection 32 ahp applies trade off method that assigns weights to different objectives and a pair wise comparison of alternatives and electre and promethee use outranking techniques mcda methods such as ahp could be unsuitable for selection of a treatment train because of the very large number of comparisons involved based on the moo approach various models were applied to wastewater treatment train selection such as a linear programming model 33 35 dynamic programming model 36 and nonlinear programming models 33 integer programming is another moo method for multi criteria rating of alternatives 37 more sophisticated linear and non linear programming methods have also been used in water treatment problems 38 39 linear programming is often initially used to get good starting points for the non linear optimization models 40 41 other moo approaches include evolutionary 42 and genetic algorithms ga 43 1 3 development of a user friendly integrated decision support tool idst in this study the moo approach was adopted in the development of idst to optimize the decision process from a large set of alternatives with multiple constraints and objective functions another critical feature of an idst is the need to have a user friendly interface to allow users to input data and view outputs for this purpose the excel visual basic for applications vba can be used numerous dsts have been developed however only few have been applied to solve real world problems 44 some models are too complicated for non expert users and some operate in a black box mode which makes it difficult for users to effectively execute the models or trust the modeling output 45 one way to enhance the usability of a dst is to develop a simple to use but a rigorous model with a user friendly interface 46 47 the idst graphical user interface allows users to modify or assign weights to selection criteria include or exclude treatment processes define feed water quality and quantity choose intended reuse options and visualize results including treatment trains and cost and energy requirements several of the existing dsts consider only major technical and economic factors such as contaminant removal efficiency capital cost or both for selecting a water treatment process however many recognize that designing a water treatment process should consider an integrated system analysis approach where other factors are also considered 26 30 therefore we developed an idst that considers comprehensive technical economic and environmental criteria in addition to conventional and emerging treatment technologies the idst includes considerations for nutrient and energy recovery from wastewater non quantifiable criteria such as modularity and operator oversight are treated subjectively through user scoring and ranking while quantifiable criteria such as energy demand and cost are determined quantitatively the idst provides flexibility to users by changing weights to treatment method selection criteria users can also limit the number of treatment technologies to be included or excluded in the selection process to those that are applicable to their site for existing wastewater treatment plants users can utilize the idst to determine if additional technologies are needed to meet improved water quality requirements 2 methodology this section describes the conceptual framework or the logic model for the idst development inputs to the tool a comprehensive list of state of the science treatment methods and corresponding treatment capacities the logic model includes an optimization module that determines an effective treatment train iteratively until target water quality and other user defined constraints are met considering cost energy demand and other criteria the conceptual framework of development of the idst and details about water quality database treatment methods beneficial use water quality requirements and the optimization approach are presented 2 1 conceptual framework logic model the idst selects the best treatment train with respect to economic and technical criteria that meets water quality requirements for user specified beneficial use option the first version of the tool 48 was developed for produced water treatment and reuse based on mcda with a simple additive weighting saw approach this method required defining alternatives i e treatment trains in advance by selecting a treatment method or a combination of treatment methods that can provide treatment to each water quality constituent the selected treatment methods were then organized into a master list of treatment trains by performing a permutation with a procedure to remove duplicates this master list can be quite long if a large number of treatment methods are capable of meeting the treatment goals once the alternatives were identified the saw method was applied to rank the alternatives the saw method is an mcda approach that requires listing alternatives in advance and are applicable to a relatively fewer sets of alternatives the upgraded idst uses an alternative moo approach in contrast to the mcda method moo approaches are applicable to a large set of alternatives and attempt to find solutions to multi objective problems defined by a set of constraints and do not require defining alternatives in advance in addition moo models have robust gradient based algorithms and built in global optimization solvers to search for the global optimum solution the moo approach provides better flexibility because it allows defining constraints discussed in section 2 6 that limit the selection of certain treatment technologies and an objective function the idst has a built in water quality database for several oil and gas production sites for sites not included in the database the tool has an option for users to use site specific data the tool includes water quality requirements for each of the constituents required for different beneficial use options based on feed and target water quality contaminants requiring treatment are identified and the level of treatment required is calculated the idst includes a list of conventional and state of the science treatment technologies outputs from the tool include selected treatment trains costs and energy requirements and list of constituents that should be treated to meet reuse water quality the conceptual framework for the treatment selection process is illustrated in fig 1 2 2 water quality database the idst has a built in water quality database for i unconventional oil and gas produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback water including coalbed methane cbm and shale gas across different regions of the united states ii water associated or in the vicinity of geothermal resources iii domestic and industrial wastewater iv seawater v surface water and vi brackish groundwater the database includes 46 constituents and their respective concentrations the cbm produced water database is comprised of wellhead data from coalbed methane wells across the rocky mountain region including the powder river raton and san juan basins 48 49 data sources include public records private historical data from producers and data from hundreds of sampled wells and discharge points in the different states producing basins and coal formations the water quality data for shale gas produced water were collected from collaborative producers the u s geological survey s usgs national produced waters geochemical database v2 1 provisional marcellus shale coalition shale gas produced water database new mexico water and infrastructure data system and new mexico oil conservation division the idst also includes water quality data from geothermal sites including geothermal brines and impaired water co located with geothermal resource with the purpose of assessing the viability of desalination using low grade geothermal heat data from geothermal basins in regions of texas new mexico colorado arizona utah nevada and southern california are included 50 53 the spatial and temporal average concentrations are used in the treatment selection process however when a large number of datasets are available the tool provides the 25th percentile median and 75th percentile values 2 3 treatment technologies the idst includes 62 standalone and hybrid configurations of treatment technologies table 1 and their removal capacities for each water quality constituent for the selection of pre treatment physical chemical biological desalination and post treatment processes the comprehensive literature review and detailed technical assessment of the treatment technologies can be found in the report published by the u s department of energy 54 this technical assessment includes generic treatment processes and commercial packages developed for treatment of oil and gas produced water and zero liquid discharge zld the results of literature review and technical assessment were used as basis in the development of the idst 2 4 treatment selection a multi objective optimization moo approach the idst selects water treatment technologies using an moo approach for defined objective functions and constraints in idst the multiple objectives include the economic and technical criteria used in the selection process moo techniques may involve conflicting objectives and thus involve to a certain extent a trade off between different objectives some judgment therefore is needed to set up the priorities for the various objective functions e g economic versus technical moo schemes are usually converted to a single objective function and the resulting problem is solved as a single optimization problem the solution in single objective optimization can be regarded as optimal when the objective function achieves the smallest or largest value minimization or maximization problems respectively within the solution space defined by constraints when dealing with conflicting objective functions the solution can be seen as optimal when no objective function value can be improved without compromising some other objectives for example a relatively lower cost treatment process may not require a higher operator skill but may require a larger footprint when quantities in the objective function are different e g technical versus economic normalization is used to ensure consistency the normalized objective functions can then be defined using a weighted sum approach weights are usually applied to each objective function criterion based on professional judgment regarding the importance of each criterion to the decision making the weighted sum method allows the moo problem to be casted as a single objective optimization problem 2 5 idst objective function the idst objective function is formulated from treatment selection criteria the idst selects the best treatment train with respect to quantifiable and non quantifiable criteria while meeting water quality requirements there is a total of 15 criteria included in the objective function of which four are quantifiable and eleven are non quantifiable table 2 facility capital costs and operation and maintenance o m costs are calculated for each treatment process the capital costs for each treatment process are calculated as a function of treatment capacity daily flow rate using empirical relations obtained from literature and experience from engineering firms for design and construction of water works 55 the capital costs are amortized to annual costs based on user defined interest rate and period of service for each treatment technology annual o m costs include costs for energy labor chemicals treatment supplies and for leasing public land the total annual cost is calculated as the sum of annualized capital costs and annual o m costs a general description of capital o m and other costs is listed in table 3 in the formulation of the objective function weights and rankings are used to define preference among treatment processes the weights assigned by the user are used to define the importance of each criterion in table 2 in the treatment selection process while ranks pre defined by experts in the tool are used to reflect the merit of each treatment method with respect to a criterion thus weights consider the relative importance of a criterion while rankings compare the relative suitability of each treatment method with respect to a criterion weights ranging from 1 to 5 are assigned qualitatively for all the 15 criteria in table 2 a different approach is used for quantifiable and non quantifiable criteria in ranking the treatment methods with respect to a criterion for non quantifiable criteria an approach similar to weighting is used the treatment technologies are ranked from 1 to 5 based on the merits of the treatment methods with respect to a criterion for the quantifiable criteria costs energy and chemical demand are calculated for each treatment method and the outputs are normalized between 1 and 5 so all criteria are treated the same way in the objective function weights defined by users indicate the relative importance of each criterion while the ranks defined by expert and built in the model compare the treatment methods based on each criterion users can assign a weight of zero to one or more of the criteria to exclude the criteria this way user can use only one criterion e g capital cost or energy requirement or more in the decision making by assigning the rest of the criteria a value of zero for example if the user has a site where space is freely available they would assign a lower weight to footprint criteria or zero if it is totally irrelevant however if space is limited they would score this as 5 in contrast the expert ranks are assigned to each treatment method based on the merits of the specific technology with respect to a criterion thus the expert ranking is assigned to each treatment method depending on relative footprint requirement of specific treatment method regardless of availability of space a total score s is calculated for each treatment method based on both rankings and weights the combined score for each treatment method with respect to a criterion i is defined as the sum product of rankings and weights 1 s i 1 m w i r i where s represents a score based on both user assigned weights and expert assigned scores for each treatment method wi is weight assigned by the user to criteria i ri is expert assigned ranking to criteria i i varies from 1 to m where m is the number of criteria listed in table 2 eq 1 provides a score for each treatment method a method that has a lower combined score s is preferred to a method with relatively high total score providing that both methods satisfy required removal efficiency the total score for all treatment methods given by the sum product of the scores of individual treatment methods given by eq 2 is the final score used in decision making thus the multi objective function is defined as 2 o b j v a l u e min j 1 n s j x j o r min j 1 n i 1 m w i r i x j where objvalue is the value of the objective function total scores considering all treatment methods sj is the score calculated for one treatment method using eq 1 xj is a binary decision variable with a value of 0 or 1 during the optimization process xj becomes zero if a treatment method is not selected and 1 if selected a treatment train is selected based on achieving minimum objvalue the goal is to minimize objvalue e g cost if cost is the only criteria and select a combination of treatment methods that minimizes objvalue note that this is subject to constraints that are chosen by the user as discussed in section 2 6 2 6 model constraints the objective function is formulated such that the best treatment method is selected with respect to quantifiable and non quantifiable criteria equally important is meeting the treatment efficiency or end use water quality requirements for selected use options and other constraints defined by the user thus the approach forces the idst to select a combination of effective treatment methods with lower total score as defined by eq 2 while meeting the constraints besides the constraint to meet the target water quality selected by the user there are other constrains included in the idst to provide further flexibility to the user for example 1 some contaminants that may cause scaling and fouling should be removed before a desalination process 2 users utilities may want to retain existing treatment methods and optimize others alternatively they may want to exclude and include a treatment method because of some site specific reasons and 3 some treatment methods cannot be used for some salinity levels or water temperature range the inclusion of such functionality defined as constraints in the optimization model makes the idst a flexible and robust tool model constraints and equations used to implement these constraints are discussed here in more details 2 6 1 constraint 1 meeting water quality requirements for selected beneficial use options the treatment efficiency provided by the treatment train should be greater than or equal to the efficiency required to meet water quality requirement for user specified beneficial use options the water quality database has a list of contaminants and concentrations for different types of unconventional water and locations and water quality concentration goals for a variety of end use options the tool also provides options for the users to define input and output concentrations the contaminants requiring treatment are selected based on comparison of concentration in the input cinput and concentration required for intended use option coutput the required removal efficiency r is calculated as 3 r c i n p u t c o u t p u t c i n p u t 100 treatment methods selected through the optimization process should have a combined treatment efficiency greater than r for the number of treatment methods n the combined treatment efficiency e from several treatment methods in series can be calculated as 4 1 1 1 e 1 1 e 2 1 e n 1 j 1 n 1 e j thus constraint for pretreatment requirement for each contaminant can be written as 5 1 j 1 n 1 e j x j r where the left side of the equation represents the combined removal efficiency provided by the treatment train ej is the treatment efficiency for each treatment method xj is the decision variable n is the number of treatment methods evaluated and r is removal efficiency required by a user selected reuse option thus eq 5 implies the combined treatment capacity efficiency provided by all processes should be greater than removal efficiency required by a user selected end use option 2 6 2 constraint 2 meeting scaling and fouling requirements scaling and fouling are primary concerns when desalination processes are used for treatment scaling occurs on membranes when the concentration of scale forming species exceeds saturation fouling occurs when suspended solids microbes and organic materials deposit on the membrane surface 56 the idst includes a step by step process to determine 1 if desalination would be needed and 2 if concentration of constituents exceeds the limit required to protect membrane or heat exchanger surface from fouling and scaling and determines methods to avoid fouling and scaling i e pre treatment the pretreatment efficiency required to protect membranes is calculated using the total flux and scalant program tfsp 57 the tfsp program calculates solubility conditions for the feed and concentrate streams the program returns the ionic concentration of each stream and calculates the scaling index for the potential scaling species using either standard practice for calculation and adjustment of the langelier saturation index 58 methods or methods based on ion complex calculations the tfsp module calculates the langelier saturation index lsi and saturation degrees for caso4 srso4 baso4 and sio2 the module was adapted to identify contaminants with concentrations that may cause scaling required input concentrations for calculation of scaling potential include ionic strength ph barium calcium silica strontium sulfate carbonate bicarbonate and iron for number of pretreatment methods n combined treatment efficiency from several pre treatment methods in series can be calculated as 6 1 1 1 f 1 1 f 2 1 f n 1 j 1 n 1 f j thus constraint for pretreatment requirement for constituent k can be written as 7 1 j 1 n 1 f j x j p k where fj is the treatment efficiency for each pretreatment method xj is the decision variable xj is zero if a pretreatment method is not selected and 1 if selected and pk is removal efficiency for constituent k needed before the water goes to the desalination step eq 7 implies the combined treatment efficiency percent removal provided by pretreatment methods should be greater than removal efficiency needed to minimize scaling before the desalination step the required percent removal p for each constituent depends on the treatment efficiency required to protect membranes from scaling and fouling for the non linear constraints such as constraint 2 a non linear programming option generalized reduced gradient grg solver option was used to solve the optimization problem unlike the simplex lp linear programing solver option a poorly scaled non linear problem may generate results that are suboptimal or otherwise very different from expectations this could be improved using automatic scaling options or by using starting values for the variables so that the solver does not get trapped in a region of slow improvement linear programming is often initially used to get good starting points for the non linear model variables 41 to ensure a faster convergence a linear model was applied prior to running the grg non linear option by defining the combined treatment efficiency from the different treatment methods as the sum of treatment capacities instead of a product this has considerably reduced the time required for convergence and the results the treatment train were evaluated in the context of the constituents treated that is also an output from the idst the results are then compared to outputs from the general algebraic modeling system gams model gams is a high level modeling system for mathematical optimization designed for solving linear nonlinear and mixed integer optimization problems 2 6 3 constraint 3 including and excluding specific treatment methods in final treatment train the optimization model selects treatment methods that are preferred with respect to criteria discusses earlier however it may happen that a user may need to include a specific pre treatment or desalination method for other reasons like mobility cost or because it is an existing treatment method already in use at the site the constraint defined below allows the user to include a treatment method of interest in the final treatment train 8 j 1 n t j x j t where tj is a user preference parameter the user sets tj to 1 to include a treatment j in the final treatment otherwise zero t is the total number of user selected treatment methods the constraint forces the treatment method selected by the user to be included in the final train a user may want to exclude one of the treatment methods pretreatment or desalination process for some site specific reason the approach used to exclude a treatment method is assigning a treatment capacity of zero to the treatment method so the tool will automatically exclude the treatment method from the final solution because selecting it will not improve treatment instead it increases cost 2 6 4 other constraints the structure of the optimization model allows addition of constraints to add flexibility of the tool to adapt it to new user or expert defined rules the following constraints are included to improve the flexibility of the idst in addition to the constraints discussed above 1 it may not be desirable to have treatment methods with similar purpose in series e g ceramic and polymeric microfiltration ultrafiltration or media filter and green sand filter the tool has a constraint function that limits overlapping treatment methods with the same purpose 2 for thermal and membrane process the tool applies threshold values for temperature and brine concentration to select a thermal process over a membrane process when temperature and brine concentration thresholds are exceeded regardless of cost or other criteria 3 the idst has a constraint to preclude or include the selection of some treatment methods depending on source water type and intended beneficial use and 4 the idst gives flexibility to choose one source of energy over another depending on the availability for example the idst may select a membrane process requiring electrical energy because of cost the user can constrain the tool to choose a thermal process that requires heat energy if heat energy is the preferred or an available energy source these constraints give the tool flexibility and feedbacks from the user additional constraints can easily be added 2 7 user interface the user interface design and the level of interactivity are important factors for broader use of any dst a user interface should facilitate easy quantitative data input in addition to allowing user intervention to change alternatives 46 47 usually little attention is given to the user interface when a dst is intended as a conceptual demonstration or evaluation of approaches 42 or when it is intended for a highly specific use or for expert users who are more concerned with the theory behind the decision process 59 60 for a dst intended to be used by a wide range of users who may not be modelers it is preferred that the user interface allows easy and active interaction interactivity can be in the form of adding the ability to monitor the decision process and or set constraints or rules that reflect the user s preferences or giving a warning message if any design standards are violated 46 61 62 it is important that the user interface integrates the various underlying modules often it is also important to have a help tool to guide the user through the system 61 63 the design of the idst shown in fig 2 is organized to include attributes of a simple to use user interface the user can easily modify the input including such as water quality inputs units flow rate beneficial use inputs and others within each input the user has the ability to change and modify various factors that affect the outcome of the idst user can then run idst and visualize the outputs also from the user interface 3 idst test cases performance evaluation four scenarios were studied to evaluate the performance of the idst including treating municipal wastewater for potable use and agricultural irrigation and treating geothermal water for surface discharge and power plant cooling water produced water case study is described in detail in part ii of the idst series papers 64 the current version of the idst does not have an automatic sensitivity and uncertainty analysis module users can manually change some of the inputs to evaluate how model outputs change sensitivity of treatment costs versus feed water quality and flow rate is shown in the supplementary content as an example 3 1 water quality water qualities of each source water and end use requirements are summarized in table 4 and 5 it should be noted agricultural water quality requirement is for general uses depending on the crops and soil types other specific water quality parameters may be required such as different values of sodium adsorption ratio sar specific ions and ph 65 potable use water quality requirements are based on the primary and secondary drinking water standards set by the u s environmental protection agency usepa 2 66 power plant cooling water quality requirements were extracted from the reports by consulting companies and published by the department of energy national energy technology laboratory doe netl 67 68 it should be noted that the water quality parameters listed in tables 4 and 5 are for the case study purpose to demonstrate the use of the idst the water quality considerations are more complex such as including the removal of organic contaminants of emerging concern e g pharmaceuticals personnel care products etc heavy metals volatile and semi volatile organic compounds and disinfection byproducts 3 2 case study assumptions the case studies were conducted for a 3785 m3 day 1 million gallons per day mgd treatment capacity with a series of assumptions on economic factors annualized capital costs were estimated by assuming 15 year lifetime of facilities and 8 5 annual interest rate in addition to equipment costs the capital costs included footprint cost by assigning footprint requirement of each treatment technology with land purchase rate at 20 000 acre land leasing option was also available at 10 000 acre per year labor cost was assumed at 40 000 year for un skilled labors a multiply factor of 2 88 was assigned for skilled labors working in treatment facilities electrical and thermal energy unit costs were assumed at 0 08 kwh an example of modeling parameters and cost information is shown in fig 3 idst screenshot 3 3 case study results the modeling results of treatment trains and product water qualities for the four case study scenarios are summarized in tables 6 and 7 respectively to reuse municipal wastewater for potable application a list of contaminants that exceed targeted water quality requirements and need to be removed included suspended solids ammonia organic matter in terms of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 bacteria and viruses the idst selected a treatment train with primary sedimentation activated sludge system denitrification media filtration and chemical disinfection activated sludge degrades organic contaminants in wastewater and reduces bod5 ammonia was removed through nitrification by oxidizing ammonia to nitrate followed by denitrification and turned into nitrogen gas media filtration removes suspended solids in wastewater potable water strictly requires low number of bacteria and no virus thus chemical disinfection is mandatory in this study the removal of contaminants of emerging concern cecs was not considered because many of them are not regulated in the current primary or secondary drinking water standards for direct or indirect potable water reuse high pressure membrane such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation processes would be selected if the cecs are included in the feed water and targeted water quality requirements to reuse municipal wastewater for irrigation the treatment train including primary sedimentation biological aerated filter baf media filtration clarifier and chemical disinfection was selected by the idst no desalination process was required as the salinity level of municipal wastewater is lower than irrigation requirement standards baf was selected by the idst to remove bod5 from source water for irrigation instead of activated sludge for potable use activated sludge had higher cost of operation and resulted in the higher annualized cost 4 1 kgal besides activated sludge required larger footprint than baf media filtration and clarifier were selected to further remove the suspended solids in the secondary effluent no specific bacteria and virus standards are listed in default crop irrigation water requirement but they should be required for fruits and vegetable irrigation thus disinfection was required municipal wastewater has sodium adsorption ratio sar value of 16 which is acceptable to moderate tolerance crops such as rice oats and beans high sar may result in dispersion of soil particles and reduces water and air infiltration rates for more sensitive crops such as fruits and nuts desalination processes will be required for reuse of reclaimed municipal water which will result in higher costs the geothermal water chosen for the case study was produced water from hidalgo county in east texas with salinity level at approximately 23 600 mg l for surface discharge of this geothermal water desalination process was required mechanical vapor compression mvc was selected by the idst considering its higher salinity and higher temperature the high temperature of feed geothermal water reduced energy demand for mvc process by reducing the energy required to vaporize the water chemical softening and media filtration were adopted as pretreatment processes to reduce total hardness and suspended solids for desalination process because mvc process removed all dissolved salts from feed water and the product water became corrosive post treatment was required by either adding alkalinity into the product water or by blending the product water with brackish water at a proper ratio to reduce the impact on surface water systems power plant cooling system requires water quality with low hardness but has higher tolerance of tds at 70 000 mg l no tds removal was required to reuse geothermal water for power plant cooling system chemical softening was selected to reduce total hardness followed by media filtration to prevent excessive suspended solids generated by chemical softening going into the cooling system a cooling tower would be required to cool down the geothermal water for power plant cooling the costs and energy consumptions of the four scenarios are summarized in table 8 energy consumption for reusing municipal wastewater was primarily for pumping and aeration reusing municipal wastewater for potable use had higher capital cost and energy demand than for agricultural irrigation because denitrification process was required for other cases with higher bod in source municipal wastewater baf might not be capable of achieving the water quality requirements and activated sludge would be adopted resulting in lower overall cost for irrigation reuse different soil types also require different sars to prevent high sodium impact and thus higher reuse costs use of geothermal water for surface discharge required desalination which increased the capital cost o m cost and energy requirement mvc was selected to treat the highly saline geothermal water for surface discharge the actual electric energy consumption and unit cost would be lower than the idst result because geothermal water provides low grade heat thus reducing the energy requirement to vaporize feed water the cost of reusing for power plant cooling system was much lower than for surface discharge because desalination was not required however the overall cost would increase as extra cooling process was required to cool down the geothermal water 4 summary and conclusions decision support tools dsts are critical to integrate multiple criteria and objective functions in decision making process however most dsts involve only a limited number of criteria particularly costs the idst developed in this study is a comprehensive tool that considers multiple factors including technical energy demand and economic criteria that are quantifiable and non quantifiable in the selection of treatment methods for unconventional water treatment management and beneficial uses the tool has a built in water quality database for various types of source waters and end use water quality requirements the water quality database includes cbm and shale gas produced water hydraulic fracturing flowback water impaired water co located with geothermal resources domestic wastewater and saline water the tool also allows users to input their own feed and target water quality data a constrained multi objective optimization moo approach is implemented with a graphical user interface for users to change inputs such as criteria weights costs and energy demand allowing a higher level of interactivity the graphical user interface allows altering constraints that may result in a different set of treatment trains the case studies demonstrated that the tool was capable of suggesting appropriate treatment trains for various unconventional water supplies while the current version of the tool can be implemented to generate useful information on the treatment methods required for beneficial use of non traditional waters and associated costs improvements could be made to future version that considers indirect benefits from use of alternative waters translated to monetary values the indirect social and environmental benefits can be assessed such as using triple bottom line tbl approach and should be integrated to the next version of the idst the translation of the social and additional environmental benefits into monetary values may further increase the overall net benefits and can give better insight to the decision making process regarding disposal and other end use options acknowledgements the authors thank the funding agencies including research partnership to secure energy for america program administered by

14528,the integrated use of two solid adsorbents with magnetic properties was studied with the aim of decontaminating an acid mine water the adsorbents were magnetic nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate mag nanocsh and magnetic manganese dioxide mag mno2 both of which consist of a crystalline fe3o4 nucleus surrounded by external amorphous layers of calcium silicate and manganese oxide respectively they were synthesised using simple quick and reproducible methods both adsorbents were characterised chemically physically and magnetically via different analytical techniques the particle size of the adsorbents varied between 60 and 200 nm which led to a tendency to agglomerate and the surface area varied between 30 and 70 m2 g the magnetic saturation of the absorbents was found to be around 57 59 emu g which is sufficient to ensure complete separation of these two compounds from an aqueous raffinate using a common magnet the nanostructure and microstructure of both adsorbents had many available adsorption sites and their chemical structure permitted efficient and simultaneous removal of cationic and anionic species present in aqueous solutions following different adsorption mechanisms the influence of the main variables on the adsorption of the ionic species was studied samples of an acid mine water were treated using both magnetic composites consecutively in the first step mag nanocsh was able to dramatically reduce the contents of many of the ions in the treated water then mag mno2 was added to the re acidified raffinate produced in the first step and the resulting final aqueous solution was found to comply with the chilean environmental regulations keywords magnetic adsorbents nanostructured adsorbents calcium silicate manganese dioxide remediation acid mine water 1 introduction mining and industrial operations are commonly recognised as some of the most polluting human activities they cause numerous environmental problems including the generation of solid and liquid wastes as well as the contamination of air by dust and gaseous emissions from pirometallurgical plants one of the main difficulties in such cases relates to the pollution of surface and underground waters by mining and metallurgical residual effluents or their contamination with natural acid mine drainages 1 this pollution poses both technical and economic problems these waters contain diverse toxic contaminants including suspended or dissolved heavy metals anions and oxyanions as arsenates and sulphates acidic and saline compounds and granular and colloidal type suspended fine solids which are quite difficult to remove 2 recently many technical options have been studied in order to remove these pollutants mostly metallic ions and some anionic species however none of these treatment alternatives can be considered optimal for example chemical precipitation 3 ion exchange with solid resins 4 solvent extraction 5 chelation 6 biological methods 7 membranes 8 and electrochemical operations 9 among others have been tested for removing heavy metals some of these alternatives are very specific and thus nearly incapable of removing different contaminants in a single process whereas others can remove cationic species but cannot remove anionic compounds simultaneously moreover some methods are expensive or impractical for use at the industrial scale unquestionably adsorption processes are some of the most promising options for removal of ionic contaminants from aqueous solutions as many types of natural and synthetic compounds are potential absorbents these compounds are very simple to apply affordable and widely available 10 15 in this sense a suitable industrial scale adsorbent used to clean up polluted mining solutions must present important characteristics such as a high capacity to remove cationic and anionic species simultaneously and easy separation from the treated water after the adsorption process various microparticle and nanoparticle type adsorbents have been prepared and modified in an attempt to improve the surface area and amount of available active adsorption sites for enhancing their efficiency in water treatment 16 18 however because of the tiny size of the solid formed between the adsorbent and the adsorbate species during the adsorption process it is very difficult to separate it from the resultant raffinate aqueous solution especially if its nature is colloidal a previous communication presented the synthesis and characterisation of a nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate unmodified or modified with fe iii for evaluation as an adsorbent for removing ionic species from acidic aqueous solutions 19 the preparation of the adsorbents is simple and reproducible using low cost commercial raw materials as lime and an industrial aqueous solution of sodium silicate it was concluded that the presence of iron in the adsorbent structure significantly improved its ability to remove arsenic species by forming highly insoluble and stable double iron and calcium arsenate salts however although the solids formed in the adsorption process were very insoluble their separation from the aqueous raffinate was troublesome a practical solution to overcome this problem is imparting magnetic properties to the adsorbent because the magnetised structure of the adsorbent including the composite formed with the removed species could be easily separated from the aqueous solution by using a simple magnetic process employing a permanent magnet 20 21 in this study the remediation of an acid mine water samples originating from chilean mining activity was investigated using an integrated method with two adsorbents having magnetic properties in the first stage the mine water was treated with a new adsorbent prepared in our laboratory namely a magnetic nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate mag nanocsh which can remove the highly concentrated pollutants existing in acid mine water the preparation characterisation and adsorption properties of this adsorbent composite are described in section 2 1 in the second stage the raffinate produced during the first stage of mine water treatment with mag nanocsh is treated with another adsorbent magnetic manganese dioxide mag mno2 in order for the final effluent to comply with the national chilean environmental regulations for discharge to continental surface water bodies a previous study reported the synthesis characterisation and use of this adsorbent for removing traces or low concentrations of some metallic ions from pure acid aqueous solutions 22 this adsorbent behaves as a hydrous oxide adsorbent which exhibits a point of zero charge phpzc or zeta potential of around 3 5 allowing efficient adsorption of cationic species at ph levels above this value via an ion exchange mechanism between the metallic ions in solution and the hydrogen ions dissociated from the surface of the adsorbent the adsorption mechanisms of both compounds were studied with regard to the surface area electric charge and chemical structure of the adsorbents the final purpose of this practical study was to clean up the mine water effectively using both adsorbents consecutively 2 experimental procedure 2 1 synthesis of the adsorbents the synthesis of mag nanocsh was conducted by means of a chemical reaction between a sodium silicate solution and ca oh 2 in the presence of hcl as shown in equation 1 a sufficient quantity of magnetite fe3o4 was added with the purpose of imparting adsorbent magnetic properties the synthesis is based on a procedure employed previously in the preparation of a non modified and non magnetic nanocsh 23 1 n a 2 s i o 3 c a o h 2 2 h c l c a s i o 3 s 2 n a c l 2 h 2 o for the first step in the synthesis the appropriate amount of fe3o4 was added to an already prepared suspension of ca oh 2 in water and hcl in a batch reactor under vigorous stirring at a velocity of 2000 min 1 second sodium silicate solution was added to the reactor and the mixture was stirred at 1500 min 1 for 2 h a blackish solid corresponding to a magnetic calcium silicate hydrate was rapidly obtained and separated from the suspension using a neodymium magnet the product was washed with water and ethanol and dried at 333 k for 12 h in turn the magnetic mno2 adsorbent was synthesised using an oxidative precipitation method in an already reported alkaline medium in which a salt of mn ii was oxidised by kmno4 in the presence of magnetite fe3o4 according to the following chemical reaction 24 2 3mncl2 2kmno4 4oh 5mno2 2k 6cl 2h2o the mixture was mechanically stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min at room temperature the use of koh allowed it to reach ph 12 which rapidly produced a dark brownish solid which was separated from the solution using a neodymium magnet the final product was washed with water and dried at 40 c both adsorbent composites mag nanocsh and mag mno2 have been prepared and magnetised using a commercial magnetite or fe3o4 prepared at the laboratory scale 25 both adsorbents presented a similar adsorption capacity thus in this communication all the reported results correspond to those achieved utilizing the commercial precursor 2 2 characterisation of the adsorbents different analytical techniques were used to characterize the synthesised adsorbent composites among them scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem images were obtained using a sem fei inspect f50 apparatus the specific surface area of the particles and other porosimetry parameters were determined via brunauer emmett teller bet measurements using an n2 sorptometer at 77 k with micrometrics asap 2010 equipment the particles were also evaluated via x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis employing a bruker d8 advance device with the purpose of verifying the crystalline or amorphous character of the solid adsorbents the zeta potential of the mag mno2 particles was determined by means of a laser doppler electrophoresis method using a malvern mastersizer hydro 2000mu device the magnetic properties of the mag nanocsh and mag mno2 particles were determined using a vibrating sample magnetometer the iron manganese and calcium contents in the adsorbents and all the metal and arsenic concentrations in the aqueous solutions in the adsorption experiments were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas using a perkinelmer pinaacle 900 f instrument the same technique was utilised to measure the leached metals from the adsorbent in the chemical stability tests the si content was measured through elemental analysis when necessary inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for determining lower or trace concentrations of metals in aqueous solutions 2 3 adsorbent stability experiments and adsorption studies considering that the adsorbents prepared in this study will be employed in the clean up of acid mine water or even industrial aqueous solutions the first experimental tests were designed to check their chemical stability towards acid aqueous solutions the leachability of the adsorbents was evaluated as follows 50 mg of mag mno2 and 100 mg of mag nanocsh were added to 50 ml of aqueous solutions whose initial acidities varied between ph 1 and ph 7 and mixed at 25 c in an orbital shaker for 24 h the ph of the acid solutions was adjusted using 0 1 m h2so4 and or 0 1 m naoh once the experiments had concluded the quantity of ca mn and fe leached in the acid aqueous solutions was measured using aas the amounts of these metals remaining in the adsorbents were determined by mass balance considering their initial concentrations in the solids pb ii cd ii cu ii zn ii as v and mo vi adsorption experiments were carried out at 25 c varying the ph and the content of the contaminants of the aqueous solutions and varying the mass of adsorbent some experiments were conducted using single metal synthetic aqueous solutions prepared in the laboratory the main experiments were carried out using samples of an acid mine water that contained among others all the above mentioned chemical species the acid mine water was a sulphated solution with a ph that varied between 2 and 4 it had the following average composition 10 03 mg l pb ii 11 87 mg l cd ii 52 82 mg l cu ii 43 56 mg l zn ii 39 07 mg l as v as arsenates and 4 75 mg l mo vi as molybdates and contained other components as well however in some adsorption tests the acidity of this solution and the concentrations of the ionic species were changed and adjusted to different values once the adsorption experiments were finalised the pollutant loaded solid adsorbents were easily separated from the aqueous solutions using a permanent neodymium magnet the equilibrium ph of each resulting raffinate was measured as were the concentrations of the ionic species that remained because they were not adsorbed the amount of each ionic species effectively adsorbed was determined by mass balance considering their respective initial concentrations in the initial aqueous phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of the adsorbents the synthesis of both adsorbents mag nanocsh and mag mno2 was very efficient providing a high product yield with respect to the preparation of mag nanocsh for which the precursors ca oh 2 hcl a liquid solution of na2sio3 and commercial magnetite were used the reaction was quick and reproducible with an average yield of 96 resulting in a blackish semi amorphous and very insoluble solid whose particles tended to agglomerate this solid is crystalline in nature as evidenced by its magnetite content and it was surrounded by amorphous layers of calcium silicate however the sequence of adding the reagents is important magnetite must be added after the addition of hcl in order to avoid direct contact between both compounds which could provoke dissolution of the iron oxide or enhance its partial oxidation to maghemite fe2o3 a species that presents a lower magnetic susceptibility than magnetite to study the effect of the magnetic saturation degree two different types of mag nanocsh adsorbents were synthesised and evaluated with varying calcium silicate and magnetite proportions nanocsh fe3o4 1 1 or 2 1 however most of the adsorption studies were conducted using the compound nanocsh fe3o4 at 1 1 similarly the synthesis of mag mno2 using the oxidative precipitation method in presence of magnetite was fast and quantitative with a yield over 95 resulting in a dark brownish solid similar to mno2 in this case and based on previous studies only one type of this adsorbent was synthesised one with a mno2 fe3o4 proportion of 1 1 given its chemical stability and magnetic saturation the synthesised solids mag nanocsh and mag mno2 were easily separated from the reaction medium using the neodymium magnet 3 2 characterisation of the adsorbents two characterisation methodologies were used to understand the morphology of the adsorbents fig 1 shows the sem images of the unmodified nanostructured calcium silicate mag nanocsh fig 1a and mag mno2 fig 1b in the case of mag nanocsh the morphology of particle sizes was uniform and much lower than 1 μm illustrating their tendency to agglomerate and some crystalline features due to the presence of fe3o4 in the particles were observed the images show individual particle sizes of around 60 200 nm for the adsorbent prepared using commercial magnetite fig 1b shows an sem micrograph of the magnetic mno2 wherein the particles do not have a defined geometry and correspond to very small structures whose particle size varied between 60 and 130 nm they also presented a tendency to agglomerate then the resulting compound could be classified as one having the features of a nanoadsorbent and a microadsorbent fig 2 presents the transmission electron microscopy tem micrographs for both type of adsorbents confirming the tendency of agglomeration of particles in the case of the mag nanocsh fig 2a the particles had a tendency to be spherical and presented a nanostructure and a microstructure with dark central zones corresponding to a crystalline nucleus of magnetite surrounded by clearer layers of amorphous calcium silicate the particle size of this adsorbent was confirmed in the analysis and it was dependent on the particle size of the magnetite used during the synthesis of the adsorbent this adsorbent has a nanostructure based on a backbone of silicates even though it might be classified as a microadsorbent in terms of particle size 23 26 fig 2b shows the tem image of the mag mno2 the image shows aggregates of particles similar to those of mag nanocsh that is of a structure that poses a dark crystalline nucleus of fe3o4 surrounded in this case by clearer amorphous layers of manganese oxide in many cases these particles are sized below 100 nm with some even closer to 60 nm which corresponds to the definition of nanoparticles however in a previous study when mno2 was magnetised using magnetite particles prepared in the laboratory individual particles of the adsorbent composite were even smaller than 10 nm 22 however the adsorption results reported hereinafter demonstrate that the low cost adsorbents so prepared in this study were sufficiently active and adequate for removing most of the contaminants originally present in the aqueous solution bet porosimetry analysis measurements were carried out using an n2 sorptometer at 77 k the average measured surface area ranged from 30 to 40 m2 g for mag nanocsh presenting a mean pore diameter between 2 and 10 nm and an average pore volume of 0 2 cm3 g in the case of the magnetic manganese oxide the surface area ranged from 60 to 70 m2 g with a mean pore diameter of around 5 10 nm and an average pore volume of 0 1 cm3 g these results ensure a vast number of available adsorption sites were distributed either in the external area or in the internal accessible area of both adsorbents types thus ensuring efficient and fast adsorption of the ionic species existing in the aqueous solutions requiring treatment these results also indicate that the surface area measured for mag nanocsh was a little smaller than that of mag mno2 probably owing to the contraction of the surface generated between the bond of the nanostructured calcium silicate net with the magnetite moreover the surface area and the pore diameter were affected by the size of the magnetite particles used in this study fig 3 shows the adsorption desorption isotherms for both adsorbent composites in both figures the filling of the micropores and mesopores at lower relative pressure between 0 1 and 0 8 p po conforming to the inner structure of the adsorbent and the filling of the macropores at higher relative pressure corresponding to the aggregation of adsorbent particles are observed the macropores that originated between the particles of these aggregates were accessible to the gas but would also configure a large number of adsorption sites on the internal surface of the adsorbent available to be filled in by the contaminants although both curves present a similar shape the volume of gas adsorbed in the case of mag nanocsh was almost double that of mag mno2 which is coherent with the bigger pore volume of the silicated compound with respect to the manganese oxide this characteristic would probably also explain the higher adsorption capacity observed for mag nanocsh samples of the adsorbents were subjected to x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis fig 4 presents the results for samples of mag nanocsh fe3o4 1 1 and mag mno2 the diffractogram of mag nanocsh fig 4a clearly shows signals at 2θ of 30 35 43 57 and 63 red which correspond to the crystalline structure of magnetite moreover the weak green signals at 2θ of 32 36 and 47 are associated with casio3 which tends to be amorphous under the experimental route followed in this work the low intensity of these signals confirmed the amorphous character of the external layers of casio3 as was seen in the sem and tem analyses besides signals associated with calcite caco3 at 2θ of 29 39 47 and 48 blue were observed likely owing to impurities in the reagents used in the synthesis lime or sodium silicate or by carbonation from the air during the process thus it is highly probable that these adsorbents would comprise a fe3o4 crystalline nucleus and have external layers of amorphous calcium silicate which is expected considering the great variety of polymeric and oligomeric species of silicates and silica existing in the na2sio3 aqueous solution which generate colloidal solids with an untidy structure fig 4b presents the xrd pattern of mag mno2 this diffractogram presents newly observed identical signals at 2θ of 30 35 43 57 and 63 red which are attributable to the crystalline structure of fe3o4 no signals corresponding to mno2 were observed which is expected given the amorphous character of this compound hence this adsorbent also would present a structure wherein a crystalline nucleus of magnetite is surrounded by amorphous layers of mno2 the higher the magnetic saturation ms of the adsorbent the easier it was to separate it from the resulting aqueous solution raffinate by introducing a permanent magnet in this sense measurements of magnetic properties of the synthesised adsorbents are necessary fig 5 shows the magnetisation curves of the prepared adsorbents and the magnetite employed in this work in this figure the dependence of the changes in the magnetic saturation ms expressed in emu g was plotted against the applied magnetic field expressed in oe 1 emu g 10 k oe it is clear that magnetite presents the highest magnetic response at over 80 emu g although during the synthesis of the adsorbents a small fraction of fe3o4 was oxidised to maghemite fe2o3 as can be seen in fig 5 the magnetic adsorbents mag mno2 and mag nanocsh fe3o4 at a 1 1 ratio present a high grade of magnetic saturation 59 35 emu g and 57 15 emu g respectively which ensured complete separation of the contaminant loaded adsorbent from the aqueous raffinate hence the composite having a lower proportion of fe3o4 nanocsh fe3o4 2 1 had lower magnetic saturation 42 70 emu g as was expected compared to the adsorbent nanocsh fe3o4 1 1 given its lower proport based on tem analysis and on the initial magnetic susceptibility obtained from fig 5 it is possible to make a good estimation of the layer thickness of the coatings present at the adsorbent particle composites this was accomplished by estimating the magnetic diameter dm of the particles associated to the magnetic core of the particles using the equation derived from the langevin function which assumes that the magnetic nanoparticles are monodisperse 27 as it can be seen in fig 5 the magnetism curves for mag nanocsh 1 1 and mag mno2 are almost overlapped which provides a rather similar layer thickness between 4 3 nm and 5 3 nm for both compounds undoubtedly the calcium silicate formed during the synthesis as well as the mno2 behaved as diamagnetic species compared with behaviour of the ferromagnetic precursor fe3o4 however fe3o4 by itself is not a good enough adsorbent and thus a suitable adsorbent composite must be structured by mixing the calcium silicate or the manganese oxide with magnetite in order to achieve an adsorbent with good adsorption capacity and sufficient magnetic properties making feasible the separation of the loaded adsorbent from the aqueous raffinate as was observed in this study with regard to the particle size of the adsorbents between 60 and 200 nm some particles act as nanoparticles presenting superparamagnetic properties and having almost null coercivity which would allow their reuse in further wastewater cycles meanwhile larger particles lose some of the characteristics that limit their reuse complementarily by means of the laser doppler electrophoresis method a phpzc of 3 5 was measured for mno2 fe3o4 a value that classifies the species to be adsorbed by this compound according to the surface charge of the adsorbent the surface electric charge of the adsorbent is influenced by the ph of the aqueous solution additionally a phpzc of 6 0 was measured for the commercial magnetite used in this study chemical analysis of the main components of the adsorbent was performed the contents of ca mn and fe were determined by aas of a previous acid digestion and elemental analysis of silicon content table 1 shows the chemical composition of the synthesised adsorbents adsorbent mag nanocsh corresponds to a calcium silicate hydrate hence the difference in the composition was attributed to the existence of water molecules associated with the solids a similar condition can be assigned to mag mno2 given that is a hydrous manganese oxide which also possesses many hydroxyl groups in its structure table 1 shows the average composition of the different adsorbents prepared in this study in ca mn fe and si 3 3 adsorption experiments the adsorbents synthesised in this study were used to treat polluted acid mine waters in this sense they must be low cost and also chemically and mechanically stable towards the action of acid solutions in a broad ph range given the great variety of acid and residual mine waters it is also possible that pollutant loaded solid adsorbents could be desorbed using acid solutions and recycled for new adsorption processing with this purpose a set of experiments was designed for contacting the adsorbents with aqueous solutions whose initial ph varied between 0 and 6 fig 6 presents the results the amounts of ca mn and fe leached were generally very low especially over ph 2 where only a minimal concentration of these metals was dissolved iron is not leached at all over ph 2 probably owing to in both adsorbents magnetite as the nucleus of the solid surrounded by layers of calcium silicate or mno2 which protects it from attack by protons slightly higher leaching of calcium and manganese was observed probably because they are more exposed in aqueous solutions given the sites of the external layers of both adsorbents and owing to their solubility undoubtedly when the acidity of the aqueous solution is too high specifically at ph below 2 0 the dissolution of these metals is caused by the direct attack of the extremely high concentration of hydrogen ions on the surface of the adsorbents promoting the leaching of the metals into and their presence in the resultant aqueous solutions subsequently it can be concluded that both types of adsorbents can be used for treating polluted aqueous solutions whose acidity is not below ph 2 0 in all cases despite the scarce dissolution of iron and other components the solids were completely separated from the solution using a neodymium magnet thus the magnetic saturation of the adsorbents remained constant before applying the adsorbents to the treatment of samples of actual acid mine water a series of experiments was designed to test them using aqueous solutions that simulate mine water the purpose was to establish the ph range in which the adsorbents presented their best adsorption capacity and to measure the contaminant loading capacity of both compounds defined as q and expressed in mg ion removed g adsorbent fig 7 shows the effect of the initial ph of the aqueous solution on the adsorption of pb ii cd ii cu ii and zn ii ions using mag mno2 as the adsorbent these experiments were carried out using aqueous solutions containing around 10 mg l of these metallic ions which were mixed with 50 mg of mag mno2 fig 7 shows that as the ph of the aqueous phase increases the extraction percentage of the four metallic species increases this adsorbent is a magnetic hydrous oxide compound whose surface can suffer protonation or deprotonation reactions this can be explained because the ph of zero charge phzc or zeta potential measured for this adsorbent was around 3 2 3 5 that is the adsorption of cationic metal species increased with increasing ph of the aqueous solution especially above the zero charge ph value phzc under this condition the adsorption of cationic species would be favoured owing to the polyhydroxylation of the surface of the adsorbent followed by a deprotonation of the hydroxyl groups thus favouring an adsorption mechanism governed by cation exchange between the metallic ion and the h groups as is expressed in the following equations 3 m n o h s o h a q m n o h 2 s 4 m n o h 2 s m a q 2 m n o 2 m s 2 2 h a q where m n o h s represents the manganese hydrous oxide and m is the metal ion present in the aqueous solution to be removed with regard to the adsorption of these divalent cations the metallic ion would coordinate with the donor oxygen atom on the surface of the adsorbent material liberating protons to the solution 24 on the other hand significant adsorption at a ph lower than the zeta potential ph 3 2 3 5 would not have occurred because in a sulphuric medium at least the four metals studied would not form anionic species that would feasibly be adsorbed by mno2 at low ph fig 7 shows that the adsorption of pb2 is preferred over that of cd2 and cu2 with zn2 being the least favoured it is also observed that the adsorption of all the ions reaches a maximum around ph 4 0 5 0 and does not increase at higher ph values as the range for the deprotonation of the h ions from the surface of the adsorbent is minimal however the acidity range of aqueous solutions between ph values of 1 and 5 is of interest in the treatment of acid mine waters both the acid mine drainages and the aqueous mining wastes generated in metallurgical plants are generally this acidic similar experiments were carried out for comparisons but only with fe3o4 observing much lower adsorption especially at more acidic ph levels owing not only to a lower adsorption capacity of magnetite given its structure but also because its phzc is close to 6 0 the latter prevents or limits the adsorption of metal ions on its surface at ph lower than this value considering that the mine water used also contained anionic species we conducted adsorption experiments of the oxyanion arsenates and molybdates normally found in numerous acid mine waters particularly those related to chilean copper mining they appear structurally associated with copper ores chemical species such as molybdenite mos2 and arsenic minerals such as enargite and tennantite the adsorption experiments were performed by mixing 50 mg of adsorbent with a feed solution containing 10 mg l of mo vi and as v the results are presented in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the adsorption of both oxyanionic species is favoured in the ph range between 1 and 2 that is under strongly acidic conditions this finding coincides with a ph range lower than the value measured for phzc for this adsorbent under these conditions the surface of the adsorbent would be polyprotonated thus acquiring its positive surface charge which would allow adsorption of anionic species by means of electrostatic attraction mechanisms and ion pair formation as illustrated in the following equations 5 m n o h s h a q m n o h 2 s 6 m n o h 2 s h a o x a q m n o h 2 h a o x s where h a o x represents the anionic species to be removed i e arsenates and molybdates equation 5 represents the polyprotonation of the surface of the adsorbent and equation 6 the formation of the ion pair o h 2 h a o x s however according to the chemical stability tests the ph suitable for the removal of these species should be around 2 0 although the adsorption is still good at lower ph the risk of its dissolution also increases fig 6 shows that a better relative adsorption of molybdates with respect to arsenates under the given experimental conditions these results could be explained by an analysis of the ionic chemical speciation of as and mo in aqueous solutions for example at very low ph as v can form arsenic acid h3aso4 less dissociated in arsenates a species that would probably be adsorbed to a great extent in turn the predominant mo vi species in aqueous solutions are the molybdate ions which depending on the concentration of mo in solution and its ph can form various anionic species however complete adsorption of these ions could be achieved if enough adsorbent mass was used in sum besides the acidity of the aqueous phase to be treated the relative mass of adsorbent used in the experiments strongly affected the adsorption of the ionic species present in solution fig 9 shows the experimental results obtained for the adsorption of the ions from an aqueous phase with an initial ph of 3 0 containing 10 mg l of each ion the disappearance of ions from aqueous solution is plotted as a function of the mass of adsorbent used in the experiments where c and c 0 represent the ion concentration at any time t and its initial concentration respectively these results would be related to an approximation of the saturation of the adsorption sites available on the mag mno2 surface when low amounts of adsorbent are used in this case practically all the adsorption sites would be occupied by the metal ions resulting in a greater mass of adsorbate removed per unit mass of adsorbent an adequate relationship must be found between the adsorbent mass to be used and the net mass of metal to be removed depending on the concentration of the ion and the volume of aqueous solution to be used however in fig 9 it is observed that for a certain concentration of the ions in solution 10 mg l the percentage of adsorption increases as the amount of adsorbent used increases it is also evident an increasing of the adsorption of as v and mo vi would allow a complete clean up of the aqueous solution to achieve a high adsorption efficiency a sufficient adsorbent mass is required so as to offer enough available active sites for adsorption the ion loading capacity q for 10 to 20 mg ion g mag mno2 was measured and the results were comparable to or exceeded those achieved using the traditionally used adsorbents which lacks magnetic properties as a general conclusion mag mno2 presents excellent characteristics that allow both the removal of metal ions that form cationic species in solution as well as anionic species depending on the ph of the treated aqueous phase moreover in all cases the loaded adsorbent could be separated easily and completely from the aqueous raffinate using the respective magnetic saturation capacity similar adsorption experiments were conducted with aqueous solutions that simulate mine water but using the other adsorbent i e the mag nanocsh previous studies reported the use of this non magnetised compound however given its particle size and chemical structure its separation from the aqueous solution after adsorption is very complex 19 23 as reported above the magnetic silicates synthesised in this work showed a sufficient degree of magnetic saturation which allowed their easy and complete separation from the aqueous raffinate via a neodymium magnet several adsorption experiments were designed and carried out using an aqueous solution that simulated mine water containing higher concentrations than that used with the mag mno2 the synthesised mag nanocsh fe3o4 at a 1 1 ratio was utilised as the adsorbent fig 10 shows the influence of the initial ph of the aqueous solution on the adsorption of ions onto this adsorbent composite the initial concentrations of the contaminants were 100 mg l for pb cu and zn 60 mg l for cd and 50 mg l for mo and as an almost quantitative adsorption of the four metallic ions was independent of the acidity of the contacted aqueous phase this is mainly because the calcium silicates alkalize the medium very quickly irrespective of the initial acidity of the aqueous solution generating very stable granular precipitates in all cases the silicates acted as a buffer always maintaining a ph higher than 7 0 in the raffinate preventing redissolution of the precipitates obtained the latter pose sufficient magnetic saturation which facilitated their separation from the resulting aqueous phase fig 10 also shows that the adsorption of mo vi species is reasonably high particularly at low ph whereas the adsorption of as v species is limited the preferred adsorption of molybdenum is explicable as the mo vi species for most ph values are predominantly anionic these species would be adsorbed onto the highly protonated surface of the adsorbent through electrostatic attraction furthermore it is conceivable that the higher or lesser adsorption of anionic species by mag nanocsh would be related to the solubility of the respectively formed calcium salts that is the calcium molybdates formed would be sufficiently insoluble to allow good adsorption the low adsorption of as v observed in these experiments could be explained by the low adsorbent mass used considering the vast number of species that need to be removed thus higher as v removal can be achieved using a sufficient quantity of adsorbent in fact calcium arsenates and double calcium and iron arsenates are quite insoluble which permits good adsorption preferably at ph over 2 0 where most of the as v is dissociated as h3aso4 19 a significant fraction of the heavy metals present in the amds is expected to precipitate when increasing the ph of the aqueous solution when lime is added controlled experiments were carried out using only lime to increase the ph of amd solutions the removal of anionic species was not good the removal of some metallic ions although important in many cases in incomplete in the case of zn pb cr among others due to the formation of highly soluble poly hydroxylated species and their amphoteric behaviour chemical precipitation with lime or limestones has many problems such as the re dissolution of metal precipitates the need of huge amounts of chemicals the generation of large volumes of colloidal sludges etc precipitation with lime also provides the incomplete removal of arsenate molybdate and sulphate ions and fails to eliminate traces of other problematic contaminants therefore using only lime it is not possible to fulfil the chilean environmental national regulations for discharging residual mining waters to continental water bodies in this sense the combined use of mag nanocsh and mag mno2 overcomes this difficulties allowing a complete and simultaneous removal of anionic and cationic species dissolved in acidic mine waters several adsorption experiments were performed with variable adsorbent masses an aqueous solution containing 100 mg l of pb cu and zn 60 mg l of cd and 50 mg l of mo and as and whose acidity was adjusted to ph 3 0 was used in all the experimental runs the results obtained are presented in fig 11 fig 11 shows that in all cases adsorption yields greater than 95 for all metal ions and mo vi were achieved with the exception of lower adsorption of arsenic species whose complete removal was achieved with the integrated use of both magnetic adsorbents higher loading capacities q were measured by using mag nanocsh compared to mag mno2 for removing the contaminant ions in fact q variables between 20 and 40 mg ion g mag nanocsh were found confirming that this compound should be recommended for reducing higher ion contents present in aqueous solutions in the first stage of treatment followed by the use of mag mno2 in the second stage as a polishing adsorbent for more toxic species commonly present in lower concentrations this way it would be possible to fulfil with the strict environmental regulations associated with acid mine waters when using mag nanocsh metallic ions were adsorbed most likely through combined mechanisms such as a by the formation of the respective hydroxide or mixed hydroxides with the silanol groups of the silicates on the surface of adsorbents and as discrete particles of hydroxides in solution or b via cation exchange between the adsorbed metal that becomes part of the structure of the silicate with the ca atoms of the adsorbent which are released to the raffinate solution in turn the possible mechanism of removal of anionic species as molybdates and arsenates would be governed by an anion exchange mechanism between the oxyanions existing in aqueous solution and the silicate groups of the adsorbent forming the respective calcium salt the more insoluble the formed calcium salt with the adsorbed anion the higher its stability thus promoting greater adsorption and less redissolution in the resulting raffinate additionally the main reason behind conferring magnetic properties to the adsorbents is more related to achieving an easier separation of the contaminant loaded magnetic adsorbent from the resulting aqueous solution using a conventional permanent magnet rather than to increase their adsorption capacity both adsorbents do not have magnetic properties but are very good adsorbents furthermore magnetite fe3o4 the compound used to provide magnetic properties to the adsorbents composites presents a very small adsorption capacity our control experiments indicated that magnetite only could adsorb around 2 3 of cu and zn less than 1 of cd and pb and exhibits a null adsorption of as and mo species besides magnetite presents a pzc close to 6 0 limiting the adsorption of ionic species at ph lower than this value it is clear that the magnetite covered with calcium silicate or hydrous mno2 did not affected their high adsorption capacity compared to pure calcium silicate hydrate or mno2 adsorbents then the magnetics composites mag nanocsh and mag mno2 would be ideal engineered materials enabling the efficient adsorption of contaminants and the complete separation of the solids from the treated mine water 3 4 treatment tests of an acid mine water the practical objective of using the adsorbents prepared in this study was the treatment of acid waters contaminated with different ionic species both cationic and anionic in this sense it is required that the adsorbents ideally present capacity to remove several ions collectively and simultaneously using samples of a mine water generated during chilean copper mining activity a series of previous experiments was conducted to measure the adsorption selectivity coefficients using both adsorbents the selectivity coefficient represents the quotient of the respective loading capacities between a pair of ions according to the following expression 7 α qa qb where α is the selectivity coefficient and qa and qb are the adsorption loading capacities of the metal ions a and b respectively both expressed in mg adsorbed ion g adsorbent the selectivity tests were carried out using a mine water in which the concentration for each ion was adjusted in 10 mg l and its ph to 3 0 table 2 shows the measured values of coefficient α it is obvious that the closer the selectivity factor is to 1 0 the less selective the adsorbent and therefore the greater its capacity for collective adsorption although the selectivity α coefficient is sensitive to the acidity of the aqueous phase the content of the metal ions and the mass of adsorbent used in each case table 2 shows that generally both adsorbents have high collective adsorption capacity as most of the α coefficients are close to 1 0 this is necessary for treating polluted waters containing multiple ionic contaminants these results led us to design an integrated system using both adsorbents for cleaning up the mine waste solution in the first stage the sample of the acid mine water was treated with mag nanocsh which generally has a higher adsorption capacity than mag mno2 does table 3 shows the initial concentration of all the studied ions their concentration in the raffinate after adsorption with this compound the extent of adsorption of each species and the limit of discharge to continental water bodies according to the chilean national norm 28 once the adsorption process which required only a few minutes was completed the loaded adsorbent was completely separated from the aqueous raffinate using a neodymium magnet using this technique allowed us to solve one of the most complex pollution issues with the help of microadsorbents or nanoadsorbents as their separation from the treated water is based on their magnetic properties all the results reflect that the high adsorption achieved for all species with this unique process can help meet the discharge regulations for copper zinc and molybdenum ions in acid mine waters furthermore by using mag nanocsh it was possible to reduce by a very high proportion the fine solid particles suspended in the mine water via their adherence through coprecipitation onto the solids formed in the process in the second step the aqueous raffinate produced in the first stage was mixed with the adsorbent mag mno2 although this compound had a lower adsorption capacity compared with that of mag nanocsh it was useful for treating aqueous solution containing trace or lower concentrations of generally more toxic pollutants considering that the use of mag nanocsh in the first step raised the original ph of the aqueous solution to over ph 7 0 the raffinate was re acidified with sulfuric acid to around ph 4 table 4 shows the results of this second treatment the results reported in table 4 indicate that this second adsorbent could reduce the contents of all ions in the second raffinate effectively including the more toxic and dangerous ones to a level below the limit fixed by the chilean environmental discharge regulation the process was quick and again the loaded mag mno2 compound was separated easily and completely from the resulting aqueous solution with the permanent magnet hence as a global result it is possible to state that the integrated use of both synthesised adsorbents both prepared following a low cost and simple process make feasible an effective and complete decontamination treatment of acid mining water both adsorbents are very stable whenever the initial ph of the aqueous solutions is above 2 0 where the material losses is expected to be below 0 2 0 8 percent expressed as leaching of fe ca and mn fig 6 moreover mechanical attrition of the adsorbents was not appreciated during the experiments these magnetic adsorbents could also be applied for processing many kinds of residual polluted industrial waters in a further report in preparation we will communicate in detail the equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic behaviours of both adsorbents when used in acidic solutions 4 conclusions two adsorbents with magnetic properties based on fe3o4 coated with nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate mag nanocsh and manganese oxide mag mno2 were successfully prepared with the purpose of their integrated use for remediation of an acid mine water both adsorbents were quite stable towards aqueous solutions with ph over 2 0 as dissolution was not observed under this condition both compounds were characterised using different methodologies sem and tem analyses indicated that the individual particle size of the adsorbents varies between 60 and 200 nm leading to a tendency to agglomerate bet porosimetry analysis showed a particle surface area variable between 30 and 70 m2 g and a pore diameter of around 2 10 nm xrd analysis confirmed that mag nanocsh and mag mno2 adsorbents present a crystalline magnetite nucleus surrounded by amorphous layers of calcium silicate or mno2 respectively the nanostructures and microstructures of both composites showed many available adsorption sites and their chemical structures made them very efficient at simultaneously adsorbing both cationic and anionic species in aqueous solutions both adsorbents had magnetic moments of around 57 59 emu g which was lower than the corresponding value for fe3o4 and yet high enough to ensure their complete separation from the aqueous raffinate the adsorption of ionic species was affected by the acidity of the aqueous solution however in the ph range of around 2 4 most of the contaminants were collectively removed through adsorption mechanisms based on ion exchange ion pair formation and insoluble salt and hydroxide formation the loading capacity of the adsorbents was affected by the adsorbent mass and the concentration of the species to be removed from the aqueous solution both adsorbents were used in an integrated manner to decontaminate a sample of an acid mine water mag nanocsh which has a higher adsorption capacity was used in the first step and drastically reduced the concentration of many ions present in the treated water consecutively after re acidification the raffinate produced in the first step was mixed with mag mno2 which resulted in an aqueous solution that met the chilean environmental regulations for discharge into continental water bodies acknowledgement the authors

14528,the integrated use of two solid adsorbents with magnetic properties was studied with the aim of decontaminating an acid mine water the adsorbents were magnetic nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate mag nanocsh and magnetic manganese dioxide mag mno2 both of which consist of a crystalline fe3o4 nucleus surrounded by external amorphous layers of calcium silicate and manganese oxide respectively they were synthesised using simple quick and reproducible methods both adsorbents were characterised chemically physically and magnetically via different analytical techniques the particle size of the adsorbents varied between 60 and 200 nm which led to a tendency to agglomerate and the surface area varied between 30 and 70 m2 g the magnetic saturation of the absorbents was found to be around 57 59 emu g which is sufficient to ensure complete separation of these two compounds from an aqueous raffinate using a common magnet the nanostructure and microstructure of both adsorbents had many available adsorption sites and their chemical structure permitted efficient and simultaneous removal of cationic and anionic species present in aqueous solutions following different adsorption mechanisms the influence of the main variables on the adsorption of the ionic species was studied samples of an acid mine water were treated using both magnetic composites consecutively in the first step mag nanocsh was able to dramatically reduce the contents of many of the ions in the treated water then mag mno2 was added to the re acidified raffinate produced in the first step and the resulting final aqueous solution was found to comply with the chilean environmental regulations keywords magnetic adsorbents nanostructured adsorbents calcium silicate manganese dioxide remediation acid mine water 1 introduction mining and industrial operations are commonly recognised as some of the most polluting human activities they cause numerous environmental problems including the generation of solid and liquid wastes as well as the contamination of air by dust and gaseous emissions from pirometallurgical plants one of the main difficulties in such cases relates to the pollution of surface and underground waters by mining and metallurgical residual effluents or their contamination with natural acid mine drainages 1 this pollution poses both technical and economic problems these waters contain diverse toxic contaminants including suspended or dissolved heavy metals anions and oxyanions as arsenates and sulphates acidic and saline compounds and granular and colloidal type suspended fine solids which are quite difficult to remove 2 recently many technical options have been studied in order to remove these pollutants mostly metallic ions and some anionic species however none of these treatment alternatives can be considered optimal for example chemical precipitation 3 ion exchange with solid resins 4 solvent extraction 5 chelation 6 biological methods 7 membranes 8 and electrochemical operations 9 among others have been tested for removing heavy metals some of these alternatives are very specific and thus nearly incapable of removing different contaminants in a single process whereas others can remove cationic species but cannot remove anionic compounds simultaneously moreover some methods are expensive or impractical for use at the industrial scale unquestionably adsorption processes are some of the most promising options for removal of ionic contaminants from aqueous solutions as many types of natural and synthetic compounds are potential absorbents these compounds are very simple to apply affordable and widely available 10 15 in this sense a suitable industrial scale adsorbent used to clean up polluted mining solutions must present important characteristics such as a high capacity to remove cationic and anionic species simultaneously and easy separation from the treated water after the adsorption process various microparticle and nanoparticle type adsorbents have been prepared and modified in an attempt to improve the surface area and amount of available active adsorption sites for enhancing their efficiency in water treatment 16 18 however because of the tiny size of the solid formed between the adsorbent and the adsorbate species during the adsorption process it is very difficult to separate it from the resultant raffinate aqueous solution especially if its nature is colloidal a previous communication presented the synthesis and characterisation of a nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate unmodified or modified with fe iii for evaluation as an adsorbent for removing ionic species from acidic aqueous solutions 19 the preparation of the adsorbents is simple and reproducible using low cost commercial raw materials as lime and an industrial aqueous solution of sodium silicate it was concluded that the presence of iron in the adsorbent structure significantly improved its ability to remove arsenic species by forming highly insoluble and stable double iron and calcium arsenate salts however although the solids formed in the adsorption process were very insoluble their separation from the aqueous raffinate was troublesome a practical solution to overcome this problem is imparting magnetic properties to the adsorbent because the magnetised structure of the adsorbent including the composite formed with the removed species could be easily separated from the aqueous solution by using a simple magnetic process employing a permanent magnet 20 21 in this study the remediation of an acid mine water samples originating from chilean mining activity was investigated using an integrated method with two adsorbents having magnetic properties in the first stage the mine water was treated with a new adsorbent prepared in our laboratory namely a magnetic nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate mag nanocsh which can remove the highly concentrated pollutants existing in acid mine water the preparation characterisation and adsorption properties of this adsorbent composite are described in section 2 1 in the second stage the raffinate produced during the first stage of mine water treatment with mag nanocsh is treated with another adsorbent magnetic manganese dioxide mag mno2 in order for the final effluent to comply with the national chilean environmental regulations for discharge to continental surface water bodies a previous study reported the synthesis characterisation and use of this adsorbent for removing traces or low concentrations of some metallic ions from pure acid aqueous solutions 22 this adsorbent behaves as a hydrous oxide adsorbent which exhibits a point of zero charge phpzc or zeta potential of around 3 5 allowing efficient adsorption of cationic species at ph levels above this value via an ion exchange mechanism between the metallic ions in solution and the hydrogen ions dissociated from the surface of the adsorbent the adsorption mechanisms of both compounds were studied with regard to the surface area electric charge and chemical structure of the adsorbents the final purpose of this practical study was to clean up the mine water effectively using both adsorbents consecutively 2 experimental procedure 2 1 synthesis of the adsorbents the synthesis of mag nanocsh was conducted by means of a chemical reaction between a sodium silicate solution and ca oh 2 in the presence of hcl as shown in equation 1 a sufficient quantity of magnetite fe3o4 was added with the purpose of imparting adsorbent magnetic properties the synthesis is based on a procedure employed previously in the preparation of a non modified and non magnetic nanocsh 23 1 n a 2 s i o 3 c a o h 2 2 h c l c a s i o 3 s 2 n a c l 2 h 2 o for the first step in the synthesis the appropriate amount of fe3o4 was added to an already prepared suspension of ca oh 2 in water and hcl in a batch reactor under vigorous stirring at a velocity of 2000 min 1 second sodium silicate solution was added to the reactor and the mixture was stirred at 1500 min 1 for 2 h a blackish solid corresponding to a magnetic calcium silicate hydrate was rapidly obtained and separated from the suspension using a neodymium magnet the product was washed with water and ethanol and dried at 333 k for 12 h in turn the magnetic mno2 adsorbent was synthesised using an oxidative precipitation method in an already reported alkaline medium in which a salt of mn ii was oxidised by kmno4 in the presence of magnetite fe3o4 according to the following chemical reaction 24 2 3mncl2 2kmno4 4oh 5mno2 2k 6cl 2h2o the mixture was mechanically stirred at 500 rpm for 30 min at room temperature the use of koh allowed it to reach ph 12 which rapidly produced a dark brownish solid which was separated from the solution using a neodymium magnet the final product was washed with water and dried at 40 c both adsorbent composites mag nanocsh and mag mno2 have been prepared and magnetised using a commercial magnetite or fe3o4 prepared at the laboratory scale 25 both adsorbents presented a similar adsorption capacity thus in this communication all the reported results correspond to those achieved utilizing the commercial precursor 2 2 characterisation of the adsorbents different analytical techniques were used to characterize the synthesised adsorbent composites among them scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem images were obtained using a sem fei inspect f50 apparatus the specific surface area of the particles and other porosimetry parameters were determined via brunauer emmett teller bet measurements using an n2 sorptometer at 77 k with micrometrics asap 2010 equipment the particles were also evaluated via x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis employing a bruker d8 advance device with the purpose of verifying the crystalline or amorphous character of the solid adsorbents the zeta potential of the mag mno2 particles was determined by means of a laser doppler electrophoresis method using a malvern mastersizer hydro 2000mu device the magnetic properties of the mag nanocsh and mag mno2 particles were determined using a vibrating sample magnetometer the iron manganese and calcium contents in the adsorbents and all the metal and arsenic concentrations in the aqueous solutions in the adsorption experiments were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas using a perkinelmer pinaacle 900 f instrument the same technique was utilised to measure the leached metals from the adsorbent in the chemical stability tests the si content was measured through elemental analysis when necessary inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for determining lower or trace concentrations of metals in aqueous solutions 2 3 adsorbent stability experiments and adsorption studies considering that the adsorbents prepared in this study will be employed in the clean up of acid mine water or even industrial aqueous solutions the first experimental tests were designed to check their chemical stability towards acid aqueous solutions the leachability of the adsorbents was evaluated as follows 50 mg of mag mno2 and 100 mg of mag nanocsh were added to 50 ml of aqueous solutions whose initial acidities varied between ph 1 and ph 7 and mixed at 25 c in an orbital shaker for 24 h the ph of the acid solutions was adjusted using 0 1 m h2so4 and or 0 1 m naoh once the experiments had concluded the quantity of ca mn and fe leached in the acid aqueous solutions was measured using aas the amounts of these metals remaining in the adsorbents were determined by mass balance considering their initial concentrations in the solids pb ii cd ii cu ii zn ii as v and mo vi adsorption experiments were carried out at 25 c varying the ph and the content of the contaminants of the aqueous solutions and varying the mass of adsorbent some experiments were conducted using single metal synthetic aqueous solutions prepared in the laboratory the main experiments were carried out using samples of an acid mine water that contained among others all the above mentioned chemical species the acid mine water was a sulphated solution with a ph that varied between 2 and 4 it had the following average composition 10 03 mg l pb ii 11 87 mg l cd ii 52 82 mg l cu ii 43 56 mg l zn ii 39 07 mg l as v as arsenates and 4 75 mg l mo vi as molybdates and contained other components as well however in some adsorption tests the acidity of this solution and the concentrations of the ionic species were changed and adjusted to different values once the adsorption experiments were finalised the pollutant loaded solid adsorbents were easily separated from the aqueous solutions using a permanent neodymium magnet the equilibrium ph of each resulting raffinate was measured as were the concentrations of the ionic species that remained because they were not adsorbed the amount of each ionic species effectively adsorbed was determined by mass balance considering their respective initial concentrations in the initial aqueous phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of the adsorbents the synthesis of both adsorbents mag nanocsh and mag mno2 was very efficient providing a high product yield with respect to the preparation of mag nanocsh for which the precursors ca oh 2 hcl a liquid solution of na2sio3 and commercial magnetite were used the reaction was quick and reproducible with an average yield of 96 resulting in a blackish semi amorphous and very insoluble solid whose particles tended to agglomerate this solid is crystalline in nature as evidenced by its magnetite content and it was surrounded by amorphous layers of calcium silicate however the sequence of adding the reagents is important magnetite must be added after the addition of hcl in order to avoid direct contact between both compounds which could provoke dissolution of the iron oxide or enhance its partial oxidation to maghemite fe2o3 a species that presents a lower magnetic susceptibility than magnetite to study the effect of the magnetic saturation degree two different types of mag nanocsh adsorbents were synthesised and evaluated with varying calcium silicate and magnetite proportions nanocsh fe3o4 1 1 or 2 1 however most of the adsorption studies were conducted using the compound nanocsh fe3o4 at 1 1 similarly the synthesis of mag mno2 using the oxidative precipitation method in presence of magnetite was fast and quantitative with a yield over 95 resulting in a dark brownish solid similar to mno2 in this case and based on previous studies only one type of this adsorbent was synthesised one with a mno2 fe3o4 proportion of 1 1 given its chemical stability and magnetic saturation the synthesised solids mag nanocsh and mag mno2 were easily separated from the reaction medium using the neodymium magnet 3 2 characterisation of the adsorbents two characterisation methodologies were used to understand the morphology of the adsorbents fig 1 shows the sem images of the unmodified nanostructured calcium silicate mag nanocsh fig 1a and mag mno2 fig 1b in the case of mag nanocsh the morphology of particle sizes was uniform and much lower than 1 μm illustrating their tendency to agglomerate and some crystalline features due to the presence of fe3o4 in the particles were observed the images show individual particle sizes of around 60 200 nm for the adsorbent prepared using commercial magnetite fig 1b shows an sem micrograph of the magnetic mno2 wherein the particles do not have a defined geometry and correspond to very small structures whose particle size varied between 60 and 130 nm they also presented a tendency to agglomerate then the resulting compound could be classified as one having the features of a nanoadsorbent and a microadsorbent fig 2 presents the transmission electron microscopy tem micrographs for both type of adsorbents confirming the tendency of agglomeration of particles in the case of the mag nanocsh fig 2a the particles had a tendency to be spherical and presented a nanostructure and a microstructure with dark central zones corresponding to a crystalline nucleus of magnetite surrounded by clearer layers of amorphous calcium silicate the particle size of this adsorbent was confirmed in the analysis and it was dependent on the particle size of the magnetite used during the synthesis of the adsorbent this adsorbent has a nanostructure based on a backbone of silicates even though it might be classified as a microadsorbent in terms of particle size 23 26 fig 2b shows the tem image of the mag mno2 the image shows aggregates of particles similar to those of mag nanocsh that is of a structure that poses a dark crystalline nucleus of fe3o4 surrounded in this case by clearer amorphous layers of manganese oxide in many cases these particles are sized below 100 nm with some even closer to 60 nm which corresponds to the definition of nanoparticles however in a previous study when mno2 was magnetised using magnetite particles prepared in the laboratory individual particles of the adsorbent composite were even smaller than 10 nm 22 however the adsorption results reported hereinafter demonstrate that the low cost adsorbents so prepared in this study were sufficiently active and adequate for removing most of the contaminants originally present in the aqueous solution bet porosimetry analysis measurements were carried out using an n2 sorptometer at 77 k the average measured surface area ranged from 30 to 40 m2 g for mag nanocsh presenting a mean pore diameter between 2 and 10 nm and an average pore volume of 0 2 cm3 g in the case of the magnetic manganese oxide the surface area ranged from 60 to 70 m2 g with a mean pore diameter of around 5 10 nm and an average pore volume of 0 1 cm3 g these results ensure a vast number of available adsorption sites were distributed either in the external area or in the internal accessible area of both adsorbents types thus ensuring efficient and fast adsorption of the ionic species existing in the aqueous solutions requiring treatment these results also indicate that the surface area measured for mag nanocsh was a little smaller than that of mag mno2 probably owing to the contraction of the surface generated between the bond of the nanostructured calcium silicate net with the magnetite moreover the surface area and the pore diameter were affected by the size of the magnetite particles used in this study fig 3 shows the adsorption desorption isotherms for both adsorbent composites in both figures the filling of the micropores and mesopores at lower relative pressure between 0 1 and 0 8 p po conforming to the inner structure of the adsorbent and the filling of the macropores at higher relative pressure corresponding to the aggregation of adsorbent particles are observed the macropores that originated between the particles of these aggregates were accessible to the gas but would also configure a large number of adsorption sites on the internal surface of the adsorbent available to be filled in by the contaminants although both curves present a similar shape the volume of gas adsorbed in the case of mag nanocsh was almost double that of mag mno2 which is coherent with the bigger pore volume of the silicated compound with respect to the manganese oxide this characteristic would probably also explain the higher adsorption capacity observed for mag nanocsh samples of the adsorbents were subjected to x ray powder diffraction xrd analysis fig 4 presents the results for samples of mag nanocsh fe3o4 1 1 and mag mno2 the diffractogram of mag nanocsh fig 4a clearly shows signals at 2θ of 30 35 43 57 and 63 red which correspond to the crystalline structure of magnetite moreover the weak green signals at 2θ of 32 36 and 47 are associated with casio3 which tends to be amorphous under the experimental route followed in this work the low intensity of these signals confirmed the amorphous character of the external layers of casio3 as was seen in the sem and tem analyses besides signals associated with calcite caco3 at 2θ of 29 39 47 and 48 blue were observed likely owing to impurities in the reagents used in the synthesis lime or sodium silicate or by carbonation from the air during the process thus it is highly probable that these adsorbents would comprise a fe3o4 crystalline nucleus and have external layers of amorphous calcium silicate which is expected considering the great variety of polymeric and oligomeric species of silicates and silica existing in the na2sio3 aqueous solution which generate colloidal solids with an untidy structure fig 4b presents the xrd pattern of mag mno2 this diffractogram presents newly observed identical signals at 2θ of 30 35 43 57 and 63 red which are attributable to the crystalline structure of fe3o4 no signals corresponding to mno2 were observed which is expected given the amorphous character of this compound hence this adsorbent also would present a structure wherein a crystalline nucleus of magnetite is surrounded by amorphous layers of mno2 the higher the magnetic saturation ms of the adsorbent the easier it was to separate it from the resulting aqueous solution raffinate by introducing a permanent magnet in this sense measurements of magnetic properties of the synthesised adsorbents are necessary fig 5 shows the magnetisation curves of the prepared adsorbents and the magnetite employed in this work in this figure the dependence of the changes in the magnetic saturation ms expressed in emu g was plotted against the applied magnetic field expressed in oe 1 emu g 10 k oe it is clear that magnetite presents the highest magnetic response at over 80 emu g although during the synthesis of the adsorbents a small fraction of fe3o4 was oxidised to maghemite fe2o3 as can be seen in fig 5 the magnetic adsorbents mag mno2 and mag nanocsh fe3o4 at a 1 1 ratio present a high grade of magnetic saturation 59 35 emu g and 57 15 emu g respectively which ensured complete separation of the contaminant loaded adsorbent from the aqueous raffinate hence the composite having a lower proportion of fe3o4 nanocsh fe3o4 2 1 had lower magnetic saturation 42 70 emu g as was expected compared to the adsorbent nanocsh fe3o4 1 1 given its lower proport based on tem analysis and on the initial magnetic susceptibility obtained from fig 5 it is possible to make a good estimation of the layer thickness of the coatings present at the adsorbent particle composites this was accomplished by estimating the magnetic diameter dm of the particles associated to the magnetic core of the particles using the equation derived from the langevin function which assumes that the magnetic nanoparticles are monodisperse 27 as it can be seen in fig 5 the magnetism curves for mag nanocsh 1 1 and mag mno2 are almost overlapped which provides a rather similar layer thickness between 4 3 nm and 5 3 nm for both compounds undoubtedly the calcium silicate formed during the synthesis as well as the mno2 behaved as diamagnetic species compared with behaviour of the ferromagnetic precursor fe3o4 however fe3o4 by itself is not a good enough adsorbent and thus a suitable adsorbent composite must be structured by mixing the calcium silicate or the manganese oxide with magnetite in order to achieve an adsorbent with good adsorption capacity and sufficient magnetic properties making feasible the separation of the loaded adsorbent from the aqueous raffinate as was observed in this study with regard to the particle size of the adsorbents between 60 and 200 nm some particles act as nanoparticles presenting superparamagnetic properties and having almost null coercivity which would allow their reuse in further wastewater cycles meanwhile larger particles lose some of the characteristics that limit their reuse complementarily by means of the laser doppler electrophoresis method a phpzc of 3 5 was measured for mno2 fe3o4 a value that classifies the species to be adsorbed by this compound according to the surface charge of the adsorbent the surface electric charge of the adsorbent is influenced by the ph of the aqueous solution additionally a phpzc of 6 0 was measured for the commercial magnetite used in this study chemical analysis of the main components of the adsorbent was performed the contents of ca mn and fe were determined by aas of a previous acid digestion and elemental analysis of silicon content table 1 shows the chemical composition of the synthesised adsorbents adsorbent mag nanocsh corresponds to a calcium silicate hydrate hence the difference in the composition was attributed to the existence of water molecules associated with the solids a similar condition can be assigned to mag mno2 given that is a hydrous manganese oxide which also possesses many hydroxyl groups in its structure table 1 shows the average composition of the different adsorbents prepared in this study in ca mn fe and si 3 3 adsorption experiments the adsorbents synthesised in this study were used to treat polluted acid mine waters in this sense they must be low cost and also chemically and mechanically stable towards the action of acid solutions in a broad ph range given the great variety of acid and residual mine waters it is also possible that pollutant loaded solid adsorbents could be desorbed using acid solutions and recycled for new adsorption processing with this purpose a set of experiments was designed for contacting the adsorbents with aqueous solutions whose initial ph varied between 0 and 6 fig 6 presents the results the amounts of ca mn and fe leached were generally very low especially over ph 2 where only a minimal concentration of these metals was dissolved iron is not leached at all over ph 2 probably owing to in both adsorbents magnetite as the nucleus of the solid surrounded by layers of calcium silicate or mno2 which protects it from attack by protons slightly higher leaching of calcium and manganese was observed probably because they are more exposed in aqueous solutions given the sites of the external layers of both adsorbents and owing to their solubility undoubtedly when the acidity of the aqueous solution is too high specifically at ph below 2 0 the dissolution of these metals is caused by the direct attack of the extremely high concentration of hydrogen ions on the surface of the adsorbents promoting the leaching of the metals into and their presence in the resultant aqueous solutions subsequently it can be concluded that both types of adsorbents can be used for treating polluted aqueous solutions whose acidity is not below ph 2 0 in all cases despite the scarce dissolution of iron and other components the solids were completely separated from the solution using a neodymium magnet thus the magnetic saturation of the adsorbents remained constant before applying the adsorbents to the treatment of samples of actual acid mine water a series of experiments was designed to test them using aqueous solutions that simulate mine water the purpose was to establish the ph range in which the adsorbents presented their best adsorption capacity and to measure the contaminant loading capacity of both compounds defined as q and expressed in mg ion removed g adsorbent fig 7 shows the effect of the initial ph of the aqueous solution on the adsorption of pb ii cd ii cu ii and zn ii ions using mag mno2 as the adsorbent these experiments were carried out using aqueous solutions containing around 10 mg l of these metallic ions which were mixed with 50 mg of mag mno2 fig 7 shows that as the ph of the aqueous phase increases the extraction percentage of the four metallic species increases this adsorbent is a magnetic hydrous oxide compound whose surface can suffer protonation or deprotonation reactions this can be explained because the ph of zero charge phzc or zeta potential measured for this adsorbent was around 3 2 3 5 that is the adsorption of cationic metal species increased with increasing ph of the aqueous solution especially above the zero charge ph value phzc under this condition the adsorption of cationic species would be favoured owing to the polyhydroxylation of the surface of the adsorbent followed by a deprotonation of the hydroxyl groups thus favouring an adsorption mechanism governed by cation exchange between the metallic ion and the h groups as is expressed in the following equations 3 m n o h s o h a q m n o h 2 s 4 m n o h 2 s m a q 2 m n o 2 m s 2 2 h a q where m n o h s represents the manganese hydrous oxide and m is the metal ion present in the aqueous solution to be removed with regard to the adsorption of these divalent cations the metallic ion would coordinate with the donor oxygen atom on the surface of the adsorbent material liberating protons to the solution 24 on the other hand significant adsorption at a ph lower than the zeta potential ph 3 2 3 5 would not have occurred because in a sulphuric medium at least the four metals studied would not form anionic species that would feasibly be adsorbed by mno2 at low ph fig 7 shows that the adsorption of pb2 is preferred over that of cd2 and cu2 with zn2 being the least favoured it is also observed that the adsorption of all the ions reaches a maximum around ph 4 0 5 0 and does not increase at higher ph values as the range for the deprotonation of the h ions from the surface of the adsorbent is minimal however the acidity range of aqueous solutions between ph values of 1 and 5 is of interest in the treatment of acid mine waters both the acid mine drainages and the aqueous mining wastes generated in metallurgical plants are generally this acidic similar experiments were carried out for comparisons but only with fe3o4 observing much lower adsorption especially at more acidic ph levels owing not only to a lower adsorption capacity of magnetite given its structure but also because its phzc is close to 6 0 the latter prevents or limits the adsorption of metal ions on its surface at ph lower than this value considering that the mine water used also contained anionic species we conducted adsorption experiments of the oxyanion arsenates and molybdates normally found in numerous acid mine waters particularly those related to chilean copper mining they appear structurally associated with copper ores chemical species such as molybdenite mos2 and arsenic minerals such as enargite and tennantite the adsorption experiments were performed by mixing 50 mg of adsorbent with a feed solution containing 10 mg l of mo vi and as v the results are presented in fig 8 fig 8 shows that the adsorption of both oxyanionic species is favoured in the ph range between 1 and 2 that is under strongly acidic conditions this finding coincides with a ph range lower than the value measured for phzc for this adsorbent under these conditions the surface of the adsorbent would be polyprotonated thus acquiring its positive surface charge which would allow adsorption of anionic species by means of electrostatic attraction mechanisms and ion pair formation as illustrated in the following equations 5 m n o h s h a q m n o h 2 s 6 m n o h 2 s h a o x a q m n o h 2 h a o x s where h a o x represents the anionic species to be removed i e arsenates and molybdates equation 5 represents the polyprotonation of the surface of the adsorbent and equation 6 the formation of the ion pair o h 2 h a o x s however according to the chemical stability tests the ph suitable for the removal of these species should be around 2 0 although the adsorption is still good at lower ph the risk of its dissolution also increases fig 6 shows that a better relative adsorption of molybdates with respect to arsenates under the given experimental conditions these results could be explained by an analysis of the ionic chemical speciation of as and mo in aqueous solutions for example at very low ph as v can form arsenic acid h3aso4 less dissociated in arsenates a species that would probably be adsorbed to a great extent in turn the predominant mo vi species in aqueous solutions are the molybdate ions which depending on the concentration of mo in solution and its ph can form various anionic species however complete adsorption of these ions could be achieved if enough adsorbent mass was used in sum besides the acidity of the aqueous phase to be treated the relative mass of adsorbent used in the experiments strongly affected the adsorption of the ionic species present in solution fig 9 shows the experimental results obtained for the adsorption of the ions from an aqueous phase with an initial ph of 3 0 containing 10 mg l of each ion the disappearance of ions from aqueous solution is plotted as a function of the mass of adsorbent used in the experiments where c and c 0 represent the ion concentration at any time t and its initial concentration respectively these results would be related to an approximation of the saturation of the adsorption sites available on the mag mno2 surface when low amounts of adsorbent are used in this case practically all the adsorption sites would be occupied by the metal ions resulting in a greater mass of adsorbate removed per unit mass of adsorbent an adequate relationship must be found between the adsorbent mass to be used and the net mass of metal to be removed depending on the concentration of the ion and the volume of aqueous solution to be used however in fig 9 it is observed that for a certain concentration of the ions in solution 10 mg l the percentage of adsorption increases as the amount of adsorbent used increases it is also evident an increasing of the adsorption of as v and mo vi would allow a complete clean up of the aqueous solution to achieve a high adsorption efficiency a sufficient adsorbent mass is required so as to offer enough available active sites for adsorption the ion loading capacity q for 10 to 20 mg ion g mag mno2 was measured and the results were comparable to or exceeded those achieved using the traditionally used adsorbents which lacks magnetic properties as a general conclusion mag mno2 presents excellent characteristics that allow both the removal of metal ions that form cationic species in solution as well as anionic species depending on the ph of the treated aqueous phase moreover in all cases the loaded adsorbent could be separated easily and completely from the aqueous raffinate using the respective magnetic saturation capacity similar adsorption experiments were conducted with aqueous solutions that simulate mine water but using the other adsorbent i e the mag nanocsh previous studies reported the use of this non magnetised compound however given its particle size and chemical structure its separation from the aqueous solution after adsorption is very complex 19 23 as reported above the magnetic silicates synthesised in this work showed a sufficient degree of magnetic saturation which allowed their easy and complete separation from the aqueous raffinate via a neodymium magnet several adsorption experiments were designed and carried out using an aqueous solution that simulated mine water containing higher concentrations than that used with the mag mno2 the synthesised mag nanocsh fe3o4 at a 1 1 ratio was utilised as the adsorbent fig 10 shows the influence of the initial ph of the aqueous solution on the adsorption of ions onto this adsorbent composite the initial concentrations of the contaminants were 100 mg l for pb cu and zn 60 mg l for cd and 50 mg l for mo and as an almost quantitative adsorption of the four metallic ions was independent of the acidity of the contacted aqueous phase this is mainly because the calcium silicates alkalize the medium very quickly irrespective of the initial acidity of the aqueous solution generating very stable granular precipitates in all cases the silicates acted as a buffer always maintaining a ph higher than 7 0 in the raffinate preventing redissolution of the precipitates obtained the latter pose sufficient magnetic saturation which facilitated their separation from the resulting aqueous phase fig 10 also shows that the adsorption of mo vi species is reasonably high particularly at low ph whereas the adsorption of as v species is limited the preferred adsorption of molybdenum is explicable as the mo vi species for most ph values are predominantly anionic these species would be adsorbed onto the highly protonated surface of the adsorbent through electrostatic attraction furthermore it is conceivable that the higher or lesser adsorption of anionic species by mag nanocsh would be related to the solubility of the respectively formed calcium salts that is the calcium molybdates formed would be sufficiently insoluble to allow good adsorption the low adsorption of as v observed in these experiments could be explained by the low adsorbent mass used considering the vast number of species that need to be removed thus higher as v removal can be achieved using a sufficient quantity of adsorbent in fact calcium arsenates and double calcium and iron arsenates are quite insoluble which permits good adsorption preferably at ph over 2 0 where most of the as v is dissociated as h3aso4 19 a significant fraction of the heavy metals present in the amds is expected to precipitate when increasing the ph of the aqueous solution when lime is added controlled experiments were carried out using only lime to increase the ph of amd solutions the removal of anionic species was not good the removal of some metallic ions although important in many cases in incomplete in the case of zn pb cr among others due to the formation of highly soluble poly hydroxylated species and their amphoteric behaviour chemical precipitation with lime or limestones has many problems such as the re dissolution of metal precipitates the need of huge amounts of chemicals the generation of large volumes of colloidal sludges etc precipitation with lime also provides the incomplete removal of arsenate molybdate and sulphate ions and fails to eliminate traces of other problematic contaminants therefore using only lime it is not possible to fulfil the chilean environmental national regulations for discharging residual mining waters to continental water bodies in this sense the combined use of mag nanocsh and mag mno2 overcomes this difficulties allowing a complete and simultaneous removal of anionic and cationic species dissolved in acidic mine waters several adsorption experiments were performed with variable adsorbent masses an aqueous solution containing 100 mg l of pb cu and zn 60 mg l of cd and 50 mg l of mo and as and whose acidity was adjusted to ph 3 0 was used in all the experimental runs the results obtained are presented in fig 11 fig 11 shows that in all cases adsorption yields greater than 95 for all metal ions and mo vi were achieved with the exception of lower adsorption of arsenic species whose complete removal was achieved with the integrated use of both magnetic adsorbents higher loading capacities q were measured by using mag nanocsh compared to mag mno2 for removing the contaminant ions in fact q variables between 20 and 40 mg ion g mag nanocsh were found confirming that this compound should be recommended for reducing higher ion contents present in aqueous solutions in the first stage of treatment followed by the use of mag mno2 in the second stage as a polishing adsorbent for more toxic species commonly present in lower concentrations this way it would be possible to fulfil with the strict environmental regulations associated with acid mine waters when using mag nanocsh metallic ions were adsorbed most likely through combined mechanisms such as a by the formation of the respective hydroxide or mixed hydroxides with the silanol groups of the silicates on the surface of adsorbents and as discrete particles of hydroxides in solution or b via cation exchange between the adsorbed metal that becomes part of the structure of the silicate with the ca atoms of the adsorbent which are released to the raffinate solution in turn the possible mechanism of removal of anionic species as molybdates and arsenates would be governed by an anion exchange mechanism between the oxyanions existing in aqueous solution and the silicate groups of the adsorbent forming the respective calcium salt the more insoluble the formed calcium salt with the adsorbed anion the higher its stability thus promoting greater adsorption and less redissolution in the resulting raffinate additionally the main reason behind conferring magnetic properties to the adsorbents is more related to achieving an easier separation of the contaminant loaded magnetic adsorbent from the resulting aqueous solution using a conventional permanent magnet rather than to increase their adsorption capacity both adsorbents do not have magnetic properties but are very good adsorbents furthermore magnetite fe3o4 the compound used to provide magnetic properties to the adsorbents composites presents a very small adsorption capacity our control experiments indicated that magnetite only could adsorb around 2 3 of cu and zn less than 1 of cd and pb and exhibits a null adsorption of as and mo species besides magnetite presents a pzc close to 6 0 limiting the adsorption of ionic species at ph lower than this value it is clear that the magnetite covered with calcium silicate or hydrous mno2 did not affected their high adsorption capacity compared to pure calcium silicate hydrate or mno2 adsorbents then the magnetics composites mag nanocsh and mag mno2 would be ideal engineered materials enabling the efficient adsorption of contaminants and the complete separation of the solids from the treated mine water 3 4 treatment tests of an acid mine water the practical objective of using the adsorbents prepared in this study was the treatment of acid waters contaminated with different ionic species both cationic and anionic in this sense it is required that the adsorbents ideally present capacity to remove several ions collectively and simultaneously using samples of a mine water generated during chilean copper mining activity a series of previous experiments was conducted to measure the adsorption selectivity coefficients using both adsorbents the selectivity coefficient represents the quotient of the respective loading capacities between a pair of ions according to the following expression 7 α qa qb where α is the selectivity coefficient and qa and qb are the adsorption loading capacities of the metal ions a and b respectively both expressed in mg adsorbed ion g adsorbent the selectivity tests were carried out using a mine water in which the concentration for each ion was adjusted in 10 mg l and its ph to 3 0 table 2 shows the measured values of coefficient α it is obvious that the closer the selectivity factor is to 1 0 the less selective the adsorbent and therefore the greater its capacity for collective adsorption although the selectivity α coefficient is sensitive to the acidity of the aqueous phase the content of the metal ions and the mass of adsorbent used in each case table 2 shows that generally both adsorbents have high collective adsorption capacity as most of the α coefficients are close to 1 0 this is necessary for treating polluted waters containing multiple ionic contaminants these results led us to design an integrated system using both adsorbents for cleaning up the mine waste solution in the first stage the sample of the acid mine water was treated with mag nanocsh which generally has a higher adsorption capacity than mag mno2 does table 3 shows the initial concentration of all the studied ions their concentration in the raffinate after adsorption with this compound the extent of adsorption of each species and the limit of discharge to continental water bodies according to the chilean national norm 28 once the adsorption process which required only a few minutes was completed the loaded adsorbent was completely separated from the aqueous raffinate using a neodymium magnet using this technique allowed us to solve one of the most complex pollution issues with the help of microadsorbents or nanoadsorbents as their separation from the treated water is based on their magnetic properties all the results reflect that the high adsorption achieved for all species with this unique process can help meet the discharge regulations for copper zinc and molybdenum ions in acid mine waters furthermore by using mag nanocsh it was possible to reduce by a very high proportion the fine solid particles suspended in the mine water via their adherence through coprecipitation onto the solids formed in the process in the second step the aqueous raffinate produced in the first stage was mixed with the adsorbent mag mno2 although this compound had a lower adsorption capacity compared with that of mag nanocsh it was useful for treating aqueous solution containing trace or lower concentrations of generally more toxic pollutants considering that the use of mag nanocsh in the first step raised the original ph of the aqueous solution to over ph 7 0 the raffinate was re acidified with sulfuric acid to around ph 4 table 4 shows the results of this second treatment the results reported in table 4 indicate that this second adsorbent could reduce the contents of all ions in the second raffinate effectively including the more toxic and dangerous ones to a level below the limit fixed by the chilean environmental discharge regulation the process was quick and again the loaded mag mno2 compound was separated easily and completely from the resulting aqueous solution with the permanent magnet hence as a global result it is possible to state that the integrated use of both synthesised adsorbents both prepared following a low cost and simple process make feasible an effective and complete decontamination treatment of acid mining water both adsorbents are very stable whenever the initial ph of the aqueous solutions is above 2 0 where the material losses is expected to be below 0 2 0 8 percent expressed as leaching of fe ca and mn fig 6 moreover mechanical attrition of the adsorbents was not appreciated during the experiments these magnetic adsorbents could also be applied for processing many kinds of residual polluted industrial waters in a further report in preparation we will communicate in detail the equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic behaviours of both adsorbents when used in acidic solutions 4 conclusions two adsorbents with magnetic properties based on fe3o4 coated with nanostructured calcium silicate hydrate mag nanocsh and manganese oxide mag mno2 were successfully prepared with the purpose of their integrated use for remediation of an acid mine water both adsorbents were quite stable towards aqueous solutions with ph over 2 0 as dissolution was not observed under this condition both compounds were characterised using different methodologies sem and tem analyses indicated that the individual particle size of the adsorbents varies between 60 and 200 nm leading to a tendency to agglomerate bet porosimetry analysis showed a particle surface area variable between 30 and 70 m2 g and a pore diameter of around 2 10 nm xrd analysis confirmed that mag nanocsh and mag mno2 adsorbents present a crystalline magnetite nucleus surrounded by amorphous layers of calcium silicate or mno2 respectively the nanostructures and microstructures of both composites showed many available adsorption sites and their chemical structures made them very efficient at simultaneously adsorbing both cationic and anionic species in aqueous solutions both adsorbents had magnetic moments of around 57 59 emu g which was lower than the corresponding value for fe3o4 and yet high enough to ensure their complete separation from the aqueous raffinate the adsorption of ionic species was affected by the acidity of the aqueous solution however in the ph range of around 2 4 most of the contaminants were collectively removed through adsorption mechanisms based on ion exchange ion pair formation and insoluble salt and hydroxide formation the loading capacity of the adsorbents was affected by the adsorbent mass and the concentration of the species to be removed from the aqueous solution both adsorbents were used in an integrated manner to decontaminate a sample of an acid mine water mag nanocsh which has a higher adsorption capacity was used in the first step and drastically reduced the concentration of many ions present in the treated water consecutively after re acidification the raffinate produced in the first step was mixed with mag mno2 which resulted in an aqueous solution that met the chilean environmental regulations for discharge into continental water bodies acknowledgement the authors

have allowed unconventional oil and gas o g production from deep and less permeable shale formations these breakthroughs have brought changes and challenges to water resources and environmental management which are of particular concerns to producers engineers regulators and the public hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water represent the largest waste stream generated during o g exploration and production annual flowback and produced water production in the united states was estimated to be 3 2 billion m3 20 6 billion barrels in 2012 1 more than 93 of produced water from onshore wells is injected underground for disposal and reservoir pressure maintenance 1 however there are increasing concerns that deep well injection may be responsible for increasing rates of seismic activity 2 potential comingling with freshwater aquifers as well as negative impacts on the quality of adjacent surface waters and microbial communities in downstream sediments 3 4 the volume of unconventional o g wastewater requiring disposal has continued to grow despite the recent slowing in drilling and production 5 meanwhile substantial amounts of freshwater are used by the petroleum industry for well drilling and hydraulic fracturing 6 if produced water is managed as a water resource instead of a waste product the water generated could supplement regional water demand while minimizing the volume of produced water for disposal thus reducing o g production costs and environmental implications sustainable development of o g production requires thorough understanding of produced water quality selecting appropriate treatment technologies for beneficial uses and establishing environmentally sound management strategies considering the broad range of treatment processes and the recent technological advances it is essential to have a clear guidance and tools to assist in evaluation and selection of treatment technologies to meet site specific reuse needs besides treatment capacity and removal efficiency of contaminants other factors affecting the selection of treatment technologies including technology industrial status commercially available or under development adaptability feasibility energy consumption capital operational and maintenance costs footprint space requirement skilled labor requirement infrastructure requirement brine disposal as well as user preferences should be considered in the selection process therefore selecting treatment and management options involves a complex decision making process that requires the consideration of multiple criteria constraints and objectives a decision support tool dst that can assist in selection of treatment technologies and evaluation of the feasibility of potential water uses is in great need a number of dsts have been developed based on multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods 7 8 linear nonlinear and dynamic programming tools have been applied to optimize treatment selections from a large range of alternatives using boundary constraints 9 12 however very few of the tools have been applied to real produced water treatment and management because they are either too simple to provide detailed analysis and essential outputs or too complicated for general users to understand and operate a user friendly dst should provide simple yet efficient interactions between a user and the dst editable input choices and easily understandable outputs an integrated dst idst was previously developed for treatment and beneficial use of coalbed methane cbm produced water 13 14 it includes a comprehensive water quality database for several major cbm basins in the united states this computerized produced water management tool assists users in assessing treatment options costs and environmental and institutional issues associated with treatment and beneficial use of cbm produced water the idst framework provides a quick analysis and screening of various produced water treatment and management options in this study the idst was upgraded with more functions and user choices and further developed and enhanced beyond the cbm to shale gas and other unconventional water resources 15 the primary objective of this publication is to demonstrate the application of the idst for selecting the treatment technologies and evaluating the beneficial use feasibility of hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water the marcellus shale in pennsylvania and the barnett shale in texas were selected as case studies to determine produced water treatment technologies and beneficial use options considering realistic site specific conditions assumptions and future projections such as well numbers and locations water demands flowback and produced water quality and quantity availability of disposal sites and costs the idst has built in beneficial use options including hydraulic fracturing using gel and slickwater systems potable reuse crop irrigation surface water discharge and user defined beneficial use water quality requirements for each of the beneficial use options the tool also compares the costs of treatment and beneficial uses of produced water scenarios to the existing produced water disposal costs as such the tool can be used to perform a quick screening and break even point for treatment relative to disposal under site specific conditions a detailed description of the idst methodology is in the part i of the idst series papers 15 2 logistics and modules of the idst the idst consists of four basic modules water quality module wqm treatment selection module tsm beneficial use screening module bsm and beneficial use economic module bem fig 1 the wqm is built upon a composite geochemical database previously developed for cbm produced water 13 14 it was created with 3255 entries covering major cbm basins in the rocky mountain region including the powder river basin in montana and wyoming the raton basin in colorado and new mexico and the san juan basin in colorado and new mexico the wqm contained comprehensive information on 58 parameters and constituents including field measurements e g ph temperature conductivity and dissolved oxygen metals non metals organics and radionuclides 13 in this study the wqm was expanded with additional 2791 entries for water quality data of flowback and produced water from the major o g producing basins in the united states including the barnett shale play in texas the lansing kansas city formation in texas the marcellus shale in pennsylvania and west virginia the morrow shale in

quality data and fit into the wqm datasheet the quality assurance and quality control for the wqm is described in the supplementary content file the tsm is designed to select proper treatment technologies based on feed water quality user preferences and desired product water quality the tsm includes 62 processes as stand alone pretreatment desalination and post treatment as well as

as 25 000 mg l for brackish water ro bwro 40 000 mg l for seawater ro swro 70 000 mg l for thermal technologies desalination cost of feed water in the higher bins could be significantly higher than in the lower tds bins in addition to tds bins the selection of technologies considers the treatment limits of other contaminants such as organic matter suspended solids and toxicity of certain constituents the user inputs criteria such as water quality water quantity desired water recovery and other site specific operational objectives to assist in the selection of appropriate treatment processes the user can also include or exclude certain treatment processes such as including or excluding seawater ro in the selected treatment train using these inputs along with a robust selection methodology the tool generates potential treatment trains capable of treating flowback and produced water to a quality suitable for each pre programmed or user defined beneficial use the tsm preferentially selects the minimum number of processes in a logical order required to treat a given feed water stream for beneficial use requirements the tsm generates a report detailing three suggested treatment trains with estimated product water quality and quantity energy requirements brine quality and quantity and a proposed brine management strategy for each beneficial use option in addition to onsite uses for hydraulic fracturing and drilling produced water can be used for agricultural irrigation in stream flow augmentation firefighting dust control cooling water for thermal power plants and other user defined beneficial use options the bsm stores eleven beneficial use options each of them is assigned appropriate product water quality requirements that the selected

were developed based on specific design criteria defined through the tsm general project criteria based on professional experience and unit costs for power chemicals and labor this cost estimate was developed to compare the treatment processes at screening level 3 case study setup to evaluate the beneficial use potential of flowback and produced water case studies were conducted using the idst for the marcellus shale and the barnett shale the quantity of flowback and produced water generated during shale gas exploration and production was estimated based on historical data and production trends water treatment technologies were selected to meet the water quality requirements of beneficial uses the beneficial reuse potentials were assessed and optimized by ranking user defined criteria such as technical viability adoptability energy and chemical demand labor skill requirement and screening level estimated costs for treatment reuse and disposal 3 1 study field the marcellus shale the marcellus shale is the largest natural gas producing play in the united states and is rapidly growing in recent years especially in pennsylvania new wells drilled in pennsylvania have been rapidly increasing since 2007 when breakthrough on hydraulic fracturing techniques occurred 20 flowback and produced water reuse increased remarkably from 15 to 20 in 2009 to approximately 90 in 2013 mainly for new well drilling 20 beneficial use of the reclaimed water makes up to approximately 10 of the water needed for hydraulic fracturing job for a new well flowback and produced water requires proper treatment before reuse or disposal in the marcellus shale reuse for hydraulic fracturing needs oil gas water separation filtration and dilution dilution of the wastewater is aimed to decrease contaminant concentrations such as tds total suspended solids tss total hardness and chloride to an acceptable level for hydraulic fracturing and is the most common method for reuse of flowback and produced water disposal well injection is also used in the marcellus shale with annual volume of approximately 2 5 million barrels bbl 0 4 million m3 the number of deep injection wells salt water disposal wells swd is limited in pennsylvania only eight swd wells were permitted to dispose shale gas flowback and produced water fig 2 these swd wells are class ii wells regulated by the united states environmental protection agency usepa underground injection control program under the safe drinking water act tioga county and washington county in pennsylvania were selected for this specific case study because of their locations and number of shale gas producing wells both counties have high density of shale gas wells and available water quality data tioga county is far from the disposal wells while washington county is close to the injection wells and the state of ohio where more disposal wells are available hauling cost was estimated to range from 4 bbl to 8 bbl 25 m3 50 m3 in pennsylvania while injection cost was estimated to be 0 50 bbl 2 50 bbl 3 1 m3 15 7 m3 21 pipeline cost was calculated assuming an average 10 mile distance from a wellhead to treatment facilities or impoundments 3 2 study field the barnett shale during its development the barnett shale became a leading shale gas production field in the united states in 2008 when horizontal drilling techniques were first adopted and refined 22 23 disposal well injection is the most common choice for barnett shale producers because of its economics and availability as compared to the marcellus shale in pennsylvania lower hauling and injection costs were reported in the barnett shale because of the large number of injection wells and shorter distance to disposal sites hauling cost is estimated to be 1 0 bbl hr 6 3 m3 hr while disposal cost is 0 5 1 0 bbl 3 1 6 3 m3 some producers are reusing a small amount of wastewater and many have started considering beneficial use options the railroad commission of texas recognizes concerns over water use by the o g industry and encourages recycling projects to reduce the amount of fresh water used in exploration and production 24 4 data collection and analysis 4 1 projection of flowback and produced water quantity 4 1 1 flowback water quantity in the marcellus and barnett shales the marcellus flowback water quantity was calculated based on the portion of injected hydraulic fracturing liquid that returns to the surface and forms flowback water the annual water demand and flowback water generation in the marcellus shale are summarized in table s2 supplementary content an average of 6 7 of injected water could be recovered as flowback water 25 26 in this case study an average of 6 5 was taken as the flowback water recovery rate the flowback water quantity was estimated based on the projected water demand corresponding to historic high and low gas production in the marcellus shale figure s1 in supplementary material the calculated flowback water quantity for the year 2010 was 1 78 million m3 470 million gallons while the quantity reported by industry was 1 84 million m3 485 million gallon in 2010 27 this 3 1 difference is considered acceptable for flowback water projection indicating that the projection data would be reasonable to calculate future flowback water production used in this case study flowback water quantity in the barnett shale was reported to be 500 000 600 000 gallons per well within 10 days after hydraulic fracturing 28 in this case study the average flowback flow rate was assumed to be 55 000 gallons per well per day for 10 days 4 1 2 produced water quantity in the marcellus and barnett shales because there is lack of produced water quantity data over a well lifetime for the marcellus and barnett shales the produced water quantity projection was based on a study of flowback and produced water volume in the denver basin wattenberg colorado 29 a harmonic function provided good fit to the observed data and is expressed as 1 q t q i 1 d i t where qt is produced water flow rate at time t qi is the initial water production rate and di is the initial decay rate 29 after applying the water quantity data from the marcellus shale coalition database average values of qi and di were estimated and the equation of produced water production as a function of well time for the marcellus shale is described as 2 q t 15 5 1 2 718 t produced water quantity of a shale gas well for the first year was assumed to be 12 1 bbl day based on industry reported values 29 compared with the marcellus shale the barnett shale is a high long term produced water generating play 29 the barnett shale wells generate 5 times more produced water than the marcellus wells 28 fig 3 based on eq 1 produced water flow rate for a barnett shale well as a function of well time is estimated as 3 q t 15 5 1 0 4 t 4 2 flowback and produced water quality database in the case study the quality of flowback and produced water was assumed to be stable over the lifetime of a well although flowback water quality changes significantly within the first few weeks after fracturing 30 31 its overall quality was considered stable because of its smaller volume and mixing during storage in a pond before treatment or disposal the flowback and produced water quality data for the marcellus shale were retrieved from the usgs national produced waters geochemical database v2 3 provisional and the marcellus shale coalition shale gas produced water quality database 16 of the 161 915 produced water quality data sets in the usgs database 2723 sets are for shale gas produced water distributed in oklahoma pennsylvania new york ohio and texas a statistical analysis was conducted for the produced water quality data retrieved from the usgs database the maximum minimum average 25th 50th and 75th percentile values for each parameter and constituent were calculated by state and shale formation and were included in the idst for users to choose total number of tds data points reported in this database was 979 after quality assurance and quality control qa qc with the highest tds concentration of 345 000 mg l and the lowest concentration of 390 mg l the tds distribution in produced water by state and formation is illustrated in figure s2 in supplementary content the measured tds concentration of shale gas produced water reported data averages 84 870 mg l the marcellus shale coalition produced water database included the fracturing flowback and produced water quality data of 19 wells in the marcellus shale these data were collected and reported in figure s3 and s4 in the supplementary content 18 water quality data at day 1 5 14 and 90 were collected following the hydraulic fracturing job a total of 65 tds values were reported in the database as flowback and produced water and 19 values were reported as influent water stream water used for hydraulic fracturing the tds of flowback water increased overtime and reached produced water tds level in 14 90 days fig 4 compared to the marcellus shale the flowback and produced water quality data for the barnett shale were very limited and not included in the usgs database 16 the data were mainly retrieved from a study conducted by hayes and severin in the barnett and appalachian shale water management and reuse technologies 32 this study reported the barnett shale flowback water quality data from five wells on days 1 3 5 6 7 10 and 12 the average tds concentration of flowback water was 37 800 mg l the produced water quality data for the barnett shale were obtained from multiple sources 28 33 the average tds concentration of flowback water was 67 285 mg l 4 3 beneficial use options according to the united states census of agriculture data of pennsylvania farms both tioga county and washington county have more than 1000 farms which makes agricultural irrigation water use significant 34 thus beneficial use for irrigation was included in this case study reuse options included hydraulic fracturing using gel and slickwater systems and crop irrigation potable use of produced water was not considered in this study due to high salinity economic consideration potential liability concerns and potential human health impacts the water quality requirements for beneficial uses in pennsylvania are summarized in table 1 where class b is for edible crop irrigation and class c for non edible crop irrigation 35 the tds requirement for irrigation varies depending on the types of crops and soil this study used 1500 mg l tds as irrigation requirement surface discharge requires water quality no worse than the class a requirement with tds less than 500 mg l other contaminants that are required by the primary and secondary drinking water standards set by the usepa are also required in the class a water quality standard which is regulated for potable water use potable water aquifer recharge and other residential uses 35 these water quality requirements are only used for the case study purpose for real applications long term impacts to plant health and soil conditions need to be monitored and further studied other components in produced water that rarely exist in domestic wastewater such as naturally occurring radionuclides materials petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals also need to be well evaluated for human and soil health reusing flowback and produced water for hydraulic fracturing is becoming a common practice in the o g industry hydraulic fracturing is conducted with one of two fluid systems slickwater or crosslink gel methods for slickwater fracturing the fracturing liquid is pumped down the well bore at very high flow rate with the addition of friction reducer and proppant such as sand for crosslink gel method gels are introduced into the fracturing liquid to increase its viscosity thus increase the stability of proppant suspension compared to slickwater system crosslink gel system can be used for fracturing of deeper formation and it creates wider fractures yet it requires more experienced operators the quality of the water is important for hydraulic fracturing because impurities can reduce the efficiency of the additives used in the process however there is lack of common standards to determine the quality requirement of the water for fracturing it is highly dependent upon the formation the fracturing methods and chemicals added in the process for example a recent review showed the metal crosslinked guar fluids prepared with produced water were successfully used in wells at bottomhole temperatures up to about 121 c with produced water tds up to 300 000 mg l and hardness up to 44 000 mg l 36 compared to conventional gelled fracturing fluids the performance of slickwater fluids is generally less sensitive to mix water quality however high salinity mix water will cause a loss in achievable friction reduction in this study it was assumed that slickwater system requires water with tds lower than 40 000 mg l while crosslink gel system does not have strict tds requirement but have specific requirements on certain ions as listed in table 2 these water quality requirements are examples for the case studies and within the range of fracturing fluids mix water requirements users can enter their specific water quality requirement in the idst 4 4 case study assumptions user score input which indicates the importance of each parameter was set to default values for this case study as shown in fig 5 a with no preference in specific treatment technologies user preference input was not changed indicating that no specific treatment technology was included or excluded as shown in fig 5b economic assumption of the case study utilizes values pre stored in the idst as shown in fig 6 5 case study results 5 1 marcellus shale 5 1 1 produced water quality in tioga and washington counties the tds concentration of produced water in tioga county ranges from 746 mg l to 358 000 mg l with an average of 88 500 mg l much higher than most beneficial use water quality requirements average tss concentration is 468 mg l alkalinity 114 mg l as caco3 total hardness sum of ca2 and mg2 768 mg l as caco3 and ph 7 4 table a2 in supplementary content the average concentrations of tds and major ions of produced water in washington county are higher than in tioga county fig 7 it should be noted that the concentrations used in the study were the average values from the usgs produced water quality database the tss concentration unlike other parameters is three times lower than that of the produced water in tioga county this produced water quality difference would lead to a higher treatment cost for beneficial use of produced water in washington county due to higher concentrations of sodium chloride and hardness 5 1 2 selected produced water treatment technologies for the tioga county produced water no desalination is required for hydraulic fracturing using gel system as it does not have a limit on tds concentration the treatment trains selected by the idst are summarized in table 3 treatment is required to remove suspended solids sparingly soluble salts and inactivate microorganisms hydraulic fracturing using slickwater method requires removal of suspended solids sparingly soluble salts and tds by desalination because of its 40 000 mg l tds limit and other ion concentration requirements reuse for hydraulic fracturing requires disinfection because bacteria present in the fracturing fluid will sour the well producing organic acids and increasing operational expenses as a result of the corrosion e g h2s pitting stress cracking in both surface equipment and subsurface pipes mechanical vapor compression mvc distillation was selected by the idst as the desalination technique for the produced water with feed salinity of 88 500 mg l for washington county produced water the selected treatment processes for the three reuse options are the same starting with chemical softening and precipitation followed by media filtration to remove particulate matters including suspended petroleum hydrocarbons although salinity level is not required for hydraulic fracturing using gel system mvc was adopted to reduce chloride concentration to lower than 40 000 mg l the product water is required to blend with filtered produced water to meet water quality requirements mvc was also selected for hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system and for irrigation to reduce salinity level to the required concentration the mvc product water is blended with filtered produced water to meet the water quality requirement for different beneficial use purposes 5 1 3 screening level estimated project costs for produced water treatment 5 1 3 1 tioga county produced water according to the pennsylvania state impact project there were 640 active shale gas wells in tioga county owned by 9 operators 37 the produced water production in tioga county was projected for the next 15 years based on eq 2 and the number of existing wells in the county in this case study shale gas wells were grouped by operators that is produced water from all the wells operated by the same operator would be collected treated by clustered treatment facilities and reused produced water quantity for each operator was assumed to be proportional to the number of wells they own two companies that own the most wells 386 and the least well one in tioga county were chosen to represent two extreme production conditions company a represents the scenario of clustered produced water treatment collected from 386 wells with a high flow rate of 0 394 million gal day mgd 9373 bbl day 1490 m3 day while company b with only one well represents wellhead treatment with a flow rate of 320 gal day 7 7 bbl day 1 2 m3 day the capital cost of a wellhead treatment train would be much lower than that of clustered treatment due to small size of the facilities however the unit cost in terms of dollars per gallon would be much higher for wellhead treatment because of elevated capital investment and labor costs normalized by gallon of treated water the economic scale of costs of the wellhead treatment is extremely low due to small flow rate the treatment costs and energy demand for the treatment trains selected by the idst are summarized in table 4 among the three beneficial use scenarios hydraulic fracturing using gel system had the lowest capital and o m costs because of its low product water quality requirement especially no tds limit hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system was ranked the second it had higher electrical energy demand and the desalinated water would be blended with filtered water to meet the water quality requirement for all the case studies the lifetime of treatment facilities was assumed to be 10 years capital and o m costs for the three beneficial use options did not differ considerably at low flow rate scenario wellhead treatment because of smaller facility size and less labor requirement total annualized costs of wellhead treatment options in tioga county ranged from 256 800 year to 259 200 year however at high flow rate scenario the differences became significant the annual o m costs of reusing produced water for slickwater fracking and irrigation were approximately 2 times higher than those for gel system capital costs were approximately 4 9 million for gel system 8 3 million for slickwater system and 8 3 million for irrigation use for wellhead treatment for low flow rate annual unit o m costs were approximately 1 9 gal 502 m3 while total annual unit costs were approximately 2 2 gal 581 m3 therefore wellhead water treatment was deemed to be cost inhibitive due to small capacity versus the economic scale of costs at the high flow rate gel system had the lowest o m and total costs 0 003 and 0 007 gal respectively while the costs for hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system and irrigation were estimated to be 0 005 and 0 011 gal respectively 5 1 3 2 washington county produced water by 2014 there were 1094 shale gas wells in the washington county owned by 10 operators 37 the companies operating 748 wells and 1 well were chosen to simulate high and low produced water quantity scenarios at 0 889 mgd 21 174 bbl day 3 36 million m3 day and 350 gal day 8 38 bbl day 1 3 m3 day respectively produced water flow rate over time for washington county had similar trend as tioga county high flow rate scenario in washington county had higher flow rate than in tioga county which led to lower unit costs operators with the least wells in both counties had 1 well which makes their flow rates similar thus almost same costs table 4 as the same treatment processes were selected to the three beneficial reuse options the idst estimated the same capital cost and o m cost for different beneficial use scenarios 2 03 gal 536 m3 for low flow rate of 350 gal day 1 3 m3 day and 0 01 gal 2 64 m3 for high flow rate of 0 889 mgd 3 36 million m3 day because the costs calculated in the idst were at a screening level the cost estimate was not sensitive enough to reflect the amounts of chemicals used such as lime and soda to achieve different product water qualities however the idst allows users to enter chemical uses for more accurate cost estimate the difference of costs between low flow scenario and high flow scenario was significant low flow scenario required much lower capital cost and annual energy consumption but had a much higher unit cost table 4 5 1 4 cost comparison of beneficial uses deep well injection and transportation deep well injection is the most commonly used disposal method for shale gas produced water because of its low cost in pennsylvania the number of injection wells is very limited because of the geological condition of the formation among the five active injection wells that accept wastewater from the o g industry the nearest one is over 120 miles from tioga county which makes transportation cost significantly high an average 8 bbl 0 19 gal 50 3 m3 hauling cost of produced water was estimated for tioga county 21 injection cost generally ranges from 0 5 bbl to 2 5 bbl 0 0119 0 0595 gal 3 15 15 7 m3 considering the supply and demand relationship in pennsylvania 2 bbl 0 0476 gal 12 6 m3 of injection cost was assumed for tioga county resulting in an overall disposal cost including deep well injection and transportation of 10 bbl 0 238 gal 62 9 m3 it was estimated that a produced water flow rate of 170 bbl day 27 m3 day would be required to breakeven disposal cost with treatment cost for gel system assuming a produced water flow rate of 2 3 bbl day per well reuse of produced water for a group of 60 100 wells would be more cost efficient than disposal considering all operators in tioga county 3 out of 8 operators own more than 60 wells while all others own less than 30 wells centralizing and treating produced water from multiple operators would be recommended to small operators to minimize treatment costs the nearest injection well that accepts o g wastewater from washington county is approximately 50 miles away in pennsylvania injection wells in ohio were not included in this case study because of limited information an estimated hauling cost of 4 bbl 0 0952 gal 25 2 m3 was adopted while 2 bbl 0 0476 gal 12 6 m3 injection cost was added to the total cost of 6 bbl 0 143 gal 37 8 m3 for disposal using deep injection wells which is 40 less than that in tioga county using the breakeven approach to balance with the disposal cost produced water from at least 100 165 wells needs to be collected and treated at a clustered facility in washington county only two operators own more than 100 wells and can make beneficial use cost efficiently by themselves other operators are recommended to collectively treat produced water and develop clustered treatment systems to decrease the costs it should be noted that the cost for purchasing fresh water for hydraulic fracturing was not included in the cost analysis taking into account the fresh water costs would further offset the costs for reusing flowback and produced water 5 1 5 flowback water in marcellus shale pennsylvania hydraulic fracturing flowback water quality and quantity were retrieved from the marcellus shale coalition produced water database 18 among the 19 wells in the database the well j is located in tioga county and the wells b and f are located in washington county the water quality for days 1 5 14 and 15 was chosen to represent flowback water the weighted average of water quality based on daily flow rate was calculated in the idst table 5 the flowback water flow rate for tioga county was taken as the average value of the 19 wells 878 bbl day 140 m3 day for washington county the average flow rate for wells b and f was assumed to be 930 bbl day 148 m3 day the treatment trains for the two counties selected by the idst are summarized in table 6 iron iii and total hardness were required to be removed by chemical softening and precipitation in both counties to prevent scaling and fouling because of the low tds in flowback water in tioga county beneficial reuse for hydraulic fracturing using gel and slickwater systems did not require desalination which significantly reduced the costs only chemical disinfection was required to inactivate microorganisms brackish water reverse osmosis bwro was selected to desalinate flowback water in tioga county for irrigation for flowback water in washington county mvc was selected for the higher tds water the estimated treatment costs for flowback water are summarized in table 7 the unit costs for reusing flowback water in tioga county were much lower than those for washington county because of better flowback water quality in tioga county without desalination processes required reuse of flowback water for hydraulic fracturing using gel and slickwater systems in tioga county had the lowest costs 5 2 barnett shale the case study for the barnett shale adopted similar approach as for the marcellus shale the water quality and quantity data were collected analyzed and projected for the future 15 years the idst was utilized to select the optimal treatment trains based on user preference and estimate screening level treatment costs for various reuse scenarios the costs were then compared with disposal costs through deep injection wells and recommendations were made for operators in the barnett shale based on the site specific conditions the flowback and produced water quality in barnett shale is summarized in table 8 5 2 1 flowback water reuse scenario in this case study the average flow rate of the treatment facility was designed to be 1300 bbl day 54 600 gal day 207 m3 day assuming flowback water wellhead treatment for the barnett shale all beneficial uses require the removal of suspended solids and hardness using chemical softening and coagulation to reuse the flowback water for hydraulic fracturing using gel system although tds removal is not required mvc was selected by the idst to remove chloride that exceeded the required limits mvc was also selected for irrigation to reduce tds concentration table 9 as the salinity of barnett shale flowback water is lower than the requirement of slickwater hydraulic fracturing liquid only disinfection was needed to eliminate microorganisms slickwater hydraulic fracturing is the most favorable beneficial use option with the lowest costs and energy consumption table 10 there are approximately 144 000 class ii wells in the united states of which 20 is swd wells 21 in texas approximately 12 000 swd wells are currently available for flowback and produced water disposal at a cost of 0 5 2 5 bbl 3 15 15 75 m3 21 based on supply and demand the disposal cost was assumed to be 0 5 bbl 3 15 m3 in the barnett shale for this case study 21 an average trucking cost of 0 75 bbl 4 7 m3 was estimated the overall cost to dispose flowback and produced water through swds was estimated to be 1 25 bbl 7 9 m3 0 0298 gal which is close to the cost to reuse the barnett shale flowback water for slickwater hydraulic fracturing compared with the flowback water scenarios in pennsylvania the cost of reuse is much lower in the barnett shale as well as disposal costs moreover the barnett shale has a higher density of producing wells and therefore it is easier for the operators to develop clustered or centralized treatment to increase the flow rate and reduce the economic scale of costs 5 2 2 produced water reuse scenario two producers in the barnett shale were chosen to represent the most and least wells with the high and low flow rate scenarios of 8 554 bbl day 0 36 mgd 1363 m3 day and 2 bbl day 84 gal day 0 32 m3 day respectively all reuses require chemical coagulation and media filtration no desalination is required to reuse the produced water for hydraulic fracturing using gel system mvc was selected to reduce tds level to reuse produced water for hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system and for irrigation table 11 the product water needs to be blended with filtered produced water to use for irrigation and hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system to achieve desired water quality and to reduce overall costs the low flow rate scenario led to a very high unit cost to reuse produced water at 8 8 gal 2 325 m3 for all reuse options table 12 the unit costs for the high flow rate scenario were estimated to be 0 005 gal 1 32 m3 for gel system hydraulic fracturing to 0 012 gal 3 17 m3 for slickwater fracturing and irrigation reusing produced water for hydraulic fracturing using gel system is the more economic option with low cost and energy consumption because no desalination is required to break even with the cost for disposal through injection wells it requires at least 1550 bbl day 246 m3 day 0 065 mgd treatment capacity for reusing produced water for gel hydraulic fracturing using the same assumption as in the marcellus shale it requires to treat produced water collected from at least 517 1275 wells for gel hydraulic fracturing to break even with the costs for disposal under the current production conditions in the barnett shale reusing produced water is not economically competitive as compared to disposal through injection wells because of the requirements for large number of wells cooperation between producers and collection and treatment systems 6 conclusion unconventional o g development increased rapidly during the past decade which leads to an increasing demand on fresh water for hydraulic fracturing and better management of wastewater treating flowback and produced water for beneficial reuse has become an attractive option however reusing flowback and produced water is challenging because of poor water quality complexity in selecting treatment technologies and highly variable wastewater quality and quantity the idst provides a comprehensive decision support framework integrated with multiple criteria functions objectives and constraints to optimize the selection of treatment technologies for beneficial use of hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water the case studies in the marcellus shale and barnett shale demonstrated that flow rate and water quality are the two primary factors affecting the costs and feasibility of treating and beneficial use of these wastewaters higher flow rate leads to higher total capital cost and annual o m cost yr because of higher plant capacity and more labor requirement but lower unit costs gal or m3 costs for well head treatment are much higher than centralized treatment options meanwhile better water quality reduces the need of treatment processes thus reducing costs reusing for hydraulic fracturing requires the least treatment processes especially avoiding desalination technologies thus resulting in lower treatment cost for example reusing flowback water in tioga county for crosslink gel system fracturing requires minimal treatment which leads to 7 kgal total unit cost compared with 28 9 kgal for reusing produced water in tioga county that requires treatment with bwro in addition onsite reuse for hydraulic fracturing is highly favorable because of reduced water transportation costs the case studies demonstrate that the idst is a useful screening tool to select treatment trains and estimate screening level costs for reuse scenarios from current practice of hydraulic fracturing to potential uses such as irrigation due to the limited number of injection wells and high disposal cost beneficial use of fracturing flowback and produced water is very attractive in the marcellus shale clustered treatment systems are recommended considering the economic scale of treatment costs reusing flowback water in the barnett shale would be the most cost efficient for hydraulic fracturing reusing produced water in the barnett shale is currently not economically favorable because of the low disposal cost through swd wells however the rapid development of unconventional o g industry would result in more intensive water demand which further leads to a higher potential of flowback and produced water beneficial reuse acknowledgments the authors thank

14529,development of unconventional gas resources is currently one of the most rapidly growing trends in the oil and natural gas industry exploration of shale gas requires significant quantities of water for hydraulic fracturing meanwhile large volumes of produced water are generated during gas production treatment and beneficial use of hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water provides opportunities for sustainable unconventional gas operations while minimizing impacts to environment local water resources and public health considering the broad variety of treatment technologies and the wide spectrum of flowback and produced water qualities selecting appropriate treatment and management options involves a complex decision making process that requires understanding of treatment technologies water quality reuse requirements and consideration of multiple criteria constraints and objectives this study presents an integrated decision support tool idst to assist in selection of treatment technologies and evaluation of the feasibility of potential water reuse options the marcellus shale in pennsylvania and the barnett shale in texas were selected as case studies to demonstrate produced water treatment technologies and beneficial reuse options considering realistic site specific conditions assumptions and future projections such as well numbers and locations

have allowed unconventional oil and gas o g production from deep and less permeable shale formations these breakthroughs have brought changes and challenges to water resources and environmental management which are of particular concerns to producers engineers regulators and the public hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water represent the largest waste stream generated during o g exploration and production annual flowback and produced water production in the united states was estimated to be 3 2 billion m3 20 6 billion barrels in 2012 1 more than 93 of produced water from onshore wells is injected underground for disposal and reservoir pressure maintenance 1 however there are increasing concerns that deep well injection may be responsible for increasing rates of seismic activity 2 potential comingling with freshwater aquifers as well as negative impacts on the quality of adjacent surface waters and microbial communities in downstream sediments 3 4 the volume of unconventional o g wastewater requiring disposal has continued to grow despite the recent slowing in drilling and production 5 meanwhile substantial amounts of freshwater are used by the petroleum industry for well drilling and hydraulic fracturing 6 if produced water is managed as a water resource instead of a waste product the water generated could supplement regional water demand while minimizing the volume of produced water for disposal thus reducing o g production costs and environmental implications sustainable development of o g production requires thorough understanding of produced water quality selecting appropriate treatment technologies for beneficial uses and establishing environmentally sound management strategies considering the broad range of treatment processes and the recent technological advances it is essential to have a clear guidance and tools to assist in evaluation and selection of treatment technologies to meet site specific reuse needs besides treatment capacity and removal efficiency of contaminants other factors affecting the selection of treatment technologies including technology industrial status commercially available or under development adaptability feasibility energy consumption capital operational and maintenance costs footprint space requirement skilled labor requirement infrastructure requirement brine disposal as well as user preferences should be considered in the selection process therefore selecting treatment and management options involves a complex decision making process that requires the consideration of multiple criteria constraints and objectives a decision support tool dst that can assist in selection of treatment technologies and evaluation of the feasibility of potential water uses is in great need a number of dsts have been developed based on multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods 7 8 linear nonlinear and dynamic programming tools have been applied to optimize treatment selections from a large range of alternatives using boundary constraints 9 12 however very few of the tools have been applied to real produced water treatment and management because they are either too simple to provide detailed analysis and essential outputs or too complicated for general users to understand and operate a user friendly dst should provide simple yet efficient interactions between a user and the dst editable input choices and easily understandable outputs an integrated dst idst was previously developed for treatment and beneficial use of coalbed methane cbm produced water 13 14 it includes a comprehensive water quality database for several major cbm basins in the united states this computerized produced water management tool assists users in assessing treatment options costs and environmental and institutional issues associated with treatment and beneficial use of cbm produced water the idst framework provides a quick analysis and screening of various produced water treatment and management options in this study the idst was upgraded with more functions and user choices and further developed and enhanced beyond the cbm to shale gas and other unconventional water resources 15 the primary objective of this publication is to demonstrate the application of the idst for selecting the treatment technologies and evaluating the beneficial use feasibility of hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water the marcellus shale in pennsylvania and the barnett shale in texas were selected as case studies to determine produced water treatment technologies and beneficial use options considering realistic site specific conditions assumptions and future projections such as well numbers and locations water demands flowback and produced water quality and quantity availability of disposal sites and costs the idst has built in beneficial use options including hydraulic fracturing using gel and slickwater systems potable reuse crop irrigation surface water discharge and user defined beneficial use water quality requirements for each of the beneficial use options the tool also compares the costs of treatment and beneficial uses of produced water scenarios to the existing produced water disposal costs as such the tool can be used to perform a quick screening and break even point for treatment relative to disposal under site specific conditions a detailed description of the idst methodology is in the part i of the idst series papers 15 2 logistics and modules of the idst the idst consists of four basic modules water quality module wqm treatment selection module tsm beneficial use screening module bsm and beneficial use economic module bem fig 1 the wqm is built upon a composite geochemical database previously developed for cbm produced water 13 14 it was created with 3255 entries covering major cbm basins in the rocky mountain region including the powder river basin in montana and wyoming the raton basin in colorado and new mexico and the san juan basin in colorado and new mexico the wqm contained comprehensive information on 58 parameters and constituents including field measurements e g ph temperature conductivity and dissolved oxygen metals non metals organics and radionuclides 13 in this study the wqm was expanded with additional 2791 entries for water quality data of flowback and produced water from the major o g producing basins in the united states including the barnett shale play in texas the lansing kansas city formation in texas the marcellus shale in pennsylvania and west virginia the morrow shale in anadarko basin oklahoma the organic rich shale in pennsylvania new york and ohio the permian basins in texas and new mexico the tuscarora play tight gas in pennsylvania and the woodford shale in oklahoma the water quality data were collected from collaborative producers the united states geological survey 5 national produced waters geochemical database v2 3 provisional the marcellus shale coalition shale gas produced water database the new mexico water and infrastructure data system and the new mexico oil conservation division 16 19 the idst also allows users to enter their water quality data and fit into the wqm datasheet the quality assurance and quality control for the wqm is described in the supplementary content file the tsm is designed to select proper treatment technologies based on feed water quality user preferences and desired product water quality the tsm includes 62 processes as stand alone pretreatment desalination and post treatment as well as integrated and commercial treatment packages each technology is assigned removal efficiency for each contaminant corresponding to different total dissolved solids tds bins bin 1 tds 8000 mg l bin 2 8000 25 000 mg l bin 3 25 000 40 000 mg l bin 4 40 000 70 000 mg l and bin 5 tds 70 000 mg l the bin classification is based on the removal capacities of different water desalination technologies such as 25 000 mg l for brackish water ro bwro 40 000 mg l for seawater ro swro 70 000 mg l for thermal technologies desalination cost of feed water in the higher bins could be significantly higher than in the lower tds bins in addition to tds bins the selection of technologies considers the treatment limits of other contaminants such as organic matter suspended solids and toxicity of certain constituents the user inputs criteria such as water quality water quantity desired water recovery and other site specific operational objectives to assist in the selection of appropriate treatment processes the user can also include or exclude certain treatment processes such as including or excluding seawater ro in the selected treatment train using these inputs along with a robust selection methodology the tool generates potential treatment trains capable of treating flowback and produced water to a quality suitable for each pre programmed or user defined beneficial use the tsm preferentially selects the minimum number of processes in a logical order required to treat a given feed water stream for beneficial use requirements the tsm generates a report detailing three suggested treatment trains with estimated product water quality and quantity energy requirements brine quality and quantity and a proposed brine management strategy for each beneficial use option in addition to onsite uses for hydraulic fracturing and drilling produced water can be used for agricultural irrigation in stream flow augmentation firefighting dust control cooling water for thermal power plants and other user defined beneficial use options the bsm stores eleven beneficial use options each of them is assigned appropriate product water quality requirements that the selected treatment train needs to achieve the user can also enter specific water quality parameters of interest the bem calculates costs based on the selected treatment technologies desired product water flow rate and economic inputs assigned by user and outputs unit cost and annual cost for capital cost operation and maintenance o m cost and energy consumption capital and o m costs presented in the bem were developed based on specific design criteria defined through the tsm general project criteria based on professional experience and unit costs for power chemicals and labor this cost estimate was developed to compare the treatment processes at screening level 3 case study setup to evaluate the beneficial use potential of flowback and produced water case studies were conducted using the idst for the marcellus shale and the barnett shale the quantity of flowback and produced water generated during shale gas exploration and production was estimated based on historical data and production trends water treatment technologies were selected to meet the water quality requirements of beneficial uses the beneficial reuse potentials were assessed and optimized by ranking user defined criteria such as technical viability adoptability energy and chemical demand labor skill requirement and screening level estimated costs for treatment reuse and disposal 3 1 study field the marcellus shale the marcellus shale is the largest natural gas producing play in the united states and is rapidly growing in recent years especially in pennsylvania new wells drilled in pennsylvania have been rapidly increasing since 2007 when breakthrough on hydraulic fracturing techniques occurred 20 flowback and produced water reuse increased remarkably from 15 to 20 in 2009 to approximately 90 in 2013 mainly for new well drilling 20 beneficial use of the reclaimed water makes up to approximately 10 of the water needed for hydraulic fracturing job for a new well flowback and produced water requires proper treatment before reuse or disposal in the marcellus shale reuse for hydraulic fracturing needs oil gas water separation filtration and dilution dilution of the wastewater is aimed to decrease contaminant concentrations such as tds total suspended solids tss total hardness and chloride to an acceptable level for hydraulic fracturing and is the most common method for reuse of flowback and produced water disposal well injection is also used in the marcellus shale with annual volume of approximately 2 5 million barrels bbl 0 4 million m3 the number of deep injection wells salt water disposal wells swd is limited in pennsylvania only eight swd wells were permitted to dispose shale gas flowback and produced water fig 2 these swd wells are class ii wells regulated by the united states environmental protection agency usepa underground injection control program under the safe drinking water act tioga county and washington county in pennsylvania were selected for this specific case study because of their locations and number of shale gas producing wells both counties have high density of shale gas wells and available water quality data tioga county is far from the disposal wells while washington county is close to the injection wells and the state of ohio where more disposal wells are available hauling cost was estimated to range from 4 bbl to 8 bbl 25 m3 50 m3 in pennsylvania while injection cost was estimated to be 0 50 bbl 2 50 bbl 3 1 m3 15 7 m3 21 pipeline cost was calculated assuming an average 10 mile distance from a wellhead to treatment facilities or impoundments 3 2 study field the barnett shale during its development the barnett shale became a leading shale gas production field in the united states in 2008 when horizontal drilling techniques were first adopted and refined 22 23 disposal well injection is the most common choice for barnett shale producers because of its economics and availability as compared to the marcellus shale in pennsylvania lower hauling and injection costs were reported in the barnett shale because of the large number of injection wells and shorter distance to disposal sites hauling cost is estimated to be 1 0 bbl hr 6 3 m3 hr while disposal cost is 0 5 1 0 bbl 3 1 6 3 m3 some producers are reusing a small amount of wastewater and many have started considering beneficial use options the railroad commission of texas recognizes concerns over water use by the o g industry and encourages recycling projects to reduce the amount of fresh water used in exploration and production 24 4 data collection and analysis 4 1 projection of flowback and produced water quantity 4 1 1 flowback water quantity in the marcellus and barnett shales the marcellus flowback water quantity was calculated based on the portion of injected hydraulic fracturing liquid that returns to the surface and forms flowback water the annual water demand and flowback water generation in the marcellus shale are summarized in table s2 supplementary content an average of 6 7 of injected water could be recovered as flowback water 25 26 in this case study an average of 6 5 was taken as the flowback water recovery rate the flowback water quantity was estimated based on the projected water demand corresponding to historic high and low gas production in the marcellus shale figure s1 in supplementary material the calculated flowback water quantity for the year 2010 was 1 78 million m3 470 million gallons while the quantity reported by industry was 1 84 million m3 485 million gallon in 2010 27 this 3 1 difference is considered acceptable for flowback water projection indicating that the projection data would be reasonable to calculate future flowback water production used in this case study flowback water quantity in the barnett shale was reported to be 500 000 600 000 gallons per well within 10 days after hydraulic fracturing 28 in this case study the average flowback flow rate was assumed to be 55 000 gallons per well per day for 10 days 4 1 2 produced water quantity in the marcellus and barnett shales because there is lack of produced water quantity data over a well lifetime for the marcellus and barnett shales the produced water quantity projection was based on a study of flowback and produced water volume in the denver basin wattenberg colorado 29 a harmonic function provided good fit to the observed data and is expressed as 1 q t q i 1 d i t where qt is produced water flow rate at time t qi is the initial water production rate and di is the initial decay rate 29 after applying the water quantity data from the marcellus shale coalition database average values of qi and di were estimated and the equation of produced water production as a function of well time for the marcellus shale is described as 2 q t 15 5 1 2 718 t produced water quantity of a shale gas well for the first year was assumed to be 12 1 bbl day based on industry reported values 29 compared with the marcellus shale the barnett shale is a high long term produced water generating play 29 the barnett shale wells generate 5 times more produced water than the marcellus wells 28 fig 3 based on eq 1 produced water flow rate for a barnett shale well as a function of well time is estimated as 3 q t 15 5 1 0 4 t 4 2 flowback and produced water quality database in the case study the quality of flowback and produced water was assumed to be stable over the lifetime of a well although flowback water quality changes significantly within the first few weeks after fracturing 30 31 its overall quality was considered stable because of its smaller volume and mixing during storage in a pond before treatment or disposal the flowback and produced water quality data for the marcellus shale were retrieved from the usgs national produced waters geochemical database v2 3 provisional and the marcellus shale coalition shale gas produced water quality database 16 of the 161 915 produced water quality data sets in the usgs database 2723 sets are for shale gas produced water distributed in oklahoma pennsylvania new york ohio and texas a statistical analysis was conducted for the produced water quality data retrieved from the usgs database the maximum minimum average 25th 50th and 75th percentile values for each parameter and constituent were calculated by state and shale formation and were included in the idst for users to choose total number of tds data points reported in this database was 979 after quality assurance and quality control qa qc with the highest tds concentration of 345 000 mg l and the lowest concentration of 390 mg l the tds distribution in produced water by state and formation is illustrated in figure s2 in supplementary content the measured tds concentration of shale gas produced water reported data averages 84 870 mg l the marcellus shale coalition produced water database included the fracturing flowback and produced water quality data of 19 wells in the marcellus shale these data were collected and reported in figure s3 and s4 in the supplementary content 18 water quality data at day 1 5 14 and 90 were collected following the hydraulic fracturing job a total of 65 tds values were reported in the database as flowback and produced water and 19 values were reported as influent water stream water used for hydraulic fracturing the tds of flowback water increased overtime and reached produced water tds level in 14 90 days fig 4 compared to the marcellus shale the flowback and produced water quality data for the barnett shale were very limited and not included in the usgs database 16 the data were mainly retrieved from a study conducted by hayes and severin in the barnett and appalachian shale water management and reuse technologies 32 this study reported the barnett shale flowback water quality data from five wells on days 1 3 5 6 7 10 and 12 the average tds concentration of flowback water was 37 800 mg l the produced water quality data for the barnett shale were obtained from multiple sources 28 33 the average tds concentration of flowback water was 67 285 mg l 4 3 beneficial use options according to the united states census of agriculture data of pennsylvania farms both tioga county and washington county have more than 1000 farms which makes agricultural irrigation water use significant 34 thus beneficial use for irrigation was included in this case study reuse options included hydraulic fracturing using gel and slickwater systems and crop irrigation potable use of produced water was not considered in this study due to high salinity economic consideration potential liability concerns and potential human health impacts the water quality requirements for beneficial uses in pennsylvania are summarized in table 1 where class b is for edible crop irrigation and class c for non edible crop irrigation 35 the tds requirement for irrigation varies depending on the types of crops and soil this study used 1500 mg l tds as irrigation requirement surface discharge requires water quality no worse than the class a requirement with tds less than 500 mg l other contaminants that are required by the primary and secondary drinking water standards set by the usepa are also required in the class a water quality standard which is regulated for potable water use potable water aquifer recharge and other residential uses 35 these water quality requirements are only used for the case study purpose for real applications long term impacts to plant health and soil conditions need to be monitored and further studied other components in produced water that rarely exist in domestic wastewater such as naturally occurring radionuclides materials petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals also need to be well evaluated for human and soil health reusing flowback and produced water for hydraulic fracturing is becoming a common practice in the o g industry hydraulic fracturing is conducted with one of two fluid systems slickwater or crosslink gel methods for slickwater fracturing the fracturing liquid is pumped down the well bore at very high flow rate with the addition of friction reducer and proppant such as sand for crosslink gel method gels are introduced into the fracturing liquid to increase its viscosity thus increase the stability of proppant suspension compared to slickwater system crosslink gel system can be used for fracturing of deeper formation and it creates wider fractures yet it requires more experienced operators the quality of the water is important for hydraulic fracturing because impurities can reduce the efficiency of the additives used in the process however there is lack of common standards to determine the quality requirement of the water for fracturing it is highly dependent upon the formation the fracturing methods and chemicals added in the process for example a recent review showed the metal crosslinked guar fluids prepared with produced water were successfully used in wells at bottomhole temperatures up to about 121 c with produced water tds up to 300 000 mg l and hardness up to 44 000 mg l 36 compared to conventional gelled fracturing fluids the performance of slickwater fluids is generally less sensitive to mix water quality however high salinity mix water will cause a loss in achievable friction reduction in this study it was assumed that slickwater system requires water with tds lower than 40 000 mg l while crosslink gel system does not have strict tds requirement but have specific requirements on certain ions as listed in table 2 these water quality requirements are examples for the case studies and within the range of fracturing fluids mix water requirements users can enter their specific water quality requirement in the idst 4 4 case study assumptions user score input which indicates the importance of each parameter was set to default values for this case study as shown in fig 5 a with no preference in specific treatment technologies user preference input was not changed indicating that no specific treatment technology was included or excluded as shown in fig 5b economic assumption of the case study utilizes values pre stored in the idst as shown in fig 6 5 case study results 5 1 marcellus shale 5 1 1 produced water quality in tioga and washington counties the tds concentration of produced water in tioga county ranges from 746 mg l to 358 000 mg l with an average of 88 500 mg l much higher than most beneficial use water quality requirements average tss concentration is 468 mg l alkalinity 114 mg l as caco3 total hardness sum of ca2 and mg2 768 mg l as caco3 and ph 7 4 table a2 in supplementary content the average concentrations of tds and major ions of produced water in washington county are higher than in tioga county fig 7 it should be noted that the concentrations used in the study were the average values from the usgs produced water quality database the tss concentration unlike other parameters is three times lower than that of the produced water in tioga county this produced water quality difference would lead to a higher treatment cost for beneficial use of produced water in washington county due to higher concentrations of sodium chloride and hardness 5 1 2 selected produced water treatment technologies for the tioga county produced water no desalination is required for hydraulic fracturing using gel system as it does not have a limit on tds concentration the treatment trains selected by the idst are summarized in table 3 treatment is required to remove suspended solids sparingly soluble salts and inactivate microorganisms hydraulic fracturing using slickwater method requires removal of suspended solids sparingly soluble salts and tds by desalination because of its 40 000 mg l tds limit and other ion concentration requirements reuse for hydraulic fracturing requires disinfection because bacteria present in the fracturing fluid will sour the well producing organic acids and increasing operational expenses as a result of the corrosion e g h2s pitting stress cracking in both surface equipment and subsurface pipes mechanical vapor compression mvc distillation was selected by the idst as the desalination technique for the produced water with feed salinity of 88 500 mg l for washington county produced water the selected treatment processes for the three reuse options are the same starting with chemical softening and precipitation followed by media filtration to remove particulate matters including suspended petroleum hydrocarbons although salinity level is not required for hydraulic fracturing using gel system mvc was adopted to reduce chloride concentration to lower than 40 000 mg l the product water is required to blend with filtered produced water to meet water quality requirements mvc was also selected for hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system and for irrigation to reduce salinity level to the required concentration the mvc product water is blended with filtered produced water to meet the water quality requirement for different beneficial use purposes 5 1 3 screening level estimated project costs for produced water treatment 5 1 3 1 tioga county produced water according to the pennsylvania state impact project there were 640 active shale gas wells in tioga county owned by 9 operators 37 the produced water production in tioga county was projected for the next 15 years based on eq 2 and the number of existing wells in the county in this case study shale gas wells were grouped by operators that is produced water from all the wells operated by the same operator would be collected treated by clustered treatment facilities and reused produced water quantity for each operator was assumed to be proportional to the number of wells they own two companies that own the most wells 386 and the least well one in tioga county were chosen to represent two extreme production conditions company a represents the scenario of clustered produced water treatment collected from 386 wells with a high flow rate of 0 394 million gal day mgd 9373 bbl day 1490 m3 day while company b with only one well represents wellhead treatment with a flow rate of 320 gal day 7 7 bbl day 1 2 m3 day the capital cost of a wellhead treatment train would be much lower than that of clustered treatment due to small size of the facilities however the unit cost in terms of dollars per gallon would be much higher for wellhead treatment because of elevated capital investment and labor costs normalized by gallon of treated water the economic scale of costs of the wellhead treatment is extremely low due to small flow rate the treatment costs and energy demand for the treatment trains selected by the idst are summarized in table 4 among the three beneficial use scenarios hydraulic fracturing using gel system had the lowest capital and o m costs because of its low product water quality requirement especially no tds limit hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system was ranked the second it had higher electrical energy demand and the desalinated water would be blended with filtered water to meet the water quality requirement for all the case studies the lifetime of treatment facilities was assumed to be 10 years capital and o m costs for the three beneficial use options did not differ considerably at low flow rate scenario wellhead treatment because of smaller facility size and less labor requirement total annualized costs of wellhead treatment options in tioga county ranged from 256 800 year to 259 200 year however at high flow rate scenario the differences became significant the annual o m costs of reusing produced water for slickwater fracking and irrigation were approximately 2 times higher than those for gel system capital costs were approximately 4 9 million for gel system 8 3 million for slickwater system and 8 3 million for irrigation use for wellhead treatment for low flow rate annual unit o m costs were approximately 1 9 gal 502 m3 while total annual unit costs were approximately 2 2 gal 581 m3 therefore wellhead water treatment was deemed to be cost inhibitive due to small capacity versus the economic scale of costs at the high flow rate gel system had the lowest o m and total costs 0 003 and 0 007 gal respectively while the costs for hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system and irrigation were estimated to be 0 005 and 0 011 gal respectively 5 1 3 2 washington county produced water by 2014 there were 1094 shale gas wells in the washington county owned by 10 operators 37 the companies operating 748 wells and 1 well were chosen to simulate high and low produced water quantity scenarios at 0 889 mgd 21 174 bbl day 3 36 million m3 day and 350 gal day 8 38 bbl day 1 3 m3 day respectively produced water flow rate over time for washington county had similar trend as tioga county high flow rate scenario in washington county had higher flow rate than in tioga county which led to lower unit costs operators with the least wells in both counties had 1 well which makes their flow rates similar thus almost same costs table 4 as the same treatment processes were selected to the three beneficial reuse options the idst estimated the same capital cost and o m cost for different beneficial use scenarios 2 03 gal 536 m3 for low flow rate of 350 gal day 1 3 m3 day and 0 01 gal 2 64 m3 for high flow rate of 0 889 mgd 3 36 million m3 day because the costs calculated in the idst were at a screening level the cost estimate was not sensitive enough to reflect the amounts of chemicals used such as lime and soda to achieve different product water qualities however the idst allows users to enter chemical uses for more accurate cost estimate the difference of costs between low flow scenario and high flow scenario was significant low flow scenario required much lower capital cost and annual energy consumption but had a much higher unit cost table 4 5 1 4 cost comparison of beneficial uses deep well injection and transportation deep well injection is the most commonly used disposal method for shale gas produced water because of its low cost in pennsylvania the number of injection wells is very limited because of the geological condition of the formation among the five active injection wells that accept wastewater from the o g industry the nearest one is over 120 miles from tioga county which makes transportation cost significantly high an average 8 bbl 0 19 gal 50 3 m3 hauling cost of produced water was estimated for tioga county 21 injection cost generally ranges from 0 5 bbl to 2 5 bbl 0 0119 0 0595 gal 3 15 15 7 m3 considering the supply and demand relationship in pennsylvania 2 bbl 0 0476 gal 12 6 m3 of injection cost was assumed for tioga county resulting in an overall disposal cost including deep well injection and transportation of 10 bbl 0 238 gal 62 9 m3 it was estimated that a produced water flow rate of 170 bbl day 27 m3 day would be required to breakeven disposal cost with treatment cost for gel system assuming a produced water flow rate of 2 3 bbl day per well reuse of produced water for a group of 60 100 wells would be more cost efficient than disposal considering all operators in tioga county 3 out of 8 operators own more than 60 wells while all others own less than 30 wells centralizing and treating produced water from multiple operators would be recommended to small operators to minimize treatment costs the nearest injection well that accepts o g wastewater from washington county is approximately 50 miles away in pennsylvania injection wells in ohio were not included in this case study because of limited information an estimated hauling cost of 4 bbl 0 0952 gal 25 2 m3 was adopted while 2 bbl 0 0476 gal 12 6 m3 injection cost was added to the total cost of 6 bbl 0 143 gal 37 8 m3 for disposal using deep injection wells which is 40 less than that in tioga county using the breakeven approach to balance with the disposal cost produced water from at least 100 165 wells needs to be collected and treated at a clustered facility in washington county only two operators own more than 100 wells and can make beneficial use cost efficiently by themselves other operators are recommended to collectively treat produced water and develop clustered treatment systems to decrease the costs it should be noted that the cost for purchasing fresh water for hydraulic fracturing was not included in the cost analysis taking into account the fresh water costs would further offset the costs for reusing flowback and produced water 5 1 5 flowback water in marcellus shale pennsylvania hydraulic fracturing flowback water quality and quantity were retrieved from the marcellus shale coalition produced water database 18 among the 19 wells in the database the well j is located in tioga county and the wells b and f are located in washington county the water quality for days 1 5 14 and 15 was chosen to represent flowback water the weighted average of water quality based on daily flow rate was calculated in the idst table 5 the flowback water flow rate for tioga county was taken as the average value of the 19 wells 878 bbl day 140 m3 day for washington county the average flow rate for wells b and f was assumed to be 930 bbl day 148 m3 day the treatment trains for the two counties selected by the idst are summarized in table 6 iron iii and total hardness were required to be removed by chemical softening and precipitation in both counties to prevent scaling and fouling because of the low tds in flowback water in tioga county beneficial reuse for hydraulic fracturing using gel and slickwater systems did not require desalination which significantly reduced the costs only chemical disinfection was required to inactivate microorganisms brackish water reverse osmosis bwro was selected to desalinate flowback water in tioga county for irrigation for flowback water in washington county mvc was selected for the higher tds water the estimated treatment costs for flowback water are summarized in table 7 the unit costs for reusing flowback water in tioga county were much lower than those for washington county because of better flowback water quality in tioga county without desalination processes required reuse of flowback water for hydraulic fracturing using gel and slickwater systems in tioga county had the lowest costs 5 2 barnett shale the case study for the barnett shale adopted similar approach as for the marcellus shale the water quality and quantity data were collected analyzed and projected for the future 15 years the idst was utilized to select the optimal treatment trains based on user preference and estimate screening level treatment costs for various reuse scenarios the costs were then compared with disposal costs through deep injection wells and recommendations were made for operators in the barnett shale based on the site specific conditions the flowback and produced water quality in barnett shale is summarized in table 8 5 2 1 flowback water reuse scenario in this case study the average flow rate of the treatment facility was designed to be 1300 bbl day 54 600 gal day 207 m3 day assuming flowback water wellhead treatment for the barnett shale all beneficial uses require the removal of suspended solids and hardness using chemical softening and coagulation to reuse the flowback water for hydraulic fracturing using gel system although tds removal is not required mvc was selected by the idst to remove chloride that exceeded the required limits mvc was also selected for irrigation to reduce tds concentration table 9 as the salinity of barnett shale flowback water is lower than the requirement of slickwater hydraulic fracturing liquid only disinfection was needed to eliminate microorganisms slickwater hydraulic fracturing is the most favorable beneficial use option with the lowest costs and energy consumption table 10 there are approximately 144 000 class ii wells in the united states of which 20 is swd wells 21 in texas approximately 12 000 swd wells are currently available for flowback and produced water disposal at a cost of 0 5 2 5 bbl 3 15 15 75 m3 21 based on supply and demand the disposal cost was assumed to be 0 5 bbl 3 15 m3 in the barnett shale for this case study 21 an average trucking cost of 0 75 bbl 4 7 m3 was estimated the overall cost to dispose flowback and produced water through swds was estimated to be 1 25 bbl 7 9 m3 0 0298 gal which is close to the cost to reuse the barnett shale flowback water for slickwater hydraulic fracturing compared with the flowback water scenarios in pennsylvania the cost of reuse is much lower in the barnett shale as well as disposal costs moreover the barnett shale has a higher density of producing wells and therefore it is easier for the operators to develop clustered or centralized treatment to increase the flow rate and reduce the economic scale of costs 5 2 2 produced water reuse scenario two producers in the barnett shale were chosen to represent the most and least wells with the high and low flow rate scenarios of 8 554 bbl day 0 36 mgd 1363 m3 day and 2 bbl day 84 gal day 0 32 m3 day respectively all reuses require chemical coagulation and media filtration no desalination is required to reuse the produced water for hydraulic fracturing using gel system mvc was selected to reduce tds level to reuse produced water for hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system and for irrigation table 11 the product water needs to be blended with filtered produced water to use for irrigation and hydraulic fracturing using slickwater system to achieve desired water quality and to reduce overall costs the low flow rate scenario led to a very high unit cost to reuse produced water at 8 8 gal 2 325 m3 for all reuse options table 12 the unit costs for the high flow rate scenario were estimated to be 0 005 gal 1 32 m3 for gel system hydraulic fracturing to 0 012 gal 3 17 m3 for slickwater fracturing and irrigation reusing produced water for hydraulic fracturing using gel system is the more economic option with low cost and energy consumption because no desalination is required to break even with the cost for disposal through injection wells it requires at least 1550 bbl day 246 m3 day 0 065 mgd treatment capacity for reusing produced water for gel hydraulic fracturing using the same assumption as in the marcellus shale it requires to treat produced water collected from at least 517 1275 wells for gel hydraulic fracturing to break even with the costs for disposal under the current production conditions in the barnett shale reusing produced water is not economically competitive as compared to disposal through injection wells because of the requirements for large number of wells cooperation between producers and collection and treatment systems 6 conclusion unconventional o g development increased rapidly during the past decade which leads to an increasing demand on fresh water for hydraulic fracturing and better management of wastewater treating flowback and produced water for beneficial reuse has become an attractive option however reusing flowback and produced water is challenging because of poor water quality complexity in selecting treatment technologies and highly variable wastewater quality and quantity the idst provides a comprehensive decision support framework integrated with multiple criteria functions objectives and constraints to optimize the selection of treatment technologies for beneficial use of hydraulic fracturing flowback and produced water the case studies in the marcellus shale and barnett shale demonstrated that flow rate and water quality are the two primary factors affecting the costs and feasibility of treating and beneficial use of these wastewaters higher flow rate leads to higher total capital cost and annual o m cost yr because of higher plant capacity and more labor requirement but lower unit costs gal or m3 costs for well head treatment are much higher than centralized treatment options meanwhile better water quality reduces the need of treatment processes thus reducing costs reusing for hydraulic fracturing requires the least treatment processes especially avoiding desalination technologies thus resulting in lower treatment cost for example reusing flowback water in tioga county for crosslink gel system fracturing requires minimal treatment which leads to 7 kgal total unit cost compared with 28 9 kgal for reusing produced water in tioga county that requires treatment with bwro in addition onsite reuse for hydraulic fracturing is highly favorable because of reduced water transportation costs the case studies demonstrate that the idst is a useful screening tool to select treatment trains and estimate screening level costs for reuse scenarios from current practice of hydraulic fracturing to potential uses such as irrigation due to the limited number of injection wells and high disposal cost beneficial use of fracturing flowback and produced water is very attractive in the marcellus shale clustered treatment systems are recommended considering the economic scale of treatment costs reusing flowback water in the barnett shale would be the most cost efficient for hydraulic fracturing reusing produced water in the barnett shale is currently not economically favorable because of the low disposal cost through swd wells however the rapid development of unconventional o g industry would result in more intensive water demand which further leads to a higher potential of flowback and produced water beneficial reuse acknowledgments the authors thank
