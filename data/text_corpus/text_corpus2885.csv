membrane was mixed with mbr effluent and the obtained mixture was used as a feed stream for nf membrane test system qualities of product waters obtained from different feed mixtures were investigated and compared with the standards of cooling and boiling feed water for industrial usage in addition the reuse of product water as process water in paper and textile industries was also discussed 2 materials and methods field tests were carried out at itob organized industrial zone wastewater treatment plant in tekeli menderes izmir where mbr treatment process is used for wastewater reclamation for experiments a mini pilot scale membrane test unit having nf membranes in spiral wound configuration was used the mbr treated wastewater discharged from the treatment plant was re treated by using a single nf90 membrane in spiral wound configuration at 10 bar of operating pressure the feed tank was filled with the mixture of mbr treated wastewater and nf90 concentrate with the ratios of 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 respectively the flow diagram of the process was given in fig 1 the mbr treated wastewater was first passed through the cartridge filters and sand filter then it was pumped to the feed tank 500 l after filling the feed tank with mbr treated wastewater the nf system was started to run the amount of feed water used by the system was calculated by the summation of permeate and concentrate fluxes feed flow rate was approximately 290 l h at 10 bar of operating pressure taking into consideration this feed flow rate mbr effluent and nf90 concentrate stream were mixed at the ratios of 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 respectively the obtained mixture was used as a feed water during the concentrate management tests recycled amounts of mbr effluent and nf90 concentrate in the feed tank with the mixing ratios of 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 were shown in table 1 during the experimental studies a continuous mode of operation was followed permeate samples were collected from the permeate tank and the excess amount of concentrate stream was sent to the mbr pool the tests were carried out for 3 h feed permeate and concentrate samples were taken every half an hour for analysis conductivity tds and salinity values of samples were measured by using a conductometer hach hq40d silica ammonium n nitrite n nitrate n phosphate p chloride sulphate and cod values were determined with a colorimeter hach lange dr3900 and ready prepared chemicals were used for those analyses the measuring ranges of these kits used were shown in table 2 some parameters such as cod and phosphate need heating for this purpose a thermo reactor hach lange lt 200 was used sodium magnesium calcium and potassium ions concentrations were determined by using aa 7000 model shimadzu atomic absorption spectrophotometer toc measurement was made with toc vcph model toc device carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations were determined with acid base titration method and turbidity was measured by micro tpi field portable turbidimeter permeate fluxes of the each studies were calculated by measuring the permeate volume which is collected over a certain period as l m2 h using eq 1 1 j p f p a jp permeate flux l m2 h fp permeate flowrate l h a effective membrane area m2 the percent removal of various parameters was calculated using eq 2 2 r x 100 1 x p x f r x percentage rejection xp x properties in permeate xf x properties in feed 3 result and discussion in table 3 feed mixture characteristics were shown for each study with minimum and maximum values the maximum values were obtained at the end of the study at 180 min while the minimum values at the beginning of the study these values also represent the mbr effluent characteristics because only mbr effluent was present in the tank at the beginning of the study as seen in table 3 mbr effluent characteristics were not constant during the experiments industrial wastewater which was collected from different industries was treated by using mbr process the volumes of wastewater discharged from various industries were not the same during the day in industrial zone thus the inlet water of the mbr treatment process did not have the same characteristics permeate flux is one of the important parameters of membrane separation process for design and economical feasibility analysis of the system so the change in the permeate flux was observed the performance nf90 membrane were depicted in fig 2 in terms of permeate flux for different feed mixtures explained in table 1 according to the test results average permeate fluxes of nf90 membrane at 10 bar of operating pressure were found as 52 5 49 1 48 3 and 48 4 l m2h for the feed mixtures of 1 2 3 and 4 explained in table 1 respectively during the studies permeate fluxes slightly decreased by increasing the amount of concentrate in the feed mixture the decrease permeate flux can be prevented in two different ways 1 reduction of the membrane fouling 2 reduction of the osmotic pressure on the membrane surface 12 fouling is mostly related to the problems of particle blocking concentration polarization and fouling on the membrane surface due to feed stream composition which has significant concentration of foulants 13 antiscalant dosage is important to eliminate the fouling 12 increasing operating pressure is also important to reduce the permeate flux decline 12 increasing the feed concentration by a gradual increase in operating pressure can solve the flux decline problem during the studies permeate quality was investigated by measuring various physicochemical parameters such as tds salinity conductivity ph turbidity cod tss color na ca2 k mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl po4 p nh4 n no3 n no2 n tn caco3 hardness toc and sio2 concentrations permeates of 1 2 3 and 4 were obtained from feed mixtures of 1 2 3 and 4 see table 1 respectively quality of permeates and removal rates of nf90 membrane for each parameter was listed in table 4 with average values while nf90 membrane showed similar and good removal efficiency for many parameters such as conductivity salinity tds na k mg2 ions color and total hardness for all feed mixtures it showed less removal performance for some parameters such as tss no3 n po4 p no2 n and tn this behavior of membrane could be explained by charge effect and sieving effect with membrane pore size which played important role in retention of parameters the charge effect is due to electrostatic interactions between the ion and the membrane the electrostatic repulsion affects the rejection of ionic species at neutral ph nf90 membrane are negatively charged 14 15 repulsion interactions between anionic species and charged membranes contribute to the rejection the low no3 n rejection by nf90 membrane can be attributed to the small ionic radius of the nitrate ion 0 189 nm 16 therefore the size effect governs no3 ion transfer across the membrane the rejections for no2 n and tn were also governed by the same phenomena as for no3 ion described the nf membranes are effective in rejection of tss and po4 p which is larger than monovalent ions but the tss and po4 p concentrations of the feed solution were low thus the rejections became low cod sio2 and toc ions removal increased with an increasing amount of concentrate in the feed mixture during membrane operation the membrane will retain solid molecules on its surface and the solid will accumulate at the membrane surface reduction of feed concentration may lead to a higher foulant concentration close to the membrane surface which would cause a more dense gel cake layer and increase filtration resistance 17 on the other hand nh4 n and ca2 ions removals slightly decreased with the increase in the amount of concentrate stream in the feed mixture with an increase in feed water concentration the concentration difference across the membrane also increased so the concentration gradient was formed in the fluid adjacent to the membrane surface that is called concentration polarization 18 membrane performance is seriously affected by concentration polarization 2 next the quality of obtained permeates from different feed mixtures were compared with the standards of cooling and boiling feed water for the industrial usage summary of water quality guidelines for cooling water and boiler water was given in table 5 with these water quality guidelines it was aimed to prevent or minimize corrosion scaling or fouling boiler water quality requirements are more stringent than cooling water due to the relatively higher temperature and pressure conditions needed for steam production 3 according to comparison with guidelines permeates 1 2 and 3 satisfied all parameters for using them as cooling water only there is a little difference between the required bicarbonate value and bicarbonate concentration for permeate 4 additional treatment which could be ph control or use of antiscalants may be necessary for permeate 4 to control scale formation problem 19 boiler water quality requirements were also listed in table 5 the ranges for certain parameters depend on the operating pressure of boiler water higher temperature and pressure conditions require higher quality feed water in addition to reuse as a cooling water permeates obtained in this study could be also used as a boiler feed water another comparison was made between permeates and pulp paper industry feed water characteristics the results were shown in table 6 the pulp and paper industry is one of the considerable users of water in turkey 4 nearly at every step of the pulp and paper manufacturing processes which are pulp production pulp processing pulp bleaching and stock preparation large amount of water is used 19 on the other hand water quality requirements for pulp and paper production change according to the grade of paper to be produced generally lower quality water can be used for the brown grade papers and higher water qualitys are needed for the production of white grade papers 20 according to obtained results permeates obtained from different feed mixtures are suitable for all brown and white grades paper production processes water quality requirements for typical textile industry were summarized in table 7 the basic steps of a typical textile industry consist of yarn formation fabric formation wet processing and fabrication units the major water quality issues for textile production are the fact that the dyes react properly and discoloration does not occur hardness adversely affects cleaning and dyeing processes because hard water prevents the proper solution of soap and dye which causes stains and discoloring turbidity color iron and manganese concentration have the potential to cause staining of fabric during production 21 according to our results permeates obtained from different feed mixtures by using nf90 membrane satisfied all parameters required for typical textile feed water usage 4 conclusions the reuse of wastewater that would otherwise be discharged into the environment can save the water sources and environment in our study to reduce the amount of concentrate stream discharged from nf process certain amounts of concentrate stream of nf membrane was mixed with mbr effluent the obtained mixtures were used as a feed stream for nf membrane with this application concentrate discharge was reduced with the ratio of 35 5 53 5 69 3 and 88 2 for the feed mixtures of 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the average permeate fluxes were found as 52 5 49 1 48 3 and 48 4 l m2h for permeates 1 2 3 and 4 respectively when the concentrate amount increases in feed mixture permeate flux slightly decreased the reason of flux decline could be due to membrane fouling fouling problem on membrane surface appeared when the concentration of feed mixtures increased increasing concentration of feed stream also affected the nh4 n and ca2 rejections their removal rates slightly decreased because of the concentration polarization it could be implied that the nf90 membrane showed similar and good removal efficiency for many parameters for all feed mixtures in addition reuseability of permeate streams in industrial zone was also discussed and for this purpose water usage in different industries in turkey was investigated the data given by turkey statistical association show that the first three sectors that use the most water in turkey are metal pulp and paper and textile industry large quantity of water 785 766 m3 year was used in metal industry and 90 3 of this amount was used for the purpose of cooling and boiling in addition usage of water as a process water had a big portion 84 and 69 respectively within yearly comsumed water amount in the pulp and paper and textile industry 4 in selecting water reuse applications one of the factors that affects the selection of applications is water quality for this the quality of the obtained permeates were compared with cooling and boiler water quality requirements water quality especially tss and cl concentrations are important parameters because of potential scaling or corrosion in piping systems and heat exchangers residual organic matter may also contribute to biological growths in heat exchangers and cooling towers 19 end of the comparison it was seen that the permeates obtained from different feed mixtures could be reused in industry for the purposes of cooling and boiler water the obtained permeates were also checked for using as a feed water in pulp and paper industry and textile industry in the pulp and paper industry there are many different kinds of mills products and processes therefore the required water quality vary significantly depending on the process 3 phosphates surfactants and metal ions may affect the efficiency of resins in the stock preparation process iron manganese and microbial contamination can cause discoloring the suspended solids can also affect the brightness of the paper and the color of reclaimed water may be an issue for production of higher grade paper 19 wet processing which involves fabric preparation dyeing and or printing is one of the most important part of the textile industry so water quality is carefully screened during the these processes hardness adversely affects soaps used in cleaning processes and can cause deposits on the textile usually soaps are not deposited evenly with hard water resulting in dyeing irregularities hardness may also cause precipitation of some dyes and increase the breakage of silk turbidity color iron and manganese concentration can cause the staining of fabric 19 it can be also concluded that the permeates obtained from different feed mixtures by using nf90 membrane agreed well the requirements of feed water in pulp and paper industry and

14426,in this study some field tests were conducted at itob organized industrial zone wastewater treatment plant where membrane bioreactor mbr process has been used for wastewater treatment the mbr treatment process provides stable and high quality product water but product water still contains high salinity in this case therefore a mini pilot scale membrane test system having three different nanofiltration nf which are nf90 nf270 and tr60 and two different reverse osmosis ro membranes which are bw30 and ag with spiral wound configurations was employed for demineralization of mbr effluent the system was operated with 10 bar of operating pressure for nf membranes and at 20 bar for ro membranes the average water recoveries of nf membranes were 50 2 56 0 and 51 8 for nf90 nf270 and tr60 membranes respectively while average water recoveries of ro membranes were 64 0 for bw30 membrane and 62 3 for ag membrane the qualities of product waters were analyzed and compared with standards to reuse them for agricultural irrigation and as process water the permeates of nf270 and tr60 membranes agreed well with the third class water quality for salinity and the second class quality for the rest of parameters on the other hand the permeates of nf90 bw30 and ag membranes provided with the first class water for all parameters except for infiltration mixing the permeates of nf and ro membranes with mbr effluent in appropriate ratios was considered to be helpful to get acceptable quality values for product water and a good permeability for agricultural irrigation therefore an optimum theoretical mixture of mbr effluent to permeates was determined when qualities of product water obtained by nf and ro membranes were compared with the standards of cooling and boiling feedwaters for industrial usage and with the process water characteristics for pulp and paper textile industries it was considered that the permeates of nf90 bw30 and ag membranes obeyed well the quality standards required keywords nanofiltration nf membrane bioreactor mbr reverse osmosis ro wastewater reclamation and reuse industrial wastewater 1 introduction continuous population growth and industrialization are causing increased water demand and contamination one way to increase water resources in water scarce regions is using reclaimed and desalinated water therefore the treated wastewater effluents have been reused as an alternative water source recently 1 water shortage is not a problem only for human and industrial activities it also affects the sustainable food production properly treated wastewaters which do not have the same requirements as that of drinking water can be used for irrigation 2 the use of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation is the most common application around the world globally about 20 million hectares of agricultural land is irrigated with polluted water 3 in many semi arid regions water recycling provides a major portion of the irrigation water however water reuse programs are still faced with a number of technical economic social regulatory and institutional challenges 4 5 the treated wastewater should have some

toxicity permeability salinity and microbiological parameters have to be compared with suitable standards 2 the main criteria for assessing the quality of water irrigation are salinity sodicity

potential of soil water and an increase in osmotic pressure of the soil solution increases the amount of energy which plants must expend to take up water from the soil 7 in addition to total salinity the tendency of irrigation water to generate excessive levels of exchangeable sodium which adversely affect the soil physicochemical properties needs to be considered the most reliable index of the sodium hazard of irrigation water is the sodium adsorption ration so called sar 6 according to the data by general directorate of state hydraulic works dsi turkey a 44 million m3 of water from underground and surface sources was consumed in turkey in 2012 when the utilization of water source for different purposes was investigated it was seen that a 73 of the total water was consumed for

wastewater in the industrial zone since 2008 the flat sheet mbr membranes kubota have a nominal pore size of 0 4 μm the characteristics of mbr treated wastewater were given in table 1 during the experiments mbr effluents was treated by using a mini pilot scale membrane test unit having different nf and ro membranes in spiral wound configurations the flow diagram of the system was given in fig

nf and ro membranes by the help a of high pressure pump as nf membranes nf90 nf270 and tr60 membranes were employed while ag and bw30 membranes as ro membranes the properties of the membranes were summarized in table 2 18 a mini pilot scale nf ro system was employed at 10 bar of operating pressure for nf membranes and at 20 bar for ro membranes the duration of each membrane test was 6 h during the studies a batch mode of operation was used both permeate and concentrate streams indicated as p and c respectively in the flow diagram were recirculated back to the feed reservoir to remain feed

water however decreasing the salinity of product water is needed in some cases if the product water will be recovered and reused as irrigation water and process water obviously water quality refers to the characteristics of a water supply that will influence its suitability for a specific use in this study advanced membrane treatment processes such as nf and ro were employed for demineralization of the mbr effluent the nf membranes usually provide with a good retention of small organic molecules and inorganic salts especially if multivalent ions are involved 19 the nf method is much the same as ro method and the only difference is the degree of removal of monovalent ions such as sodium and chloride with both processes the ro membranes remove monovalent ions with a 98 99 of rejection while removals with the nf membranes vary in a range 50 90 of rejection depending on the material and manufacture of the membrane the nf membranes have the ability to reject uncharged dissolved materials and charged ions according the size and shape of the molecule they usually provide with a good rejection of small organic molecules and inorganic salts especially multivalent ions 12 in this study the mini pilot scale experiments were conducted at itob organized industrial zone menderes izmir this is the mixed organized industry zone where a wastewater treatment plant based on mbr process was first installed in turkey the wastewater coming to the treatment plant is a mixture of wastewaters that have both municipal and industrial origins the applicability of nf and ro processes of mini pilot scale was investigated to reuse mbr treated wastewater as irrigation water and process water the characteristics of mbr effluent were listed in table 1 a mini pilot scale membrane test system containing three different nf nf90 nf270 and tr60 and two different ro membranes bw30 and ag with spiral wound configurations was employed for advanced treatment of mbr effluent the basic properties of nf ro membranes were summarized in table 2 the average permeate fluxes of nf and ro membranes vs time plots were shown in fig 2 the average permeate fluxes of nf90 nf270 and tr60 nf membranes were measured as 50 4 64 0 and 54 6 l m2h respectively at 10 bar of operating pressure due to its larger pore size nf270 membrane gave a maximum permeate flux the average water recoveries of nf membranes were 50 2 56 0 and 51 8 for nf90 nf270 and tr60 membranes respectively the bw30 and ag membranes exhibited similar permeate fluxes at the same operating pressure of 20 bar permeate fluxes of these two membranes slightly increased in the first three hours of studies for the last three hours of studies permeate fluxes reached the steady state it was considered that the pores of virgin membranes were enlarged by the applied pressure during the first 3 h the average permeate fluxes of bw30 and ag ro membranes were found as 65 9 and 62 7 l m2h respectively the average water recoveries of ro membranes were 64 0 for bw30 and 62 3 for ag membrane among the nf membranes nf90 membrane showed the best removal efficiencies for conductivity salinity and total dissolved solid tds the bw30 and ag membranes had similar removal performances in terms of conductivity salinity and tds especially for salinity rejection ro membranes were more efficient than nf membranes according to ion rejections nf90 membrane exhibited the highest performance among nf membranes while both ro membranes bw30 and ag showed good removal performances for almost all parameters measured the nf membranes exhibited a better removal for divalent ions than monovalent ions the quality of product waters obtained by all membranes were listed in table 3 by measuring average values of each parameters as reported in the published literatüre 20 21 the difference in performance of the membranes observed during this work can be due to the diversities in the properties such as pore size surface charge hydrophobic or hydrophilic characteristics and the structure or composition of the active layer for the membranes employed the qualities of product water obtained by nf and ro membranes were compared to the water qualities required for boiler feedwater and cooling water applications which are given in table 4 the permeate of nf90 was suitable as cooling water according to all parameters except for ph value in addition to this nf90 permeate could be also used as boiler feedwater after ph adjusment the permeates of nf270 and tr60 membranes did not satisfy cooling water requirements because of the high tds magnesium and calcium values they are also not suitable for steam generation and do not to meet many parameters of boiler feedwater requirements the ro permeates of bw30 and ag membranes can be used as cooling water according to all parameters except for ph value in addition to this the ro permeates could be employed as boiler feed water after ph adjustment in addition the operating pressure should be also taken into consideration because boiler feedwater requirements are different according to operating pressure the permeate qualities of nf and ro membranes were also compared with the feed water characteristics requested by pulp and paper and textile industry the feed water characteristics of those industries were also listed in table 4 the permeate of nf90 membrane was suitable for the production of paper of brown and white grades the product water of nf270 was not suitable as process water of pulp and paper industry because of its high tds and chloride concentration also the permeate of tr60 membrane was not suitable for reuse in the pulp and paper industry because of its high tds chloride and hardness values on the other hand bw30 and ag membranes provided with the product water which is suitable for production of brown and white grades paper the quality of nf90 permeate was suitable as process water for textile industry on the other hand the quality of nf270 permeate does not meet the requirements for textile industry because of its high values of color tds and total hardness the product water of tr60 membrane is also not suitable to be used as process water of textile industry since tss tds and hardness values were higher than standards the permeates obtained from bw30 and ag membranes satisfied all requirements of feed water for typical textile industry our previous study confirmed also the results related with usage of nf90 permeates as a process water in different industries 22 the water quality data collected in this study were also compared with national irrigation water standards 23 as shown in table 5 since high or changing salinity presents a challenge for bio treatment processes mbr treatment system may not be enough if the treated wastewater is considered to be reused again however both nf and ro processes can remove salinity and various species in water bunani et al studied treatment of mbr effluent by three different nf ck nf270 and nf90 membranes and two ro ak bwro and ad swro membranes using a laboratory scale cross flow and flat sheet membrane test system the product water reusability in agricultural irrigation was also assessed it was concluded that product water quality by nf90 was suitable for irrigation 24 later on sert et al used nf90 and bw30 membranes in a mini pilot scale for preliminary field tests using mbr treated wastewater 25 both results fit well with water quality required for agricultural irrigation comparison of nf and ro permates with national irrigation water standards was summarized in table 6 salinity is referred to electrical conductivity and water infiltration problem is referred to sar sodium adsorption ratio with the respect to electrical conductivity ecw other toxicity effects or miscellaneous water constituents were evaluated based on ion contents such as sodium and chloride 26 27 the permeates of nf270 and tr60 membranes agreed well with the third class water quality for salinity and second class water quality for other parameters on the other hand the permeates of nf90 bw30 and ag membranes obeyed well with the first class water quality for all parameters except for infiltration infiltration problem was caused by unbalanced removal of na ca2 and mg2 ions affecting sar values bearing this in mind mixing ro and nf permeates with mbr effluent in appropriate ranges may have suitable composition values and good permeability for agricultural irrigation therefore the theoretical values of sar and ecw for different mixtures were calculated and summarized in table 7 the plots of sar versus ecw for each nf and ro membranes were shown in figs 3 and 4 the area of class i represents that the irrigation water will have no or insignificant harmful effects on soil infiltration while class iii represents a serious decrease in infiltration explaining that this water may not be used for irrigation purposes irrigation water in class ii can be used in irrigation with some caution for the determination of optimum theoretical mixture to overcome the infiltration problem salinity and specific ion toxicity were also taken into consideration since mixing mbr effluent with nf ro permeates can cause an adverse effect for salinity and specific ion toxicity optimum mixing ratios should be determined for agricultural irrigation according to all these considerations optimum theoretical mixtures of mbr effluent and permeates of nf membranes were 0 2 0 8 for tr60 0 6 0 4 for nf270 and 0 3 0 7 for nf90 membranes for the case of ro membranes optimum theoretical mixture of mbr effluent and permeates was 0 4 0 6 for bw30 and ag membranes when the ratios of optimum theoretical mixtures were determined comparison of the water qualities of these mixtures with national irrigation standards was presented in table 8 4 conclusions the type of the membrane affected the water recovery and quality issues for reclamation of mbr treated wastewater and its reuse for irrigation and industrial purposes mixing mbr effluent with the permeates of nf and ro membranes could be a good strategy to increase the volume of water reclaimed and to eliminate infiltration problem in agricultural irrigation the field tests to put this strategy into practice are still going on and will be reported elsewhere acknowledgements this study was supported

14426,in this study some field tests were conducted at itob organized industrial zone wastewater treatment plant where membrane bioreactor mbr process has been used for wastewater treatment the mbr treatment process provides stable and high quality product water but product water still contains high salinity in this case therefore a mini pilot scale membrane test system having three different nanofiltration nf which are nf90 nf270 and tr60 and two different reverse osmosis ro membranes which are bw30 and ag with spiral wound configurations was employed for demineralization of mbr effluent the system was operated with 10 bar of operating pressure for nf membranes and at 20 bar for ro membranes the average water recoveries of nf membranes were 50 2 56 0 and 51 8 for nf90 nf270 and tr60 membranes respectively while average water recoveries of ro membranes were 64 0 for bw30 membrane and 62 3 for ag membrane the qualities of product waters were analyzed and compared with standards to reuse them for agricultural irrigation and as process water the permeates of nf270 and tr60 membranes agreed well with the third class water quality for salinity and the second class quality for the rest of parameters on the other hand the permeates of nf90 bw30 and ag membranes provided with the first class water for all parameters except for infiltration mixing the permeates of nf and ro membranes with mbr effluent in appropriate ratios was considered to be helpful to get acceptable quality values for product water and a good permeability for agricultural irrigation therefore an optimum theoretical mixture of mbr effluent to permeates was determined when qualities of product water obtained by nf and ro membranes were compared with the standards of cooling and boiling feedwaters for industrial usage and with the process water characteristics for pulp and paper textile industries it was considered that the permeates of nf90 bw30 and ag membranes obeyed well the

14427,membrane bioreactor mbr effluents of industrial wastewaters generally include high amounts of salinity nitrate and hardness although mbr process can be applied for the production of low and or medium quality water nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro processes are needed for removal of excess salinity from mbr effluent since the fouling is a unique problem for membrane systems pre

water and process water production has become more important for the foreseeable future 1 3 drinking water and process water for an industrialized society are indispensable needs and more required than agricultural irrigation water hence in a case of draught first water cut offs will be applied for irrigation waters this situation makes water reuse for irrigation more important 4 drinking and process water requirements are harder to achieve than irrigation water requirements thus the potential of water reuse for irrigation purposes is more possible 5 the ro process is already applied in different countries such as israel spain and jordan for the purpose of water reuse in irrigation 6 8 membrane fouling is a bottleneck for membrane systems flow rates of membrane systems are badly affected by this problem and capacity of the membranes are reduced in addition membrane life time can be shorten and permeate quality can be deteriorated by time all of these lead to frequent maintenance operations further cleaning work large amount of cleaning agents higher operation costs and waste of time these conditions are very problematic for the small scale laboratory operations while it is not acceptable for the large scale industrial membrane applications 9 11 solution of membrane fouling depends on the feed water content it will also affect the fouling type some pre treatment operations physical cleaning techniques chemical cleaning agents membrane surface improvements can be used to get rid of fouling problem physical cleaning can be used for reversible fouling while chemical cleaning is preventing the occurrence of irreversible fouling however cost of the chemicals and formation of harmful products are disadvantages of the chemical cleaning 12 14 fouling due to the suspended solids can be easily manageable by pre treatment methods like coagulation and flocculation techniques while it is harder to get rid of colloidal fouling by using traditional methods using chemical agents are ideal for decreasing scaling on membrane surface due to salinity content of feed water combination of physical and chemical cleanings can be used for organic and biological foulings integrated membrane filtration methods are very effective for removal of solid particules salinity and organic matter 15 selecting a membrane pre treatment system prior to ro system rather than using conventional methods is generally more advantageous reason behind this is that high rejection of membrane systems leads to fouling preventation for ro membranes and hence an improved quality of ro feed stream causes increased permeate flux of ro system 16 industrial wastewaters are mostly treated by conventional activated sludge cas process or mbr systems mbr integrates membrane filtration with bioreactor process therefore mbr works both as a biological treatment and a filtration system 17 chemically enhanced mbr process can be considered as pre treatment systems for water reuse purpose before the ro systems if there is an inorganic scaling problem 18 kent et al 19 compared the mbr pre treatment and conventional activated sludge process with tertiary membrane filtration cas tmf pre treatment prior to ro system the obtained results showed that biological accumulation on the ro membranes in the study with cas tmf pre treatment was higher seker et al 20 compared the effect of microfiltration mf pre treatment before forward osmosis fo system study showed that mf pre treatment decreased the initial flow rate while the flow rate after 4 h was same due to the high foulant content in feed water ultrafiltration uf membranes can also satisfy the pre treatment requirement considering the removal of turbidity bacteria and solid particles by uf 21 khanzada et al 22 made a study of integrated uf fo pre treatment for upstream of ro unit under different feed water qualities and water recoveries the results showed that the integrated system reached a 98 of salt removal comparison of uf powdered activated carbon pac combination of coagulation with uf proceses as pre treatment of ro showed that uf system is enough to remove turbidity and suspended solids for better ro performance while pac and coagulation systems have high yield of dissolved organic carbon removal 23 dionisio ruiz et al 24 stated that for the seawater desalination systems chlorine dosage combined with physicochemical processes or uf systems as pre treatment before ro systems can reduce the biological fouling however it can not be considered as the best solution colla et al 25 indicated that combination of ro system with uf pre treatment incrased the rejections of water reuse operations from wastewater of steel industry anticipation of an increase in the equipment service life based on the lower salinity content of treated water was underlined nf membranes have high capability of removing organic and inorganic substances as well as bacteria elimination nf systems have variety of applications in industrial processes al harahsheh et al 26 suggested to use nf membranes nf270 and nf90 instead of ro membrane bw30 due to their high fluxes and fractional recovery of h3po4 from industrial wastewater similarly a study for the seawater desalination process by kaya et al 27 showed that nf pre treatment increased the effluent quality of ro system a 98 of salt rejection was obtained with only ro system while the salt rejections were 99 3 and 99 4 with two different nf ro integrations nf treated waters have low level of bacteria content and slow bacterial growth 28 alzahrani et al 29 used the effluent water of petroleum refinery treatment plant as feed stream to nf pre treated ro system the quality analysis showed that about one hundred of the drinking water standards of world health organization who and u s environmental protection agency usepa were provided al rawajfeh 30 investigated the effect of nf pre treatment on multistage flash msf distillation system and results showed that nf pre treatment have a capability of lowering co2 release salinity content of treated wastewater is highly responsible for the inability to use it for several purposes like industrial process water or irrigation water a 98 of the attainable water can not be used before treatment just because of high salinity 31 this makes ro system come forefront of its proven salinity removal capability even the reuse of concentrate stream of ro system is gaining importance and several applications are carrying over 32 in addition to salinity and toxicity related parameters sodium and potassium hazard of water are two other important subjects regarding agricultural irrigation sodium hazard is generally associated with the parameter called sar sodium adsorption ratio sar factor can be used to understand effects of irrigation water on soil hydraulic properties and can be calculated by using eq 1 33 if sar to ec ratio is not suitable plant can not absorb minerals even if they exist in the soil 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 the addition of calcium and magnesium ions can be a pragmatic solution to decrease sodium hazard yet it has both economic consequences and increases salinity hazard 33 also united nations food and agricultural organization fao limits calcium and magnesium contents of irrigation water to 400 mg l and 61 mg l respectively 34 potassium adsorption ratio par is another parameter related with the quality of irrigation water similar to sar this parameter shows the negative effect of potassium in irrigation water on soil permeability property and it can be calculated by using eq 2 35 2 p a r k c a 2 m g 2 2 all concentration units in eqs 1 and 2 are meq l in our previous study 36 we have evaluated mbr treated wastewater for its reuse in agricultural irrigation in accordance with various international standards a quality analysis was performed for mbr permeate nf and ro permeates of mbr effluent and tap water in this paper a performance comparison has been carried out for ro permeate of mbr effluent with product water of integrated nf ro process employed for reclamation of mbr effluent at wastewater treatment plant of itob organized industrial zone 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental conditions mbr effluent of wastewater treatment plant of itob industrial organized zone itob osb located in menderes izmir turkey was used as feed water for experiments mbr effluent was collected in a tank of 5 m3 and fed to the uf pre treatment system uf permeate collected in another 5 m3 tank was fed to nf or ro membranes during experiments in order to observe the effect of membrane scaling on system performance of ro process better two batch experiments with ro system were performed one of them was based on nf pre treatment prior to ro while the other one was done by using only ro membranes feed of nf system was uf effluent in the first continuous experiment with nf system while feed of ro system was uf effluent and nf effluent in other two experiments with ro system during ro tests concentrate stream of the first two membranes were fed to the third membrane in order the decrease to concentrate discharge and have a water recovery at around 70 properties of feed waters are given in table 1 experiments were carried out in a pilot plant located in aforementioned wastewater treatment plant both experiments were conducted for 4 h and the applied pressure was 10 bar for nf system and 15 bar for ro system nf tests were performed in continuous mode while ro experiments were performed in batch mode permeate feed and concentrate samples were taken at each hour permeate and concentrate flow rates were measured in each 10 min the configuration of pilot scale nf ro process was given in fig 1 photos of pilot nf ro system were shown in fig 2 three tm720d 400 ro and three tm620 400 nf membranes were used in experiments their properties were summarized in table 2 2 2 performance calculations temperature and flow rates of the permeate streams were carefully noted to calculate normalized flux for counteracting the effect of temperature changes on permeate flux water recoveries and permeate fluxes were calculated by using eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 w a t e r r e c o v e r y j p j f 100 4 p e r m e a t e f l u x l m 2 h q p s m where jp is permeate flux jf is mbr effluent flux qp is the permeate flow rate sm is the active membrane area which is 37 m2 in case of tm720d 400 and tm620 400 membranes water recovery can be easily calculated by dividing permeate flow rate to the sum of permeate and concentrate flow rates all permeate fluxes are normalized at 25 c by using eq 5 39 5 n o r m a l i z e d p e r m e a t e f l u x a t 25 o c l m 2 h j p t o 1 03 t 25 where t is the sample permeate temperature 2 3 agricultural irrigation criteria table 3 states irrigation standards given by turkish ministry of environment and urbanization 40 on the evaluation of chemical quality of agricultural irrigation water table 4 includes the data given in table 3 and also some extra criteria stated by u n food and agriculture organization 41 u s environmental protection agency 42 and world health organization 43 the comparative evaluation of sar vs ec for the permeability of water was shown in fig 3 for simplification in fig 3 the area covered by class i represents that the irrigation water will have none or insignificant harmful effects on soil infiltration while class iii represents a serious drop in infiltration and shows that this water cannot be used for irrigation purposes irrigation water of class ii preferably close to class i can be used in irrigation with caution 3 results and discussion rejections and permeate flux did not change significantly during experimental period one of the main reasons for this situation is the short period of tests 4 h which may not be enough to observe the flux decline the other reason is the application of uf pre treatment prior to nf ro and ro tests table 5 shows the results of system performances related to average water recoveries and permeate fluxes for both integrated nf ro and only ro systems nf pre treatment works with 67 7 of water recovery and produces 150 7 l m2 h of permeate flux which is more than the feed processed by ro unit the total recovery is lower when nf pre treatment is applied to ro process which is 46 8 69 1 of the 67 7 of main feed solution these results show that although more percentage of water can be obtained by application of only ro process the obtained permeate quality is enhanced when nf pre treatment is applied hence the use of nf pre treatment is not only a decision of feed water characteristics but also a trade off between permeate flux and total water recovery depending on the priorities of any plant applying ro process either high permeate flux is sacrificed to obtain high water recovery or water recovery is decreased but more permeate is obtained per time properties of obtained permeates were summarized in table 6 and compared to irrigation standards the ro permeate although fits perfectly for most criteria falls into the 3rd class of water quality in soil permeability property hence it cannot be used for agricultural irrigation also its low ionic content indicates that it cannot give enough nutrients to the plant but since it cleans most of the toxicity from water mixtures including ro permeate and mbr effluent can be considered for irrigation since the composition of the mixture would vary depending on the feed composition and rejections of the used ro membrane it cannot be used at each case but different proportions of this mixture would again fit irrigation standards the nf membranes remove high amounts of calcium and magnesium ions from water but low amounts of sodium and potassium ions this results with high sar and par values according to sar and par equations eqs 1 and 2 and par value is over limitations its mixture with ro permeate cannot be used due to low calcium and magnesium concentrations in the mixture the wastewater treated obtained from the field studies were also evaluated for the reuse in several industrial applications table 7 shows the comparison of the water quality requirement for cooling and steam generation operations with the obtained water quality in studies as shown in table 7 the permeate quality of nf membrane satisfied all requirements of cooling water except tds and mg2 ion concentration tds parameter was problematic for low pressure steam generation and cod is at the boundry the permeate of ro membrane provided with the required quality almost for cooling water water quality was suitable for low pressure steam generation but ph is not in the 8 2 10 range for medium pressure in addition the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ions 3 9 mg l for ca2 and 0 7 mg l for mg2 were higher than the required values which are 0 4 mg l and 0 25 mg l respectively for medium pressure steam generation the ro permeate satisfied only tds parameter for high pressure steam generation and some parameters like cu zn and fe ions were uncertain for both high and medium pressure steam generation since the permissible concentrations of those elements were below the detection limits by aas the permeate quality of the ro membrane following nf pre treatment was better than the permeate of ro membrane without any pretreatment the ph and mg2 ion concentration are at the boundry for cooling water the low pressure steam generation standards were satisfied except ph which was very close to 7 0 10 0 range with a value of 6 9 in contrast just tds cod and fe parameters were suitable for medium pressure with values of 17 1 mg l 5 0 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively on the other hand the product water cannot be used for high pressure steam generation directly without polishing in most cases table 8 shows the comparison of water quality requirements for cooling and boiler feed water for the purpose of power generation considering nf permeate only tds parameter was above the cooling water constraints while tds cod nh4 n parameters 1286 mg l 5 0 mg l 0 2 mg l respectively were problematic for boiler feed water in addition high content of cl ion was remarkable despite of there is no any restriction for it the permeate quality of only ro study was enough to fulfill all requirements for cooling water the values of tds and hco3 ion concentration were lower than the preferred range while cod was at the upper boundary value instead the nf ro integrated study exhibited a similar behavior with only ro study for cooling water and it satisfied all requirements as expected the value of cod was at the upper boundary but ph tds hco3 and sio2 were lower than lower boundary values of boiler feed water standards 4 conclusion the main variable between the feed solutions used for two experiments was the feed salinity since one of the feeds was nf permeate and the other one was mbr permeate water recovery was tried to be kept constant during the studies average water recoveries for ro system were calculated as 68 6 and 69 0 for nf ro and only ro experiments respectively average normalized permeate flux of ro system was calculated as 96 9 l m2 h when nf process was used prior to ro process while it was 86 0 l m2 h for only ro application the permeate quality became significantly better when nf process used prior to ro process as we reported before 36 the ro permeate produced from mbr effluent was evaluated for agricultural irrigation purposes it is clearly seen that the ro permeate is not suitable to use in irrigation due to its low ionic content and severe harmful effect on soil infiltration even though its toxicity is low the ionic content of mbr effluent was high although it cannot cause harmful effect on soil infiltration its toxicity was high wastewater reclamation and reuse for process water purposes was also evaluated the nf permeate was suitable for some purposes like cooling water of power generation although its salt content is much higher than the ro permeate both single ro and integrated nf ro studies provided with the requirements for low pressure steam generation and cooling water of power generation additional polishing methods such as mixed bed ion exchange or electrodeionization edi could be considered to provide the water quality needed for producing high quality water for high pressure steam generation all in all application of nf pre treatment prior to ro process is favorable in cases where more amounts of clean water are needed and or higher permeate quality is required acknowledgements we acknowledge tubitak project no 114y500 for the financial support to the project and scholarships given to graduate

14427,membrane bioreactor mbr effluents of industrial wastewaters generally include high amounts of salinity nitrate and hardness although mbr process can be applied for the production of low and or medium quality water nanofiltration nf or reverse osmosis ro processes are needed for removal of excess salinity from mbr effluent since the fouling is a unique problem for membrane systems pre

different conductivities were fed to the ro system for this purpose in addition change in the permeate quality was monitored and permeate quality increase was noticed in the nf pre treatment study average normalized permeate fluxes of ro system were 32 3 l m2 h and 28 7 l m2 h for the study with nf pre treatment and with only ro study respectively treated wastewaters were also evaluated for the

14428,this paper proposes an alternative approach for estimating the global velocity gradient parameter g through hydrodynamic characteristics using computational fluid dynamics modeling cfd in the design of water and wastewater treatment plants several hydraulic and geometric parameters are needed to guarantee the efficiency of the treatment processes among these parameters g is estimated using empirical equations or prototypes the use of empirical equations is a simple and fast way to estimate g but they are often incompatible with the geometry of the unit leading to a high number of errors on the other hand the use of prototypes leads to higher accuracy but their construction is time consuming and can be very costly thus an in depth analysis of the basic equations for obtaining g and of cfd modeling aspects can assist in obtaining this parameter without using empirical equations or prototypes the proposed approach was tested in six flocculation units based on helical geometry called

which is the average amount of work done by a reactor calculating calculating the root mean square value rms value on the left side of eq 2 10 this average work is equal to the work dissipated as heat the rms velocity gradient commonly seen as the global velocity gradient g and sometimes erroneously known as the velocity gradient can be obtained by defining the rms value of a continuous function as

of the main criticisms of the g expression proposed in camp and stein 1 and camp 11 refers to the use of this single parameter to represent the entire reactor which can bring about a wide variation in gradient velocity values 12 13 as an example in baffled hydraulic units commonly used to promote flocculation a significant variability in the velocity gradient values along the sections of the unit are observed since in units such as this the flow undergoes successive and sudden changes of direction haarhoff and van der walt 14 demonstrated that in straight sections the agitation has a low intensity while in sections with changes of direction curves agitation is considerably high which may negatively influence the efficiency of the process naturally it is expected that g can represent the hydrodynamic behavior of the unit if the variability in velocity gradient values along the reactor is not high one example of this kind of unit is the helically coiled tube flocculator hctf described in the following section 2 1 g evaluation in helically coiled tube flocculators hctfs an innovative flocculation unit has been evaluated by several researchers due to among other factors the constancy in its hydrodynamic characteristics its low detention time and its high process efficiency this unit is formed by winding a flexible tube inside a rigid pipe giving a helical characteristic

flocculators hctfs and their functionality is still under evaluation by prototypes and reduced models 2 4 21 29 this unit uses hydraulic energy to disperse the coagulation flocculation reagents and promote collisions between particles to form flocs according to these authors the constancy of the hydrodynamic characteristics is due to the constant and smooth change of direction seen in helically coiled tubes the constancy in curvature κ and torsion τ values in the unit are dependent on the geometric parameters pipe diameter 2 a winding diameter 2 b and pitch c as shown in fig 1 mathematically described by eqs 6 and 7 respectively it is noteworthy that curvature and torsion are of great importance in flow analysis in hctfs as shown in several numerical and or experimental studies 30 34 6 κ

through eq 5 are obtained and b cfd modeling in which hydrodynamic parameters are obtained to estimate g by calculating the rms value of the right side of eq 2 as recommended by kramer and clark 8 and pedocchi and piedra cueva 9 instead of eq 1 finally different approaches used for the evaluation of g are presented for comparison purposes 3 1 reactors setups in this study three reactors were used with distinct geometric characteristics being a b c and l length of the unit as shown in table 1 once the geometry to be used was defined the flow rates were determined the first two reactors reactors a and b were tested with flow rates equal to 1 and 2 l min 1 1 67 10 5 and 3 33 10 5 m³ s 1 respectively the last reactor reactor c was tested with flow rates equal to 2 and 4 l min 1 3 33 10 5 and 6 67 10 5 m³ s 1 respectively totaling in six configurations these configurations were chosen based on oliveira and teixeira 4 and on the equipment available in the laboratory used due to their high efficiency and low length making their construction easier 3 2 prototyping aspects the experimental apparatus used in this research is shown in fig 2 it is composed of 1 a reservoir of water 2 a flow meter flow controller 3 a pressure gauge connected to the flocculator s input and output sections 4 the flocculator and 5 a drain for the final disposal of the used fluid initially the water in the reservoir is carried to the flocculator by passing through the flow meter to measure the flow rate after that the fluid flows through the flocculator where head loss is measured in all tests by a pressure gauge and empties out into the end drain the flocculator consists of a transparent and flexible pvc hose polyvinyl chloride hose coiled inside a rigid pvc pipe the hose that was used has a smooth internal surface with a synthetic yarn reinforcement with high tenacity to ensure that there are no changes in the cross section along the reactor the experimental uncertainty of the instruments used was 10 an uncertainty analysis was conducted for each measurement instrument of the experimental hydraulic apparatus in this paper the flow meters and the pressure gauge 3 3 cfd modeling aspects a three dimensional cfd model was developed using the computer aided engineering software cfx 13 0 for each hctf evaluated in this study this model is based on a a conservative element based finite volume method b an implicit pressure based algorithm and c a high resolution bounded scheme of advection modeling the governing equations are solved in a coupled way for mass momentum as seen in sartori oliveira 29 unstructured meshes were used to represent the computational domain with higher resolution areas as required the computational runs were performed in an intel core tm i7 3770 3 40 ghz with 16 gb of ram memory in all simulations the flow regime was considered as steady state isothermal and incompressible thereby the simplified mass and momentum conservation equations are presented in eqs 11 and 12 11 u i x i 0 12 ρ u j u i x j p x i μ x j u i x j u j x i ρ g i where u i j k the component of instantaneous velocity in the direction of x i j k p the instantaneous static pressure g i the component in the direction x i of the acceleration due to gravity all parameter values were set to zero in the flow domain except for the inlet section where the flow rate was specified as a uniform flow additionally the reference pressure value of 0 0 pa was defined at the center of the inlet section to obtain a unique solution to the governing system of the equations for each setup solid boundaries were treated as impermeable and a no slip condition was imposed in the nearest cell the cfd simulations were conducted using unstructured computational meshes which were formed by tetrahedral and prismatic elements the number of elements for each reactor is presented in table 2 the mesh test and the calibration validation step was performed as shown in 29 based on the experimental work of yu zheng 34 basic information about the modeling aspects are shown in table 3 to ensure that the predicted results were not significantly affected by the numerical discretization process a mesh refinement impact assessment was conducted reducing the computational demand and the simulation time five meshes were analyzed using a normalized mean square error nmse eq 13 the finest mesh was adopted as the reference mesh mesh 5 13 n m s e 1 i i 1 i a r e f i a i 2 a r e f i 2 where a i the parameter value taken at point i a r e f i the corresponding reference parameter value i the number of points involved in the comparison the nmse values were calculated for the axial velocity the nmse values were 10 7 9 6 1 5 and 1 4 for meshes 1 2 3 and 4 respectively based on these results mesh 3 was chosen for all tests 3 4 description of the approaches for g evaluation in this study five approaches for g evaluation were compared approaches 1 and 2 are based on empirical equations and they were proposed in previous studies by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 approaches 3 and 4 are proposed in this paper using data obtained by cfd modeling approach 5 is based on prototyping and it uses eq 5 proposed by camp 11 to estimate g the characteristics of the different approaches are presented in table 4 it is noteworthy that all methodologies proposed in this paper approaches 3 and 4 use discrete data to estimate g however in approach 3 the velocity gradient values were obtained from the entire reactor domain whereas in approach 4 the velocity gradient values were derived from a representative cross section located after the hydrodynamic entrance region as described in fig 3 the use of approach 4 is possible due to the constancy of hydrodynamic characteristics in hctfs after the hydrodynamic entrance region if torsion and curvature values are kept constant situation verified in hctfs of this paper mathematical proof of this behavior is presented in jinsuo and benzhao 35 where it is possible to verify the flow independence with respect to the axis coordinated relative to the center line inside the coil i e no cross section changes are verified along the domain after the hydrodynamic entrance region 4 results and discussion in this study the approaches described in table 4 were grouped into two classes the approaches in the first class use hydraulic and geometric parameters for g evaluation based on vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 s works approaches 1 and 2 the approaches contained in the second class use cfd modeling to obtain hydrodynamic parameters throughout the reactor s domain and in a representative cross section of the reactor located after the hydrodynamic entrance region approaches 3 and 4 in all cases g values obtained from each approach from 1 to 4 were compared with g values obtained from approach 5 approach 5 was used as a reference because it is based on prototyping leading to a higher accuracy the results are presented below 4 1 class a approaches 1 and 2 referring to the empirical models described in vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 g values obtained by prototyping approach 5 were compared with the g values obtained using empirical equations proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 approach 1 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 approach 2 the results are presented in table 5 from table 5 it is possible to note that approach 1 referring to the value of g obtained by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 s model presents a rmse and mapd equal to 92 8 s 1 and 38 0 respectively when it is compared with approach 5 and approach 2 referring to the value of g obtained by al hashimi and ashjyan 3 s model showed a rmse and mapd equal to 96 2 s 1 and 62 0 respectively when it is compared with approach 5 however one can raise questions about the direct comparison performed above since each method is very distinct in order to verify whether there is a correlation between g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained using empirical expressions proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 linear regressions were performed as shown in fig 4 from fig 4 a a high value of r ² determination coefficient equal to 0 9715 can be observed when g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained using empirical equations proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 approach 1 are correlated however there is relevant data dispersion around the regression line this result can be confirmed through the standard error value equal to 31 s 1 standard error is a measure of data dispersion in a regression and defines the confidence interval around the estimated value from a required confidence level considering the number of datapoints for example using a confidence level of 95 an estimated g of 325 s 1 will be between 260 s 1 and 390 s 1 when g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained using empirical equations proposed by al hashimi and ashjyan 3 approach 2 are correlated worse results were obtained fig 4 b presenting a value of r ² equal to 0 8786 and a standard error equal to 68 s 1 thus empirical equations proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 for g evaluation do not show satisfactory results in fact models proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 do not take into account the units curvature and torsion parameters which influence the flow characteristics 30 32 even with the simplicity inherent in the methods being a factor of significant importance in choosing an estimation method of a parameter of such magnitude in the flocculation process such as g deviations reaching over 60 and a wide dispersion of data around the regression line means these methods become unviable therefore these results indicate that the use of these methods for estimating g should be performed cautiously making the need for more appropriate methodologies for the evaluation of g in hctfs clearer 4 2 class b approaches 3 and 4 referring to the hydrodynamic parameters obtained by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor and in a representative cross section of the reactor located after the hydrodynamic entrance region g values obtained by prototyping approach 5 were compared with the g values obtained by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor approach 3 and in a representative cross section of the reactor located after the hydrodynamic entrance region approach 4 the results are presented in table 6 from table 6 it is possible to note that approach 3 referring to g obtained by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor presents a rmse and mapd equal to 27 3 s 1 and 9 6 respectively when it is compared with approach 5 and approach 4 referring to g obtained by cfd modeling in a representative cross section of the reactor showed a rmse and mapd equal to 27 5 s 1 and 19 1 respectively when it is compared with approach 5 also in these cases one can question the direct comparison performed above to verify whether there is a correlation between g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained by approaches 3 and 4 linear regressions were performed as shown in fig 5 from fig 5 a a very high value of r ² determination coefficient equal to 0 9995 can be observed when g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor approach 3 are correlated contrary to comparisons previously performed prototyping versus class a approaches there is a small dispersion of data around the regression line this result can be confirmed through the standard error value equal to 5 s 1 in this case with a confidence level of 95 the same estimated g of 325 s 1 will be between 315 s 1 and 336 s 1 when g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained by cfd modeling in a representative cross section of the reactor approach 4 are correlated fig 5 b the results that were obtained were worse when they are compared with results from the approach 3 performance test fig 5 a presenting an r ² equal to 0 9822 and a standard error equal to 30 s 1 however the performance results of approach 4 were better than the class a approach performance results indicating higher values of r² and lower values of standard error the r ² values of approach 1 and 4 can be considered similar however an increase in the r ² value when r ² is next to 1 requires a significant effort furthermore approach 1 cannot be used indiscriminately because it is based on only two variables tube diameter and mean velocity the winding diameter was considered in approach 1 and it is relevant in the velocity gradient values one reason for the satisfactory performance of approach 1 was the fact that in this paper the winding diameter and pitch were not modified therefore it is expected to have greater differences between approaches 1 and 4 in these cases finally previous results indicate that approach 3 represents a satisfactory value of g in the methodology section the experimental uncertainty was 10 for this reason this research recommends the use of approach 3 to evaluate g as the primary option however approach 3 may have a high computational cost for units with a large length as seen in 36 in this case this research recommends the use of approach 4 as an alternative method the main advantage of using a representative section of the unit for g evaluation is a non mandatory simulation of a complete geometry mainly in cases of flocculation units with hundreds of turns 36 with the use of only a cross section of the unit it is possible to obtain a considerable reduction in the computational cost required in g evaluation allowing multiple tests for different configurations to be carried out to optimize the geometric parameters according to the hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters of the unit the evaluation of various configurations is impractical for exceptionally large computational times which makes approach 4 a tool with an immense potential for g estimation in addition to this approach 4 can be used as an initial evaluation step after that approach 3 can be used in the final steps of analysis where a fine adjustment is required 5 conclusions the global velocity gradient g is an especially important parameter in the project of flocculation units since its value is typically used to measure the agitation level of the liquid mass inside the unit the evaluation of g is performed through prototyping making it costly empirical equations can be also used as a prompt way to evaluate g but they are frequently incompatible with the geometry of the unit leading to a high number of errors therefore this study sought alternatives to estimate g using cfd modeling testing them in six hctfs from these results it can be concluded that all approaches presented in this study to evaluate g using cfd modeling showed better results than the empirical models proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 indicating that cfd modeling can be a useful tool for evaluating g as a first option it is recommended that approach 3 is used which evaluates g by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor this approach presented results that were more adherent to the physical process with an rmse and mapd equal to 27 3 s 1 and 9 6 respectively when compared with approach 5 related to the prototyping approach however when there are restrictions on the availability of computational resources the use of approach 4 is recommended since it evaluates g by cfd modeling in a representative cross section of the reactor approach 4 can be used as an initial evaluation step due to its low computational cost further approach 3 with a higher computational cost can be used in the final steps of analysis where a fine adjustment is required approach 4 has a lower computational cost because it is possible to obtain a representative value of g through knowledge of the hydrodynamic characteristics of a unique unit cross section after the hydrodynamic entrance region allowing the simulation of shorter reactors however the average deviations encountered with such an approach were higher than those found with the use of the entire domain under study in which the use of such a method requires caution

14428,this paper proposes an alternative approach for estimating the global velocity gradient parameter g through hydrodynamic characteristics using computational fluid dynamics modeling cfd in the design of water and wastewater treatment plants several hydraulic and geometric parameters are needed to guarantee the efficiency of the treatment processes among these parameters g is estimated using empirical equations or prototypes the use of empirical equations is a simple and fast way to estimate g but they are often incompatible with the geometry of the unit leading to a high number of errors on the other hand the use of prototypes leads to higher accuracy but their construction is time consuming and can be very costly thus an in depth analysis of the basic equations for obtaining g and of cfd modeling aspects can assist in obtaining this parameter without using empirical equations or prototypes the proposed approach was tested in six flocculation units based on helical geometry called helically coiled tube flocculators hctfs as a result a high correlation between g obtained from prototypes used as reference and g obtained from the corresponding cfd modeling results was verified

momentum as seen in sartori oliveira 29 unstructured meshes were used to represent the computational domain with higher resolution areas as required the computational runs were performed in an intel core tm i7 3770 3 40 ghz with 16 gb of ram memory in all simulations the flow regime was considered as steady state isothermal and incompressible thereby the simplified mass and momentum conservation equations are presented in eqs 11 and 12 11 u i x i 0 12 ρ u j u i x j p x i μ x j u i x j u j x i ρ g i where u i j k the component of instantaneous velocity in the direction of x i j k p the instantaneous static pressure g i the component in the direction x i of the acceleration due to gravity all parameter values were set to zero in the flow domain except for the inlet section where the flow rate was specified as a uniform flow additionally the reference pressure value of 0 0 pa was defined at the center of the inlet section to obtain a unique solution to the governing system of the equations for each setup solid boundaries were treated as impermeable and a no slip condition was imposed in the nearest cell the cfd simulations were conducted using unstructured computational meshes which were formed by tetrahedral and prismatic elements the number of elements for each reactor is presented in table 2 the mesh test and the calibration validation step was performed as shown in 29 based on the experimental work of yu zheng 34 basic information about the modeling aspects are shown in table 3 to ensure that the predicted results were not significantly affected by the numerical discretization process a mesh refinement impact assessment was conducted reducing the computational demand and the simulation time five meshes were analyzed using a normalized mean square error nmse eq 13 the finest mesh was adopted as the reference mesh mesh 5 13 n m s e 1 i i 1 i a r e f i a i 2 a r e f i 2 where a i the parameter value taken at point i a r e f i the corresponding reference parameter value i the number of points involved in the comparison the nmse values were calculated for the axial velocity the nmse values were 10 7 9 6 1 5 and 1 4 for meshes 1 2 3 and 4 respectively based on these results mesh 3 was chosen for all tests 3 4 description of the approaches for g evaluation in this study five approaches for g evaluation were compared approaches 1 and 2 are based on empirical equations and they were proposed in previous studies by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 approaches 3 and 4 are proposed in this paper using data obtained by cfd modeling approach 5 is based on prototyping and it uses eq 5 proposed by camp 11 to estimate g the characteristics of the different approaches are presented in table 4 it is noteworthy that all methodologies proposed in this paper approaches 3 and 4 use discrete data to estimate g however in approach 3 the velocity gradient values were obtained from the entire reactor domain whereas in approach 4 the velocity gradient values were derived from a representative cross section located after the hydrodynamic entrance region as described in fig 3 the use of approach 4 is possible due to the constancy of hydrodynamic characteristics in hctfs after the hydrodynamic entrance region if torsion and curvature values are kept constant situation verified in hctfs of this paper mathematical proof of this behavior is presented in jinsuo and benzhao 35 where it is possible to verify the flow independence with respect to the axis coordinated relative to the center line inside the coil i e no cross section changes are verified along the domain after the hydrodynamic entrance region 4 results and discussion in this study the approaches described in table 4 were grouped into two classes the approaches in the first class use hydraulic and geometric parameters for g evaluation based on vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 s works approaches 1 and 2 the approaches contained in the second class use cfd modeling to obtain hydrodynamic parameters throughout the reactor s domain and in a representative cross section of the reactor located after the hydrodynamic entrance region approaches 3 and 4 in all cases g values obtained from each approach from 1 to 4 were compared with g values obtained from approach 5 approach 5 was used as a reference because it is based on prototyping leading to a higher accuracy the results are presented below 4 1 class a approaches 1 and 2 referring to the empirical models described in vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 g values obtained by prototyping approach 5 were compared with the g values obtained using empirical equations proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 approach 1 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 approach 2 the results are presented in table 5 from table 5 it is possible to note that approach 1 referring to the value of g obtained by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 s model presents a rmse and mapd equal to 92 8 s 1 and 38 0 respectively when it is compared with approach 5 and approach 2 referring to the value of g obtained by al hashimi and ashjyan 3 s model showed a rmse and mapd equal to 96 2 s 1 and 62 0 respectively when it is compared with approach 5 however one can raise questions about the direct comparison performed above since each method is very distinct in order to verify whether there is a correlation between g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained using empirical expressions proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 linear regressions were performed as shown in fig 4 from fig 4 a a high value of r ² determination coefficient equal to 0 9715 can be observed when g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained using empirical equations proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 approach 1 are correlated however there is relevant data dispersion around the regression line this result can be confirmed through the standard error value equal to 31 s 1 standard error is a measure of data dispersion in a regression and defines the confidence interval around the estimated value from a required confidence level considering the number of datapoints for example using a confidence level of 95 an estimated g of 325 s 1 will be between 260 s 1 and 390 s 1 when g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained using empirical equations proposed by al hashimi and ashjyan 3 approach 2 are correlated worse results were obtained fig 4 b presenting a value of r ² equal to 0 8786 and a standard error equal to 68 s 1 thus empirical equations proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 for g evaluation do not show satisfactory results in fact models proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 do not take into account the units curvature and torsion parameters which influence the flow characteristics 30 32 even with the simplicity inherent in the methods being a factor of significant importance in choosing an estimation method of a parameter of such magnitude in the flocculation process such as g deviations reaching over 60 and a wide dispersion of data around the regression line means these methods become unviable therefore these results indicate that the use of these methods for estimating g should be performed cautiously making the need for more appropriate methodologies for the evaluation of g in hctfs clearer 4 2 class b approaches 3 and 4 referring to the hydrodynamic parameters obtained by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor and in a representative cross section of the reactor located after the hydrodynamic entrance region g values obtained by prototyping approach 5 were compared with the g values obtained by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor approach 3 and in a representative cross section of the reactor located after the hydrodynamic entrance region approach 4 the results are presented in table 6 from table 6 it is possible to note that approach 3 referring to g obtained by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor presents a rmse and mapd equal to 27 3 s 1 and 9 6 respectively when it is compared with approach 5 and approach 4 referring to g obtained by cfd modeling in a representative cross section of the reactor showed a rmse and mapd equal to 27 5 s 1 and 19 1 respectively when it is compared with approach 5 also in these cases one can question the direct comparison performed above to verify whether there is a correlation between g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained by approaches 3 and 4 linear regressions were performed as shown in fig 5 from fig 5 a a very high value of r ² determination coefficient equal to 0 9995 can be observed when g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor approach 3 are correlated contrary to comparisons previously performed prototyping versus class a approaches there is a small dispersion of data around the regression line this result can be confirmed through the standard error value equal to 5 s 1 in this case with a confidence level of 95 the same estimated g of 325 s 1 will be between 315 s 1 and 336 s 1 when g obtained by prototyping approach 5 and g obtained by cfd modeling in a representative cross section of the reactor approach 4 are correlated fig 5 b the results that were obtained were worse when they are compared with results from the approach 3 performance test fig 5 a presenting an r ² equal to 0 9822 and a standard error equal to 30 s 1 however the performance results of approach 4 were better than the class a approach performance results indicating higher values of r² and lower values of standard error the r ² values of approach 1 and 4 can be considered similar however an increase in the r ² value when r ² is next to 1 requires a significant effort furthermore approach 1 cannot be used indiscriminately because it is based on only two variables tube diameter and mean velocity the winding diameter was considered in approach 1 and it is relevant in the velocity gradient values one reason for the satisfactory performance of approach 1 was the fact that in this paper the winding diameter and pitch were not modified therefore it is expected to have greater differences between approaches 1 and 4 in these cases finally previous results indicate that approach 3 represents a satisfactory value of g in the methodology section the experimental uncertainty was 10 for this reason this research recommends the use of approach 3 to evaluate g as the primary option however approach 3 may have a high computational cost for units with a large length as seen in 36 in this case this research recommends the use of approach 4 as an alternative method the main advantage of using a representative section of the unit for g evaluation is a non mandatory simulation of a complete geometry mainly in cases of flocculation units with hundreds of turns 36 with the use of only a cross section of the unit it is possible to obtain a considerable reduction in the computational cost required in g evaluation allowing multiple tests for different configurations to be carried out to optimize the geometric parameters according to the hydraulic and hydrodynamic parameters of the unit the evaluation of various configurations is impractical for exceptionally large computational times which makes approach 4 a tool with an immense potential for g estimation in addition to this approach 4 can be used as an initial evaluation step after that approach 3 can be used in the final steps of analysis where a fine adjustment is required 5 conclusions the global velocity gradient g is an especially important parameter in the project of flocculation units since its value is typically used to measure the agitation level of the liquid mass inside the unit the evaluation of g is performed through prototyping making it costly empirical equations can be also used as a prompt way to evaluate g but they are frequently incompatible with the geometry of the unit leading to a high number of errors therefore this study sought alternatives to estimate g using cfd modeling testing them in six hctfs from these results it can be concluded that all approaches presented in this study to evaluate g using cfd modeling showed better results than the empirical models proposed by vigneswaran and setiadi 2 and al hashimi and ashjyan 3 indicating that cfd modeling can be a useful tool for evaluating g as a first option it is recommended that approach 3 is used which evaluates g by cfd modeling in the entire domain of the reactor this approach presented results that were more adherent to the physical process with an rmse and mapd equal to 27 3 s 1 and 9 6 respectively when compared with approach 5 related to the prototyping approach however when there are restrictions on the availability of computational resources the use of approach 4 is recommended since it evaluates g by cfd modeling in a representative cross section of the reactor approach 4 can be used as an initial evaluation step due to its low computational cost further approach 3 with a higher computational cost can be used in the final steps of analysis where a fine adjustment is required approach 4 has a lower computational cost because it is possible to obtain a representative value of g through knowledge of the hydrodynamic characteristics of a unique unit cross section after the hydrodynamic entrance region allowing the simulation of shorter reactors however the average deviations encountered with such an approach were higher than those found with the use of the entire domain under study in which the use of such a method requires caution

14429,this paper describes and discusses an investigation into the treatment performance of boron doped diamond bdd pt coated ti pt and various mixed metal oxide mmo anodes after pre treatment chemical coagulation for total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod removal from instant coffee and coffee products production wastewater firstly the performance of coagulants alcl3 al2 so4 3 fecl3 and feso4 were investigated secondly the treatment performance of bdd pt and various mmo anodes the influence of the applied current density and the effect of flow rate for the best

alcl3 showed the best performance removing 29 toc and cod 55 at the electrooxidation process bdd electrode achieved the best performance at the end of the 6 h run period bdd electrode achieved 95 toc and 97 cod removal on the other hand pt and mmo electrodes just removed 13 22 toc and 25 50 cod respectively in this study the bdd electrode performed much better than pt and mmo electrodes keywords total organic carbon electrooxidation instant coffee wastewater boron doped diamond chemical coagulation 1 introduction coffee is one of the favorite beverages of the world and the second largest traded commodity after petroleum 1 2 55 countries in the world that are involved in producing coffee as primary agricultural produce 3 coffee is cultivated in about 80 countries across the globe and entangles colossal business worldwide 1 the demand for instant coffee is increasing in today s fast living conditions this demand shows that the instant coffee production sector and the wastes from the industry will grow the wastewater of instant coffee and coffee products production is primarily generated from cleaning operations involving apparatus cleaning and floor washing instant coffee wastewater includes enormous amounts of macromolecules such as humic acid lignins or tannins which causes water pollution the untreated macromolecules include the vast number of cod that pollutes various type of water resources hence it is needed to reduce the pollutant concentration in the instant coffee wastewater before discharging it into the environment 4 in previous studies researchers used a variety of treatment methods photo fenton uv fe2 h2o2 5 electrocoagulation electrooxidation 6 thermophilic anaerobic treatment 7 fenton and photo fenton 8 mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion with thermophilic pre acidification 9 chemical flocculation and advanced oxidation processes 10 electrocoagulation 11 to remove of pollutants from the coffee industry wastewater in water and wastewater treatment coagulation and flocculation process are very important colloidal material includes mineral substances small aggregates of precipitated and flocculated matter viruses silt bacteria plankton biopolymers and macromolecules such equipment comprises inorganic ions molecules and polymeric species polyelectrolytes organic molecules undissociated solutes and small aggregates chemical coagulation and flocculation in wastewater treatment involve the addition of chemicals to change the physical state of dissolved and suspended solids and assist their removal by sedimentation coagulation is used for removal of the wastes in a suspended or colloidal form that does not settle out on standing or may settle by taking an extremely long time in water and wastewater treatment coagulation as the pretreatment is regarded as the most popular pretreatment 12 15 chemical coagulation has been used in the treatment of much different wastewater such as tannery wastewater 16 pulp and paper wastewater 17 textile industry wastewater 18 distillery wastewater 19 petrochemical wastewater 20 and food industry wastewater 21 the generally used metal coagulants fall into two general categories those based on iron and those based on aluminum the iron coagulants include ferrous sulfate ferric sulfate ferric chloride sulfate ferric chloride polyferric sulfate and ferric salts with organic polymers the aluminum coagulants contain aluminum sulfate this is probably the most extensively used coagulant and has been in use for water treatment for several centuries aluminum chlorohydrate aluminum chloride sodium aluminate polyaluminum chloride polyaluminum sulfate chloride polyaluminum silicate chloride and forms of polyaluminum chloride with organic polymers main disadvantages that might preclude a wholly physical chemical solution to wastewater treatment are the problems related to the highly putrescible sludge produced and the high operating costs of chemical addition 15 to reduce that disadvantage coagulants were used in as small quantities as possible in this study the coagulant used here is intended to remove suspended pollutants rather than complete removal electrooxidation has been used increasingly in recent years in the treatment of various wastewaters such as textile wastewater 22 toxic cardboard plant wastewater 23 pharmaceutical industry wastewater 24 gelatin production plant wastewater 25 and landfill leachate 26 electrooxidation of pollutants can take place using two different mechanisms direct anodic oxidation where the pollutants are destroyed at the anode surface and indirect oxidation where a mediator is electrochemically generated to carry out the oxidation it has to be kept in mind that during the electrooxidation of wastewater both oxidation mechanisms may coexist 27 electrooxidation is an environmentally favorable technology capable of mineralizing non biodegradable organic matter and to eliminate nitrogen species two lines of investigation have been followed 1 replacement of traditional processes by electrochemical oxidation and 2 integration of electrooxidation into a treatment process 28 this study is using chemical coagulation as the pre treatment to increase the performance of anode electrodes and reduce the high energy demand of electrooxidation in this study it was aimed to examine the treatment performance removal and energy consumption of bdd pt and various mmo anodes after chemical coagulation for toc and cod removal from instant coffee and coffee products production wastewater iccppw firstly chemical coagulation was applied to the wastewater to remove colloidal and suspended particles and it was followed by electrooxidation to eliminate the remaining dissolved persistent organic compounds in the chemical coagulation experiments 4 type coagulant and their concentrations were tested to study their influence on the removal of toc and cod in the electrooxidation experiments the treatment performance of bdd pt and various mmo anodes the impact of the applied current density and the effect of flow rate for the best performed electrode and the chemical coagulation pre treatment coagulant concentration was studied also specific energy consumptions and anode performance of anodes were evaluated for electrooxidation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the iccppw was obtained from the instant coffee and coffee products production factory in turkey the iccppw samples were stored at 4 c accordance with the standard methods 29 table 1 shows the typical characteristics of the iccppw in the coagulation flocculation processes four different coagulant salts were used feso4 fecl3 al2 so4 3 and alcl3 all the chemicals used in the experiments were analytical quality merck products bdd boron doped diamond pt and mmo mixed metal oxide electrodes ti ruo2 tio2 ti ruo2 iro2 ti iro2 ta2o5 ti pt iro2 were used as the anode while a stainless steel electrode was used as the cathode pt and mmo electrodes are ti based electrodes bdd electrodes were supplied from diaccon gmbh germany pt and mmo electrodes were supplied from baoji changli special metal co ltd china 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedure chemical coagulation runs were performed in a 2000 ml pyrex glass reactor the reactor was equipped with a magnetic stirrer heidolph mr hei tec model digital magnetic stirrers 2000 ml of iccppw was placed in the reactor a rotation speed of 100 rpm was applied for 2 min followed by slow mixing for 15 min at 50 rpm then coagulated iccppw was let to settle for 30 min and the supernatant was collected from the top for the electrooxidation experiments electrooxidation runs were performed in a 1000 ml pyrex glass 500 ml of coagulated iccppw was placed in the pyrex glass reactor for each run one anode and one cathode in sizes of 200 60 2 mm were used in the reactor both the anodes and cathodes were placed vertically parallel to each other the inter electrode gap was kept constant at 5 mm the total active surface area of the anodes depending on the immersion level in the solution was 40 cm2 before each run the electrodes were wiped with phosphoric acid or acetone to remove impurities deposited on the surface and washed with distilled water the reactor was equipped with a magnetic stirrer and the stirring speed was adjusted at 500 rpm to keep the wastewater homogeny mixed for this purpose heidolph mr hei tec model digital magnetic stirrers were used the system powered by agilent and rigol brand programmable agilent 6674 a system 0 60 v 0 35 a rigol dp832 0 30 v 0 3 a digital d c direct current power supply the temperature increase caused by the interelectrode voltage across the reactor was prevented by blowing cold air to the reactor wall from the outside thus the temperature of the solution was maintained at 25 1 c through the run which was monitored using a laser thermometer for continuous runs a peristaltic pump was used no ph adjustment was made during the runs the runs were completed in 360 min toc and cod values were measured by sampling 20 min or every hour 2 3 analytical method all the chemical analyses were carried out by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 29 the cod value was determined by dichromate open reflux method as per standard method 5220 b the toc levels were determined through combustion of the samples at 680 c using a non dispersive ir source shimadzu toc l model by non purgeable organic carbon method all the experiments were repeated twice for checking the reproducibility of the results the maximum experimental error was below 2 and the average values have been reported each measurement was made with three repetitions and the average of 3 results was obtained the toc and cod removal efficiency e is calculated as 1 e c i c f c i x 100 where c i is initial toc or cod concentration mg l and c f is the final concentration mg l on that account specific energy consumption sec based on cod and toc removal was calculated which is the main component of the running costs of most electrochemical treatment processes sec is defined as the amount of energy consumed per unit mass of cod cod rem or toc removed toc rem and expressed in kwh kg of cod or toc removed and is given as 2 s e c k w h k g

subjected to coagulation flocculation for the removal of suspended organics using four different types of coagulant salt to determine the most effective one in the second phase several different types of anode were used in the electrooxidation process for toc and cod removal from wastewater to identify the most effective one in the third phase the most efficient anode electrode was studied in batch and continuous mode at different current densities to investigate treatment efficiencies 3 1 the effects of coagulant dosage for toc removal performance when the wastewater with high rates of suspended organics was subjected to electrooxidation process some of the suspended organics were converted to soluble form as a result of the circulation to which the wastewater in the process was exposed during the first minutes of the electrooxidation process this unwanted phenomenon affects the efficiency of the electrooxidation process and operating conditions adversely to avoid this and to increase the effectiveness of the electrooxidation process the production wastewater of coffee and coffee products was subjected to coagulation flocculation for the removal of suspended organics before electrooxidation process the optimal coagulant was determined by comparing the coagulation flocculation processes in which four different coagulant salts were used feso4 fecl3 al2 so4 3 and alcl3 fig 1 shows the toc values of coffee and coffee products production wastewater after coagulation flocculation using four different coagulant salts fig 1 indicates that two aluminum salts achieved the best removal al2 so4 3 and alcl3 reduced the toc value from 757 mg l to 549 mg l and 539 mg l respectively coagulation flocculation was performed on the wastewater by applying the two aluminum coagulant salts alcl3 and al2 so4 3 at different doses to determine optimal coagulant dosage fig 2 shows toc and cod removal efficiencies for alcl3 and al2 so4 3 coagulant salts after coagulation flocculation the wastewater color became substantially clear and turned light yellow the toc and cod values for alcl3 decreased to 539 mg l and 1064 mg l respectively while the toc and cod values for al2 so4 3 decreased to 549 mg l and 1156 mg l respectively 3 2 the effects of anode type on the toc and cod removal efficiency the removal efficiencies of the aluminum coagulants al2 so4 3 and alcl3 were close to one another therefore the effect of the anode type was also investigated for coagulation flocculation using both coagulants to monitor how aluminum coagulants or their residues so4 and cl would act on toc and cod removal during electrooxidation to investigate the effects of anode type on the toc and cod removal efficiency from the coffee and coffee products production wastewater by electrooxidation process 6 type anode bdd electrode pt and 4 mmo electrodes was used all runs were achieved at j 75 ma cm2 current density fig 3 shows the removal efficiencies after electrooxidation with different electrodes applied to the wastewater partially purified from pollutants after coagulation flocculation with also4 fig 3 a and b show toc and cod removal efficiencies for different anode electrodes figs show that bdd electrode achieved much better removal than pt and mmo electrodes at the end of the 6 h run period bdd electrode achieved 91 toc and 93 cod removal while toc and cod removal of pt and mmo electrodes ranged from 9 to 10 and from 17 to 23 respectively this result indicates that bdd electrode yields 4 10 times better toc and 4 5 times better cod removal efficiency than pt and mmo electrodes fig 3 c and d show the sec values calculated depending on the amount of toc and cod removal for each anode electrode fig 3 indicate that the lowest sec values were obtained for bdd electrode with the highest removal efficiency while the highest sec values were obtained for the pt iro2 electrode with the lowest toc removal efficiency and the ruo2 tio2 electrode with the lowest cod removal efficiency fig 4 shows the removal efficiencies after electrooxidation with different electrodes applied to the wastewater partially purified from pollutants after coagulation flocculation with alcl3 fig 4 a and b show toc and cod removal efficiencies for different anode electrodes figs show that bdd electrode achieved much better removal than pt and mmo electrodes at the end of the 6 h run period bdd electrode achieved 95 toc and 97 cod removal while toc and cod removal of pt and mmo electrodes ranged from 13 to 22 and from 25 to 50 respectively this result indicates that bdd electrode yields 4 7 times better toc and 2 4 times better cod removal efficiency than pt and mmo electrodes fig 4 c and d show the sec values calculated depending on the amount of toc and cod removal for each anode electrode fig 4 indicate that the lowest sec values were obtained for bdd electrode with the highest removal efficiency while the highest sec values were obtained for the ruo2 tio2 electrode with the lowest toc removal efficiency and with the lowest cod removal efficiency table 2 summarizes the efficiency of the anode electrodes depending on the parameters of electrooxidation removal efficiency and energy consumption table 2 indicates that the bdd electrode is superior in performance to other pt and mmo electrodes in all parameters the anode efficiency η and instantaneous current efficiency ice of bbd electrode are about 2 3 times and 2 5 times higher than those of other electrodes respectively pt electrodes performed the second best during anodic oxidation two species of active oxygen can be electrochemically generated on the surface of anodes the chemisorbed which is responsible for the electrochemical conversion generally produced on carbon graphite and mmo anodes while the other is physisorbed which is responsible for electrochemical combustion usually produced on pbo2 sno2 and bdd anodes during indirect oxidation the anodically generated agents like chlorine and hypochlorite hydrogen peroxide and ozone are responsible for the oxidation of pollutants organics 32 the effect of coagulant or coagulant residues used for coagulation flocculation before electrooxidation is most evident when mmo electrodes were used as the anode while the use of alcl3 or al2 so4 3 coagulant before electrocoagulation slightly affected the performance of bdd anode electrode it had an effect on pt and mmo electrodes in favor of alcl3 increases were observed in anode efficiency η 33 133 and instantaneous current efficiency ice 60 97 this positive contribution of alcl3 coagulant is attributed to the increase in the activity of electrooxidation with the participation of cl ions which are left in the water after chemical coagulation in indirect oxidation in the electrooxidation process table 3 summarizes the results of the first two stages of toc and cod removal from production wastewater of coffee and coffee products table 3 indicates that using alcl3 as the coagulant for coagulation flocculation before electrooxidation yielded better results in removal efficiencies in the light of this result coagulation flocculation in the wastewater before electrooxidation was carried out using alcl3 coagulant in the later stages of the study 3 3 toc and cod removal using bdd electrode 3 3 1 effect of current density fig 5 a and b show toc and cod removal efficiencies for bdd electrode at different current densities fig clearly indicate that toc and cod removal directly depends on current density at the end of the 6 h run period 95 96 toc and 100 cod removal efficiencies were obtained for current densities of 100 and 125 ma cm2 84 toc and 86 cod removal efficiencies were obtained for the lowest current density of 25 ma cm2 these values are satisfactory in the sense that they were obtained at 5 times lower current density the most apparent difference in the removal efficiencies for all these 5 different current density values was observed in the middle of the 360 min run time in these minutes the difference between the removal efficiencies can be more than 2 times at the 180 min 41 toc and 43 cod removal efficiencies were obtained for 25 ma cm2 while 92 toc and 125 cod removal efficiencies were obtained for 125 ma cm2 these results indicate that oxidation and or mineralization of pollutants in electrooxidation depends on the pollutant composition current density and duration or flow rate fig 5 c and d show the sec values calculated depending on the amount of toc and cod removal for different current density values indicating that the sec values increase in parallel with the applied current density the lowest sec values were obtained for 25 ma cm2 while the highest sec values were obtained for 125 ma cm2 at the end of 360 min the difference between the lowest and highest removal efficiencies is around 12 14 whereas the sec rates can be 8 times different among the variables that are usually modified in electrooxidation processes the current density may be the term most frequently pointed to because it controls the reaction rate it should be highlighted that an increase in current density does not necessarily result in an increase in the oxidation efficiency or oxidation rate and that for a given anode electrode material the effect of current density on the treatment or removal efficiency depends on the specification of the effluent or aqueous media to be treated though the use of higher current densities generally results in higher operating costs due to the increase in energy consumption 28 table 4 summarizes the efficiency of the current density depending on the parameters of electrooxidation removal efficiency and energy consumption indicating that as the current density increases the removal efficiencies increase however energy consumption and performance parameters are affected negatively by this when the current density is increased by 5 times the anode efficiency η and instantaneous current efficiency ice of bbd electrode decrease 4 3 4 4 times and 4 3 times respectively this result indicates that operating at low current density is more profitable regarding energy efficiency and anode performance direct oxidation during the electrooxidation is controlled by the diffusion of the pollutants organics towards the electrode surface where the o h is produced and the current efficiency is favored by a high mass transport coefficient high pollutant organic concentration and low current density achieving electrolysis in optimized conditions without diffusion limitation the current efficiency reaches 100 for high pollutant organic concentrations and low current densities the cod decreased linearly and the ice remained about 100 while for low pollutant organic concentrations or high current densities the cod decreased exponentially and the ice started to decrease due to the mass transport limitation and the side reactions of oxygen evolution 33 3 3 2 effect of flow effect of flow rate on the toc and cod removal from the coffee and coffee products production wastewater was studied in a range of 300 ml h 5 ml min 600 ml h 10 ml min and 1200 ml h 20 ml min at a constant current density of 75 ma cm2 fig 6 a and b and 125 ma cm2 fig 6c and d 4 conclusion electrooxidation process successfully applied to the treatment of iccppw after pre treatment chemical coagulation pre treatment with chemical coagulation removed the suspended organics and helped to make electrooxidation successful in the pre treatment stage 29 toc and cod 55 removed from wastewater in the electrooxidation stage all the remaining cod and almost all the toc were removed from the wastewater toc and cod removal on the

total organic carbon electrooxidation instant coffee wastewater boron doped diamond chemical coagulation 1 introduction coffee is one of the favorite beverages of the world and the second largest traded commodity after petroleum 1 2 55 countries in the world that are involved in producing coffee as primary agricultural produce 3 coffee is cultivated in about 80 countries across the globe and entangles colossal business worldwide 1 the demand for instant coffee is increasing in today s fast living conditions this demand shows that the instant coffee production sector and the wastes from the industry will grow the wastewater of instant coffee and coffee products production is primarily generated from cleaning operations involving apparatus cleaning and floor washing instant coffee wastewater includes enormous amounts of macromolecules such as humic acid lignins or tannins which causes water pollution the untreated macromolecules include the vast number of cod that pollutes various type of water resources hence it is needed to reduce the pollutant concentration in the instant coffee wastewater before discharging it into the environment 4 in previous studies researchers used a variety of treatment methods photo fenton uv fe2 h2o2 5 electrocoagulation electrooxidation 6 thermophilic anaerobic treatment 7 fenton and photo fenton 8 mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion with thermophilic pre acidification 9 chemical flocculation and advanced oxidation processes 10 electrocoagulation 11 to remove of pollutants from the coffee industry wastewater in water and wastewater treatment coagulation and flocculation process are very important colloidal material includes mineral substances small aggregates of precipitated and flocculated matter viruses silt bacteria plankton biopolymers and macromolecules such equipment comprises inorganic ions molecules and polymeric species polyelectrolytes organic molecules undissociated solutes and small aggregates chemical coagulation and flocculation in wastewater treatment involve the addition of chemicals to change the physical state of dissolved and suspended solids and assist their removal by sedimentation coagulation is used for removal of the wastes in a suspended or colloidal form that does not settle out on standing or may settle by taking an extremely long time in water and wastewater treatment coagulation as the pretreatment is regarded as the most popular pretreatment 12 15 chemical coagulation has been used in the treatment of much different wastewater such as tannery wastewater 16 pulp and paper wastewater 17 textile industry wastewater 18 distillery wastewater 19 petrochemical wastewater 20 and food industry wastewater 21 the generally used metal coagulants fall into two general categories those based on iron and those based on aluminum the iron coagulants include ferrous sulfate ferric sulfate ferric chloride sulfate ferric chloride polyferric sulfate and ferric salts with organic polymers the aluminum coagulants contain aluminum sulfate this is probably the most extensively used coagulant and has been in use for water treatment for several centuries aluminum chlorohydrate aluminum chloride sodium aluminate polyaluminum chloride polyaluminum sulfate chloride polyaluminum silicate chloride and forms of polyaluminum chloride with organic polymers main disadvantages that might preclude a wholly physical chemical solution to wastewater treatment are the problems related to the highly putrescible sludge produced and the high operating costs of chemical addition 15 to reduce that disadvantage coagulants were used in as small quantities as possible in this study the coagulant used here is intended to remove suspended pollutants rather than complete removal electrooxidation has been used increasingly in recent years in the treatment of various wastewaters such as textile wastewater 22 toxic cardboard plant wastewater 23 pharmaceutical industry wastewater 24 gelatin production plant wastewater 25 and landfill leachate 26 electrooxidation of pollutants can take place using two different mechanisms direct anodic oxidation where the pollutants are destroyed at the anode surface and indirect oxidation where a mediator is electrochemically generated to carry out the oxidation it has to be kept in mind that during the electrooxidation of wastewater both oxidation mechanisms may coexist 27 electrooxidation is an environmentally favorable technology capable of mineralizing non biodegradable organic matter and to eliminate nitrogen species two lines of investigation have been followed 1 replacement of traditional processes by electrochemical oxidation and 2 integration of electrooxidation into a treatment process 28 this study is using chemical coagulation as the pre treatment to increase the performance of anode electrodes and reduce the high energy demand of electrooxidation in this study it was aimed to examine the treatment performance removal and energy consumption of bdd pt and various mmo anodes after chemical coagulation for toc and cod removal from instant coffee and coffee products production wastewater iccppw firstly chemical coagulation was applied to the wastewater to remove colloidal and suspended particles and it was followed by electrooxidation to eliminate the remaining dissolved persistent organic compounds in the chemical coagulation experiments 4 type coagulant and their concentrations were tested to study their influence on the removal of toc and cod in the electrooxidation experiments the treatment performance of bdd pt and various mmo anodes the impact of the applied current density and the effect of flow rate for the best performed electrode and the chemical coagulation pre treatment coagulant concentration was studied also specific energy consumptions and anode performance of anodes were evaluated for electrooxidation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the iccppw was obtained from the instant coffee and coffee products production factory in turkey the iccppw samples were stored at 4 c accordance with the standard methods 29 table 1 shows the typical characteristics of the iccppw in the coagulation flocculation processes four different coagulant salts were used feso4 fecl3 al2 so4 3 and alcl3 all the chemicals used in the experiments were analytical quality merck products bdd boron doped diamond pt and mmo mixed metal oxide electrodes ti ruo2 tio2 ti ruo2 iro2 ti iro2 ta2o5 ti pt iro2 were used as the anode while a stainless steel electrode was used as the cathode pt and mmo electrodes are ti based electrodes bdd electrodes were supplied from diaccon gmbh germany pt and mmo electrodes were supplied from baoji changli special metal co ltd china 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedure chemical coagulation runs were performed in a 2000 ml pyrex glass reactor the reactor was equipped with a magnetic stirrer heidolph mr hei tec model digital magnetic stirrers 2000 ml of iccppw was placed in the reactor a rotation speed of 100 rpm was applied for 2 min followed by slow mixing for 15 min at 50 rpm then coagulated iccppw was let to settle for 30 min and the supernatant was collected from the top for the electrooxidation experiments electrooxidation runs were performed in a 1000 ml pyrex glass 500 ml of coagulated iccppw was placed in the pyrex glass reactor for each run one anode and one cathode in sizes of 200 60 2 mm were used in the reactor both the anodes and cathodes were placed vertically parallel to each other the inter electrode gap was kept constant at 5 mm the total active surface area of the anodes depending on the immersion level in the solution was 40 cm2 before each run the electrodes were wiped with phosphoric acid or acetone to remove impurities deposited on the surface and washed with distilled water the reactor was equipped with a magnetic stirrer and the stirring speed was adjusted at 500 rpm to keep the wastewater homogeny mixed for this purpose heidolph mr hei tec model digital magnetic stirrers were used the system powered by agilent and rigol brand programmable agilent 6674 a system 0 60 v 0 35 a rigol dp832 0 30 v 0 3 a digital d c direct current power supply the temperature increase caused by the interelectrode voltage across the reactor was prevented by blowing cold air to the reactor wall from the outside thus the temperature of the solution was maintained at 25 1 c through the run which was monitored using a laser thermometer for continuous runs a peristaltic pump was used no ph adjustment was made during the runs the runs were completed in 360 min toc and cod values were measured by sampling 20 min or every hour 2 3 analytical method all the chemical analyses were carried out by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 29 the cod value was determined by dichromate open reflux method as per standard method 5220 b the toc levels were determined through combustion of the samples at 680 c using a non dispersive ir source shimadzu toc l model by non purgeable organic carbon method all the experiments were repeated twice for checking the reproducibility of the results the maximum experimental error was below 2 and the average values have been reported each measurement was made with three repetitions and the average of 3 results was obtained the toc and cod removal efficiency e is calculated as 1 e c i c f c i x 100 where c i is initial toc or cod concentration mg l and c f is the final concentration mg l on that account specific energy consumption sec based on cod and toc removal was calculated which is the main component of the running costs of most electrochemical treatment processes sec is defined as the amount of energy consumed per unit mass of cod cod rem or toc removed toc rem and expressed in kwh kg of cod or toc removed and is given as 2 s e c k w h k g

subjected to coagulation flocculation for the removal of suspended organics using four different types of coagulant salt to determine the most effective one in the second phase several different types of anode were used in the electrooxidation process for toc and cod removal from wastewater to identify the most effective one in the third phase the most efficient anode electrode was studied in batch and continuous mode at different current densities to investigate treatment efficiencies 3 1 the effects of coagulant dosage for toc removal performance when the wastewater with high rates of suspended organics was subjected to electrooxidation process some of the suspended organics were converted to soluble form as a result of the circulation to which the wastewater in the process was exposed during the first minutes of the electrooxidation process this unwanted phenomenon affects the efficiency of the electrooxidation process and operating conditions adversely to avoid this and to increase the effectiveness of the electrooxidation process the production wastewater of coffee and coffee products was subjected to coagulation flocculation for the removal of suspended organics before electrooxidation process the optimal coagulant was determined by comparing the coagulation flocculation processes in which four different coagulant salts were used feso4 fecl3 al2 so4 3 and alcl3 fig 1 shows the toc values of coffee and coffee products production wastewater after coagulation flocculation using four different coagulant salts fig 1 indicates that two aluminum salts achieved the best removal al2 so4 3 and alcl3 reduced the toc value from 757 mg l to 549 mg l and 539 mg l respectively coagulation flocculation was performed on the wastewater by applying the two aluminum coagulant salts alcl3 and al2 so4 3 at different doses to determine optimal coagulant dosage fig 2 shows toc and cod removal efficiencies for alcl3 and al2 so4 3 coagulant salts after coagulation flocculation the wastewater color became substantially clear and turned light yellow the toc and cod values for alcl3 decreased to 539 mg l and 1064 mg l respectively while the toc and cod values for al2 so4 3 decreased to 549 mg l and 1156 mg l respectively 3 2 the effects of anode type on the toc and cod removal efficiency the removal efficiencies of the aluminum coagulants al2 so4 3 and alcl3 were close to one another therefore the effect of the anode type was also investigated for coagulation flocculation using both coagulants to monitor how aluminum coagulants or their residues so4 and cl would act on toc and cod removal during electrooxidation to investigate the effects of anode type on the toc and cod removal efficiency from the coffee and coffee products production wastewater by electrooxidation process 6 type anode bdd electrode pt and 4 mmo electrodes was used all runs were achieved at j 75 ma cm2 current density fig 3 shows the removal efficiencies after electrooxidation with different electrodes applied to the wastewater partially purified from pollutants after coagulation flocculation with also4 fig 3 a and b show toc and cod removal efficiencies for different anode electrodes figs show that bdd electrode achieved much better removal than pt and mmo electrodes at the end of the 6 h run period bdd electrode achieved 91 toc and 93 cod removal while toc and cod removal of pt and mmo electrodes ranged from 9 to 10 and from 17 to 23 respectively this result indicates that bdd electrode yields 4 10 times better toc and 4 5 times better cod removal efficiency than pt and mmo electrodes fig 3 c and d show the sec values calculated depending on the amount of toc and cod removal for each anode electrode fig 3 indicate that the lowest sec values were obtained for bdd electrode with the highest removal efficiency while the highest sec values were obtained for the pt iro2 electrode with the lowest toc removal efficiency and the ruo2 tio2 electrode with the lowest cod removal efficiency fig 4 shows the removal efficiencies after electrooxidation with different electrodes applied to the wastewater partially purified from pollutants after coagulation flocculation with alcl3 fig 4 a and b show toc and cod removal efficiencies for different anode electrodes figs show that bdd electrode achieved much better removal than pt and mmo electrodes at the end of the 6 h run period bdd electrode achieved 95 toc and 97 cod removal while toc and cod removal of pt and mmo electrodes ranged from 13 to 22 and from 25 to 50 respectively this result indicates that bdd electrode yields 4 7 times better toc and 2 4 times better cod removal efficiency than pt and mmo electrodes fig 4 c and d show the sec values calculated depending on the amount of toc and cod removal for each anode electrode fig 4 indicate that the lowest sec values were obtained for bdd electrode with the highest removal efficiency while the highest sec values were obtained for the ruo2 tio2 electrode with the lowest toc removal efficiency and with the lowest cod removal efficiency table 2 summarizes the efficiency of the anode electrodes depending on the parameters of electrooxidation removal efficiency and energy consumption table 2 indicates that the bdd electrode is superior in performance to other pt and mmo electrodes in all parameters the anode efficiency η and instantaneous current efficiency ice of bbd electrode are about 2 3 times and 2 5 times higher than those of other electrodes respectively pt electrodes performed the second best during anodic oxidation two species of active oxygen can be electrochemically generated on the surface of anodes the chemisorbed which is responsible for the electrochemical conversion generally produced on carbon graphite and mmo anodes while the other is physisorbed which is responsible for electrochemical combustion usually produced on pbo2 sno2 and bdd anodes during indirect oxidation the anodically generated agents like chlorine and hypochlorite hydrogen peroxide and ozone are responsible for the oxidation of pollutants organics 32 the effect of coagulant or coagulant residues used for coagulation flocculation before electrooxidation is most evident when mmo electrodes were used as the anode while the use of alcl3 or al2 so4 3 coagulant before electrocoagulation slightly affected the performance of bdd anode electrode it had an effect on pt and mmo electrodes in favor of alcl3 increases were observed in anode efficiency η 33 133 and instantaneous current efficiency ice 60 97 this positive contribution of alcl3 coagulant is attributed to the increase in the activity of electrooxidation with the participation of cl ions which are left in the water after chemical coagulation in indirect oxidation in the electrooxidation process table 3 summarizes the results of the first two stages of toc and cod removal from production wastewater of coffee and coffee products table 3 indicates that using alcl3 as the coagulant for coagulation flocculation before electrooxidation yielded better results in removal efficiencies in the light of this result coagulation flocculation in the wastewater before electrooxidation was carried out using alcl3 coagulant in the later stages of the study 3 3 toc and cod removal using bdd electrode 3 3 1 effect of current density fig 5 a and b show toc and cod removal efficiencies for bdd electrode at different current densities fig clearly indicate that toc and cod removal directly depends on current density at the end of the 6 h run period 95 96 toc and 100 cod removal efficiencies were obtained for current densities of 100 and 125 ma cm2 84 toc and 86 cod removal efficiencies were obtained for the lowest current density of 25 ma cm2 these values are satisfactory in the sense that they were obtained at 5 times lower current density the most apparent difference in the removal efficiencies for all these 5 different current density values was observed in the middle of the 360 min run time in these minutes the difference between the removal efficiencies can be more than 2 times at the 180 min 41 toc and 43 cod removal efficiencies were obtained for 25 ma cm2 while 92 toc and 125 cod removal efficiencies were obtained for 125 ma cm2 these results indicate that oxidation and or mineralization of pollutants in electrooxidation depends on the pollutant composition current density and duration or flow rate fig 5 c and d show the sec values calculated depending on the amount of toc and cod removal for different current density values indicating that the sec values increase in parallel with the applied current density the lowest sec values were obtained for 25 ma cm2 while the highest sec values were obtained for 125 ma cm2 at the end of 360 min the difference between the lowest and highest removal efficiencies is around 12 14 whereas the sec rates can be 8 times different among the variables that are usually modified in electrooxidation processes the current density may be the term most frequently pointed to because it controls the reaction rate it should be highlighted that an increase in current density does not necessarily result in an increase in the oxidation efficiency or oxidation rate and that for a given anode electrode material the effect of current density on the treatment or removal efficiency depends on the specification of the effluent or aqueous media to be treated though the use of higher current densities generally results in higher operating costs due to the increase in energy consumption 28 table 4 summarizes the efficiency of the current density depending on the parameters of electrooxidation removal efficiency and energy consumption indicating that as the current density increases the removal efficiencies increase however energy consumption and performance parameters are affected negatively by this when the current density is increased by 5 times the anode efficiency η and instantaneous current efficiency ice of bbd electrode decrease 4 3 4 4 times and 4 3 times respectively this result indicates that operating at low current density is more profitable regarding energy efficiency and anode performance direct oxidation during the electrooxidation is controlled by the diffusion of the pollutants organics towards the electrode surface where the o h is produced and the current efficiency is favored by a high mass transport coefficient high pollutant organic concentration and low current density achieving electrolysis in optimized conditions without diffusion limitation the current efficiency reaches 100 for high pollutant organic concentrations and low current densities the cod decreased linearly and the ice remained about 100 while for low pollutant organic concentrations or high current densities the cod decreased exponentially and the ice started to decrease due to the mass transport limitation and the side reactions of oxygen evolution 33 3 3 2 effect of flow effect of flow rate on the toc and cod removal from the coffee and coffee products production wastewater was studied in a range of 300 ml h 5 ml min 600 ml h 10 ml min and 1200 ml h 20 ml min at a constant current density of 75 ma cm2 fig 6 a and b and 125 ma cm2 fig 6c and d 4 conclusion electrooxidation process successfully applied to the treatment of iccppw after pre treatment chemical coagulation pre treatment with chemical coagulation removed the suspended organics and helped to make electrooxidation successful in the pre treatment stage 29 toc and cod 55 removed from wastewater in the electrooxidation stage all the remaining cod and almost all the toc were removed from the wastewater toc and cod removal on the electrooxidation directly depends on current density and anode electrode performance bdd electrode performed 74 82 toc and 47 72 cod removal efficiency better than the other electrodes when bdd anode was used 95 96 toc and 100 cod removal efficiencies were obtained for current densities of 100 and 125 ma cm2 at the end of the 6 h run period this study showed that this sequential process could be an essential alternative for the treatment of such wastewater when the bdd electrode is used in the process acknowledgment the authors wish to extend their sincere gratitude to all who supported this
