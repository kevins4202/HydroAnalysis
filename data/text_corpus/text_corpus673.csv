3365,evaporation in shallow soil has a great influence on the properties of surface soil therefore under evaporation conditions research on the rule and mechanism of heat water salt migration in surface soil has great significance for engineering geology and environmental science in this study with full consideration of the initial water content salt content atmospheric temperature and groundwater supply a series of indoor evaporation tests were performed on shallow saline soil to observe the heat water salt migration process in addition before and after the evaporation test the soil microstructure at different depths was observed and analysed to explore the influence of heat water salt migration on the soil the results show that during the evaporation process salt carried by water migrates in the soil column and the water vapour phase transition causes salt accumulation which also leads to the electrical conductivity ec profile showing a v shape and the salt content in the middle of the soil column is lower than that in the end in addition high atmospheric temperature significantly reduces the surface water content but alleviates salt accumulation under the condition of groundwater supplementation the salt accumulation in the soil column surface is rapid by observing the microstructure it can be seen that a flocculent structure exists in the soil before evaporation after evaporation the surface microstructure changes significantly and pores and salt crystals can be observed the results provide a reference for understanding heat water salt transport in arid areas keywords soil evaporation bare soil heat water salt migration microstructure 1 introduction strong evaporation occurs in arid and semiarid regions resulting in water shortages and soil salinization which undermines agricultural production and is also detrimental to economic development mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 evaporation results in a high salt content in the soil surface for a long time forming saline soil that harms agriculture the salt content significantly affects the soil properties according to the technical code for building in saline soil regions gb t50942 2014 when the soluble salt content 0 3 in the soil it can be defined as saline soil in general saline soil has many engineering properties such as salt expandability and thaw collapsibility the distribution of saline soil in arid and semiarid areas is very extensive in china reaching 920 9 104 hm2 accounting for approximately 69 03 of the total saline soil area in china yue et al 2020 the formation of saline soil will inhibit the growth of plants and threaten the sustainable utilization of farmland soil the saline soil in northeast china is widely distributed and the saline soil layer is very thick which seriously restricts the development of the agricultural economy the most important factor affecting soil salinization is evaporation soil evaporation is an important medium for energy exchange and substance exchange between the atmosphere and soil approximately 70 of surface water returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration in arid areas this proportion increases to 90 xie 1990 many scholars have studied soil evaporation the study of soil evaporation begins with the observation of water evaporation subsequently researchers constructed relevant models based on its formation mechanism maintenance conditions and influencing factors such as wind speed temperature and humidity most of these models are used to calculate surface evapotranspiration angus and watts 1984 based on previous studies penman 1948 proposed a relatively rigorous evaporation model based on aerodynamics and the energy balance principle monteith 1957 proposed the penman monteith model with a modification based on the penman model however such models consider more meteorological factors such as solar radiation net radiation albedo wind speed water vapour pressure latitude and longitude many factors affect soil evaporation such as solar radiation humidity in the soil and atmosphere and soil characteristics water in the soil absorbs energy from the sun which changes into water vapour entering the atmosphere high temperature accelerates the transportation of water molecules and causes rapid evaporation according to the characteristics of soil evaporation researchers have carried out many tests on soil evaporation and have proposed three stages in soil evaporation bao et al 2021 fisher 1923 jambhekar et al 2015 lehmann et al 2008 lehmann and or 2009 or et al 2013 shahraeeni and or 2010 teng et al 2021 in the first stage the soil has a high water content and the main factor affecting the evaporation rate is the replenishment of capillary water as long as the water replenishes continuously a high evaporation rate remains this stage is similar to evaporation on the water surface the first stage lasts for a short time when the water content in the soil surface is reduced and hydraulic continuity cannot be maintained it enters the second stage in this stage the porous channel for transporting capillary water is disrupted and water migration in the soil mainly occurs in the form of liquid and vapour evaporation in soil occurs mainly in the second stage in the last stage the evaporation rate is low and it is affected by the vapour transport efficiency in the porous structure of the soil in general evaporation usually occurs on the soil surface with decreasing water content on the surface the evaporation rate will decrease rapidly there is a transition region in the soil it is an evaporation front and the water vapour phase transition mainly occurs in this region gowing et al 2006 in the early period of evaporation the evaporation front is on the interface between the soil and atmosphere with the loss of surface water the evaporation front moves down the soil is dry above the evaporation front and water migrates only in the form of vapour below the evaporation front water migrates in the form of a liquid phase gran et al 2011b in addition evaporation is also affected by the soil structure and particle size the evaporation rate is slower in dense soil than in loose soil which is attributed to fewer voids in dense soil and it is not conducive to heat exchange the soil sample contains a large amount of clay so it has a good water holding capacity which is conducive to observing the water heat migration in soil under evaporation soil evaporation as an important controlling factor of water thermal salt change in arid and semiarid areas has caused serious problems in water resources agriculture and geological disasters teng et al 2019b therefore the study of salt transport is also a concern of researchers nachshon et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b the capillary conduction of liquids was studied by richards 1931 who proposed partial differential equations to study water migration in soil salt movement depends on water movement so research on salt movement is usually carried out with water migration nielsen et al 1986 studied the interaction between soil and solute and pointed out that the convection dispersion effect of soil water was the key to the study of solute transport in addition solute migration will change the properties of soil wan et al 2020 studied the salt crystallization rule and the freezing temperature and water content of soil affected by salt they carried out cooling tests on na2so4 saline soil and obtained the temperature variation law in saline soil the precipitated salt crystals would fill the pore structure of the soil thus changing the physical properties of the soil such as water conductivity and thermal conductivity and affecting the water salt migration of frozen saline soil fujimaki et al 2006 conducted indoor evaporation tests on soil columns containing different solute concentrations improved the volume transfer equation in the evaporation process and evaluated the relationship between salt crust resistance and salt accumulation gran et al 2011a found that during evaporation water vapour moves to both above and below the evaporation front and the salt concentration above the evaporation front is higher than that below in previous studies many scholars only considered a few influencing factors in the study of evaporation and many theoretical models are difficult to use in engineering practice and have low applicability for water salt prediction in the field in addition few researchers have studied the microstructure of soil during evaporation through on site monitoring of saline alkali soil in cold regions of northeast china zhang et al 2021a established a coupling model to describe the water thermal coupling process in the freezing process and used it to predict the freezing and thawing depth however it can be found that in shallow soil 0 5 m for instance the measured temperature was higher than the simulated temperature one of the reasons may be soil evaporation caused by solar radiation which limits the applicability of the coupling model above 0 5 m therefore in shallow soil the effects of evaporation salt content and other factors on bare soil should be considered in this study an indoor evaporation test was employed to simulate the evaporation process in shallow soil and various influencing factors such as initial moisture content salt content atmospheric temperature groundwater supply etc on heat water salt migration in the evaporation process were considered in addition the soil structure before and after evaporation was analysed and compared by scanning electron microscopy sem and the heat water salt migration mechanism in the evaporation process was deeply explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of soil features in this evaporation model test soil samples were taken from a site located in shanghai china the region has a subtropical marine monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 15 22 c and the maximum and minimum temperatures are 35 c and 7 c respectively the soil sample was located below the miscellaneous fill layer approximately 2 2 3 m from the surface it is yellowish brown in colour and has no plant roots inside the grain size composition of the soil samples is similar to that of saline soil in northeast china in addition a series of tests were carried out to measure the physical and chemical properties first the soil sample needs to be dried drying soil using an oven will separate the bound water in the mineral such as zeolite water tang et al 1987 resulting in a change in the mineral properties of the soil sample in addition if the drying temperature is too high some organic matter of soil sample will be removed which influences the heat water salt migration therefore the soil sample was treated by natural air drying after which the soil sample was crushed by a crusher the basic properties of the soil were measured according to the standard for geotechnical test methods gb t50123 2019 the soil moisture content was measured by drying the soil at 105 c for 12 h the liquid limit and plastic limit were measured by a gys 2 photoelectric type liquid plastic limit tester the basic physical and chemical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 below the natural water content of the soil samples is 23 42 and the water content after natural air drying is 3 18 3 25 after air drying the soil samples became significantly hard the permeability coefficient of the soil sample is 7 17 10 8 cm s which is suitable for studying water migration in soil in addition the particle size of the soil sample was measured by the sieving method and gravimetric method and the results are shown in table 2 table 2 shows that the content of the clay group 0 0 005 mm is the highest accounting for 50 32 the second highest is the silty group 0 005 0 075 mm the proportion of soil particles less than 0 075 mm is 92 07 indicating that the soil particles mainly included silt and clay belonging to silty clay and the permeability of silt and clay is poor previous studies have confirmed that the pore channels of clay have many advantages such as good connectivity high capillary water rising height good water holding capacity and sensitivity to water aggregation for studying water migration zhang et al 2019 x ray diffraction xrd was used to analyse the mineral composition of the soil samples and the results are shown in fig 1 fig 1 shows that the relative contents of mineral components in the soil samples are albite 52 4 illite 27 4 quartz 13 2 and kaolinite 7 albite and quartz are primary minerals with stable chemical properties and they play an important role in the composition of the soil skeleton structure illite and kaolinite are secondary minerals and the particle size is small they are also considered clay minerals the relative content of illite and kaolinite in the soil is 34 4 which makes the soil have poor permeability and good water holding capacity in addition montmorillonite is not found in the xrd test indicating that soil expansion is small 2 2 preparation of saline soil there are many kinds of salt in natural saline soil different kinds of salt will affect each other which is not conducive to analysing the influence of a single factor on water heat salt migration therefore the saline soil used in this test was made artificially the salt solution was uniformly added to the soil particles after mixing it was allowed to stand for 48 h currently research on saline soil mainly focuses on chloride saline soil and sulfate saline soil however research on carbonate saline soil is rare therefore in this paper saline soil prepared from raw soil samples and na2co3 was used to explore the salt migration law during evaporation in this study a conductivity meter was used to measure the ec value of the original soil sample ec value was used to evaluate the salt content in the soil and a high ec value means that the soil sample has a high soluble salt content fig 2 illustrates the relationship between the ec value and salt solution concentration the saline soil specimen studied in this test is remoulded manually and the salt content in the original soil sample has a significant influence on the test results therefore it is necessary to measure the ec value of the original soil to determine if it is necessary to remove initial salt from the soil before the soil sample remoulding process according to the soil quality determination for conductivity electrode method hj802 2016 the soil and water were fully mixed at a ratio of 1 5 and filtered after mixing the solid and solution of the mixture were separated by a filtration test and the ec value of the solution was measured by a conductivity meter the ec value of the original soil sample was 8 17 us cm therefore the original soil sample can be considered to contain no soluble salt the saline soil in this test was prepared by fully mixing different concentrations of na2co3 solution with original soil samples 2 3 test apparatus and procedure the factors affecting the heat water salt migration of saline soil mainly include external factors such as load temperature humidity wind speed rainfall and groundwater level and internal factors such as soil particle size composition salt content and initial moisture content therefore this test studied the influence of different factors on water heat salt migration including salt content water content temperature and groundwater supply the evaporation test case design is shown in table 3 w 0 represents the initial moisture content of the soil θ c represents the ratio of salt mass to dry soil mass in this indoor model evaporation test five soil columns can be evaporated simultaneously and labels a and b represent two different evaporation groups cases a1 a5 differ in the salt content cases b1 and b3 differ in the initial water content cases b2 and b3 differ in atmospheric temperature cases b3 and b5 differ in groundwater supplement cases b3 and b4 differ in the salt content this indoor evaporation test was conducted using a test setup designed and assembled by ourselves as shown in fig 3 the test setup mainly consists of a heating system an evaporation container a data monitoring system and a water supply system the container for filling the soil samples is made of plexiglas and the top is open there is a hole at the bottom of the container to simulate the groundwater supply filter paper is placed at the bottom of the soil column to prevent soil particles from blocking the pipe the plexiglas container is cylindrical 15 5 cm in diameter and 20 cm in height and the bottom of the container is supported by a steel bracket temperature humidity probes were mainly used for data acquisition which can simultaneously measure the temperature and relative humidity profiles inside the soil the positions of the probes are 1 cm 5 cm 8 cm 11 cm 13 cm 15 cm 17 cm and 19 cm above the bottom of the soil since the probe also occupies a certain space to reduce the interference of the probe on soil evaporation the number of probes at the bottom of the soil column is reduced the plexiglas containers are covered with insulation to avoid heat exchange on the sides of the soil column the water supply system uses a cup with a volume of 50 ml and the bottom of the cup is connected to the bottom of the plexiglas container through a catheter in addition the water surface in the cup is at the same horizontal line as the bottom of the soil column it is worth noting that the heating system uses a 250 w infrared lamp philips br125 to provide a stable heat source the light emitted by the infrared lamp has a good heating effect many scholars use an infrared lamp in simulating evaporation gran et al 2011b zhou et al 2020 since this test requires a continuous light and stable atmospheric temperature the method described in fig 4 was used to measure the atmospheric temperature at different positions fig 4 shows that within 44 cm of the infrared lamp irradiation has a significant impact on temperature and the temperature curve can be considered a linear change when the distance is more than 44 cm the temperature is 22 23 c and it is in a steady state moreover after 20 min of irradiation the atmospheric temperature did not change significantly compared with that after 60 min of irradiation and it can be considered that the light condition was stable because this test was carried out in a windless indoor environment the influence of airflow on evaporation efficiency was not considered in the evaporation test the macroscopic changes in the soil columns were observed and temperature humidity probes were used to observe the changes in the temperature field and moisture field with time after the evaporation test the ec values of the soil samples at different heights were measured to observe the salt migration law during evaporation in addition soil moisture migration and water gas phase transition will occur during evaporation and the pore structure will also change during this process salt in saline soil will make this process more complex and salt crystallization will become part of the soil skeleton and affect the size and distribution of pores therefore it is necessary to observe and analyse the microstructure of saline soil to more comprehensively understand the influence of evaporation on saline soil after the evaporation test sem tests were performed on soil samples of different heights before the sem test the soil sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze dried after that the soil sample was treated by conductive coating and was observed at 800 and 2000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface phenomenon in the evaporation process the increasing temperature causes the liquid water in the soil to transform into water vapour under these conditions the surface of the soil column cracks which is subjected to the loss of water and the effect of capillary force wang et al 2018 it should be noted that in case a to better observe salt precipitation on the soil column surface the infrared light was temporarily turned off when taking photos and the infrared light was turned on immediately after shooting to avoid the influence on the test the surface changes of the soil columns during evaporation are shown in fig 5 it can be seen in fig 5 a that the cracks occur around the soil columns in a ring shape because the container wall is fixed and the topsoil shrinks radially during evaporation the cracks grew very fast during the first four days and then slowed down the cracks on the 4th day were no different from those on the 11th day which indicates that the evaporation at the top surface of the soil columns was about to stop on the 4th day and the evaporation front shifted downwards from the soil atmosphere interface on the 11th day some white spots can be seen on the surface of some soil columns especially in soil columns with a high salt content in the early stage of evaporation a water vapour phase transition occurs at the soil surface when the surface water content gradually decreases the water in deep soil carries salt to the surface and finally crystallizes on the surface due to evaporation chen 1992 shimojima et al 1996 however the difference in the salt content of the soil columns a1 a5 does not make a great difference in surface development in soil with a high salt content the interaction of salt ions and water molecules hinders water migration the evaporation rate becomes slow and crack growth becomes slow however this phenomenon is difficult to observe due to the low salt content in all test groups the different evaporation conditions of b1 b5 are shown in table 3 similarly in the early stage of evaporation the cracks also grow fast the crack growth speed is significantly affected by the changing rate of the water content under the irradiation of high temperature the cracks of b2 grow earlier and faster high temperature leads to the rapid vaporization of soil surface water the difference in water content between the top and middle layers is also increased so the tensile stress in the soil also increases resulting in the formation of cracks jenkins 2005 morris et al 1992 tang et al 2011b the higher the atmospheric temperature is the faster the cracks grow compared with b1 and b3 the influence of the initial water content on crack growth can be obtained the initial water content of b3 is 35 it is obvious that the crack of b3 grows faster and wider than that of b1 and the soil with a high moisture content has more water in the pores under evaporation the tension of water on soil particles is greater resulting in a greater tensile stress the other phenomena are similar to those in test group a 3 2 temperature profile in the evaporation process the temperature humidity probes were placed at different heights to observe the change in the temperature profile and water profile in the soil columns in the test group a1 a5 the change in temperature at different heights with evaporation time was obtained and is shown in fig 6 before the evaporation test the temperature in each soil column was in the range of 19 21 c and the average temperature in the soil column was 20 2 c which is close to room temperature in addition the temperature at the bottom is higher than that at the top in some soil columns such as a1 a4 and a5 because there is a plexiglas plate 2 cm thick at the bottom which can inhibit energy exchange to a certain extent on the other hand the top of the soil column is open which is conducive to heat exchange after irradiation for one day the temperature in the soil column increases significantly and forms a temperature gradient in the vertical direction as shown in fig 6 the maximum temperature of the soil column is the highest 39 c on the first day and the bottom has the lowest temperature 24 3 c the overall temperature of the soil columns slowly increases with the radiation time and the temperature gradient gradually decreases in the upper surface of the soil column the surface soil layer can absorb a large amount of heat from the atmosphere so the temperature rises rapidly at the bottom due to the low environmental temperature heat is lost from the soil column resulting in a lower temperature this is why a temperature difference exists along the vertical direction in the soil column overall the temperature of the soil columns increased gradually with increasing irradiation time among which the change was the fastest in the first three days and then slowed finally the atmospheric temperature at the top surface of the soil column was approximately 45 c and stabilized at the early stage of the test free water gradually decreases under evaporation and the proportion of bound water gradually increases there are many negative charges on the surface of clay which can adsorb a large amount of bound water compared with free water bound water gasification requires more energy tang et al 1987 which is why the evaporation rate slows down after three days in addition with the decrease in water content in the superficial soil layer the contact between the atmosphere and water is transformed into contact between the atmosphere and soil particles lin et al 2021 thus a large amount of heat enters the soil particles and leads to an increase in temperature the soil surface becomes dry as cracks grow and the evaporation front moves downwards the heat transfer efficiency decreases the heat exchange between the environment and the soil tends to be stable and evaporation slows in addition fig 6 shows that the temperature at the top surface was more than the atmospheric temperature after irradiation for nine days because the soil absorbed heat from the outside continuously the soil column does not keep warming up but forms a balance with the atmosphere and stays in a certain temperature range in the early stage of the evaporation test heat accumulation will accelerate the evaporation of the soil column surface and accelerate the growth of cracks hillel 2004 at this time large amounts of water and salt are transported upwards when the surface soil becomes dry water vapour enters the atmosphere and salt remains on the surface of the soil column forming a hard salt shell heat accumulation has a more significant impact on topsoil but has a slight effect on water salt transport in deep soil the thermal energy generated by the infrared lamp is continuously transmitted to the soil column which also provides the driving force for water and salt migration the salt in the soil column will increase the specific heat capacity of the soil so that the soil can absorb more heat in this test the temperature difference caused by the difference in salt content is not obvious the possible reason is that the salt content in the soil column is relatively low so the temperature difference is not significant in addition the temperature humidity probes used in the test have certain errors and the temperature difference caused by a small amount of salt is not obvious in the whole test the temperature changes of b1 b5 during evaporation are shown in fig 7 the influence of the temperature field by the initial water content can be obtained by comparing b1 w 0 25 and b3 w 0 35 the initial water content has a significant influence on the temperature during the first 3 days especially on the first day after irradiation for one day the temperature gradient of b1 is significantly greater than that of b3 in the superficial soil layer there are two reasons why the temperature increase of b3 is lower than that of b1 first because of the high water content the specific heat capacity of the soil is large so the rate of temperature increase is slower under the same heat absorption the second reason is that the surface evaporation in b3 is more intense at the early stage of evaporation due to the high moisture content which consumes a large amount of heat in addition the surface layer of the soil column can obtain more water supply which makes the severe vaporization of the surface layer last for a long time cases b2 and b3 differ in the radiation temperature the temperature gradient provides a driving force for water salt migration water and salt move in response to changes in temperature miyazaki 2006 for the superficial soil layer the temperature gradient in b2 is higher than that in b3 under a high temperature gradient the water in the soil vaporizes rapidly therefore the cracks grow rapidly which destroys the soil structure and increases the contact area between the atmosphere and soil wang et al 2018 so the efficiency of soil absorbing heat energy also increases however due to groundwater supplementation at the bottom the temperature gradient below 13 cm is significantly reduced in addition in this test the salt content and water supplementation had no obvious effect on temperature from the temperature curves of b1 b5 it can be concluded that the main factors affecting the temperature profile in the soil column are the initial moisture content and the atmospheric temperature controlled by the infrared lamp 3 3 relative humidity profile in the process of evaporation the water migrates from bottom to top and the liquid water driven by capillary action moves upwards in the soil column when it is close to the soil surface part of the liquid water changes into gas due to evaporation but the water migration is still dominated by liquid water then the liquid water and vapour water leave the soil together the relative humidity is affected by the temperature and moisture content it can be defined as the mass of water vapour present in the air expressed as a percentage of the mass present in an equal volume of saturated air at the same temperature since it is difficult to monitor soil moisture content in real time the dynamic change in the liquid water content in soil pores is reflected by the relative humidity the value range of the humidity probe is 0 99 when the humidity is 99 the pores in the soil are almost filled with water vapour fig 8 shows the relative humidity changes in the soil columns a1 a5 at different evaporation times the relative humidity was close to 100 before the evaporation test the humidity gradient increased in response to the elapsed time for the superficial soil layer the relative humidity changes dramatically vapour diffusion often occurs in the pores of unsaturated soil in addition the flow velocity is related to the pressure gradient and the diffusivity of the soil and the pressure gradient is influenced by the temperature gradient and soil suction tan et al 2022 teng et al 2019a there is a large temperature gradient in the surface soil layer thus vapour diffusion is very fast which is also the reason for the rapid decrease in relative humidity in the vertical direction the farther away from the upper surface of the soil column the relative humidity in the soil decreases gradually near the surface of the soil column liquid water becomes water vapour under evaporation which makes the surface soil shrink and crack the changing trend of relative humidity is consistent with the development of cracks the relative humidity in the middle of the soil column decreased slowly indicating that the evaporation effect slowed down below the drying layer 14 20 cm the relative humidity at the bottom 0 5 cm has little change meaning that the evaporation effect is weak since there is a water supply channel at the bottom the external water supply maintains the relative humidity at the bottom of the soil column at the initial state in addition comparing a1 a5 the effect of the water profile by different salt contents can be obtained with the increase in the salt content of the soil column the change in relative humidity is more obvious at the top 15 20 cm in soil with a high salt content such as a4 and a5 the relative humidity at the top decreased significantly and the relative humidity curves had an inflexion point which also indicates that evaporation is most intense above 15 cm below 13 cm the temperature of the soil column is low and it cannot provide sufficient energy for the migration of liquid water and vapour so the relative humidity is high the changing trend of the relative humidity curves was different from that of temperature in the temperature curve the temperature change is very slow after three days of irradiation however during the whole test the relative humidity decreased rapidly in the first three days and decreased evenly after three days this is because water migration is slower than heat migration compared with heat migration water migration will lag to some extent in addition relative humidity is not a direct index for soil moisture content but a parameter affected by temperature pressure and water content the change in relative humidity can only indirectly reflect the dynamic change in moisture under evaporation the relative humidity of b1 b5 is shown in fig 9 comparing b1 w0 25 with b3 w0 35 the relative humidity of b3 is 36 after irradiation for 11 days but that of b1 is only 10 in addition the change in relative humidity decreased rapidly on the first day of b1 as shown in fig 9 a the inflexion point can be found easily in the red curve and the reason is that soil with a low moisture content easily cracks due to water loss in the early stage the crack growth will increase the contact area between the soil surface and atmosphere thus the evaporation rate is further accelerated comparing b2 irradiation temperature of 55 c with b3 irradiation temperature of 45 c the relative humidity of b2 is significantly lower than that of b3 in b2 the soil column evaporates rapidly at high temperatures especially at the top of the column driven by high temperature heat water salt transport destroyed the soil structure and opened the channel of water vapour convection so the relative humidity at the top of b2 was very low at 15 20 cm the soil is dry and water is mainly transported in the gas state at 13 15 cm the liquid vapour phase transition mostly occurs here and this area can be considered the evaporation front below 13 cm water in the soil migrates mainly as a liquid when the water movement in soil is dominated by liquid water this state can ensure the water flow continuity in the soil profile and drive the evaporation process when the water movement in the soil is dominated by water vapour it will reduce the water conductivity and weaken the water immigration capacity resulting in a low water content at the top of the soil column thus it is not conducive to evaporation compared with b3 b5 has no groundwater supply fig 9 e shows that the relative humidity of b3 is very high close to the bottom in the soil column supplied by groundwater at 0 5 cm the relative humidity of b3 changes little with irradiation time but the relative humidity decreases gradually with increasing evaporation time at the top surface however if there is no water supply the overall relative humidity decreases the relative humidity of b5 changed most significantly in the first three days and decreased evenly after three days under groundwater supplementation water will be continuously transported upwards in the superficial soil layer high temperature leads to rapid vaporization the destruction of the soil structure and salt accumulation will hinder water migration and water migration occurs mainly in the vapour state in the wet soil layer the groundwater supply can keep the water salt transport channel from being destroyed shokri et al 2009 therefore in the case of groundwater recharge the lower part of the soil column still maintains high relative humidity gowing et al 2006 pointed out that in the process of evaporation soil surface water will first be lost if there is groundwater supply the evaporation rate will not change however when the water supply is insufficient the soil surface is dry and the evaporation front moves downwards making evaporation slow zhong et al 2006 the temperature gradient at the bottom of the soil column is low therefore driven by temperature and the water vapour pressure difference the water at the bottom of the soil column moves to the evaporation front resulting in a decrease in the relative humidity at the bottom 3 4 water content and ec value the test was stopped after 11 days of evaporation and the water content and ec value were measured the water contents of a1 a5 are shown in fig 10 the variation trends of a1 a5 are similar at 0 13 cm the water content is also high the water content decreases gradually with increasing height in the wet soil layer the higher the soil salt content is the higher the water content is this is because salt ions exist in liquid water which increases the potential energy of liquid water and the dynamic viscosity of water leading to a decrease in flow velocity in addition salt crystallization in the soil blocks some pores making the water transport channel tortuous and hindering the migration of water vapour and solution alizadeh et al 2018 peysson 2012 wen et al 2020 therefore the water holding capacity of the soil is enhanced which is also the reason why the water content of a5 is the highest in the wet soil layer when the height exceeds 13 cm the moisture content of each soil column has an obvious mutation the moisture content decreases sharply and the second mutation occurs at 17 cm it can be concluded that the main occurrence area of the soil column phase transition is 13 17 cm soil salinization must rely on water movement and ec value can reflect the salt content in the soil the ec value of a1 a5 is shown in fig 11 the ec value of a1 is not drawn in fig 11 because the original soil sample contains too little salt so it can be ignored after evaporation the ec value of all soil columns increased indicating that if there is groundwater supply evaporation will bring salt in the groundwater to the soil thereby accelerating salinization all soil column ec profiles exhibit a zig zag pattern due to a water salt transport discontinuity and similar results have been obtained by zhang 2018 li et al 2009 and lai et al 2021 in addition the ec value is lower in the middle part of the soil column and higher at the two ends showing a v shape at 13 cm the ec value is the smallest in the evaporation process water and salt migrate upwards as shown in fig 10 the dry soil layer exists at 13 20 cm and evaporation mainly occurs in this area however the water content at 0 13 cm is still high water salt migration during the evaporation process is a dynamic process in the early stage of evaporation the evaporation front exists at the top surface of the soil column with the loss of water on the surface the water in the middle of the soil column moves upwards and the salt also moves with the water causing a high ec value at the top surface and low ec value in the middle after the middle water is transported upwards the water at the bottom also moves to the middle at the same time the groundwater carrying a large amount of salt enters the soil column but only part of water moves upwards a large amount of the water remains at the bottom of the soil column owing to gravity therefore the ec value at the bottom is higher than that at the middle the difference in ec values in a2 a5 is mainly due to the different salt contents and groundwater supplements which also demonstrates that the salt content of groundwater has a significant influence on soil salinization fig 12 explains the mechanism of soil salinization the high salt content at the top surface is due to the liquid vapour phase transition occurring in the soil surface during evaporation the soluble salt stays at the soil surface and forms salt crystals with water migration and evaporation after the evaporation test white salt crystals can be seen on the surface of the soil column these salt crystals grow in soil pores blocking the water vapour channel and delaying evaporation this is the reason for the high moisture content of soil columns with a high salt content at 0 12 cm cases b1 and b3 differ in the initial water content and the water content and ec curves of b1 and b3 are shown in fig 13 by comparing b1 w 0 25 with b3 w 0 35 there is an obvious difference in the water content below 13 cm above 13 cm the difference in water content between b1 and b3 gradually decreases above 17 cm the water content is basically the same the ec curves are similar to those of test group a in general showing a v shape it can be seen from fig 13 that the ec value of b1 is generally smaller than that of b3 and at 11 13 cm the ec values of the two are similar this may be caused by the difference in water movement speed on the surface of the soil column the rapid decrease in water content causes salt accumulation the initial moisture content of b1 is low so the cumulative process is very short with pores and cracks growing when the water transport channel in b1 is no longer continuous the salt migration gradually stops the water content of b3 is high so when the surface water enters the atmosphere the water in the middle part of the soil column quickly supplements the surface so the surface salt content of b3 is higher than that of b1 water content is correlated with the ec value in the dry soil layer 13 20 cm the lower the moisture content is the higher the ec value is which is caused by the upwards migration of water salt from the middle of the soil column in the wet soil layer 0 13 cm the higher the water content is the higher the ec value is which is because the groundwater supplement has a certain delay and tends to stay at the bottom due to gravity cases b2 and b3 differ in the irradiation temperature fig 14 shows that the influence area is mainly between 11 20 cm the water content of b2 55 c and b3 45 c is basically the same at the top of the soil column 17 20 cm however at 11 17 cm the water content of b2 is significantly higher than that of b3 it can be concluded that a higher temperature will increase the thickness of the dry soil layer in the soil which is similar to the temperature variation at 11 20 cm the ec value of b3 is higher than that of b2 which may be because high temperature leads to a higher water evaporation rate however the water supply from below cannot fully keep up with the evaporation rate of water resulting in the faster formation of a dry soil layer in b2 the dry soil layer hinders water salt migration therefore the salt content in the upper part of b2 is less than that of b3 after forming the dry soil layer the evaporation rate decreases so the salt content in the b2 and b3 soil columns is roughly the same at 0 11 cm compared with b5 b3 has a groundwater supply as shown in fig 15 the water content of b5 decreases b3 has a high water content from 0 11 cm due to the supplementation of groundwater the ec value of b5 at 13 cm is lower than that in other places because the liquid gas phase transition occurs in this place resulting in rapid water migration therefore the salt at 13 cm shifts to the top of the soil column causing a higher ec value at 19 cm in general the water in soil provides a carrier for salt migration so salt migration is dependent on water migration under the condition of groundwater supply due to the temperature gradient and water gradient formed by evaporation on the surface of the soil column the decrease in surface water content will increase the matrix suction so the water at the bottom of the soil column will continuously migrate upwards the salt will also migrate upwards when the soil column surface structure is destroyed the water salt migration gradually stops if there is no groundwater supplement the water salt migration will stop sooner and it is also the reason that the ec value of b5 is smaller than that of b3 fig 16 shows the water content and ec curves of b3 and b4 note that the x axis range in fig 16 is different from the ranges in figs 13 14 and 15 fig 16 shows the overall trend of ec curves of b3 whereas figs 13 14 and 15 represent the local zoomed details of b3 cases b3 and b4 differ in the initial salt content the water content of b4 in the wet soil layer is higher than that of b3 salt accumulates at the top and bottom of the soil column the trends of the water content and salt profiles are similar to those of test group a salt accumulation blocks pores and hinders water heat salt migration therefore below 13 cm the moisture content of b4 is higher than that of b3 3 5 microstructure analysis in the process of evaporation the water gas phase transition and heat water salt migration occur in saline soil which is accompanied by energy absorption and release and changes the soil structure the reasons for the change in soil structure can be summarized into two aspects one is the migration of water and solute in the evaporation process resulting in changes in the soil structure due to the transport of materials second stress and strain may occur in the process of soil absorbing heat which will also lead to changes in the soil pore structure therefore observing the soil structure before and after evaporation can provide a deep understanding of the mechanism of heat water salt migration during evaporation the first sample was taken before the evaporation test after the test the soil samples were taken from 1 11 and 19 cm of b1 for the sem test the test results are shown in fig 17 by comparing the microstructure before and after evaporation it can be seen in fig 17 b that the soil particles are denser than those before the evaporation test there are few floc structures and the particles are obvious when water vaporization occurs from the dry soil surface the drying process accelerates the development of soil suction tang et al 2011a this capillary suction causes soil particles to rearrange and undergo volumetric shrinkage a horizontal tensile stress between soil particles also appears in this process if the tensile stress exceeds the soil tensile strength cracks will appear in the soil these cracks will accelerate the vapour flow rate and accelerate the evaporation process allaire et al 2009 jamieson et al 2002 man et al 2021 this phenomenon can also be seen from the relative humidity profile in the superficial soil layer the relative humidity decreases rapidly causing fast growth of cracks however the relative humidity is almost constant at the bottom of the soil column so there are fewer cracks in this process soil particles squeeze the pores generated by the liquid gas phase transition thereby increasing the soil density in addition because of the sharp decrease in soil moisture content the cementation of soil particles is weakened so the soil particles in fig 7 b are more obvious than those in fig 17 a many salt crystals can be seen on the surface layer because the salt carried by water migrates upwards and separates out at the top surface of the soil column this phenomenon is consistent with the ec profile and the ec value on the soil column surface is very high in the evaporation process the surface water content decreased rapidly so cracks and pores increased rapidly in fig 17 b increasing the contact area between the soil and atmosphere and further promoting evaporation and salt accumulation cracks and pores cut off the water salt transport channel resulting in the evaporation of the soil column surface gradually stopping the evaporation front moves downwards salt crystallization blocked the soil gap and slowed the evaporation rate at the bottom which also explained why the soil moisture content below 13 cm increased with increasing salt content after the evaporation test comparing the microstructures of different heights in the soil column it can be seen that the cementation of the soil structure is denser at 1 11 cm than at 19 cm and it is difficult to find obvious soil particles below 11 cm this is because the soil column below 11 cm still maintains a high moisture content after evaporation and the soil particles have a strong cementation force so the floc structure is retained in addition in the water salt migration process small particles will also migrate and agglomerate with large soil particles to form new structural units water salt migration will strengthen the connection between soil particles and the water film on the surface of soil particles will cement each other and become denser these dense soil structures can well preserve the water salt transport channel and ensure the upwards recharge of groundwater comparing fig 17 b c and d it can be concluded that in the water salt migration process the agglomeration and cementation of soil particles make the pore structure expand to form a larger migration channel the pores in the soil can be observed in fig 17 b in addition we found some salt crystals at 1 cm of the soil column because the salt content at the bottom was relatively high before the sem test the soil sample was vacuum dried resulting in salt separation this phenomenon was also consistent with the ec porfiles of the soil 4 conclusions in this paper the heat water salt migration characteristics of salinized soil during evaporation were studied the influencing factors initial water content salt content atmospheric temperature and groundwater supply on the evaporation process were discussed and analysed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the evaporation process cracks grow on the surface of the soil column a high initial moisture content and high temperature are the main factors affecting the growth of cracks they cause the rapid loss of water so the water gradient also increases resulting in a huge tensile stress in the soil and crack growth on the soil surface these cracks and pores can also be seen in the microstructure 2 thermal energy is absorbed on the soil atmosphere interface and then transmitted downwards the temperature changed quickly in the first three days and then the heating rate slowed down the temperature decreases with depth and the temperature gradient in the dry soil layer is significantly higher than that in the wet soil layer the existence of water increases the specific heat capacity of the soil and the vaporization process consumes a large amount of thermal energy which is the reason for the slow heating rate of soil with a high initial moisture content the crack growth increases the contact area of the soil column in the atmosphere increasing the efficiency of the soil column absorbing thermal energy 3 during evaporation heat water salt migration destroys the soil structure especially on the soil surface the growth of cracks and pores provides channels for water vapour migration so the relative humidity of the soil column surface is low the initial moisture content and atmospheric temperature significantly affect the relative humidity profile however the influence is limited to the surface soil column in addition when there is no groundwater supplement the water at the bottom of the soil column moves to the evaporation front resulting in a decrease in the water content at the bottom 4 in the soil surface layer the temperature gradient of the soil column is large and the growth of cracks and pores will make the phase of liquid water rapidly change into water vapour and enter the atmosphere therefore the surface relative humidity continuously decreases rapidly in deep soil the temperature is low and the temperature gradient is also low water salt transport cannot provide sufficient driving force since the bottom is difficult to directly affect by evaporating the liquid water at the bottom is protected by the soil structure so the bottom maintains a high relative humidity the protection of the soil structure for liquid water at the bottom of the soil column will be weakened without groundwater supply which causes a decrease in relative humidity 5 after the evaporation test the ec profile of the soil column showed a wave distribution due to the asynchronous migration of water and salt in the early stage of evaporation the salt in the middle of the soil column is transported upwards and accumulates at the top which causes a high salt content at the top and soil salinization the formation of salt crystals blocked the pores slowed the evaporation rate at the bottom of the soil column and preserved the flocculent structure at the bottom of the soil column which was also conducive to the further upwards transportation of water salt it can be concluded that groundwater supplements will aggravate soil

3365,evaporation in shallow soil has a great influence on the properties of surface soil therefore under evaporation conditions research on the rule and mechanism of heat water salt migration in surface soil has great significance for engineering geology and environmental science in this study with full consideration of the initial water content salt content atmospheric temperature and groundwater supply a series of indoor evaporation tests were performed on shallow saline soil to observe the heat water salt migration process in addition before and after the evaporation test the soil microstructure at different depths was observed and analysed to explore the influence of heat water salt migration on the soil the results show that during the evaporation process salt carried by water migrates in the soil column and the water vapour phase transition causes salt accumulation which also leads to the electrical conductivity ec profile showing a v shape and the salt content in the middle of the soil column is lower than that in the end in addition high atmospheric temperature significantly reduces the surface water content but alleviates salt accumulation under the condition of groundwater supplementation the salt accumulation in the soil column surface is rapid by observing the microstructure it can be seen that a flocculent structure exists in the soil before evaporation after evaporation the surface microstructure changes significantly and pores and salt crystals can be observed the results provide a reference for understanding heat water salt transport in arid areas keywords soil evaporation bare soil heat water salt migration microstructure 1 introduction strong evaporation occurs in arid and semiarid regions resulting in water shortages and soil salinization which undermines agricultural production and is also detrimental to economic development mosaffa and sepaskhah 2019 evaporation results in a high salt content in the soil surface for a long time forming saline soil that harms agriculture the salt content significantly affects the soil properties according to the technical code for building in saline soil regions gb t50942 2014 when the soluble salt content 0 3 in the soil it can be defined as saline soil in general saline soil has many engineering properties such as salt expandability and thaw collapsibility the distribution of saline soil in arid and semiarid areas is very extensive in china reaching 920 9 104 hm2 accounting for approximately 69 03 of the total saline soil area in china yue et al 2020 the formation of saline soil will inhibit the growth of plants and threaten the sustainable utilization of farmland soil the saline soil in northeast china is widely distributed and the saline soil layer is very thick which seriously restricts the development of the agricultural economy the most important factor affecting soil salinization is evaporation soil evaporation is an important medium for energy exchange and substance exchange between the atmosphere and soil approximately 70 of surface water returns to the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration in arid areas this proportion increases to 90 xie 1990 many scholars have studied soil evaporation the study of soil evaporation begins with the observation of water evaporation subsequently researchers constructed relevant models based on its formation mechanism maintenance conditions and influencing factors such as wind speed temperature and humidity most of these models are used to calculate surface evapotranspiration angus and watts 1984 based on previous studies penman 1948 proposed a relatively rigorous evaporation model based on aerodynamics and the energy balance principle monteith 1957 proposed the penman monteith model with a modification based on the penman model however such models consider more meteorological factors such as solar radiation net radiation albedo wind speed water vapour pressure latitude and longitude many factors affect soil evaporation such as solar radiation humidity in the soil and atmosphere and soil characteristics water in the soil absorbs energy from the sun which changes into water vapour entering the atmosphere high temperature accelerates the transportation of water molecules and causes rapid evaporation according to the characteristics of soil evaporation researchers have carried out many tests on soil evaporation and have proposed three stages in soil evaporation bao et al 2021 fisher 1923 jambhekar et al 2015 lehmann et al 2008 lehmann and or 2009 or et al 2013 shahraeeni and or 2010 teng et al 2021 in the first stage the soil has a high water content and the main factor affecting the evaporation rate is the replenishment of capillary water as long as the water replenishes continuously a high evaporation rate remains this stage is similar to evaporation on the water surface the first stage lasts for a short time when the water content in the soil surface is reduced and hydraulic continuity cannot be maintained it enters the second stage in this stage the porous channel for transporting capillary water is disrupted and water migration in the soil mainly occurs in the form of liquid and vapour evaporation in soil occurs mainly in the second stage in the last stage the evaporation rate is low and it is affected by the vapour transport efficiency in the porous structure of the soil in general evaporation usually occurs on the soil surface with decreasing water content on the surface the evaporation rate will decrease rapidly there is a transition region in the soil it is an evaporation front and the water vapour phase transition mainly occurs in this region gowing et al 2006 in the early period of evaporation the evaporation front is on the interface between the soil and atmosphere with the loss of surface water the evaporation front moves down the soil is dry above the evaporation front and water migrates only in the form of vapour below the evaporation front water migrates in the form of a liquid phase gran et al 2011b in addition evaporation is also affected by the soil structure and particle size the evaporation rate is slower in dense soil than in loose soil which is attributed to fewer voids in dense soil and it is not conducive to heat exchange the soil sample contains a large amount of clay so it has a good water holding capacity which is conducive to observing the water heat migration in soil under evaporation soil evaporation as an important controlling factor of water thermal salt change in arid and semiarid areas has caused serious problems in water resources agriculture and geological disasters teng et al 2019b therefore the study of salt transport is also a concern of researchers nachshon et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b the capillary conduction of liquids was studied by richards 1931 who proposed partial differential equations to study water migration in soil salt movement depends on water movement so research on salt movement is usually carried out with water migration nielsen et al 1986 studied the interaction between soil and solute and pointed out that the convection dispersion effect of soil water was the key to the study of solute transport in addition solute migration will change the properties of soil wan et al 2020 studied the salt crystallization rule and the freezing temperature and water content of soil affected by salt they carried out cooling tests on na2so4 saline soil and obtained the temperature variation law in saline soil the precipitated salt crystals would fill the pore structure of the soil thus changing the physical properties of the soil such as water conductivity and thermal conductivity and affecting the water salt migration of frozen saline soil fujimaki et al 2006 conducted indoor evaporation tests on soil columns containing different solute concentrations improved the volume transfer equation in the evaporation process and evaluated the relationship between salt crust resistance and salt accumulation gran et al 2011a found that during evaporation water vapour moves to both above and below the evaporation front and the salt concentration above the evaporation front is higher than that below in previous studies many scholars only considered a few influencing factors in the study of evaporation and many theoretical models are difficult to use in engineering practice and have low applicability for water salt prediction in the field in addition few researchers have studied the microstructure of soil during evaporation through on site monitoring of saline alkali soil in cold regions of northeast china zhang et al 2021a established a coupling model to describe the water thermal coupling process in the freezing process and used it to predict the freezing and thawing depth however it can be found that in shallow soil 0 5 m for instance the measured temperature was higher than the simulated temperature one of the reasons may be soil evaporation caused by solar radiation which limits the applicability of the coupling model above 0 5 m therefore in shallow soil the effects of evaporation salt content and other factors on bare soil should be considered in this study an indoor evaporation test was employed to simulate the evaporation process in shallow soil and various influencing factors such as initial moisture content salt content atmospheric temperature groundwater supply etc on heat water salt migration in the evaporation process were considered in addition the soil structure before and after evaporation was analysed and compared by scanning electron microscopy sem and the heat water salt migration mechanism in the evaporation process was deeply explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of soil features in this evaporation model test soil samples were taken from a site located in shanghai china the region has a subtropical marine monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 15 22 c and the maximum and minimum temperatures are 35 c and 7 c respectively the soil sample was located below the miscellaneous fill layer approximately 2 2 3 m from the surface it is yellowish brown in colour and has no plant roots inside the grain size composition of the soil samples is similar to that of saline soil in northeast china in addition a series of tests were carried out to measure the physical and chemical properties first the soil sample needs to be dried drying soil using an oven will separate the bound water in the mineral such as zeolite water tang et al 1987 resulting in a change in the mineral properties of the soil sample in addition if the drying temperature is too high some organic matter of soil sample will be removed which influences the heat water salt migration therefore the soil sample was treated by natural air drying after which the soil sample was crushed by a crusher the basic properties of the soil were measured according to the standard for geotechnical test methods gb t50123 2019 the soil moisture content was measured by drying the soil at 105 c for 12 h the liquid limit and plastic limit were measured by a gys 2 photoelectric type liquid plastic limit tester the basic physical and chemical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 below the natural water content of the soil samples is 23 42 and the water content after natural air drying is 3 18 3 25 after air drying the soil samples became significantly hard the permeability coefficient of the soil sample is 7 17 10 8 cm s which is suitable for studying water migration in soil in addition the particle size of the soil sample was measured by the sieving method and gravimetric method and the results are shown in table 2 table 2 shows that the content of the clay group 0 0 005 mm is the highest accounting for 50 32 the second highest is the silty group 0 005 0 075 mm the proportion of soil particles less than 0 075 mm is 92 07 indicating that the soil particles mainly included silt and clay belonging to silty clay and the permeability of silt and clay is poor previous studies have confirmed that the pore channels of clay have many advantages such as good connectivity high capillary water rising height good water holding capacity and sensitivity to water aggregation for studying water migration zhang et al 2019 x ray diffraction xrd was used to analyse the mineral composition of the soil samples and the results are shown in fig 1 fig 1 shows that the relative contents of mineral components in the soil samples are albite 52 4 illite 27 4 quartz 13 2 and kaolinite 7 albite and quartz are primary minerals with stable chemical properties and they play an important role in the composition of the soil skeleton structure illite and kaolinite are secondary minerals and the particle size is small they are also considered clay minerals the relative content of illite and kaolinite in the soil is 34 4 which makes the soil have poor permeability and good water holding capacity in addition montmorillonite is not found in the xrd test indicating that soil expansion is small 2 2 preparation of saline soil there are many kinds of salt in natural saline soil different kinds of salt will affect each other which is not conducive to analysing the influence of a single factor on water heat salt migration therefore the saline soil used in this test was made artificially the salt solution was uniformly added to the soil particles after mixing it was allowed to stand for 48 h currently research on saline soil mainly focuses on chloride saline soil and sulfate saline soil however research on carbonate saline soil is rare therefore in this paper saline soil prepared from raw soil samples and na2co3 was used to explore the salt migration law during evaporation in this study a conductivity meter was used to measure the ec value of the original soil sample ec value was used to evaluate the salt content in the soil and a high ec value means that the soil sample has a high soluble salt content fig 2 illustrates the relationship between the ec value and salt solution concentration the saline soil specimen studied in this test is remoulded manually and the salt content in the original soil sample has a significant influence on the test results therefore it is necessary to measure the ec value of the original soil to determine if it is necessary to remove initial salt from the soil before the soil sample remoulding process according to the soil quality determination for conductivity electrode method hj802 2016 the soil and water were fully mixed at a ratio of 1 5 and filtered after mixing the solid and solution of the mixture were separated by a filtration test and the ec value of the solution was measured by a conductivity meter the ec value of the original soil sample was 8 17 us cm therefore the original soil sample can be considered to contain no soluble salt the saline soil in this test was prepared by fully mixing different concentrations of na2co3 solution with original soil samples 2 3 test apparatus and procedure the factors affecting the heat water salt migration of saline soil mainly include external factors such as load temperature humidity wind speed rainfall and groundwater level and internal factors such as soil particle size composition salt content and initial moisture content therefore this test studied the influence of different factors on water heat salt migration including salt content water content temperature and groundwater supply the evaporation test case design is shown in table 3 w 0 represents the initial moisture content of the soil θ c represents the ratio of salt mass to dry soil mass in this indoor model evaporation test five soil columns can be evaporated simultaneously and labels a and b represent two different evaporation groups cases a1 a5 differ in the salt content cases b1 and b3 differ in the initial water content cases b2 and b3 differ in atmospheric temperature cases b3 and b5 differ in groundwater supplement cases b3 and b4 differ in the salt content this indoor evaporation test was conducted using a test setup designed and assembled by ourselves as shown in fig 3 the test setup mainly consists of a heating system an evaporation container a data monitoring system and a water supply system the container for filling the soil samples is made of plexiglas and the top is open there is a hole at the bottom of the container to simulate the groundwater supply filter paper is placed at the bottom of the soil column to prevent soil particles from blocking the pipe the plexiglas container is cylindrical 15 5 cm in diameter and 20 cm in height and the bottom of the container is supported by a steel bracket temperature humidity probes were mainly used for data acquisition which can simultaneously measure the temperature and relative humidity profiles inside the soil the positions of the probes are 1 cm 5 cm 8 cm 11 cm 13 cm 15 cm 17 cm and 19 cm above the bottom of the soil since the probe also occupies a certain space to reduce the interference of the probe on soil evaporation the number of probes at the bottom of the soil column is reduced the plexiglas containers are covered with insulation to avoid heat exchange on the sides of the soil column the water supply system uses a cup with a volume of 50 ml and the bottom of the cup is connected to the bottom of the plexiglas container through a catheter in addition the water surface in the cup is at the same horizontal line as the bottom of the soil column it is worth noting that the heating system uses a 250 w infrared lamp philips br125 to provide a stable heat source the light emitted by the infrared lamp has a good heating effect many scholars use an infrared lamp in simulating evaporation gran et al 2011b zhou et al 2020 since this test requires a continuous light and stable atmospheric temperature the method described in fig 4 was used to measure the atmospheric temperature at different positions fig 4 shows that within 44 cm of the infrared lamp irradiation has a significant impact on temperature and the temperature curve can be considered a linear change when the distance is more than 44 cm the temperature is 22 23 c and it is in a steady state moreover after 20 min of irradiation the atmospheric temperature did not change significantly compared with that after 60 min of irradiation and it can be considered that the light condition was stable because this test was carried out in a windless indoor environment the influence of airflow on evaporation efficiency was not considered in the evaporation test the macroscopic changes in the soil columns were observed and temperature humidity probes were used to observe the changes in the temperature field and moisture field with time after the evaporation test the ec values of the soil samples at different heights were measured to observe the salt migration law during evaporation in addition soil moisture migration and water gas phase transition will occur during evaporation and the pore structure will also change during this process salt in saline soil will make this process more complex and salt crystallization will become part of the soil skeleton and affect the size and distribution of pores therefore it is necessary to observe and analyse the microstructure of saline soil to more comprehensively understand the influence of evaporation on saline soil after the evaporation test sem tests were performed on soil samples of different heights before the sem test the soil sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze dried after that the soil sample was treated by conductive coating and was observed at 800 and 2000 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface phenomenon in the evaporation process the increasing temperature causes the liquid water in the soil to transform into water vapour under these conditions the surface of the soil column cracks which is subjected to the loss of water and the effect of capillary force wang et al 2018 it should be noted that in case a to better observe salt precipitation on the soil column surface the infrared light was temporarily turned off when taking photos and the infrared light was turned on immediately after shooting to avoid the influence on the test the surface changes of the soil columns during evaporation are shown in fig 5 it can be seen in fig 5 a that the cracks occur around the soil columns in a ring shape because the container wall is fixed and the topsoil shrinks radially during evaporation the cracks grew very fast during the first four days and then slowed down the cracks on the 4th day were no different from those on the 11th day which indicates that the evaporation at the top surface of the soil columns was about to stop on the 4th day and the evaporation front shifted downwards from the soil atmosphere interface on the 11th day some white spots can be seen on the surface of some soil columns especially in soil columns with a high salt content in the early stage of evaporation a water vapour phase transition occurs at the soil surface when the surface water content gradually decreases the water in deep soil carries salt to the surface and finally crystallizes on the surface due to evaporation chen 1992 shimojima et al 1996 however the difference in the salt content of the soil columns a1 a5 does not make a great difference in surface development in soil with a high salt content the interaction of salt ions and water molecules hinders water migration the evaporation rate becomes slow and crack growth becomes slow however this phenomenon is difficult to observe due to the low salt content in all test groups the different evaporation conditions of b1 b5 are shown in table 3 similarly in the early stage of evaporation the cracks also grow fast the crack growth speed is significantly affected by the changing rate of the water content under the irradiation of high temperature the cracks of b2 grow earlier and faster high temperature leads to the rapid vaporization of soil surface water the difference in water content between the top and middle layers is also increased so the tensile stress in the soil also increases resulting in the formation of cracks jenkins 2005 morris et al 1992 tang et al 2011b the higher the atmospheric temperature is the faster the cracks grow compared with b1 and b3 the influence of the initial water content on crack growth can be obtained the initial water content of b3 is 35 it is obvious that the crack of b3 grows faster and wider than that of b1 and the soil with a high moisture content has more water in the pores under evaporation the tension of water on soil particles is greater resulting in a greater tensile stress the other phenomena are similar to those in test group a 3 2 temperature profile in the evaporation process the temperature humidity probes were placed at different heights to observe the change in the temperature profile and water profile in the soil columns in the test group a1 a5 the change in temperature at different heights with evaporation time was obtained and is shown in fig 6 before the evaporation test the temperature in each soil column was in the range of 19 21 c and the average temperature in the soil column was 20 2 c which is close to room temperature in addition the temperature at the bottom is higher than that at the top in some soil columns such as a1 a4 and a5 because there is a plexiglas plate 2 cm thick at the bottom which can inhibit energy exchange to a certain extent on the other hand the top of the soil column is open which is conducive to heat exchange after irradiation for one day the temperature in the soil column increases significantly and forms a temperature gradient in the vertical direction as shown in fig 6 the maximum temperature of the soil column is the highest 39 c on the first day and the bottom has the lowest temperature 24 3 c the overall temperature of the soil columns slowly increases with the radiation time and the temperature gradient gradually decreases in the upper surface of the soil column the surface soil layer can absorb a large amount of heat from the atmosphere so the temperature rises rapidly at the bottom due to the low environmental temperature heat is lost from the soil column resulting in a lower temperature this is why a temperature difference exists along the vertical direction in the soil column overall the temperature of the soil columns increased gradually with increasing irradiation time among which the change was the fastest in the first three days and then slowed finally the atmospheric temperature at the top surface of the soil column was approximately 45 c and stabilized at the early stage of the test free water gradually decreases under evaporation and the proportion of bound water gradually increases there are many negative charges on the surface of clay which can adsorb a large amount of bound water compared with free water bound water gasification requires more energy tang et al 1987 which is why the evaporation rate slows down after three days in addition with the decrease in water content in the superficial soil layer the contact between the atmosphere and water is transformed into contact between the atmosphere and soil particles lin et al 2021 thus a large amount of heat enters the soil particles and leads to an increase in temperature the soil surface becomes dry as cracks grow and the evaporation front moves downwards the heat transfer efficiency decreases the heat exchange between the environment and the soil tends to be stable and evaporation slows in addition fig 6 shows that the temperature at the top surface was more than the atmospheric temperature after irradiation for nine days because the soil absorbed heat from the outside continuously the soil column does not keep warming up but forms a balance with the atmosphere and stays in a certain temperature range in the early stage of the evaporation test heat accumulation will accelerate the evaporation of the soil column surface and accelerate the growth of cracks hillel 2004 at this time large amounts of water and salt are transported upwards when the surface soil becomes dry water vapour enters the atmosphere and salt remains on the surface of the soil column forming a hard salt shell heat accumulation has a more significant impact on topsoil but has a slight effect on water salt transport in deep soil the thermal energy generated by the infrared lamp is continuously transmitted to the soil column which also provides the driving force for water and salt migration the salt in the soil column will increase the specific heat capacity of the soil so that the soil can absorb more heat in this test the temperature difference caused by the difference in salt content is not obvious the possible reason is that the salt content in the soil column is relatively low so the temperature difference is not significant in addition the temperature humidity probes used in the test have certain errors and the temperature difference caused by a small amount of salt is not obvious in the whole test the temperature changes of b1 b5 during evaporation are shown in fig 7 the influence of the temperature field by the initial water content can be obtained by comparing b1 w 0 25 and b3 w 0 35 the initial water content has a significant influence on the temperature during the first 3 days especially on the first day after irradiation for one day the temperature gradient of b1 is significantly greater than that of b3 in the superficial soil layer there are two reasons why the temperature increase of b3 is lower than that of b1 first because of the high water content the specific heat capacity of the soil is large so the rate of temperature increase is slower under the same heat absorption the second reason is that the surface evaporation in b3 is more intense at the early stage of evaporation due to the high moisture content which consumes a large amount of heat in addition the surface layer of the soil column can obtain more water supply which makes the severe vaporization of the surface layer last for a long time cases b2 and b3 differ in the radiation temperature the temperature gradient provides a driving force for water salt migration water and salt move in response to changes in temperature miyazaki 2006 for the superficial soil layer the temperature gradient in b2 is higher than that in b3 under a high temperature gradient the water in the soil vaporizes rapidly therefore the cracks grow rapidly which destroys the soil structure and increases the contact area between the atmosphere and soil wang et al 2018 so the efficiency of soil absorbing heat energy also increases however due to groundwater supplementation at the bottom the temperature gradient below 13 cm is significantly reduced in addition in this test the salt content and water supplementation had no obvious effect on temperature from the temperature curves of b1 b5 it can be concluded that the main factors affecting the temperature profile in the soil column are the initial moisture content and the atmospheric temperature controlled by the infrared lamp 3 3 relative humidity profile in the process of evaporation the water migrates from bottom to top and the liquid water driven by capillary action moves upwards in the soil column when it is close to the soil surface part of the liquid water changes into gas due to evaporation but the water migration is still dominated by liquid water then the liquid water and vapour water leave the soil together the relative humidity is affected by the temperature and moisture content it can be defined as the mass of water vapour present in the air expressed as a percentage of the mass present in an equal volume of saturated air at the same temperature since it is difficult to monitor soil moisture content in real time the dynamic change in the liquid water content in soil pores is reflected by the relative humidity the value range of the humidity probe is 0 99 when the humidity is 99 the pores in the soil are almost filled with water vapour fig 8 shows the relative humidity changes in the soil columns a1 a5 at different evaporation times the relative humidity was close to 100 before the evaporation test the humidity gradient increased in response to the elapsed time for the superficial soil layer the relative humidity changes dramatically vapour diffusion often occurs in the pores of unsaturated soil in addition the flow velocity is related to the pressure gradient and the diffusivity of the soil and the pressure gradient is influenced by the temperature gradient and soil suction tan et al 2022 teng et al 2019a there is a large temperature gradient in the surface soil layer thus vapour diffusion is very fast which is also the reason for the rapid decrease in relative humidity in the vertical direction the farther away from the upper surface of the soil column the relative humidity in the soil decreases gradually near the surface of the soil column liquid water becomes water vapour under evaporation which makes the surface soil shrink and crack the changing trend of relative humidity is consistent with the development of cracks the relative humidity in the middle of the soil column decreased slowly indicating that the evaporation effect slowed down below the drying layer 14 20 cm the relative humidity at the bottom 0 5 cm has little change meaning that the evaporation effect is weak since there is a water supply channel at the bottom the external water supply maintains the relative humidity at the bottom of the soil column at the initial state in addition comparing a1 a5 the effect of the water profile by different salt contents can be obtained with the increase in the salt content of the soil column the change in relative humidity is more obvious at the top 15 20 cm in soil with a high salt content such as a4 and a5 the relative humidity at the top decreased significantly and the relative humidity curves had an inflexion point which also indicates that evaporation is most intense above 15 cm below 13 cm the temperature of the soil column is low and it cannot provide sufficient energy for the migration of liquid water and vapour so the relative humidity is high the changing trend of the relative humidity curves was different from that of temperature in the temperature curve the temperature change is very slow after three days of irradiation however during the whole test the relative humidity decreased rapidly in the first three days and decreased evenly after three days this is because water migration is slower than heat migration compared with heat migration water migration will lag to some extent in addition relative humidity is not a direct index for soil moisture content but a parameter affected by temperature pressure and water content the change in relative humidity can only indirectly reflect the dynamic change in moisture under evaporation the relative humidity of b1 b5 is shown in fig 9 comparing b1 w0 25 with b3 w0 35 the relative humidity of b3 is 36 after irradiation for 11 days but that of b1 is only 10 in addition the change in relative humidity decreased rapidly on the first day of b1 as shown in fig 9 a the inflexion point can be found easily in the red curve and the reason is that soil with a low moisture content easily cracks due to water loss in the early stage the crack growth will increase the contact area between the soil surface and atmosphere thus the evaporation rate is further accelerated comparing b2 irradiation temperature of 55 c with b3 irradiation temperature of 45 c the relative humidity of b2 is significantly lower than that of b3 in b2 the soil column evaporates rapidly at high temperatures especially at the top of the column driven by high temperature heat water salt transport destroyed the soil structure and opened the channel of water vapour convection so the relative humidity at the top of b2 was very low at 15 20 cm the soil is dry and water is mainly transported in the gas state at 13 15 cm the liquid vapour phase transition mostly occurs here and this area can be considered the evaporation front below 13 cm water in the soil migrates mainly as a liquid when the water movement in soil is dominated by liquid water this state can ensure the water flow continuity in the soil profile and drive the evaporation process when the water movement in the soil is dominated by water vapour it will reduce the water conductivity and weaken the water immigration capacity resulting in a low water content at the top of the soil column thus it is not conducive to evaporation compared with b3 b5 has no groundwater supply fig 9 e shows that the relative humidity of b3 is very high close to the bottom in the soil column supplied by groundwater at 0 5 cm the relative humidity of b3 changes little with irradiation time but the relative humidity decreases gradually with increasing evaporation time at the top surface however if there is no water supply the overall relative humidity decreases the relative humidity of b5 changed most significantly in the first three days and decreased evenly after three days under groundwater supplementation water will be continuously transported upwards in the superficial soil layer high temperature leads to rapid vaporization the destruction of the soil structure and salt accumulation will hinder water migration and water migration occurs mainly in the vapour state in the wet soil layer the groundwater supply can keep the water salt transport channel from being destroyed shokri et al 2009 therefore in the case of groundwater recharge the lower part of the soil column still maintains high relative humidity gowing et al 2006 pointed out that in the process of evaporation soil surface water will first be lost if there is groundwater supply the evaporation rate will not change however when the water supply is insufficient the soil surface is dry and the evaporation front moves downwards making evaporation slow zhong et al 2006 the temperature gradient at the bottom of the soil column is low therefore driven by temperature and the water vapour pressure difference the water at the bottom of the soil column moves to the evaporation front resulting in a decrease in the relative humidity at the bottom 3 4 water content and ec value the test was stopped after 11 days of evaporation and the water content and ec value were measured the water contents of a1 a5 are shown in fig 10 the variation trends of a1 a5 are similar at 0 13 cm the water content is also high the water content decreases gradually with increasing height in the wet soil layer the higher the soil salt content is the higher the water content is this is because salt ions exist in liquid water which increases the potential energy of liquid water and the dynamic viscosity of water leading to a decrease in flow velocity in addition salt crystallization in the soil blocks some pores making the water transport channel tortuous and hindering the migration of water vapour and solution alizadeh et al 2018 peysson 2012 wen et al 2020 therefore the water holding capacity of the soil is enhanced which is also the reason why the water content of a5 is the highest in the wet soil layer when the height exceeds 13 cm the moisture content of each soil column has an obvious mutation the moisture content decreases sharply and the second mutation occurs at 17 cm it can be concluded that the main occurrence area of the soil column phase transition is 13 17 cm soil salinization must rely on water movement and ec value can reflect the salt content in the soil the ec value of a1 a5 is shown in fig 11 the ec value of a1 is not drawn in fig 11 because the original soil sample contains too little salt so it can be ignored after evaporation the ec value of all soil columns increased indicating that if there is groundwater supply evaporation will bring salt in the groundwater to the soil thereby accelerating salinization all soil column ec profiles exhibit a zig zag pattern due to a water salt transport discontinuity and similar results have been obtained by zhang 2018 li et al 2009 and lai et al 2021 in addition the ec value is lower in the middle part of the soil column and higher at the two ends showing a v shape at 13 cm the ec value is the smallest in the evaporation process water and salt migrate upwards as shown in fig 10 the dry soil layer exists at 13 20 cm and evaporation mainly occurs in this area however the water content at 0 13 cm is still high water salt migration during the evaporation process is a dynamic process in the early stage of evaporation the evaporation front exists at the top surface of the soil column with the loss of water on the surface the water in the middle of the soil column moves upwards and the salt also moves with the water causing a high ec value at the top surface and low ec value in the middle after the middle water is transported upwards the water at the bottom also moves to the middle at the same time the groundwater carrying a large amount of salt enters the soil column but only part of water moves upwards a large amount of the water remains at the bottom of the soil column owing to gravity therefore the ec value at the bottom is higher than that at the middle the difference in ec values in a2 a5 is mainly due to the different salt contents and groundwater supplements which also demonstrates that the salt content of groundwater has a significant influence on soil salinization fig 12 explains the mechanism of soil salinization the high salt content at the top surface is due to the liquid vapour phase transition occurring in the soil surface during evaporation the soluble salt stays at the soil surface and forms salt crystals with water migration and evaporation after the evaporation test white salt crystals can be seen on the surface of the soil column these salt crystals grow in soil pores blocking the water vapour channel and delaying evaporation this is the reason for the high moisture content of soil columns with a high salt content at 0 12 cm cases b1 and b3 differ in the initial water content and the water content and ec curves of b1 and b3 are shown in fig 13 by comparing b1 w 0 25 with b3 w 0 35 there is an obvious difference in the water content below 13 cm above 13 cm the difference in water content between b1 and b3 gradually decreases above 17 cm the water content is basically the same the ec curves are similar to those of test group a in general showing a v shape it can be seen from fig 13 that the ec value of b1 is generally smaller than that of b3 and at 11 13 cm the ec values of the two are similar this may be caused by the difference in water movement speed on the surface of the soil column the rapid decrease in water content causes salt accumulation the initial moisture content of b1 is low so the cumulative process is very short with pores and cracks growing when the water transport channel in b1 is no longer continuous the salt migration gradually stops the water content of b3 is high so when the surface water enters the atmosphere the water in the middle part of the soil column quickly supplements the surface so the surface salt content of b3 is higher than that of b1 water content is correlated with the ec value in the dry soil layer 13 20 cm the lower the moisture content is the higher the ec value is which is caused by the upwards migration of water salt from the middle of the soil column in the wet soil layer 0 13 cm the higher the water content is the higher the ec value is which is because the groundwater supplement has a certain delay and tends to stay at the bottom due to gravity cases b2 and b3 differ in the irradiation temperature fig 14 shows that the influence area is mainly between 11 20 cm the water content of b2 55 c and b3 45 c is basically the same at the top of the soil column 17 20 cm however at 11 17 cm the water content of b2 is significantly higher than that of b3 it can be concluded that a higher temperature will increase the thickness of the dry soil layer in the soil which is similar to the temperature variation at 11 20 cm the ec value of b3 is higher than that of b2 which may be because high temperature leads to a higher water evaporation rate however the water supply from below cannot fully keep up with the evaporation rate of water resulting in the faster formation of a dry soil layer in b2 the dry soil layer hinders water salt migration therefore the salt content in the upper part of b2 is less than that of b3 after forming the dry soil layer the evaporation rate decreases so the salt content in the b2 and b3 soil columns is roughly the same at 0 11 cm compared with b5 b3 has a groundwater supply as shown in fig 15 the water content of b5 decreases b3 has a high water content from 0 11 cm due to the supplementation of groundwater the ec value of b5 at 13 cm is lower than that in other places because the liquid gas phase transition occurs in this place resulting in rapid water migration therefore the salt at 13 cm shifts to the top of the soil column causing a higher ec value at 19 cm in general the water in soil provides a carrier for salt migration so salt migration is dependent on water migration under the condition of groundwater supply due to the temperature gradient and water gradient formed by evaporation on the surface of the soil column the decrease in surface water content will increase the matrix suction so the water at the bottom of the soil column will continuously migrate upwards the salt will also migrate upwards when the soil column surface structure is destroyed the water salt migration gradually stops if there is no groundwater supplement the water salt migration will stop sooner and it is also the reason that the ec value of b5 is smaller than that of b3 fig 16 shows the water content and ec curves of b3 and b4 note that the x axis range in fig 16 is different from the ranges in figs 13 14 and 15 fig 16 shows the overall trend of ec curves of b3 whereas figs 13 14 and 15 represent the local zoomed details of b3 cases b3 and b4 differ in the initial salt content the water content of b4 in the wet soil layer is higher than that of b3 salt accumulates at the top and bottom of the soil column the trends of the water content and salt profiles are similar to those of test group a salt accumulation blocks pores and hinders water heat salt migration therefore below 13 cm the moisture content of b4 is higher than that of b3 3 5 microstructure analysis in the process of evaporation the water gas phase transition and heat water salt migration occur in saline soil which is accompanied by energy absorption and release and changes the soil structure the reasons for the change in soil structure can be summarized into two aspects one is the migration of water and solute in the evaporation process resulting in changes in the soil structure due to the transport of materials second stress and strain may occur in the process of soil absorbing heat which will also lead to changes in the soil pore structure therefore observing the soil structure before and after evaporation can provide a deep understanding of the mechanism of heat water salt migration during evaporation the first sample was taken before the evaporation test after the test the soil samples were taken from 1 11 and 19 cm of b1 for the sem test the test results are shown in fig 17 by comparing the microstructure before and after evaporation it can be seen in fig 17 b that the soil particles are denser than those before the evaporation test there are few floc structures and the particles are obvious when water vaporization occurs from the dry soil surface the drying process accelerates the development of soil suction tang et al 2011a this capillary suction causes soil particles to rearrange and undergo volumetric shrinkage a horizontal tensile stress between soil particles also appears in this process if the tensile stress exceeds the soil tensile strength cracks will appear in the soil these cracks will accelerate the vapour flow rate and accelerate the evaporation process allaire et al 2009 jamieson et al 2002 man et al 2021 this phenomenon can also be seen from the relative humidity profile in the superficial soil layer the relative humidity decreases rapidly causing fast growth of cracks however the relative humidity is almost constant at the bottom of the soil column so there are fewer cracks in this process soil particles squeeze the pores generated by the liquid gas phase transition thereby increasing the soil density in addition because of the sharp decrease in soil moisture content the cementation of soil particles is weakened so the soil particles in fig 7 b are more obvious than those in fig 17 a many salt crystals can be seen on the surface layer because the salt carried by water migrates upwards and separates out at the top surface of the soil column this phenomenon is consistent with the ec profile and the ec value on the soil column surface is very high in the evaporation process the surface water content decreased rapidly so cracks and pores increased rapidly in fig 17 b increasing the contact area between the soil and atmosphere and further promoting evaporation and salt accumulation cracks and pores cut off the water salt transport channel resulting in the evaporation of the soil column surface gradually stopping the evaporation front moves downwards salt crystallization blocked the soil gap and slowed the evaporation rate at the bottom which also explained why the soil moisture content below 13 cm increased with increasing salt content after the evaporation test comparing the microstructures of different heights in the soil column it can be seen that the cementation of the soil structure is denser at 1 11 cm than at 19 cm and it is difficult to find obvious soil particles below 11 cm this is because the soil column below 11 cm still maintains a high moisture content after evaporation and the soil particles have a strong cementation force so the floc structure is retained in addition in the water salt migration process small particles will also migrate and agglomerate with large soil particles to form new structural units water salt migration will strengthen the connection between soil particles and the water film on the surface of soil particles will cement each other and become denser these dense soil structures can well preserve the water salt transport channel and ensure the upwards recharge of groundwater comparing fig 17 b c and d it can be concluded that in the water salt migration process the agglomeration and cementation of soil particles make the pore structure expand to form a larger migration channel the pores in the soil can be observed in fig 17 b in addition we found some salt crystals at 1 cm of the soil column because the salt content at the bottom was relatively high before the sem test the soil sample was vacuum dried resulting in salt separation this phenomenon was also consistent with the ec porfiles of the soil 4 conclusions in this paper the heat water salt migration characteristics of salinized soil during evaporation were studied the influencing factors initial water content salt content atmospheric temperature and groundwater supply on the evaporation process were discussed and analysed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the evaporation process cracks grow on the surface of the soil column a high initial moisture content and high temperature are the main factors affecting the growth of cracks they cause the rapid loss of water so the water gradient also increases resulting in a huge tensile stress in the soil and crack growth on the soil surface these cracks and pores can also be seen in the microstructure 2 thermal energy is absorbed on the soil atmosphere interface and then transmitted downwards the temperature changed quickly in the first three days and then the heating rate slowed down the temperature decreases with depth and the temperature gradient in the dry soil layer is significantly higher than that in the wet soil layer the existence of water increases the specific heat capacity of the soil and the vaporization process consumes a large amount of thermal energy which is the reason for the slow heating rate of soil with a high initial moisture content the crack growth increases the contact area of the soil column in the atmosphere increasing the efficiency of the soil column absorbing thermal energy 3 during evaporation heat water salt migration destroys the soil structure especially on the soil surface the growth of cracks and pores provides channels for water vapour migration so the relative humidity of the soil column surface is low the initial moisture content and atmospheric temperature significantly affect the relative humidity profile however the influence is limited to the surface soil column in addition when there is no groundwater supplement the water at the bottom of the soil column moves to the evaporation front resulting in a decrease in the water content at the bottom 4 in the soil surface layer the temperature gradient of the soil column is large and the growth of cracks and pores will make the phase of liquid water rapidly change into water vapour and enter the atmosphere therefore the surface relative humidity continuously decreases rapidly in deep soil the temperature is low and the temperature gradient is also low water salt transport cannot provide sufficient driving force since the bottom is difficult to directly affect by evaporating the liquid water at the bottom is protected by the soil structure so the bottom maintains a high relative humidity the protection of the soil structure for liquid water at the bottom of the soil column will be weakened without groundwater supply which causes a decrease in relative humidity 5 after the evaporation test the ec profile of the soil column showed a wave distribution due to the asynchronous migration of water and salt in the early stage of evaporation the salt in the middle of the soil column is transported upwards and accumulates at the top which causes a high salt content at the top and soil salinization the formation of salt crystals blocked the pores slowed the evaporation rate at the bottom of the soil column and preserved the flocculent structure at the bottom of the soil column which was also conducive to the further upwards transportation of water salt it can be concluded that groundwater supplements will aggravate soil

3366,precipitation plays a significant role in the hydrological cycle and atmospheric circulation however estimating precipitation is a challenging task due to the high spatiotemporal variability of precipitation the development of machine learning has marked a new approach to precipitation estimation in this study a stacking ensemble machine learning model was developed to estimate 6 hour precipitation at a high spatial resolution of 5 km based on himawari 8 and ground stations data over china metrological and topographic factors are considered ancillary data the stacking model consists of two levels three sub models namely extremely randomized trees extreme gradient boosting and deep neural networks were trained respectively in level 1 of the stacking model level 2 linearly combines sub models to achieve the final estimation evaluation results over china indicate that the stacking model outperforms the individual model with a correlation coefficient of 0 630 a mean absolute error of 1 431 mm 6hr and a root mean square error of 4 248 mm 6hr the performance of the proposed model is better than several widely used precipitation products imerg gsmap and era5 in particular the detection rate of heavy precipitation 16 9 mm 6hr in our model with a probability of detection of 0 97 is distinctly superior to that of the other products the precipitation estimations are accumulated and plotted at different temporal scales contrasting with these products the spatial patterns appear to be relatively coincident at annual and daily scales more importantly the spatial patterns of our model are more reliable than those of the products due to its smaller mean bias the study provided a novel alternative for producing improved high resolution precipitation datasets

significant and active variable related to atmospheric circulation fang et al 2019 sun et al 2018 long term precipitation records are essential for climate studies ashouri et al 2015 bhatti et al 2020 while near real time precipitation datasets are necessary for the mitigation of the influence of natural disasters such as floods and landslides arabzadeh et al 2020 atif et al 2020 brocca et al 2019 ground based measurements from traditional gauges and weather radars are considered reliable and highly accurate methods chen et al 2022 ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 shen et al 2021 however their distributions are usually sparse over many regions such as geographically complicated mountain areas chen et al 2022 prigent 2010 sun et al 2018 gauges are also affected by gauge undercatch especially for snowfall ehsani and behrangi 2021 song et al 2021a b radars are limited by lacking accessibility and funding sun et al 2018 and may suffer from contamination of ground clutter battaglia and panegrossi 2020 ehsani et al 2021a smalley et al 2017 by contrast remote sensing techniques provide more spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous measurements michaelides et al 2009 sun et al 2018 yang and luo 2014 the retrieval methods of precipitation can be classified into three main types visible infrared vis ir active or passive microwave pmw and multi sensor joint retrieval methods hu et al 2019 kidd and levizzani 2011 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 vis and ir sensors onboard geostationary satellites have the superiority of relatively high spatiotemporal resolution but have restricted accuracy due to the indirect relationship between cloud top brightness temperature tbb and surface rain rates ehsani et al 2021a kidd and levizzani 2011 min et al 2018 thies et al 2008 compared with ir microwaves are more sensitive to the precipitation particles thus they get more accurate estimates hou et al 2014 wang et al 2021a however active microwave sensors also known as precipitation radars and pmw sensors are only accessible for low orbits leading to poor temporal sampling hou et al 2014 prigent 2010 sun et al 2018 besides pmw based methods provide less accuracy than precipitation radars and present poor performance over snow and ice surfaces adhikari et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021a to further study climate change and hydrological prediction blooming products have been created to acquire more accurate estimates with a high spatiotemporal resolution by combining multiple sensors such as tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation

al 2018 wang et al 2021b wang et al 2020 xue et al 2021 min et al 2018 combined infrared brightness temperature from himawari 8 with numerical weather prediction data and developed an rf based model to estimate precipitation wang et al 2020 xue et al 2021 used a two module frame the first one for precipitation identification and the second one for precipitation estimation based on a convolutional neural network cnn to retrieve precipitation over the continental united states conus and xinjiang province in china respectively wang et al 2021b developed a cnn based model which was first pre trained over the conus and then transferred to china through re training with ir information from fengyun satellites li et al 2021 applied data 14 bands and cloud products of fengyun 4a physical weather indexes and topographic features of three rainstorm events over south china to train an rf based regression model other studies of precipitation estimation from infrared information are summarized in table s1 however improving the accuracy of the ir based precipitation retrievals is challenging due to the limited relationship between precipitation and cloud top physical variables atmospheric parameters and topographic features are necessary for improving the accuracy of ir based retrieval methods in this paper we propose a stacking machine learning model to estimate 6 hour

section 2 introduces the datasets we used in this study section 3 provides the details of model construction section 4 presents the evaluation results of indices compared with rain gauge data and several types of precipitation products conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 datasets our study was carried out over mainland china rain gauge observation data serve as the ground truths to train the model fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of rain gauges and numbers of 6 hourly samples for each station in the study area tbbs and brightness temperature differences btds from himawari 8 are selected as the inputs of the model meanwhile metrological factors are also considered inputs to improve the accuracy and stability of the model the detailed information of the datasets used as inputs is shown in table 1 2 1 rain gauge observation data the integrated surface dataset isd consists of global surface weather observations such as precipitation compiled from numerous sources into a uniform format after filtering a total of 365 stations within china are adopted in our study meanwhile quality control discarding suspect is applied to ensure the reliability of ground truths although isd can provide long term records of hourly observations smith et al 2011 the amounts of hourly records are insufficient over china to train a data driven model as a result the rain gauge observations used in this study ranged from 2018 to 2020 at a temporal resolution of 6 hour as fig 1 shows the station network over western and northeastern china is sparser than in eastern china attributable to complex terrain and hostile environment 2 2 top brightness temperature and brightness temperature differences from himawari 8 himawari 8 an operational geostationary satellite from japan meteorological agency launched on october 7 2014 himawari 8 carries the advanced himawari imager that provides 16 channels to capture vis ir images of the asia pacific region bessho et al 2016 table s2 shows the central wavelengths of each band bands 1 6 are concentrated in the visible and near infrared wavelengths meaning that they can only be available during daylight hours for the sake of building a consensus model and being not affected by sunlight we use the tbbs observed by bands 7 16 from 3 88 to 13 28 μm in addition btds between several specific bands are sensitive to cloud physical parameters kühnlein et al 2014 min et al 2018 so and shin 2018 as a consequence five types of combinations were considered which are no 11 16 in table 1 to reduce the uncertainty of different zenith angles and azimuth angles in different regions angles were also introduced as input variables in this paper hourly data from himawari 8 was collected at a spatial resolution of 5 km 2 3 ancillary data ir based precipitation estimation can be improved by applying ancillary data in the form of atmospheric parameters li et al 2021 min et al 2018 ombadi et al 2021 such as convective available potential energy and k index ancillary variables of the atmospheric environment are acquired from era5 hersbach et al 2020 hersbach et al 2018 which is the fifth generation reanalysis for the global weather from 1979 to the present by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts it provides hourly estimates for numerous atmospheric and land surface variables at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 among the variables in table 1 no 21 25 indicated the dynamic atmospheric environment and no 26 34 represent precipitation climatology in addition we used the elevation dataset from the global multi resolution terrain elevation data gmted2010 and introduced the day of year as representative of time 2 4 precipitation products three precipitation products during 2018 2020 are considered to further validate the performance of our model satellite based imerg and gsmap products and reanalysis products era5 in this section a brief introduction of each product is provided additional details about the datasets can be found in table 2 note that the rain gauge data used in these precipitation datasets is not completely independent from isd station data considering the reliability and reasonableness of evaluation the datasets without gauge calibration are used for comparison imerg provided precipitation data over the majority of the earth s surface which is of significance in regions that lack precipitation measuring instruments on the ground imerg algorithm combines multiple available satellite pmw and ir based estimates huffman et al 2015 this system runs several times for each observation time the early run can provide a quick initial estimate with a latency of 4 h while the late run is completed approximately 14 h after observation time the final run applies a month to month adjustment using global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly monitoring analysis for gauge with a 3 5 month delay in our study precipitationuncal of early run imerg e and final run imerg f are both introduced in validation gsmap sponsored by the japan aerospace exploration agency is a blended ir pmw product kubota et al 2020 2007 gsmap provides several different products such as gsmap mvk gsmap gauge and gsmap nrt gsmap mvk is a standard product which is produced based on a kalman filter model ushio et al 2009 gsmap gauge is a gauge calibrated version of gsmap mvk that applies climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation gsmap nrt is a near real time product with a latency of 4 h we collected gsmap mvk gsmap

dataset to study the differences compared with satellite based products 3 method the workflow of our study is illustrated in fig 2 in the first step of data processing the blue block ancillary data was resampled to the spatial resolution of 5 km using the bilinear interpolation method to be concordant with himawari 8 data considering that the temporal resolution of gauge observations is 6 h we averaged the variables of six hours before the observation time afterward variables were extracted at the grids in which the sites locate 5 fold site based cross validation cv si was applied to divide the dataset into train test dataset and validation dataset the explanation of cv si is in section 3 3 in the green block 5 fold sample based cross validation cv sa was applied to help establish the two level stacking model more information for model construction is described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 also in fig 3 in the part of retrieval the orange block the inputs of the model are collected and fed into the trained stacking model precipitation estimates are produced every 6 h and accumulated in a specific period the precipitation products imerg gsmap and era5 are also processed in this part for further comparison with estimates from the stacking model 3 1 sub models ert ahmad et al 2018 eslami et al 2020 geurts et al 2006 is built based on rf breiman 2001 which has one further step of randomization rf is an ensemble learning method by constructing a collection of trees compared with rf ert has two main differences the first is embodied in using the whole samples instead of a bootstrap sample when training a single tree the second is that the top down splitting for each tree is randomized gini impurity is introduced in rf to obtain local optimum while it selects splitting nodes randomly in ert the best of these randomly generated splits is chosen to split the node xgb chen et al 2019 2015 chen and guestrin 2016 shtein et al 2020 is an optimized distributed gradient tree boosting method it is highly effective and widely used it is derived from the gradient boosting framework but is much more efficient due to its parallel computation approximate tree construction efficient processing of sparse data and optimized memory usage these characteristics make xgb at least 10 times faster than existing systems dnn larochelle et al 2009 shwartz ziv and tishby 2017 tao et al 2018 is a supervised learning algorithm with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers each neuron contained in the input layer represents an input feature neurons in the hidden layer transform the values from the preceding layer with a weighted sum rumelhart et al 1986 the last hidden layer provides values to the output layer where values are transformed into a single output the weights will be updated through an adaptive optimizer namely adaptive moment estimation kingma and ba 2014 3 2 stacking model in our study a stacking machine learning model based on ert xgb and dnn has been developed to estimate precipitation over china stacking is an ensemble technique which combines results of training several basic regression models via meta regressor using cross validation breiman 1996 ting and witten 1997 the purpose of stacking is to exploit the potential of sub models and construct a more reliable model than the individual model stacking models with similar structures to ours have been used for estimating pm2 5 fine particulate matter with a diameter below 2 5 µm greatly improving accuracy chen et al 2019 shtein et al 2020 song et al 2021a b the proposed model contains two levels and its architecture is demonstrated in fig 3 the hyperparameters of the models exploited in this study are provided in table s2 in the level 1 model we first train three basic regressors ert xgb and dnn using cv sa with the training dataset from cv si to be specific the train test dataset is shuffled randomly and divided into five folds based on samples one selected as the test data and the other four folds as train data the train data is used for training the sub models e g ert in the level 1 model and then the trained regressor is applied to acquire prediction p 1 the steps are repeated until each fold is selected and we can get p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5 five predictions of each round are stacked end to end constructing the input p e r t of the level 2 model likewise p x g b and p d n n are obtained as inputs the level 2 model is trained on the three stacked predictions of sub models and produces the final prediction theoretically the meta model can be nonlinear models but simple linear models are often adopted to obtain a smooth interpretation of level 1 predictions here we use a linear regularized regression elastic net enet de mol et al 2009 li and lin 2010 zou and hastie 2005 enet is an extension of linear regression which combines the l1 and l2 penalties of the lasso and ridge method enet is a powerful and all purpose method for classification and regression 3 3 evaluation methods we use a structure of 5 folds site based cross validation cv si in our model for verifying the performance of the model specifically we divided the whole dataset into train test dataset and validation dataset based on sites as the initial input of the level 1 model the train test dataset is used for training the whole stacking model then the validation dataset measures the performance of the model note that site based method differs from the sample based method blanchet et al 2019 wang et al 2022 wang et al 2021a b c in the site based cross validation all the sites are separated into five folds at random the samples of 4 fold sites are assigned to the train test dataset while the left fold is assigned to the validation dataset this step is repeated five times until each fold is used for verification in addition several precipitation products imerg gsmap and era5 are introduced to compare the accuracy we first resampled the precipitation products to 5 km and accumulated values of six hours before the observation time to match the spatial resolution of ground data then we extracted values at the grids where the sites locate we assessed the estimates of the stacking model ranging from 2018 to 2020 the model was assessed through four widely used statistical evaluation metrics correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and mean bias mb a higher r lower mae rmse and absolute mb indicate better agreements between the estimations and observations the formulas can be seen in table 3 moreover three categorical statistical metrics namely probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi are also considered to evaluate precipitation detection capabilities pod represents the ratio of the correct estimates to the number of precipitation occurrences from gauges far denotes the proportion of events that were erroneously detected csi indicates the overall performance of detection capabilities by integrating pod and far ranging from 0 to 1 a higher pod csi and lower far indicate better performance 4 experiment results 4 1 comparison with three sub models table 4 summarized the statistical metrics of cross validation results of three sub models and the stacking model overall the stacking model shows the best performance among four models with r of 0 630 and rmse of 4 248 mm 6hr as for mb and mae the stacking model obtains the second best results the xgb model performs better than the other two sub models with r of 0 617 and mae of 1 409 mm 6hr the spatial distributions of mb for each model are presented in fig 4 xgb generally underestimates the values for most sites the stacking model dnn and ert present similar distributions among them dnn performs poorly with deeper color while the stacking model gets smaller values of mb although the three sub models outperform the stacking model with slightly higher pod far should also be considered for example dnn obtains the best score of pod 0 99 but the worst score of far 0 58 meaning that means that dnn correctly identifies precipitation events and mistakenly reports events that did not actually occur as a result dnn obtains the lowest csi of 0 42 by contrast the stacking model obtains the worst pod 0 96 but the best far 0 35 and csi 0 64 the spatial distributions of csi for each model are mapped in fig 5 to further analyze their precipitation detection capabilities the results show the stacking model performs slightly better than ert and xgb while dnn is relatively poor a total of 52 of sites in the stacking model display csi values higher than 0 6 the overall distributions of all the models are similar which may be attributed to the poor completeness of recorded observation values generally the stacking method outperforms the individual model and improves precipitation estimation 4 2 comparison with popular precipitation products the performances of several commonly used precipitation products are demonstrated in table 4 r rmse mae and mb indicate that the stacking model outperforms all the products the products have r from 0 455 to 0 587 mae from 1 477 to 1 841 mm 6 hr and rmse from 4 813 to 6 715 mm 6hr imerg f generally performs better than the other precipitation products while gsmap n performs the worst standard products imerg f and gsmap m show better performance than their near real time versions imerg e and gsmap n in terms of categorical statistical metrics the stacking model obtains pod of 0 96 and csi of 0 64 compared with satellite precipitation products the pod of the stacking model is significantly improved by 78 gsmap n and 55 imerg f however it also obtains a higher far 0 35 the csi of the stacking model is higher than all satellite products but slightly lower than era5 overall the stacking model presents competitive results and generally performs better than precipitation products over china the spatial distribution of r rmse and csi for each station is illustrated in figs 6 8 for further analysis the stacking model presents the best agreement with observations in spatial distributions of r fig 6 imerg f performs better than the other products the number of sites with r higher than 0 65 in the stacking model is 133 accounting for 36 of the total which is more than that in imerg f 64 sites account for 17 of the total era5 shows poor values of r in southwestern china while gsmap m and gsmap n perform poorly in central mainly in parts of shaanxi province and southern china in addition the values of r decrease gradually from northeast to southwest a possible reason for this finding is the difficult terrain in the west al jiboori et al 2001 and the heavy precipitation in the south ren et al 2015 which are difficult to accurately estimate in the spatial distributions of mb fig 7 the same projects have similar distributions e g imerg f and imerg e gsmap m and gsmap n while distributions of different projects are widely divergent e g imerg era5 gsmap and the stacking model compared with the products the overwhelming majority of sites in the stacking model are in lighter colors mb tends to 0 value suggesting that the stacking model performs better era5 underestimates precipitation in eastern regions of 110 e imerg f and imerg e underestimate precipitation in most parts of china except for the regions of the bohai sea coast and inner mongolia however gsmap m and gsmap n overestimate the amount in northern china and eastern coastal areas while they exhibit underestimation in southern china in terms of the spatial distributions of csi for stations fig 8 era5 presents the best results followed by the stacking model imerg f imerg e gsmap m and gsmap n present comparable distributions and perform worse than era5 and the stacking model the numbers of sites with csi higher than 0 65 are 160 and 179 in the stacking model and era5 respectively 44 and 49 of the total generally speaking our model outperforms precipitation products overall and exhibits consistent and excellent performance on the spatial distributions of r rmse and csi heavy precipitation events have a striking impact on environment and society and attract much attention in this study the threshold used to define a heavy precipitation event is the top 5 percent of all grids with precipitation which is 16 9 mm 6hr the stacking model and precipitation products are evaluated in 15 600 samples of heavy precipitation and the results are shown in fig 9 the stacking model performs best with the r rmse and mae increments of 0 01 0 14 0 59 3 41 mm 6 hr and 0 54 5 64 mm 6hr compared with other products respectively meanwhile the products obtain pod ranging from 0 83 to 0 88 indicating their similar abilities of detecting heavy precipitation by contrast the stacking model achieves a distinctly better pod of 0 97 4 3 performance assessment at temporal scales the spatial patterns and boxplots are provided to evaluate our model in contrast with other precipitation products at annual seasonal and daily scales fig 10 illustrates the spatial patterns of annually accumulated precipitation in 2020 derived from the stacking model and precipitation products the overall spatial patterns captured by the stacking model and products are relatively coincident the general trend of accumulated precipitation in china is decreasing from the southeast coast to the northwest inland at the same time discrepancies of spatial patterns still exist in local areas for example the precipitation boundary of 400 mm crosses henan shaanxi and sichuan provinces which is captured by the stacking model and all products except imerg f and imerg e these discrepancies are mainly caused by the underestimations negative mb in fig 7 of imerg e and imerg f in areas around sichuan province furthermore the stacking model and era5 present accumulated precipitation of more than 400 mm year in southwestern china parts of the yunnan and tibet provinces while the other products are less considering that mb of the stacking model performs better within these regions the result from it is more reliable high values of precipitation from the stacking model and all products primarily distribute over southern china such as the area bordering the provinces of hubei jiangxi anhui and zhejiang by contrast annually accumulated precipitation generally presents low values of 100 mm year across northwestern china where the climate is arid or semi arid fig 11 demonstrates the boxplots of r rmse pod and csi for the stacking model and precipitation products over four seasons the stacking model performs better than other products with higher r and lower rmse imerg f and era5 present comparable performance to the stacking model in summer and winter respectively the boxplots also show it tends to obtain lower r and higher rmse in summer than those in winter for the stacking model and all products this finding may be determined by the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of precipitation in china in other words typhoons and thundershowers are common in summer zhou and wu 2019 while precipitation is relatively low in winter pod of the stacking model and era5 are significantly better than other products over four seasons with the median values all over 0 8 in terms of csi era5 outperforms the other products followed by the stacking model the divergence of csi is more evidence in djf than that in jja to examine the horizontal distribution of daily accumulated precipitation fig 12 displays daily precipitation accumulation on 13 august 2020 derived from the stacking model and precipitation products generally estimates from the stacking model and products depict the pattern of daily precipitation relatively consistent not only in the identification of precipitation events but also in the regional distribution of extreme precipitation events however there are still inconsistencies in local areas the stacking model and all products except era5 capture the heavy rainfall of greater than 70 mm day in shandong province at the same time era5 overestimated precipitation in three local areas in central china relative to other products while only gsmap n identifies two patterns of heavy precipitation in addition the spatial distribution of results from the stacking model is more continuous and smoother with more details especially in light rain areas in southwest china 5 conclusion this paper proposed a stacking model consisting of ert xgb dnn and a meta regressor to estimate 6 hour precipitation at the spatial resolution of 5 km using himawari 8 over china the model performance and retrieval results are summarized as follows 1 our model outperforms sub models obtaining the highest r of 0 630 and lowest rmse of 4 248 mm 6hr in further analysis the stacking model also shows stable performance in mb and csi 2 compared with several commonly used precipitation products the performance of the stacking model is also more satisfactory especially overall spatial distribution results of r and mb indicate that the stacking model has better agreement with rain gauges in addition further analysis shows that our model also has high detection ability pod of 0 97 and great applicability under the condition of heavy precipitation 3 performance assessment is provided at different temporal scales annually seasonally and daily to comprehensively evaluate our model at annual scale the spatial patterns of our model are more reliable and acceptable because of its smaller mb besides the boxplots were applied to evaluate model performance at seasonal scale our model shows accurate estimates and skillful detection of precipitation for four seasons meanwhile the spatial patterns captured by the stacking model and products are relatively consistent at daily scale in general the proposed model can achieve satisfactory results on the issue of estimating precipitation at different time scales these results will help acquire the quantification of precipitation and enhance the understanding of dynamic water cycle however this study is restricted by the time interval between the data recorded in rain gauge observation dataset it is strongly believed the model will improve in temporal resolution with adequate hourly ground

3366,precipitation plays a significant role in the hydrological cycle and atmospheric circulation however estimating precipitation is a challenging task due to the high spatiotemporal variability of precipitation the development of machine learning has marked a new approach to precipitation estimation in this study a stacking ensemble machine learning model was developed to estimate 6 hour precipitation at a high spatial resolution of 5 km based on himawari 8 and ground stations data over china metrological and topographic factors are considered ancillary data the stacking model consists of two levels three sub models namely extremely randomized trees extreme gradient boosting and deep neural networks were trained respectively in level 1 of the stacking model level 2 linearly combines sub models to achieve the final estimation evaluation results over china indicate that the stacking model outperforms the individual model with a correlation coefficient of 0 630 a mean absolute error of 1 431 mm 6hr and a root mean square error of 4 248 mm 6hr the performance of the proposed model is better than several widely used precipitation products imerg gsmap and era5 in particular the detection rate of heavy precipitation 16 9 mm 6hr in our model with a probability of detection of 0 97 is distinctly superior to that of the other products the precipitation estimations are accumulated and plotted at different temporal scales contrasting with these products the spatial patterns appear to be relatively coincident at annual and daily scales more importantly the spatial patterns of our model are more reliable than those of the products due to its smaller mean bias the study provided a novel alternative for producing improved high resolution precipitation datasets with high accuracy keywords precipitation estimation himawari 8 machine learning stacking model high resolution 1 introduction precipitation is a crucial part of the hydrological cycle and is the most significant and active variable related to atmospheric circulation fang et al 2019 sun et al 2018 long term precipitation records are essential for climate studies ashouri et al 2015 bhatti et al 2020 while near real time precipitation datasets are necessary for the mitigation of the influence of natural disasters such as floods and landslides arabzadeh et al 2020 atif et al 2020 brocca et al 2019 ground based measurements from traditional gauges and weather radars are considered reliable and highly accurate methods chen et al 2022 ochoa rodriguez et al 2019 shen et al 2021 however their distributions are usually sparse over many regions such as geographically complicated mountain areas chen et al 2022 prigent 2010 sun et al 2018 gauges are also affected by gauge undercatch especially for snowfall ehsani and behrangi 2021 song et al 2021a b radars are limited by lacking accessibility and funding sun et al 2018 and may suffer from contamination of ground clutter battaglia and panegrossi 2020 ehsani et al 2021a smalley et al 2017 by contrast remote sensing techniques provide more spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous measurements michaelides et al 2009 sun et al 2018 yang and luo 2014 the retrieval methods of precipitation can be classified into three main types visible infrared vis ir active or passive microwave pmw and multi sensor joint retrieval methods hu et al 2019 kidd and levizzani 2011 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 vis and ir sensors onboard geostationary satellites have the superiority of relatively high spatiotemporal resolution but have restricted accuracy due to the indirect relationship between cloud top brightness temperature tbb and surface rain rates ehsani et al 2021a kidd and levizzani 2011 min et al 2018 thies et al 2008 compared with ir microwaves are more sensitive to the precipitation particles thus they get more accurate estimates hou et al 2014 wang et al 2021a however active microwave sensors also known as precipitation radars and pmw sensors are only accessible for low orbits leading to poor temporal sampling hou et al 2014 prigent 2010 sun et al 2018 besides pmw based methods provide less accuracy than precipitation radars and present poor performance over snow and ice surfaces adhikari et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021a to further study climate change and hydrological prediction blooming products have been created to acquire more accurate estimates with a high spatiotemporal resolution by combining multiple sensors such as tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 ushio et al 2009 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2015 reanalysis product is another alternative source of precipitation data which can provide longer temporal coverage than ground observations and remote sensing li et al 2020 williamson et al 2018 nevertheless errors persist in observations and assimilation methods causing uncertainties in reanalysis products jiang et al 2021 p 5 xu et al 2020 for the past few years researchers have attempted to apply machine learning techniques to hydrological applications baez villanueva et al 2020 chen et al 2021 ehsani et al 2021b p ehsani et al 2021a kühnlein et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 min et al 2018 for example random forest rf one of the most popular machine learning methods was used to retrieve rainfall rates from optical satellites and showed good accuracy kühnlein et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 min et al 2018 furthermore a novel method named rf based merging procedure showed better performance than other merging precipitation products over chile baez villanueva et al 2020 ehsani et al 2021a used cloudsat radar and machine learning for snowfall retrieval in high latitudes chen et al 2021 proposed a downscaling calibration method based on rf to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of precipitation products machine learning is proved to be a powerful method in hydrology substantial efforts have been focused on retrieval precipitation from ir information due to its high spatiotemporal resolutions and adequate spatial coverage hong et al 2004 kühnlein et al 2014 li et al 2021 meyer et al 2016 min et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2020 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2021b wang et al 2020 xue et al 2021 min et al 2018 combined infrared brightness temperature from himawari 8 with numerical weather prediction data and developed an rf based model to estimate precipitation wang et al 2020 xue et al 2021 used a two module frame the first one for precipitation identification and the second one for precipitation estimation based on a convolutional neural network cnn to retrieve precipitation over the continental united states conus and xinjiang province in china respectively wang et al 2021b developed a cnn based model which was first pre trained over the conus and then transferred to china through re training with ir information from fengyun satellites li et al 2021 applied data 14 bands and cloud products of fengyun 4a physical weather indexes and topographic features of three rainstorm events over south china to train an rf based regression model other studies of precipitation estimation from infrared information are summarized in table s1 however improving the accuracy of the ir based precipitation retrievals is challenging due to the limited relationship between precipitation and cloud top physical variables atmospheric parameters and topographic features are necessary for improving the accuracy of ir based retrieval methods in this paper we propose a stacking machine learning model to estimate 6 hour precipitation at a high spatial resolution of 5 km based on himawari 8 and ground stations data over china metrological and topographic factors are considered as ancillary data the model contains two levels level 1 trains three sub models extremely randomized trees ert extreme gradient boosting xgb and deep neural networks dnn level 2 linearly combines the sub models to achieve the final estimation evaluation results show the stacking model performs well compared with sub models and several commonly used precipitation products we organize the remainder of the article as follows section 2 introduces the datasets we used in this study section 3 provides the details of model construction section 4 presents the evaluation results of indices compared with rain gauge data and several types of precipitation products conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 datasets our study was carried out over mainland china rain gauge observation data serve as the ground truths to train the model fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of rain gauges and numbers of 6 hourly samples for each station in the study area tbbs and brightness temperature differences btds from himawari 8 are selected as the inputs of the model meanwhile metrological factors are also considered inputs to improve the accuracy and stability of the model the detailed information of the datasets used as inputs is shown in table 1 2 1 rain gauge observation data the integrated surface dataset isd consists of global surface weather observations such as precipitation compiled from numerous sources into a uniform format after filtering a total of 365 stations within china are adopted in our study meanwhile quality control discarding suspect is applied to ensure the reliability of ground truths although isd can provide long term records of hourly observations smith et al 2011 the amounts of hourly records are insufficient over china to train a data driven model as a result the rain gauge observations used in this study ranged from 2018 to 2020 at a temporal resolution of 6 hour as fig 1 shows the station network over western and northeastern china is sparser than in eastern china attributable to complex terrain and hostile environment 2 2 top brightness temperature and brightness temperature differences from himawari 8 himawari 8 an operational geostationary satellite from japan meteorological agency launched on october 7 2014 himawari 8 carries the advanced himawari imager that provides 16 channels to capture vis ir images of the asia pacific region bessho et al 2016 table s2 shows the central wavelengths of each band bands 1 6 are concentrated in the visible and near infrared wavelengths meaning that they can only be available during daylight hours for the sake of building a consensus model and being not affected by sunlight we use the tbbs observed by bands 7 16 from 3 88 to 13 28 μm in addition btds between several specific bands are sensitive to cloud physical parameters kühnlein et al 2014 min et al 2018 so and shin 2018 as a consequence five types of combinations were considered which are no 11 16 in table 1 to reduce the uncertainty of different zenith angles and azimuth angles in different regions angles were also introduced as input variables in this paper hourly data from himawari 8 was collected at a spatial resolution of 5 km 2 3 ancillary data ir based precipitation estimation can be improved by applying ancillary data in the form of atmospheric parameters li et al 2021 min et al 2018 ombadi et al 2021 such as convective available potential energy and k index ancillary variables of the atmospheric environment are acquired from era5 hersbach et al 2020 hersbach et al 2018 which is the fifth generation reanalysis for the global weather from 1979 to the present by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts it provides hourly estimates for numerous atmospheric and land surface variables at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 among the variables in table 1 no 21 25 indicated the dynamic atmospheric environment and no 26 34 represent precipitation climatology in addition we used the elevation dataset from the global multi resolution terrain elevation data gmted2010 and introduced the day of year as representative of time 2 4 precipitation products three precipitation products during 2018 2020 are considered to further validate the performance of our model satellite based imerg and gsmap products and reanalysis products era5 in this section a brief introduction of each product is provided additional details about the datasets can be found in table 2 note that the rain gauge data used in these precipitation datasets is not completely independent from isd station data considering the reliability and reasonableness of evaluation the datasets without gauge calibration are used for comparison imerg provided precipitation data over the majority of the earth s surface which is of significance in regions that lack precipitation measuring instruments on the ground imerg algorithm combines multiple available satellite pmw and ir based estimates huffman et al 2015 this system runs several times for each observation time the early run can provide a quick initial estimate with a latency of 4 h while the late run is completed approximately 14 h after observation time the final run applies a month to month adjustment using global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly monitoring analysis for gauge with a 3 5 month delay in our study precipitationuncal of early run imerg e and final run imerg f are both introduced in validation gsmap sponsored by the japan aerospace exploration agency is a blended ir pmw product kubota et al 2020 2007 gsmap provides several different products such as gsmap mvk gsmap gauge and gsmap nrt gsmap mvk is a standard product which is produced based on a kalman filter model ushio et al 2009 gsmap gauge is a gauge calibrated version of gsmap mvk that applies climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation gsmap nrt is a near real time product with a latency of 4 h we collected gsmap mvk gsmap m and gsmap nrt gsmap n products a standard and a near real time version without gauge calibration era5 has been described in section 2 3 we apply the precipitation estimates from the reanalysis dataset to study the differences compared with satellite based products 3 method the workflow of our study is illustrated in fig 2 in the first step of data processing the blue block ancillary data was resampled to the spatial resolution of 5 km using the bilinear interpolation method to be concordant with himawari 8 data considering that the temporal resolution of gauge observations is 6 h we averaged the variables of six hours before the observation time afterward variables were extracted at the grids in which the sites locate 5 fold site based cross validation cv si was applied to divide the dataset into train test dataset and validation dataset the explanation of cv si is in section 3 3 in the green block 5 fold sample based cross validation cv sa was applied to help establish the two level stacking model more information for model construction is described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 also in fig 3 in the part of retrieval the orange block the inputs of the model are collected and fed into the trained stacking model precipitation estimates are produced every 6 h and accumulated in a specific period the precipitation products imerg gsmap and era5 are also processed in this part for further comparison with estimates from the stacking model 3 1 sub models ert ahmad et al 2018 eslami et al 2020 geurts et al 2006 is built based on rf breiman 2001 which has one further step of randomization rf is an ensemble learning method by constructing a collection of trees compared with rf ert has two main differences the first is embodied in using the whole samples instead of a bootstrap sample when training a single tree the second is that the top down splitting for each tree is randomized gini impurity is introduced in rf to obtain local optimum while it selects splitting nodes randomly in ert the best of these randomly generated splits is chosen to split the node xgb chen et al 2019 2015 chen and guestrin 2016 shtein et al 2020 is an optimized distributed gradient tree boosting method it is highly effective and widely used it is derived from the gradient boosting framework but is much more efficient due to its parallel computation approximate tree construction efficient processing of sparse data and optimized memory usage these characteristics make xgb at least 10 times faster than existing systems dnn larochelle et al 2009 shwartz ziv and tishby 2017 tao et al 2018 is a supervised learning algorithm with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers each neuron contained in the input layer represents an input feature neurons in the hidden layer transform the values from the preceding layer with a weighted sum rumelhart et al 1986 the last hidden layer provides values to the output layer where values are transformed into a single output the weights will be updated through an adaptive optimizer namely adaptive moment estimation kingma and ba 2014 3 2 stacking model in our study a stacking machine learning model based on ert xgb and dnn has been developed to estimate precipitation over china stacking is an ensemble technique which combines results of training several basic regression models via meta regressor using cross validation breiman 1996 ting and witten 1997 the purpose of stacking is to exploit the potential of sub models and construct a more reliable model than the individual model stacking models with similar structures to ours have been used for estimating pm2 5 fine particulate matter with a diameter below 2 5 µm greatly improving accuracy chen et al 2019 shtein et al 2020 song et al 2021a b the proposed model contains two levels and its architecture is demonstrated in fig 3 the hyperparameters of the models exploited in this study are provided in table s2 in the level 1 model we first train three basic regressors ert xgb and dnn using cv sa with the training dataset from cv si to be specific the train test dataset is shuffled randomly and divided into five folds based on samples one selected as the test data and the other four folds as train data the train data is used for training the sub models e g ert in the level 1 model and then the trained regressor is applied to acquire prediction p 1 the steps are repeated until each fold is selected and we can get p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5 five predictions of each round are stacked end to end constructing the input p e r t of the level 2 model likewise p x g b and p d n n are obtained as inputs the level 2 model is trained on the three stacked predictions of sub models and produces the final prediction theoretically the meta model can be nonlinear models but simple linear models are often adopted to obtain a smooth interpretation of level 1 predictions here we use a linear regularized regression elastic net enet de mol et al 2009 li and lin 2010 zou and hastie 2005 enet is an extension of linear regression which combines the l1 and l2 penalties of the lasso and ridge method enet is a powerful and all purpose method for classification and regression 3 3 evaluation methods we use a structure of 5 folds site based cross validation cv si in our model for verifying the performance of the model specifically we divided the whole dataset into train test dataset and validation dataset based on sites as the initial input of the level 1 model the train test dataset is used for training the whole stacking model then the validation dataset measures the performance of the model note that site based method differs from the sample based method blanchet et al 2019 wang et al 2022 wang et al 2021a b c in the site based cross validation all the sites are separated into five folds at random the samples of 4 fold sites are assigned to the train test dataset while the left fold is assigned to the validation dataset this step is repeated five times until each fold is used for verification in addition several precipitation products imerg gsmap and era5 are introduced to compare the accuracy we first resampled the precipitation products to 5 km and accumulated values of six hours before the observation time to match the spatial resolution of ground data then we extracted values at the grids where the sites locate we assessed the estimates of the stacking model ranging from 2018 to 2020 the model was assessed through four widely used statistical evaluation metrics correlation coefficient r mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and mean bias mb a higher r lower mae rmse and absolute mb indicate better agreements between the estimations and observations the formulas can be seen in table 3 moreover three categorical statistical metrics namely probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi are also considered to evaluate precipitation detection capabilities pod represents the ratio of the correct estimates to the number of precipitation occurrences from gauges far denotes the proportion of events that were erroneously detected csi indicates the overall performance of detection capabilities by integrating pod and far ranging from 0 to 1 a higher pod csi and lower far indicate better performance 4 experiment results 4 1 comparison with three sub models table 4 summarized the statistical metrics of cross validation results of three sub models and the stacking model overall the stacking model shows the best performance among four models with r of 0 630 and rmse of 4 248 mm 6hr as for mb and mae the stacking model obtains the second best results the xgb model performs better than the other two sub models with r of 0 617 and mae of 1 409 mm 6hr the spatial distributions of mb for each model are presented in fig 4 xgb generally underestimates the values for most sites the stacking model dnn and ert present similar distributions among them dnn performs poorly with deeper color while the stacking model gets smaller values of mb although the three sub models outperform the stacking model with slightly higher pod far should also be considered for example dnn obtains the best score of pod 0 99 but the worst score of far 0 58 meaning that means that dnn correctly identifies precipitation events and mistakenly reports events that did not actually occur as a result dnn obtains the lowest csi of 0 42 by contrast the stacking model obtains the worst pod 0 96 but the best far 0 35 and csi 0 64 the spatial distributions of csi for each model are mapped in fig 5 to further analyze their precipitation detection capabilities the results show the stacking model performs slightly better than ert and xgb while dnn is relatively poor a total of 52 of sites in the stacking model display csi values higher than 0 6 the overall distributions of all the models are similar which may be attributed to the poor completeness of recorded observation values generally the stacking method outperforms the individual model and improves precipitation estimation 4 2 comparison with popular precipitation products the performances of several commonly used precipitation products are demonstrated in table 4 r rmse mae and mb indicate that the stacking model outperforms all the products the products have r from 0 455 to 0 587 mae from 1 477 to 1 841 mm 6 hr and rmse from 4 813 to 6 715 mm 6hr imerg f generally performs better than the other precipitation products while gsmap n performs the worst standard products imerg f and gsmap m show better performance than their near real time versions imerg e and gsmap n in terms of categorical statistical metrics the stacking model obtains pod of 0 96 and csi of 0 64 compared with satellite precipitation products the pod of the stacking model is significantly improved by 78 gsmap n and 55 imerg f however it also obtains a higher far 0 35 the csi of the stacking model is higher than all satellite products but slightly lower than era5 overall the stacking model presents competitive results and generally performs better than precipitation products over china the spatial distribution of r rmse and csi for each station is illustrated in figs 6 8 for further analysis the stacking model presents the best agreement with observations in spatial distributions of r fig 6 imerg f performs better than the other products the number of sites with r higher than 0 65 in the stacking model is 133 accounting for 36 of the total which is more than that in imerg f 64 sites account for 17 of the total era5 shows poor values of r in southwestern china while gsmap m and gsmap n perform poorly in central mainly in parts of shaanxi province and southern china in addition the values of r decrease gradually from northeast to southwest a possible reason for this finding is the difficult terrain in the west al jiboori et al 2001 and the heavy precipitation in the south ren et al 2015 which are difficult to accurately estimate in the spatial distributions of mb fig 7 the same projects have similar distributions e g imerg f and imerg e gsmap m and gsmap n while distributions of different projects are widely divergent e g imerg era5 gsmap and the stacking model compared with the products the overwhelming majority of sites in the stacking model are in lighter colors mb tends to 0 value suggesting that the stacking model performs better era5 underestimates precipitation in eastern regions of 110 e imerg f and imerg e underestimate precipitation in most parts of china except for the regions of the bohai sea coast and inner mongolia however gsmap m and gsmap n overestimate the amount in northern china and eastern coastal areas while they exhibit underestimation in southern china in terms of the spatial distributions of csi for stations fig 8 era5 presents the best results followed by the stacking model imerg f imerg e gsmap m and gsmap n present comparable distributions and perform worse than era5 and the stacking model the numbers of sites with csi higher than 0 65 are 160 and 179 in the stacking model and era5 respectively 44 and 49 of the total generally speaking our model outperforms precipitation products overall and exhibits consistent and excellent performance on the spatial distributions of r rmse and csi heavy precipitation events have a striking impact on environment and society and attract much attention in this study the threshold used to define a heavy precipitation event is the top 5 percent of all grids with precipitation which is 16 9 mm 6hr the stacking model and precipitation products are evaluated in 15 600 samples of heavy precipitation and the results are shown in fig 9 the stacking model performs best with the r rmse and mae increments of 0 01 0 14 0 59 3 41 mm 6 hr and 0 54 5 64 mm 6hr compared with other products respectively meanwhile the products obtain pod ranging from 0 83 to 0 88 indicating their similar abilities of detecting heavy precipitation by contrast the stacking model achieves a distinctly better pod of 0 97 4 3 performance assessment at temporal scales the spatial patterns and boxplots are provided to evaluate our model in contrast with other precipitation products at annual seasonal and daily scales fig 10 illustrates the spatial patterns of annually accumulated precipitation in 2020 derived from the stacking model and precipitation products the overall spatial patterns captured by the stacking model and products are relatively coincident the general trend of accumulated precipitation in china is decreasing from the southeast coast to the northwest inland at the same time discrepancies of spatial patterns still exist in local areas for example the precipitation boundary of 400 mm crosses henan shaanxi and sichuan provinces which is captured by the stacking model and all products except imerg f and imerg e these discrepancies are mainly caused by the underestimations negative mb in fig 7 of imerg e and imerg f in areas around sichuan province furthermore the stacking model and era5 present accumulated precipitation of more than 400 mm year in southwestern china parts of the yunnan and tibet provinces while the other products are less considering that mb of the stacking model performs better within these regions the result from it is more reliable high values of precipitation from the stacking model and all products primarily distribute over southern china such as the area bordering the provinces of hubei jiangxi anhui and zhejiang by contrast annually accumulated precipitation generally presents low values of 100 mm year across northwestern china where the climate is arid or semi arid fig 11 demonstrates the boxplots of r rmse pod and csi for the stacking model and precipitation products over four seasons the stacking model performs better than other products with higher r and lower rmse imerg f and era5 present comparable performance to the stacking model in summer and winter respectively the boxplots also show it tends to obtain lower r and higher rmse in summer than those in winter for the stacking model and all products this finding may be determined by the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of precipitation in china in other words typhoons and thundershowers are common in summer zhou and wu 2019 while precipitation is relatively low in winter pod of the stacking model and era5 are significantly better than other products over four seasons with the median values all over 0 8 in terms of csi era5 outperforms the other products followed by the stacking model the divergence of csi is more evidence in djf than that in jja to examine the horizontal distribution of daily accumulated precipitation fig 12 displays daily precipitation accumulation on 13 august 2020 derived from the stacking model and precipitation products generally estimates from the stacking model and products depict the pattern of daily precipitation relatively consistent not only in the identification of precipitation events but also in the regional distribution of extreme precipitation events however there are still inconsistencies in local areas the stacking model and all products except era5 capture the heavy rainfall of greater than 70 mm day in shandong province at the same time era5 overestimated precipitation in three local areas in central china relative to other products while only gsmap n identifies two patterns of heavy precipitation in addition the spatial distribution of results from the stacking model is more continuous and smoother with more details especially in light rain areas in southwest china 5 conclusion this paper proposed a stacking model consisting of ert xgb dnn and a meta regressor to estimate 6 hour precipitation at the spatial resolution of 5 km using himawari 8 over china the model performance and retrieval results are summarized as follows 1 our model outperforms sub models obtaining the highest r of 0 630 and lowest rmse of 4 248 mm 6hr in further analysis the stacking model also shows stable performance in mb and csi 2 compared with several commonly used precipitation products the performance of the stacking model is also more satisfactory especially overall spatial distribution results of r and mb indicate that the stacking model has better agreement with rain gauges in addition further analysis shows that our model also has high detection ability pod of 0 97 and great applicability under the condition of heavy precipitation 3 performance assessment is provided at different temporal scales annually seasonally and daily to comprehensively evaluate our model at annual scale the spatial patterns of our model are more reliable and acceptable because of its smaller mb besides the boxplots were applied to evaluate model performance at seasonal scale our model shows accurate estimates and skillful detection of precipitation for four seasons meanwhile the spatial patterns captured by the stacking model and products are relatively consistent at daily scale in general the proposed model can achieve satisfactory results on the issue of estimating precipitation at different time scales these results will help acquire the quantification of precipitation and enhance the understanding of dynamic water cycle however this study is restricted by the time interval between the data recorded in rain gauge observation dataset it is strongly believed the model will improve in temporal resolution with adequate hourly ground

3367,understanding dissolved oxygen do dynamics and corresponding driving factors are essential to improve aquatic environments and protect aquatic organisms although several studies have been conducted to investigate do dynamics on low frequency scales high frequency spectral characteristics of do and the corresponding connections with hydro biogeochemical drivers were little known accordingly this study proposed a comprehensive framework to explore the periodic and aperiodic characteristics of do and the corresponding hydrological water temperature and biogeochemical ph ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp controls in the pearl river basin of china based on high frequency measurements and spectral analysis the results showed that do water temperature ph nh3 n and tp all exhibited temporal fractal phenomena i e 1 f fluctuations in low frequency domains the scaling component β of water temperature was larger implying that the self similarity of water temperature was stronger in high frequency domains do exhibited obvious daily and half day periods of the other four elements water temperature and ph exhibited high frequency periods while nh3 n and tp did not based on the energy distribution derived from the continuous wavelet transform three do transience types swing abrupt and mixed swing and abrupt were characterized the first type was characterized by continuous fluctuations while the second type was characterized by a sudden change with a peak value the last type had traits of both swing transience and abrupt transience through an analysis of maximal information coefficient and correlation coefficient we found that linear relationships existed between water temperature and do with correlation coefficient ranging from 0 46 to 0 83 in contrast ph nh3 n and tp generally exhibited nonlinear relationships with do and the nonlinear coefficients were above 0 2 on the whole the driving elements were different for each do transience type hydrological elements mainly corresponded to do swing transience in contrast biogeochemical elements were mainly related to do abrupt transience in general this study provided a new perspective for revealing the high frequency fluctuations of do and corresponding drivers the framework and results summarized in this study broadened our understanding on do dynamics and were conducive to river management such as water quality anomaly detection water quality prediction and regulation in advance keywords dissolved oxygen periodicity aperiodicity transience type high frequency measurements pearl river basin 1 introduction dissolved oxygen do is a vital environmental parameter directly related to the health of aquatic ecosystems an environment is considered hypoxic when the do concentration is less than 2 mg l yu and gan 2021 under low oxygen conditions a large number of aquatic organisms that are sensitive to do will die within a few days breitburg et al 2018 moreover severe hypoxia can form dead zones in aquatic environments where the aquatic ecosystem is severely compromised diaz and rosenberg 2008 therefore it is of great importance to explore the dynamic characteristics of do because such information can be used to substantially improve aquatic environments and protect aquatic organisms water quality parameters can be highly dynamic and may include both periodic and aperiodic signals the periodicity of parameters is universal and composed of low and high frequency components whitfield 1995 low frequency periods have been intensively studied in the past graziano and jones 2017 for instance zhang et al 2018 explored the monthly do variability from 2001 to 2015 at mirs bay and found that an annual cycle was consistently present recently with the development of information technology obtaining real time high frequency watershed monitoring data using wireless sensor networks has become possible rode et al 2016 thus more and more researchers have focused on the high frequency periods of do in the potomac river jones and graziano 2013 and narew river rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2015 rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2016 where high frequency measurements are available the do was observed to exhibit daily or even half day cycles for aperiodic signals long term trends related to the improvement or deterioration of water quality are well known examples these include cases like kralj et al 2019 who analyzed do over the past 30 years in the northeast adriatic sea and found that the do concentration in the bottom water exhibited an increasing trend another example of an aperiodic feature is the temporal fractal phenomenon this phenomenon was firstly proposed by bloschl and sivapalan 1995 and mainly developed by kirchner et al 2000 to assess the self similarity and independence of long term water quality time series recently this phenomenon has gradually gained interest and been used in aquatic environmental researches for instance hansen and singh 2018 found that nitrate discharge and water temperature showed temporal self similarity phenomena in the des moines river and iowa river furthermore hensley et al 2018 considered that the fractal phenomena of do and other water quality parameters could be attributed to the hillside and channel processes short term transient signals which can only be captured by high frequency data are another important aperiodic characteristic as for do such signals can be driven by nonpoint source pollution caused by short term precipitation which leads to an increase in do consumption and a decrease in do concentration chen et al 2018 in 1997 whitfield and dohan were the first to extract the location duration and magnitude of transient characteristics in water temperature and conductivity whitfield and dohan 1997 since then several researchers have begun to pay attention to the short term transient characteristics of water quality signals more recently the study by jiang et al 2020 constructed a comprehensive framework based on spectral analysis and high resolution measurements and applied it to explore the transient characteristics of several water quality elements e g do water temperature ph and turbidity they categorized the transient water quality elements into two types swing transience and abrupt transience and found that the do series was mainly characterized by the swing type transience nevertheless it remains unclear whether these two types are universal and how they may evolve both hydrological and biogeochemical elements can affect do dynamics ahmed and lin 2021 li et al 2020 hydrological elements such as water temperature and rive discharge can modulate do concentration through affecting solubility and advection transport while biogeochemical processes such as eutrophication driven by nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients can accelerate the consumption of do hu et al 2021 in the chesapeake bay du et al 2018 found that the long term interannual cycles of monthly do during 1985 2012 were mainly due to the hydrological variability caused by water temperature and biogeochemical variability related to the chlorophyll a concentration furthermore cravo et al 2020 analyzed the do dynamics at different timescales i e semidiurnal daily fortnightly seasonal and inter annual cycles based on high frequency measurements every 15 min and found that the drivers of do differed among different timescales on the whole a large amount of studies have been carried out to explore the do dynamics and corresponding mechanisms by using various approaches appling et al 2018 bernhardt et al 2017 odum 1956 zhang et al 2021 it has been shown that do series existed nonlinearity and short term oxygen enrichment and consumption processes could affect do concentration significantly wang et al 2017 nevertheless there were limited studies focusing on the high frequency spectral characteristics of do meanwhile it is still unclear how external drivers affect transient do dynamics on short term timescales we considered that the do dynamics and corresponding hydro biogeochemical regulations could be further revealed by extracting the spectral characteristics of different frequency domains accordingly a comprehensive framework based on high frequency measurements and spectral analysis was built in this study firstly the high resolution data including do and several driving factors were collected secondly the spectral analysis approaches based on continuous wavelet transform cwt and fast fourier transform fft were used to extract the periodicity temporal fractal phenomenon and short term transience of all water quality elements fft can decompose the original signal into the frequency domain juez and nadal romero 2021 niu et al 2018 cwt can further decompose the original signal into the time and frequency domains quilty and adamowski 2018 wang et al 2020 both approaches can release more data details and reveal the dynamics of variables in different frequencies dökmen and aslan 2013 duran et al 2020 finally the spectral characteristics between do and driving factors were compared together to discuss the hydrological and biogeochemical regulations on do dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the pearl river basin prb was selected as the study area fig 1 the pearl river with a length of 2 214 km and a drainage area of 453 600 km2 is the second largest river in china duan et al 2021 zheng et al 2017 it delivers a large amount of freshwater from three major tributaries i e the west river north river and east river into the pearl river estuary and its adjacent continental shelf the prb experiences a subtropical monsoon climate its annual average precipitation ranges from 1200 to 2200 mm and the precipitation has an uneven spatiotemporal distribution with 80 of precipitation concentrated from april to september in addition the precipitation in this area has an obvious decreasing trend from east to west water from the prb is used to supply the tens of millions of people in the guangdong hongkong macao greater bay area and other cities in southern china in recent years changes in hydrometeorological conditions and enhanced human activities have led to more dramatic do changes and more frequent occurrences of low do conditions in the prb xu et al 2021 which could pose adverse impacts on water and human health thus it is an appropriate area to select for the assessment of do periodicity and aperiodicity and corresponding controlling factors four water quality stations i e qiaotou zhangcun nanbeichong and huashihe stations were considered in this analysis as shown in fig 1 qiaotou and zhangcun stations are located in the main steam of the east river the water flows from qiaotou station to zhangcun station with a relatively high average discharge 500 m3 s nanbeichong and huashihe stations are located in the third order stream of the west river and the water flows from huashihe station to nanbeichong station the average discharge of these two stations is relatively low 10 m3 s to analyze the responses between do and external driving factors five elements including do water temperature ph ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp were collected as the discharge data was not available during the same timeframes it was not included to perform an analysis the water temperature was used as a surrogate for hydrological activity while ph nh3 n and tp served as indicators for in channel biogeochemical activity the inclusion of water temperature and ph as candidates for drivers of do was relatively common du et al 2018 the major reason why we chose nh3 n and tp was that these two elements were the main contributors of water quality impaired conditions in china especially in the prb huang et al 2021 serious nh3 n and tp pollutions could affect the do concentration significantly the data of qiaotou and zhangcun stations were collected every two hours i e 12 data points per day while the data of nanbeichong and huashihe stations were collected every 4 h i e 6 data points per day the data ranges were 2018 01 01 2019 05 18 for qiaotou station 2018 01 01 2019 12 31 for zhangcun station 2019 10 01 2020 12 31 for nanbeichong station and 2019 04 09 2020 10 12 for huashihe station all the data had gaps the missing rates of do in four stations were 5 15 3 06 3 17 and 6 63 respectively the overall missing rate of all elements was 6 32 considering that the gap was not large and discontinuous the missing data were filled by using the linear interpolation with reference to the previous studies hensley et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 2 2 study framework the research framework of this study was provided in fig 2 and summarized in the following steps 1 calculate the average and standard deviation of do concentrations and divide the do concentrations into six grades according to the china environmental quality standard for surface water 2 identify the low and high frequency periods of do based on the real part of the wavelet coefficient and wavelet variance extracted by the cwt 3 analyze the temporal fractal phenomenon of do based on the power spectral density psd extracted by the fft 4 categorize short term transience types in do series based on the wavelet energy distribution extracted by the cwt 5 quantify the linear and nonlinear relationships between do and hydro biogeochemical elements using the correlation coefficient and maximal information coefficient mic 6 identify the responses between do and hydro biogeochemical elements by comparing their wavelet energy distributions 2 3 study methods 2 3 1 classification of do grades to master the basic variation of do china environmental quality standard for surface water was used to divide do concentrations into six grades table 1 grade i in which do concentration was larger than or equal to 7 5 mg l represented the best water quality grade vi in which do concentration was smaller than 2 mg l represented the worst water quality considering the seasonality of do each station intercepted the nearest one year data for statistical analysis to make the results comparable 2 3 2 cwt cwt an effective tool to decompose time series data into the time and frequency domains has been used to analyze the periodicity of variables in many fields lan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 its formula is as follows 1 wt a b 1 a x t φ t b a dt where wt is the wavelet coefficient a is the scaling parameter which determines how much the signal has stretched b is the position parameter which determines how much the signal has shifted and x t is the original time series following the methods of previous studies chen et al 2020 liu et al 2014 the morlet wavelet was used as the mother wavelet in this study the real part of the wavelet coefficient was used to analyze the periodicity of do and the wavelet variance was used to estimate the major periods wavelet variance is an integral of the squared norm of the wavelet coefficient in the time domain the larger the wavelet variance is the more significant the period is its formula is as follows 2 wv wt a b 2 dt the wavelet energy distribution which is defined as wt a b 2 was used to identify the transient characteristics of the do series and analyze the effects of hydrological and biogeochemical elements on do dynamics 2 3 3 fft fft is a useful tool to quickly and efficiently calculate the discrete fourier transform it decomposes the original signal into a set of sine and cosine signals and describes how the energy of a signal varies with a frequency duran et al 2020 the psd diagram extracted by the fft is the main tool used to analyze the aperiodic characteristics i e temporal fractal phenomenon referring to the previous studies jiang et al 2020 the welch approach via the pwelch function in matlab was used to calculate the psd in this study in using the welch function the hamming window was selected and the length of window was set to the length of original time series the overlap of sample numbers from section to section was set to 50 of the window length the number of fft points was set to the length of the original time series in general a time series can be considered as a time fractal or to possess temporal scaling if its spectral power s as a frequency function f follows the power law i e s f f β where β represents the scaling exponent the β value which is obtained via linear fitting of the spectrum segment with the least squares method can be used to quantify the self similarity and independence of the long term time series the larger the β value the higher the self similarity and the lower the independence and vice versa a β value between 0 and 1 represents stationary gaussian noise while a β value between 1 and 3 represents nonstationary brownian motion yang et al 2017 2 3 4 correlation coefficient correlation coefficient is effective for measuring linear relationships between variables khan et al 2020 correlation coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 with larger coefficient indicating stronger relationship between variables it was calculated using the following formula 3 r i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where r is the correlation coefficient n is the number of data points oi is the ith value of the do pi is the ith value of explanatory variable i e water temperature ph nh3 n and tp and o and p are the averages of oi and pi respectively 2 3 5 mic unlike the correlation coefficient which can only capture linear relationship between variables the mic is an effective tool to measure both linear and nonlinear relationships reshef et al 2011 this method has been widely used in the hydrological fields fan et al 2017 lan et al 2018 the basic idea behind the mic is that a grid can be drawn on the scatterplot of two variables to partition and encapsulate the correlations between them if correlations between the variables exist the mic value changes in the region of 0 1 the stronger the correlation between variables the larger the mic value in general a mic value greater than 0 3 indicates that the variables are related to each other supposing α mic r 2 the relationship between the variables is nonlinear when the α value is larger than 0 2 but it is linear when the α value is near 0 more details about the mic can be found in the paper of reshef et al 2011 3 results 3 1 statistical analysis of do concentrations the annual mean do concentrations and corresponding standard deviations of qiaotou zhangcun nanbeichong and huashihe stations were 5 66 1 68 mg l 6 10 1 46 mg l 6 74 1 54 mg l and 6 06 1 03 mg l respectively fig 3 mean do concentrations of four stations were all above grade iii i e 5 mg l the proportions of each individual do concentration categorized as grade i of the four stations were 12 72 21 00 34 20 and 9 34 respectively and the proportions categorized as grade vi were 0 98 0 21 2 41 and 0 00 on the whole both the mean do concentration and the proportion of do concentrations categorized as grade i of the nanbeichong station were the highest the seasonal distribution of do was uneven the do concentration in the dry season october march was on average of 1 45 mg l higher than that in the wet season april september the proportion of grade i do concentrations in the dry season was on average of 26 15 greater than that in the wet season and almost all the do concentrations categorized as grades v and vi occurred in the wet season 3 2 periodic characteristics of do the real part of the wavelet coefficient and wavelet variance extracted by the cwt were used to explore the periodic characteristics of do fig 4 these two indexes could effectively reveal the periods of the do series and the energy distributions of the different periods it could be observed from fig 4 that the do exhibited several low frequency periods at all stations in terms of qiaotou station the first three major low frequency periods were 108 44 and 25 days corresponding to 0 30 0 20 and 0 17 wavelet variances respectively with regard to zhangcun station the 54 day period was the most significant with a wavelet variance of 0 36 followed by 202 day and 31 day periods with wavelet variances of 0 34 and 0 27 respectively as for nanbeichong station a significant variance peak of 0 43 revealed that do exhibited a dominant 82 day period with regard to huashihe station the first three major low frequency periods were 124 67 and 31 days corresponding to 0 49 0 40 and 0 35 wavelet variances respectively on the other hand the wavelet variance also had peaks in the high frequency domains i e 1 day at qiaotou station the high frequency peak was inconspicuous among the whole range of periods while at zhangcun and huashihe stations there were obvious peaks at the 1 day period corresponding to 0 17 and 0 29 wavelet variances respectively a larger wavelet variance at huashihe station implied a stronger period at 1 day as for the half day period zhangcun and huashihe stations also had similar wavelet variances 0 10 and 0 09 respectively at nanbeichong station the wavelet variance of the 1 day period was the second largest 0 25 among the whole range of periods the wavelet variance of the half day period at this station was the largest of the four stations 0 16 indicating that this station exhibited more pronounced short term fluctuations in do 3 3 aperiodic characteristics of do 3 3 1 temporal fractal phenomenon fig 5 exhibited the psd diagram of do at four stations in low frequency domains the spectral power s decreased with the increase of frequency function f s and f followed a certain power law implying that the temporal fractal phenomenon existed specifically the β values of qiaotou zhangcun nanbeichong and huashihe stations were 1 21 1 45 1 09 and 1 55 respectively implying that the self similarities of do in huashihe and zhangcun stations were stronger in high frequency domains the psd values fluctuated strongly and exhibited several obvious peaks indicating that the do series exhibited significant high frequency periods when the frequency was 1 i e the period was 1 day the psd values of the four stations were 0 17 1 63 1 00 and 2 46 respectively when the frequency was 2 or higher i e the period was 0 5 days or less the do peaks were also obvious on the whole the results of fft revealed several interesting characteristics that was do showed 1 f fractal traits in low frequency domains and periodic traits in high frequency domains 3 3 2 short term transient the time frequency diagram extracted by the cwt was used to identify the short term transient features of do through the visual inspection of energy distributions three transience types were identified including swing referred to as type i abrupt referred to as type ii and mixed swing and abrupt referred to as type iii fig 6 highlighted several typical cases of the three transience types and their corresponding do series for type i transient features i e swing the energy exhibited an obvious cluster at 1 day or even higher frequencies fig 6c showed that the cluster was single i e single swing the corresponding energy was relatively weak about 0 4 0 5 at energy center and mainly concentrated near 1 frequency fig 6c it could be observed from the corresponding original time series that do exhibited moderate fluctuations of 1 0 mg l in size fig 6d fig 6a showed that the cluster was multiple i e multiple swings in terms of the left case in fig 6a there were double swings the energy centers of which were at about 0 4 0 7 corresponding a relatively high do fluctuation of 2 5 mg l in size as to the right case there were even triple swings with the energy centers even exceeding 1 corresponding to do fluctuations greater than 5 0 mg l in size overall type i transience always lasted from several days to months in type ii i e abrupt the energy distributions appeared as vertical and isolated lines which generally lasted from several hours to days in this type the energy centers were significantly higher than the adjacent domain resulting in an obvious and abrupt delineation as to the original time series the do showed rapid increases or decreases over short time periods the do level during type ii events even decreased from 5 75 to 1 42 mg l in a single day type iii transience was a combination of swing and abrupt which manifested as the do having a relatively large peak during the swing generally the durations of swings were long while those of abrupt events were short the time frequency diagram of do at four stations was provided in fig s1 overall type i events occurred at all four stations but especially at huashihe and zhangcun stations where the do fluctuated constantly type ii transience occurred at all four stations but the highest frequency and the strongest degree of type ii events occurred at nanbeichong station it can be observed from fig s1 f that the do concentration regularly exhibited sudden drops at this station implying highly unstable water quality as for type iii it was also a common phenomenon occurring frequently at all stations 3 4 driving factors of do dynamics 3 4 1 dynamics of do related elements the dynamics of water temperature ph nh3 n and tp were shown in fig s2 s13 and table s1 s3 in the supplementary materials and summarized as follows as shown in table s1 s3 the average water temperature and ph of the four stations were similar in terms of nh3 n the averages at qiaotou 0 37 0 29 mg l and zhangcun 0 28 0 31 mg l stations were higher than those at nanbeichong 0 10 0 08 mg l and huashihe 0 19 0 09 mg l stations all the averages of nh3 n met grade ii standard or better with regard to tp the averages at qiaotou 0 10 0 09 mg l and zhangcun 0 12 0 07 mg l stations were lower than those at nanbeichong 0 40 0 86 mg l and huashihe 0 25 0 31 mg l stations as shown in figs s2 s5 in low frequency domains the most major period of water temperature was 176 days for zhangcun station while it was 67 days for the other stations the most major period of ph was 164 days for qiaotou and zhangcun stations but 82 days for nanbeichong station and 21 days for huashihe station the most major period for nh3 n was shorter especially at zhangcun station where it was only 18 days as for the tp the period fluctuated within timescales ranging from 3 to 6 months in high frequency domains the results of cwt showed that there were regular peak values for water temperature and ph but not for nh3 n and tp implying that regular high frequency periods existed within the water temperature and ph series as shown in figs s6 s9 the s and f of all four variables followed specific power laws at low frequency domains suggesting that the temporal fractal phenomena always existed the β value ranges were 1 61 2 14 for water temperature 0 99 1 86 for ph 1 18 1 81 for nh3 n and 1 04 1 48 for tp which implied that nonstationary brownian motion was always present in high frequency domains water temperature and ph exhibited obvious peaks while nh3 n and tp did not which was consistent with the results of cwt as shown in figs s10 s13 the three types described for do transient features i e swing abrupt and mixed swing and abrupt could also be used for the other water parameters the water temperature series exhibited type i i e swing transience at all four stations but the degree of the swing was the largest at nanbeichong station as for the ph types i transience and iii transience i e mixed swing and abrupt mainly occurred at qiaotou and nanbeichong stations types ii transience i e abrupt occurred at all four stations as for the nh3 n and tp type ii transience regularly occurred with high intensities at all four stations 3 4 2 relationships between do and external elements driven by complex hydrological and biogeochemical elements do series always showed nonlinear characteristics table 2 summarized the linear and nonlinear relationships between do and the driving factors at each station at qiaotou station it was clear that do had a significant linear relationship with water temperature with an r value of 0 83 and a nonlinear relationship with tp with an α value of 0 22 at zhangcun station do was linearly related to water temperature with an r value of 0 64 and nonlinearly related to ph with an α value of 0 24 at nanbeichong station do was correlated with all four variables nonlinearly with ph and linearly with the other three variables at huashihe station do only exhibited a weak linear relationship with water temperature as indicated by the relatively low r value of 0 46 generally speaking water temperature always played a vital role in do dynamics the higher the temperature the lower the do concentration as for the ph nh3 n and tp they affected do to varying degrees at different stations furthermore the short term transience of all variables was examined using point to point comparisons along the whole time range to further reveal how external elements affected do the results in fig s1 and s10 in the supplementary materials showed that do swings corresponded well to water temperature swings in other words where there was a water temperature swing there was always a swing in do as for the ph nh3 n and tp their effects were more likely to correspond to abrupt changes on the whole swings in do concentrations were mainly correlated with water temperature while abrupt changes corresponded to changes in ph nh3 n or tp in contrast to the other stations all elements at zhangcun station exhibited multiple swings this phenomenon may have been a product of tidal modulation the pearl river estuary experiences an irregular semidiurnal tide hu et al 2011 xu et al 2019 and zhangcun station is closest to the estuary the twice daily swings of tides likely drove the regular oscillations of external elements 4 discussion 4 1 periodic and aperiodic characteristics of water quality elements in this study the periodic and aperiodic characteristics within do and four other elements were explored using high resolution measurements and spectral analysis in low frequency domains the results of cwt exhibited that obvious seasonal and monthly periods existed within the water quality series fig 4 while the results of fft exhibited that temporal fractal phenomena existed within the water quality series as the spectral energy was in line with normal 1 f scaling and no obvious peaks in the low frequency regions fig 5 considering that the time series were simply not long enough to back the periodicity up we summarized the low frequency characteristics of water quality series into temporal fractal phenomena in general the 1 f fractal phenomenon has been widely observed in many catchments chamberlin et al 2021 hansen and singh 2018 this phenomenon could be attributed to the channel filtering processes in the catchments hensley et al 2018 the random solute fluctuations could be transformed by advection and dispersion acting across a range of transport length scales to generate 1 f time series in river aubert et al 2014 kirchner et al 2000 the scaling exponents of water quality elements in this study were smaller compared with those in the potomac river where the β values were always close to 2 and eight other rivers in the midwest united states where the β values were always above 2 hansen and singh 2018 jiang et al 2020 this implied that the self similarities of water quality elements in the prb were weaker the variability of water quality elements in the prb was similar to that in the british rivers where the β values were about 1 2 1 4 kirchner and neal 2013 in high frequency domains do water temperature and ph exhibited obvious high frequency periods especially the daily period while nh3 n and tp did not fig 5 figs s6 s9 it implied that the gas related and non gas related solute signals tended to exhibit different high frequency daily characteristics which was similar to the results of hensley and cohen 2016 in general oxygen itself is a gas ph is closely related to co2 concentration water temperature can easily exchange with atmosphere these three elements could be regarded as the gas related solute signals which maintained the daily cycle through atmospheric equilibration nevertheless tp and to some extent nh3 n did not exchange with the atmosphere so there were more memory lags in their high frequency signals on the other hand nh3 n and tp were more directly related to human activities frequent sewage discharge processes might cover the daily cycle caused by irradiance easily then the high frequency transient characteristics were summarized into the three types using the energy distribution obtained by the cwt fig 6 actually the single swing in type i transience represented the basic fluctuation of water quality elements it was also observed in the potomac river jiang et al 2020 nevertheless the multiple swings in type i transience was rarely reported in previous studies which may be due to the limited availability of high frequency data and that low frequency data cannot capture it effectively type ii i e abrupt transience characterized by a sudden increase or decrease has frequently been observed in the aquatic environment and hydrological fields hernandez ramirez et al 2019 this transience could be partly attributed to sudden river pollutions such as factory discharge short term rainstorm etc these exogenous processes caused sharp increase of nh3 n and tp concentrations as a result a large amount of do were consumed and do concentration decreased significantly type iii transience as a combination of type i and type ii has also been commonly observed on the whole the fluctuation types extracted by cwt broadened our understanding on do dynamics at different time and frequency domains 4 2 hydrological and biogeochemical controls on do do dynamics are produced by a combination of multiple driving factors the results of mic and energy distribution extracted by cwt in this study suggested that do and hydro biogeochemical elements exhibited covariant relationships to some extent in the prb water temperature played a fundamental role in do variability it modulated plenty of river processes such as the oxygen solubility stratification nutrient circulation and organic metabolism etc compared with other elements water temperature was relatively stable with fewer abrupt and always fluctuated at 1 day frequency fig s10 in this study water temperature exhibited obvious linear relationships with do the correlation coefficient could reach to 0 83 it implied that higher water temperature corresponded to lower do concentration as to the transience process single swing of water temperature and do corresponded well multiple transience swings of do was rarely reported in previous studies actually it might be related to the semidiurnal tide in the prb the twice daily swings of tides likely drove the regular oscillations of do it could be observed from fig s1 s12 s13 that nh3 n and tp always exhibited abrupt transience and the abrupt transience of do and these two elements existed obvious overlapping domains implying that they were highly correlated a typical example was at nanbeichong station where the do transience was always abrupt and these abrupt changes corresponded well with abrupt changes in nh3 n and tp throughout the study period in general the abrupt transience of do over the course of several days could be attributed to the oxygen consumption processes table 2 showed that there were nonlinear relationships between do and biogeochemical elements indicating that the oxygen consumption processes driven by these elements could affect the abrupt of do to some extent while at the sub daily timescale the abrupt of do might only be caused by the sudden discharge of low oxygen water in fact variable effects of hydrological and biogeochemical processes on do dynamics over long term timescales were also found in the chesapeake bay du et al 2018 and mirs bay zhang et al 2018 nevertheless the transience extracted by the spectral analysis effectively distinguished the effects of different driving elements on do that was do swing always covaried with the hydrological elements while do abrupt always covaried with the biogeochemical elements fig 7 summarized the evolution of the three do transience types under different external drivers in general long term hydrological fluctuations always correlated with swing transience in do when short term biogeochemical fluctuations occurred the do exhibited abrupt transience furthermore external drivers could mix to form combined swing and abrupt transience in which both characteristics were exhibited simultaneously it was clear that both the hydrological and biogeochemical elements were important factors modulating do dynamics and different combinations of external drivers could affect different do transience types 4 3 application and novelty of this study with the development of measurement technologies surface water quality could be monitored almost continuously to generate high frequency multi parameter time series therefore revealing do dynamics in the high frequency scales became necessary as it could further broad our understanding on this field in general the high frequency measurements used in this study released more hidden details and further revealed the responses between do and corresponding driving factors such as the short term transience of do and its covariant relationships with water temperature ph nh3 n and tp several previous studies have been carried out to explore the do dynamics in high frequency domains appling et al 2018 bernhardt et al 2017 nevertheless the uses of spectral analysis on do were relatively not universal therefore this study provided a new insight to extract more details behind the high frequency series spectral analysis based on cwt and fft could decompose high frequency data into the time and frequency domains to further explain the do dynamics both methods for example can be also used in hydrology meteorology and other disciplines as long as high frequency data are available meanwhile several other decomposition methods can be also incorporated into the framework of this study to analyze the do dynamics meanwhile the framework built in this study was relatively synthetic it could be used to explore the do dynamics and corresponding drivers from multiple perspectives including periodicity and aperiodicity low frequency and high frequency though do transience was summarized into three types the major driving factors might be different in the prb and other catchments therefore the framework constructed in this study can be also used in other areas either similar or different to further explore the do dynamics the results obtained in other areas can be compared and the similarities and differences establish besides the high frequency measurements spectral analysis and synthetic framework the results summarized in this study were also meaningful the periodicity temporal fractal phenomenon and transient types of water quality elements deepened our understanding on the surface water quality fluctuations under different frequency domains meanwhile the results could also benefit water management and provide water security for the dense population in the prb and other basins in general managers mainly focus on grades v and vi surface water i e do 3 mg l and only in this case will they take preventive measures nevertheless several special cases should also be paid attention to even do concentration is larger than 3 mg l for instance in nanbeichong station do concentrations were relatively high while abrupt transience always occurred fig s1 it implied that the water environment was in an unstable state remaining managers to take preventive measures in advance in addition when a new do data point appears it can be integrated into the original sequence for spectral analysis so as to obtain the fluctuation characteristics according to which the main pollutants and even the pollution source can be identified effectively helping managers to conduct measures accurately 5 conclusions in this study a synthetic framework based on high frequency measurements and spectral analysis was proposed and used to explore the periodic i e low and high frequency periods and aperiodic characteristics i e temporal fractal phenomenon and short term transience of do and corresponding driving factors on the whole the results of this study exhibited both common and unique characteristics compared to other studies and significantly strengthened our knowledge of do dynamics especially in high frequency timescales the major conclusions were as follows 1 the results of spectral analysis showed that do water temperature ph nh3 n and tp all exhibited 1 f fractal phenomena in low frequency domains the scaling component β of water temperature was larger i e 1 61 2 14 implying that the self similarity of water temperature was stronger in high frequency domains do water temperature and ph exhibited obvious daily and half day periods while nh3 n and tp did not 2 the short term do dynamics exhibited three transience types type i the swing was characterized by fluctuations at 1 day or even higher frequencies type ii the abrupt was characterized by a sudden change with a peak value type iii i e mixed swing and abrupt contained the traits of both swing and abrupt transience three transience types enriched our understanding of do high frequency dynamics 3 both hydrological and biogeochemical elements affected the do dynamics do was always linearly related to water temperature while do was usually nonlinearly related to ph nh3 n and tp on the whole do tended to exhibit a swing transience when there were long term fluctuations in hydrological elements with short term biogeochemical fluctuations the do exhibited abrupt transience behavior mixing the external drivers can form mixtures of swing and abrupt transience characteristics overall several interesting phenomena of do and corresponding driving elements were captured by using the framework proposed in this study nevertheless limited by the data availability several other factors such as river discharge were not included to perform an analysis therefore several phenomena found in this study might be difficult to explain in this stage in the future more hydrological and water quality elements should be included to establish a more comprehensive picture of do dynamics in addition the effects of oxygen enrichment processes e g phytoplankton photosynthesis and re aeration from the water air interface and oxygen consumption processes e g sediment oxygen demand and respiration by organic matter on do periodicity and aperiodicity should also be considered to further reveal the responses between do and corresponding drivers

3367,understanding dissolved oxygen do dynamics and corresponding driving factors are essential to improve aquatic environments and protect aquatic organisms although several studies have been conducted to investigate do dynamics on low frequency scales high frequency spectral characteristics of do and the corresponding connections with hydro biogeochemical drivers were little known accordingly this study proposed a comprehensive framework to explore the periodic and aperiodic characteristics of do and the corresponding hydrological water temperature and biogeochemical ph ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp controls in the pearl river basin of china based on high frequency measurements and spectral analysis the results showed that do water temperature ph nh3 n and tp all exhibited temporal fractal phenomena i e 1 f fluctuations in low frequency domains the scaling component β of water temperature was larger implying that the self similarity of water temperature was stronger in high frequency domains do exhibited obvious daily and half day periods of the other four elements water temperature and ph exhibited high frequency periods while nh3 n and tp did not based on the energy distribution derived from the continuous wavelet transform three do transience types swing abrupt and mixed swing and abrupt were characterized the first type was characterized by continuous fluctuations while the second type was characterized by a sudden change with a peak value the last type had traits of both swing transience and abrupt transience through an analysis of maximal information coefficient and correlation coefficient we found that linear relationships existed between water temperature and do with correlation coefficient ranging from 0 46 to 0 83 in contrast ph nh3 n and tp generally exhibited nonlinear relationships with do and the nonlinear coefficients were above 0 2 on the whole the driving elements were different for each do transience type hydrological elements mainly corresponded to do swing transience in contrast biogeochemical elements were mainly related to do abrupt transience in general this study provided a new perspective for revealing the high frequency fluctuations of do and corresponding drivers the framework and results summarized in this study broadened our understanding on do dynamics and were conducive to river management such as water quality anomaly detection water quality prediction and regulation in advance keywords dissolved oxygen periodicity aperiodicity transience type high frequency measurements pearl river basin 1 introduction dissolved oxygen do is a vital environmental parameter directly related to the health of aquatic ecosystems an environment is considered hypoxic when the do concentration is less than 2 mg l yu and gan 2021 under low oxygen conditions a large number of aquatic organisms that are sensitive to do will die within a few days breitburg et al 2018 moreover severe hypoxia can form dead zones in aquatic environments where the aquatic ecosystem is severely compromised diaz and rosenberg 2008 therefore it is of great importance to explore the dynamic characteristics of do because such information can be used to substantially improve aquatic environments and protect aquatic organisms water quality parameters can be highly dynamic and may include both periodic and aperiodic signals the periodicity of parameters is universal and composed of low and high frequency components whitfield 1995 low frequency periods have been intensively studied in the past graziano and jones 2017 for instance zhang et al 2018 explored the monthly do variability from 2001 to 2015 at mirs bay and found that an annual cycle was consistently present recently with the development of information technology obtaining real time high frequency watershed monitoring data using wireless sensor networks has become possible rode et al 2016 thus more and more researchers have focused on the high frequency periods of do in the potomac river jones and graziano 2013 and narew river rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2015 rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2016 where high frequency measurements are available the do was observed to exhibit daily or even half day cycles for aperiodic signals long term trends related to the improvement or deterioration of water quality are well known examples these include cases like kralj et al 2019 who analyzed do over the past 30 years in the northeast adriatic sea and found that the do concentration in the bottom water exhibited an increasing trend another example of an aperiodic feature is the temporal fractal phenomenon this phenomenon was firstly proposed by bloschl and sivapalan 1995 and mainly developed by kirchner et al 2000 to assess the self similarity and independence of long term water quality time series recently this phenomenon has gradually gained interest and been used in aquatic environmental researches for instance hansen and singh 2018 found that nitrate discharge and water temperature showed temporal self similarity phenomena in the des moines river and iowa river furthermore hensley et al 2018 considered that the fractal phenomena of do and other water quality parameters could be attributed to the hillside and channel processes short term transient signals which can only be captured by high frequency data are another important aperiodic characteristic as for do such signals can be driven by nonpoint source pollution caused by short term precipitation which leads to an increase in do consumption and a decrease in do concentration chen et al 2018 in 1997 whitfield and dohan were the first to extract the location duration and magnitude of transient characteristics in water temperature and conductivity whitfield and dohan 1997 since then several researchers have begun to pay attention to the short term transient characteristics of water quality signals more recently the study by jiang et al 2020 constructed a comprehensive framework based on spectral analysis and high resolution measurements and applied it to explore the transient characteristics of several water quality elements e g do water temperature ph and turbidity they categorized the transient water quality elements into two types swing transience and abrupt transience and found that the do series was mainly characterized by the swing type transience nevertheless it remains unclear whether these two types are universal and how they may evolve both hydrological and biogeochemical elements can affect do dynamics ahmed and lin 2021 li et al 2020 hydrological elements such as water temperature and rive discharge can modulate do concentration through affecting solubility and advection transport while biogeochemical processes such as eutrophication driven by nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients can accelerate the consumption of do hu et al 2021 in the chesapeake bay du et al 2018 found that the long term interannual cycles of monthly do during 1985 2012 were mainly due to the hydrological variability caused by water temperature and biogeochemical variability related to the chlorophyll a concentration furthermore cravo et al 2020 analyzed the do dynamics at different timescales i e semidiurnal daily fortnightly seasonal and inter annual cycles based on high frequency measurements every 15 min and found that the drivers of do differed among different timescales on the whole a large amount of studies have been carried out to explore the do dynamics and corresponding mechanisms by using various approaches appling et al 2018 bernhardt et al 2017 odum 1956 zhang et al 2021 it has been shown that do series existed nonlinearity and short term oxygen enrichment and consumption processes could affect do concentration significantly wang et al 2017 nevertheless there were limited studies focusing on the high frequency spectral characteristics of do meanwhile it is still unclear how external drivers affect transient do dynamics on short term timescales we considered that the do dynamics and corresponding hydro biogeochemical regulations could be further revealed by extracting the spectral characteristics of different frequency domains accordingly a comprehensive framework based on high frequency measurements and spectral analysis was built in this study firstly the high resolution data including do and several driving factors were collected secondly the spectral analysis approaches based on continuous wavelet transform cwt and fast fourier transform fft were used to extract the periodicity temporal fractal phenomenon and short term transience of all water quality elements fft can decompose the original signal into the frequency domain juez and nadal romero 2021 niu et al 2018 cwt can further decompose the original signal into the time and frequency domains quilty and adamowski 2018 wang et al 2020 both approaches can release more data details and reveal the dynamics of variables in different frequencies dökmen and aslan 2013 duran et al 2020 finally the spectral characteristics between do and driving factors were compared together to discuss the hydrological and biogeochemical regulations on do dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the pearl river basin prb was selected as the study area fig 1 the pearl river with a length of 2 214 km and a drainage area of 453 600 km2 is the second largest river in china duan et al 2021 zheng et al 2017 it delivers a large amount of freshwater from three major tributaries i e the west river north river and east river into the pearl river estuary and its adjacent continental shelf the prb experiences a subtropical monsoon climate its annual average precipitation ranges from 1200 to 2200 mm and the precipitation has an uneven spatiotemporal distribution with 80 of precipitation concentrated from april to september in addition the precipitation in this area has an obvious decreasing trend from east to west water from the prb is used to supply the tens of millions of people in the guangdong hongkong macao greater bay area and other cities in southern china in recent years changes in hydrometeorological conditions and enhanced human activities have led to more dramatic do changes and more frequent occurrences of low do conditions in the prb xu et al 2021 which could pose adverse impacts on water and human health thus it is an appropriate area to select for the assessment of do periodicity and aperiodicity and corresponding controlling factors four water quality stations i e qiaotou zhangcun nanbeichong and huashihe stations were considered in this analysis as shown in fig 1 qiaotou and zhangcun stations are located in the main steam of the east river the water flows from qiaotou station to zhangcun station with a relatively high average discharge 500 m3 s nanbeichong and huashihe stations are located in the third order stream of the west river and the water flows from huashihe station to nanbeichong station the average discharge of these two stations is relatively low 10 m3 s to analyze the responses between do and external driving factors five elements including do water temperature ph ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp were collected as the discharge data was not available during the same timeframes it was not included to perform an analysis the water temperature was used as a surrogate for hydrological activity while ph nh3 n and tp served as indicators for in channel biogeochemical activity the inclusion of water temperature and ph as candidates for drivers of do was relatively common du et al 2018 the major reason why we chose nh3 n and tp was that these two elements were the main contributors of water quality impaired conditions in china especially in the prb huang et al 2021 serious nh3 n and tp pollutions could affect the do concentration significantly the data of qiaotou and zhangcun stations were collected every two hours i e 12 data points per day while the data of nanbeichong and huashihe stations were collected every 4 h i e 6 data points per day the data ranges were 2018 01 01 2019 05 18 for qiaotou station 2018 01 01 2019 12 31 for zhangcun station 2019 10 01 2020 12 31 for nanbeichong station and 2019 04 09 2020 10 12 for huashihe station all the data had gaps the missing rates of do in four stations were 5 15 3 06 3 17 and 6 63 respectively the overall missing rate of all elements was 6 32 considering that the gap was not large and discontinuous the missing data were filled by using the linear interpolation with reference to the previous studies hensley et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 2 2 study framework the research framework of this study was provided in fig 2 and summarized in the following steps 1 calculate the average and standard deviation of do concentrations and divide the do concentrations into six grades according to the china environmental quality standard for surface water 2 identify the low and high frequency periods of do based on the real part of the wavelet coefficient and wavelet variance extracted by the cwt 3 analyze the temporal fractal phenomenon of do based on the power spectral density psd extracted by the fft 4 categorize short term transience types in do series based on the wavelet energy distribution extracted by the cwt 5 quantify the linear and nonlinear relationships between do and hydro biogeochemical elements using the correlation coefficient and maximal information coefficient mic 6 identify the responses between do and hydro biogeochemical elements by comparing their wavelet energy distributions 2 3 study methods 2 3 1 classification of do grades to master the basic variation of do china environmental quality standard for surface water was used to divide do concentrations into six grades table 1 grade i in which do concentration was larger than or equal to 7 5 mg l represented the best water quality grade vi in which do concentration was smaller than 2 mg l represented the worst water quality considering the seasonality of do each station intercepted the nearest one year data for statistical analysis to make the results comparable 2 3 2 cwt cwt an effective tool to decompose time series data into the time and frequency domains has been used to analyze the periodicity of variables in many fields lan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 its formula is as follows 1 wt a b 1 a x t φ t b a dt where wt is the wavelet coefficient a is the scaling parameter which determines how much the signal has stretched b is the position parameter which determines how much the signal has shifted and x t is the original time series following the methods of previous studies chen et al 2020 liu et al 2014 the morlet wavelet was used as the mother wavelet in this study the real part of the wavelet coefficient was used to analyze the periodicity of do and the wavelet variance was used to estimate the major periods wavelet variance is an integral of the squared norm of the wavelet coefficient in the time domain the larger the wavelet variance is the more significant the period is its formula is as follows 2 wv wt a b 2 dt the wavelet energy distribution which is defined as wt a b 2 was used to identify the transient characteristics of the do series and analyze the effects of hydrological and biogeochemical elements on do dynamics 2 3 3 fft fft is a useful tool to quickly and efficiently calculate the discrete fourier transform it decomposes the original signal into a set of sine and cosine signals and describes how the energy of a signal varies with a frequency duran et al 2020 the psd diagram extracted by the fft is the main tool used to analyze the aperiodic characteristics i e temporal fractal phenomenon referring to the previous studies jiang et al 2020 the welch approach via the pwelch function in matlab was used to calculate the psd in this study in using the welch function the hamming window was selected and the length of window was set to the length of original time series the overlap of sample numbers from section to section was set to 50 of the window length the number of fft points was set to the length of the original time series in general a time series can be considered as a time fractal or to possess temporal scaling if its spectral power s as a frequency function f follows the power law i e s f f β where β represents the scaling exponent the β value which is obtained via linear fitting of the spectrum segment with the least squares method can be used to quantify the self similarity and independence of the long term time series the larger the β value the higher the self similarity and the lower the independence and vice versa a β value between 0 and 1 represents stationary gaussian noise while a β value between 1 and 3 represents nonstationary brownian motion yang et al 2017 2 3 4 correlation coefficient correlation coefficient is effective for measuring linear relationships between variables khan et al 2020 correlation coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 with larger coefficient indicating stronger relationship between variables it was calculated using the following formula 3 r i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 where r is the correlation coefficient n is the number of data points oi is the ith value of the do pi is the ith value of explanatory variable i e water temperature ph nh3 n and tp and o and p are the averages of oi and pi respectively 2 3 5 mic unlike the correlation coefficient which can only capture linear relationship between variables the mic is an effective tool to measure both linear and nonlinear relationships reshef et al 2011 this method has been widely used in the hydrological fields fan et al 2017 lan et al 2018 the basic idea behind the mic is that a grid can be drawn on the scatterplot of two variables to partition and encapsulate the correlations between them if correlations between the variables exist the mic value changes in the region of 0 1 the stronger the correlation between variables the larger the mic value in general a mic value greater than 0 3 indicates that the variables are related to each other supposing α mic r 2 the relationship between the variables is nonlinear when the α value is larger than 0 2 but it is linear when the α value is near 0 more details about the mic can be found in the paper of reshef et al 2011 3 results 3 1 statistical analysis of do concentrations the annual mean do concentrations and corresponding standard deviations of qiaotou zhangcun nanbeichong and huashihe stations were 5 66 1 68 mg l 6 10 1 46 mg l 6 74 1 54 mg l and 6 06 1 03 mg l respectively fig 3 mean do concentrations of four stations were all above grade iii i e 5 mg l the proportions of each individual do concentration categorized as grade i of the four stations were 12 72 21 00 34 20 and 9 34 respectively and the proportions categorized as grade vi were 0 98 0 21 2 41 and 0 00 on the whole both the mean do concentration and the proportion of do concentrations categorized as grade i of the nanbeichong station were the highest the seasonal distribution of do was uneven the do concentration in the dry season october march was on average of 1 45 mg l higher than that in the wet season april september the proportion of grade i do concentrations in the dry season was on average of 26 15 greater than that in the wet season and almost all the do concentrations categorized as grades v and vi occurred in the wet season 3 2 periodic characteristics of do the real part of the wavelet coefficient and wavelet variance extracted by the cwt were used to explore the periodic characteristics of do fig 4 these two indexes could effectively reveal the periods of the do series and the energy distributions of the different periods it could be observed from fig 4 that the do exhibited several low frequency periods at all stations in terms of qiaotou station the first three major low frequency periods were 108 44 and 25 days corresponding to 0 30 0 20 and 0 17 wavelet variances respectively with regard to zhangcun station the 54 day period was the most significant with a wavelet variance of 0 36 followed by 202 day and 31 day periods with wavelet variances of 0 34 and 0 27 respectively as for nanbeichong station a significant variance peak of 0 43 revealed that do exhibited a dominant 82 day period with regard to huashihe station the first three major low frequency periods were 124 67 and 31 days corresponding to 0 49 0 40 and 0 35 wavelet variances respectively on the other hand the wavelet variance also had peaks in the high frequency domains i e 1 day at qiaotou station the high frequency peak was inconspicuous among the whole range of periods while at zhangcun and huashihe stations there were obvious peaks at the 1 day period corresponding to 0 17 and 0 29 wavelet variances respectively a larger wavelet variance at huashihe station implied a stronger period at 1 day as for the half day period zhangcun and huashihe stations also had similar wavelet variances 0 10 and 0 09 respectively at nanbeichong station the wavelet variance of the 1 day period was the second largest 0 25 among the whole range of periods the wavelet variance of the half day period at this station was the largest of the four stations 0 16 indicating that this station exhibited more pronounced short term fluctuations in do 3 3 aperiodic characteristics of do 3 3 1 temporal fractal phenomenon fig 5 exhibited the psd diagram of do at four stations in low frequency domains the spectral power s decreased with the increase of frequency function f s and f followed a certain power law implying that the temporal fractal phenomenon existed specifically the β values of qiaotou zhangcun nanbeichong and huashihe stations were 1 21 1 45 1 09 and 1 55 respectively implying that the self similarities of do in huashihe and zhangcun stations were stronger in high frequency domains the psd values fluctuated strongly and exhibited several obvious peaks indicating that the do series exhibited significant high frequency periods when the frequency was 1 i e the period was 1 day the psd values of the four stations were 0 17 1 63 1 00 and 2 46 respectively when the frequency was 2 or higher i e the period was 0 5 days or less the do peaks were also obvious on the whole the results of fft revealed several interesting characteristics that was do showed 1 f fractal traits in low frequency domains and periodic traits in high frequency domains 3 3 2 short term transient the time frequency diagram extracted by the cwt was used to identify the short term transient features of do through the visual inspection of energy distributions three transience types were identified including swing referred to as type i abrupt referred to as type ii and mixed swing and abrupt referred to as type iii fig 6 highlighted several typical cases of the three transience types and their corresponding do series for type i transient features i e swing the energy exhibited an obvious cluster at 1 day or even higher frequencies fig 6c showed that the cluster was single i e single swing the corresponding energy was relatively weak about 0 4 0 5 at energy center and mainly concentrated near 1 frequency fig 6c it could be observed from the corresponding original time series that do exhibited moderate fluctuations of 1 0 mg l in size fig 6d fig 6a showed that the cluster was multiple i e multiple swings in terms of the left case in fig 6a there were double swings the energy centers of which were at about 0 4 0 7 corresponding a relatively high do fluctuation of 2 5 mg l in size as to the right case there were even triple swings with the energy centers even exceeding 1 corresponding to do fluctuations greater than 5 0 mg l in size overall type i transience always lasted from several days to months in type ii i e abrupt the energy distributions appeared as vertical and isolated lines which generally lasted from several hours to days in this type the energy centers were significantly higher than the adjacent domain resulting in an obvious and abrupt delineation as to the original time series the do showed rapid increases or decreases over short time periods the do level during type ii events even decreased from 5 75 to 1 42 mg l in a single day type iii transience was a combination of swing and abrupt which manifested as the do having a relatively large peak during the swing generally the durations of swings were long while those of abrupt events were short the time frequency diagram of do at four stations was provided in fig s1 overall type i events occurred at all four stations but especially at huashihe and zhangcun stations where the do fluctuated constantly type ii transience occurred at all four stations but the highest frequency and the strongest degree of type ii events occurred at nanbeichong station it can be observed from fig s1 f that the do concentration regularly exhibited sudden drops at this station implying highly unstable water quality as for type iii it was also a common phenomenon occurring frequently at all stations 3 4 driving factors of do dynamics 3 4 1 dynamics of do related elements the dynamics of water temperature ph nh3 n and tp were shown in fig s2 s13 and table s1 s3 in the supplementary materials and summarized as follows as shown in table s1 s3 the average water temperature and ph of the four stations were similar in terms of nh3 n the averages at qiaotou 0 37 0 29 mg l and zhangcun 0 28 0 31 mg l stations were higher than those at nanbeichong 0 10 0 08 mg l and huashihe 0 19 0 09 mg l stations all the averages of nh3 n met grade ii standard or better with regard to tp the averages at qiaotou 0 10 0 09 mg l and zhangcun 0 12 0 07 mg l stations were lower than those at nanbeichong 0 40 0 86 mg l and huashihe 0 25 0 31 mg l stations as shown in figs s2 s5 in low frequency domains the most major period of water temperature was 176 days for zhangcun station while it was 67 days for the other stations the most major period of ph was 164 days for qiaotou and zhangcun stations but 82 days for nanbeichong station and 21 days for huashihe station the most major period for nh3 n was shorter especially at zhangcun station where it was only 18 days as for the tp the period fluctuated within timescales ranging from 3 to 6 months in high frequency domains the results of cwt showed that there were regular peak values for water temperature and ph but not for nh3 n and tp implying that regular high frequency periods existed within the water temperature and ph series as shown in figs s6 s9 the s and f of all four variables followed specific power laws at low frequency domains suggesting that the temporal fractal phenomena always existed the β value ranges were 1 61 2 14 for water temperature 0 99 1 86 for ph 1 18 1 81 for nh3 n and 1 04 1 48 for tp which implied that nonstationary brownian motion was always present in high frequency domains water temperature and ph exhibited obvious peaks while nh3 n and tp did not which was consistent with the results of cwt as shown in figs s10 s13 the three types described for do transient features i e swing abrupt and mixed swing and abrupt could also be used for the other water parameters the water temperature series exhibited type i i e swing transience at all four stations but the degree of the swing was the largest at nanbeichong station as for the ph types i transience and iii transience i e mixed swing and abrupt mainly occurred at qiaotou and nanbeichong stations types ii transience i e abrupt occurred at all four stations as for the nh3 n and tp type ii transience regularly occurred with high intensities at all four stations 3 4 2 relationships between do and external elements driven by complex hydrological and biogeochemical elements do series always showed nonlinear characteristics table 2 summarized the linear and nonlinear relationships between do and the driving factors at each station at qiaotou station it was clear that do had a significant linear relationship with water temperature with an r value of 0 83 and a nonlinear relationship with tp with an α value of 0 22 at zhangcun station do was linearly related to water temperature with an r value of 0 64 and nonlinearly related to ph with an α value of 0 24 at nanbeichong station do was correlated with all four variables nonlinearly with ph and linearly with the other three variables at huashihe station do only exhibited a weak linear relationship with water temperature as indicated by the relatively low r value of 0 46 generally speaking water temperature always played a vital role in do dynamics the higher the temperature the lower the do concentration as for the ph nh3 n and tp they affected do to varying degrees at different stations furthermore the short term transience of all variables was examined using point to point comparisons along the whole time range to further reveal how external elements affected do the results in fig s1 and s10 in the supplementary materials showed that do swings corresponded well to water temperature swings in other words where there was a water temperature swing there was always a swing in do as for the ph nh3 n and tp their effects were more likely to correspond to abrupt changes on the whole swings in do concentrations were mainly correlated with water temperature while abrupt changes corresponded to changes in ph nh3 n or tp in contrast to the other stations all elements at zhangcun station exhibited multiple swings this phenomenon may have been a product of tidal modulation the pearl river estuary experiences an irregular semidiurnal tide hu et al 2011 xu et al 2019 and zhangcun station is closest to the estuary the twice daily swings of tides likely drove the regular oscillations of external elements 4 discussion 4 1 periodic and aperiodic characteristics of water quality elements in this study the periodic and aperiodic characteristics within do and four other elements were explored using high resolution measurements and spectral analysis in low frequency domains the results of cwt exhibited that obvious seasonal and monthly periods existed within the water quality series fig 4 while the results of fft exhibited that temporal fractal phenomena existed within the water quality series as the spectral energy was in line with normal 1 f scaling and no obvious peaks in the low frequency regions fig 5 considering that the time series were simply not long enough to back the periodicity up we summarized the low frequency characteristics of water quality series into temporal fractal phenomena in general the 1 f fractal phenomenon has been widely observed in many catchments chamberlin et al 2021 hansen and singh 2018 this phenomenon could be attributed to the channel filtering processes in the catchments hensley et al 2018 the random solute fluctuations could be transformed by advection and dispersion acting across a range of transport length scales to generate 1 f time series in river aubert et al 2014 kirchner et al 2000 the scaling exponents of water quality elements in this study were smaller compared with those in the potomac river where the β values were always close to 2 and eight other rivers in the midwest united states where the β values were always above 2 hansen and singh 2018 jiang et al 2020 this implied that the self similarities of water quality elements in the prb were weaker the variability of water quality elements in the prb was similar to that in the british rivers where the β values were about 1 2 1 4 kirchner and neal 2013 in high frequency domains do water temperature and ph exhibited obvious high frequency periods especially the daily period while nh3 n and tp did not fig 5 figs s6 s9 it implied that the gas related and non gas related solute signals tended to exhibit different high frequency daily characteristics which was similar to the results of hensley and cohen 2016 in general oxygen itself is a gas ph is closely related to co2 concentration water temperature can easily exchange with atmosphere these three elements could be regarded as the gas related solute signals which maintained the daily cycle through atmospheric equilibration nevertheless tp and to some extent nh3 n did not exchange with the atmosphere so there were more memory lags in their high frequency signals on the other hand nh3 n and tp were more directly related to human activities frequent sewage discharge processes might cover the daily cycle caused by irradiance easily then the high frequency transient characteristics were summarized into the three types using the energy distribution obtained by the cwt fig 6 actually the single swing in type i transience represented the basic fluctuation of water quality elements it was also observed in the potomac river jiang et al 2020 nevertheless the multiple swings in type i transience was rarely reported in previous studies which may be due to the limited availability of high frequency data and that low frequency data cannot capture it effectively type ii i e abrupt transience characterized by a sudden increase or decrease has frequently been observed in the aquatic environment and hydrological fields hernandez ramirez et al 2019 this transience could be partly attributed to sudden river pollutions such as factory discharge short term rainstorm etc these exogenous processes caused sharp increase of nh3 n and tp concentrations as a result a large amount of do were consumed and do concentration decreased significantly type iii transience as a combination of type i and type ii has also been commonly observed on the whole the fluctuation types extracted by cwt broadened our understanding on do dynamics at different time and frequency domains 4 2 hydrological and biogeochemical controls on do do dynamics are produced by a combination of multiple driving factors the results of mic and energy distribution extracted by cwt in this study suggested that do and hydro biogeochemical elements exhibited covariant relationships to some extent in the prb water temperature played a fundamental role in do variability it modulated plenty of river processes such as the oxygen solubility stratification nutrient circulation and organic metabolism etc compared with other elements water temperature was relatively stable with fewer abrupt and always fluctuated at 1 day frequency fig s10 in this study water temperature exhibited obvious linear relationships with do the correlation coefficient could reach to 0 83 it implied that higher water temperature corresponded to lower do concentration as to the transience process single swing of water temperature and do corresponded well multiple transience swings of do was rarely reported in previous studies actually it might be related to the semidiurnal tide in the prb the twice daily swings of tides likely drove the regular oscillations of do it could be observed from fig s1 s12 s13 that nh3 n and tp always exhibited abrupt transience and the abrupt transience of do and these two elements existed obvious overlapping domains implying that they were highly correlated a typical example was at nanbeichong station where the do transience was always abrupt and these abrupt changes corresponded well with abrupt changes in nh3 n and tp throughout the study period in general the abrupt transience of do over the course of several days could be attributed to the oxygen consumption processes table 2 showed that there were nonlinear relationships between do and biogeochemical elements indicating that the oxygen consumption processes driven by these elements could affect the abrupt of do to some extent while at the sub daily timescale the abrupt of do might only be caused by the sudden discharge of low oxygen water in fact variable effects of hydrological and biogeochemical processes on do dynamics over long term timescales were also found in the chesapeake bay du et al 2018 and mirs bay zhang et al 2018 nevertheless the transience extracted by the spectral analysis effectively distinguished the effects of different driving elements on do that was do swing always covaried with the hydrological elements while do abrupt always covaried with the biogeochemical elements fig 7 summarized the evolution of the three do transience types under different external drivers in general long term hydrological fluctuations always correlated with swing transience in do when short term biogeochemical fluctuations occurred the do exhibited abrupt transience furthermore external drivers could mix to form combined swing and abrupt transience in which both characteristics were exhibited simultaneously it was clear that both the hydrological and biogeochemical elements were important factors modulating do dynamics and different combinations of external drivers could affect different do transience types 4 3 application and novelty of this study with the development of measurement technologies surface water quality could be monitored almost continuously to generate high frequency multi parameter time series therefore revealing do dynamics in the high frequency scales became necessary as it could further broad our understanding on this field in general the high frequency measurements used in this study released more hidden details and further revealed the responses between do and corresponding driving factors such as the short term transience of do and its covariant relationships with water temperature ph nh3 n and tp several previous studies have been carried out to explore the do dynamics in high frequency domains appling et al 2018 bernhardt et al 2017 nevertheless the uses of spectral analysis on do were relatively not universal therefore this study provided a new insight to extract more details behind the high frequency series spectral analysis based on cwt and fft could decompose high frequency data into the time and frequency domains to further explain the do dynamics both methods for example can be also used in hydrology meteorology and other disciplines as long as high frequency data are available meanwhile several other decomposition methods can be also incorporated into the framework of this study to analyze the do dynamics meanwhile the framework built in this study was relatively synthetic it could be used to explore the do dynamics and corresponding drivers from multiple perspectives including periodicity and aperiodicity low frequency and high frequency though do transience was summarized into three types the major driving factors might be different in the prb and other catchments therefore the framework constructed in this study can be also used in other areas either similar or different to further explore the do dynamics the results obtained in other areas can be compared and the similarities and differences establish besides the high frequency measurements spectral analysis and synthetic framework the results summarized in this study were also meaningful the periodicity temporal fractal phenomenon and transient types of water quality elements deepened our understanding on the surface water quality fluctuations under different frequency domains meanwhile the results could also benefit water management and provide water security for the dense population in the prb and other basins in general managers mainly focus on grades v and vi surface water i e do 3 mg l and only in this case will they take preventive measures nevertheless several special cases should also be paid attention to even do concentration is larger than 3 mg l for instance in nanbeichong station do concentrations were relatively high while abrupt transience always occurred fig s1 it implied that the water environment was in an unstable state remaining managers to take preventive measures in advance in addition when a new do data point appears it can be integrated into the original sequence for spectral analysis so as to obtain the fluctuation characteristics according to which the main pollutants and even the pollution source can be identified effectively helping managers to conduct measures accurately 5 conclusions in this study a synthetic framework based on high frequency measurements and spectral analysis was proposed and used to explore the periodic i e low and high frequency periods and aperiodic characteristics i e temporal fractal phenomenon and short term transience of do and corresponding driving factors on the whole the results of this study exhibited both common and unique characteristics compared to other studies and significantly strengthened our knowledge of do dynamics especially in high frequency timescales the major conclusions were as follows 1 the results of spectral analysis showed that do water temperature ph nh3 n and tp all exhibited 1 f fractal phenomena in low frequency domains the scaling component β of water temperature was larger i e 1 61 2 14 implying that the self similarity of water temperature was stronger in high frequency domains do water temperature and ph exhibited obvious daily and half day periods while nh3 n and tp did not 2 the short term do dynamics exhibited three transience types type i the swing was characterized by fluctuations at 1 day or even higher frequencies type ii the abrupt was characterized by a sudden change with a peak value type iii i e mixed swing and abrupt contained the traits of both swing and abrupt transience three transience types enriched our understanding of do high frequency dynamics 3 both hydrological and biogeochemical elements affected the do dynamics do was always linearly related to water temperature while do was usually nonlinearly related to ph nh3 n and tp on the whole do tended to exhibit a swing transience when there were long term fluctuations in hydrological elements with short term biogeochemical fluctuations the do exhibited abrupt transience behavior mixing the external drivers can form mixtures of swing and abrupt transience characteristics overall several interesting phenomena of do and corresponding driving elements were captured by using the framework proposed in this study nevertheless limited by the data availability several other factors such as river discharge were not included to perform an analysis therefore several phenomena found in this study might be difficult to explain in this stage in the future more hydrological and water quality elements should be included to establish a more comprehensive picture of do dynamics in addition the effects of oxygen enrichment processes e g phytoplankton photosynthesis and re aeration from the water air interface and oxygen consumption processes e g sediment oxygen demand and respiration by organic matter on do periodicity and aperiodicity should also be considered to further reveal the responses between do and corresponding drivers

3368,in this work a combination of isotopic and hydrogeochemical data of a karstic region was clustered with four distinct clustering analysis ca methods to study water evolution in a vulnerable karstic region to improve protection sustainability and enhanced water resource management four ca methods including hierarchical cluster analysis hca k means km and fuzzy logic ca methods fuzzy c mean fcm and genetic k means gkm have been utilized to analyze hydrochemical chemical and isotopic datasets including dissolved inorganic carbon dic δ13c dic δ18o and δ2h datasets of water resources of paveh javanrud pv jr karstic region located at the western border of iran and iraq countries the utilized dataset contains 34 water samples with varied origination to evaluate the performance of each model and find the best method based on a meaningful categorization of geological hydrogeochemical and isotopic characteristics finally the best model results were matched graphically with developed geospatial graphs to visualize the correlation between the region s water resources accordingly the fcm and gkm methods represent the same yet meaningful results and have the best performance among the four methods it was also identified that the pv jr water resources could be generally categorized into five distinct clusters including fc1 to fc5 and gk1 to gk5 of which two clusters that have mixing two clusters with solo origination and no sign of mixing and finally a seasonal spring which is categorized as a separate cluster potentially studying water resources via theoretical methods combined with considering isotope hydrology is of particular interest since solving the environmental issues related to karstic regions and their water resource management are shared concerns in most arid and semi arid countries especially in the middle east as this study thus could lay a basis for the following scientific attempts involving hydrogeochemical studies and

the consequences of such changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change also harsher the condition and decline the availability of water resources konapala et al 2020 leading to an increase in the dependency on groundwater reservoirs more than ever this condition is also worse in arid and semi arid areas where groundwater resources are perceived as sustainable water supplies for various usages karstic aquifers procure drinking water for about 20 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2013 in many areas carbonate aquifers are considered a unique water resource bakalowicz 2015 which means there is considerable tension on these water resources on the other hand complex conditions of karstic regions such as heterogenic hydrogeological system and various characteristics regarding the complex condition of karst development ford and williams 2013 intensify the vulnerability of carbonate aquifers and highlight the importance of accurate and reliable water studies in these areas wang et al 2016 to increase the understanding of carbonate aquifers researchers generally consider different techniques environmental stable isotopes including δ13c δ18o and δ2h known as fingerprints in the hydrological cycle have gained widespread interest in water studies in recent decades clark 2015 grimmeisen et al 2017 on the other hand hydrogeochemical investigations are complementary tools to identify the main processes controlling water characteristics mainly influenced by natural processes and anthropogenic activities it also could deliver reliable information about the aquifer azizi et al 2019 mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2018 sánchez et al 2015 wang et al 2016 accordingly the combined use of environmentally stable isotopes and hydrochemistry investigations has been a powerful tool in water studies especially in karstic areas kendall and mcdonnell 2012 liu et al 2019 generally speaking graphical diagrams e g schoeller piper stiff durov etc are utilized to pragmatically interpret the hydro geochemical evolutions of water hounslow 2018 piper 1944 however they are not meant to analyze neutral chemical species such as sio2 and no3 voudouris et al 1997 it should be noted that however data interpretation by graphical methods is not regarded as the most accurate approach thereby it is proposed that using graphical techniques in conjunction with cluster based methods could pave the way to compensate for the existing restrictions of these methods cloutier et al 2008 rahbar et al 2020 vadiati et al 2019 the cluster analysis ca method can distinguish the relationship between the characteristics of the object peng et al 2015 ca method is segregated into two types of soft and hard procedures cassalho et al 2019 and each category is appropriate in different contexts considering hydrogeological systems chemical and physical continuity their corresponding statistical clusters should also be seamless for authentic interpretations güler et al 2002 consequently crisp or hard clustering is unsuitable for hydrological systems since it leads to misclassifications güler and thyne 2004 on the other hand soft or fuzzy clustering methods are more consistent for these integrated systems besides soft clustering methods could ideally differentiate overlapped data that are not decisively categorized in one cluster for a better graphical analysis it is useful to associate the clustering techniques with geostatistical methods that in turn spark a better understanding of spatial features of water resources several studies have implemented ca methods for the hydrochemical analysis güler et al 2012 güler and thyne 2004 in complex aquifers the most responsive yet best applicable method would be the combination of clustering analysis with multivariate statistical analysis cloutier 2004 interestingly the fuzzy c mean fcm clustering method is the most reported method in many water quality studies abu alnaeem et al 2018 cassalho et al 2019 rahbar et al 2020 rakotondrabe et al 2018 artificial intelligence methods have long been practiced widely in many scientific fields as well as hydrologic studies feng et al 2021 ibrahim et al 2022 oyebode and stretch 2019 rezaei et al 2021 including predicting the streamflow londhe and charhate 2010 niu and feng 2021 forecasting surface water level ebtehaj et al 2019 kisi et al 2012 piasecki et al 2018 zakaria et al 2021 and understanding water science alizadeh et al 2018 chen and chau 2019 shamshirband et al 2019 zhou 2020 as well as climate change issues ehteram et al 2018 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 some reports exist on the combined use of genetic algorithms gm and fcm for clustering applications in hydrology beskow et al 2016 while few articles combine these methods for hydrogeochemical evaluations mohammadrezapour et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that based on yang et al yang et al 2020 if the aim of the study is a long term monitoring network many clustering methods may have limitations regarding the classification of the cluster is conducted for temporal means güler and thyne 2004 this cluster analysis identifies the spatial patterns and could not reveal the temporal patterns yang et al 2020 previous studies are the combined use of the environmental tracers hydrogeochemistry and stable isotope although the results reveal some general characteristics of the water resources mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2018 mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2021 it is obvious that a deeper understating is required to unveil the hidden features of all water resources in the region since hydrogeological systems are continuous and physio chemical properties of water change continuously it is recommended to use the soft clustering methods especially the methods which are related to the fuzzy logic and could be the most useful classification güler et al 2012 güler et al 2002 moreover the ca methods could mathematically discriminate the hydrogeological hadrochemical and isotopic characteristics in which reliable results and interpretations would be achievable although some researchers applied clustering methods i e fcm km hca etc to evaluate the hydrogeochemical characteristics of water and reflect the underlying hydrochemical and hydrologic characteristics of the water resources güler et al 2012 rahbar et al 2020 none of them take advantage of genetic algorithm to the best of our knowledge this study is the first effort to assess and address groundwater evolution in a complex karstic region by comparing hca km fcm and gkm clustering methods the present study aims at i evaluating the performance of introduced methods hca km fcm and gkm to identify the main processes affecting hydrochemical and isotopic evolution in a karstic terrain ii comparing the ability of the methods and identifying the best one for the karstic terrain and iii classifying the water resources based on groundwater origin and hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics for this purpose multi tracer exploration water chemistry and stable environmental isotopes of δ13c dic δ18o and δ2h utilizing hca km fcm and gkm clustering methods were adopted due to the vulnerability and complexity of the karstic region especially in border areas accurate studies are demanded to increase the protection of the environment and sustainable water resource management 2 material and methods 2 1 hydrochemical and stable isotopes dataset to investigate and compare trends in groundwater evolution within the study area which will be explained in section 2 6 a dataset consisting of totally 34 water samples including springs wells rivers and watery caves in wet and dry seasons with detailed isotopic and hydrogeochemical information were selected from karstic outlets of pv jr karstic area mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2021 the region is a complicated karstic mountain area and the samples were collected from different geological formations that truly represent the region s features and water resources were the primary groundwater resources with the highest discharge rates the statistical parameters including mean maximum minimum and standard deviation sd of the data are presented in table 1 among conventional hydrochemical variables main parameters have been chosen based on the scientific norm previous studies the aim of the research and the local environment of the region isotopic inputs δ18o and δ2h and δ13c dic concentration have been selected to determine the origin of water and compare the mean residence time of water in the carbonate aquifer the δ13c dic concentration was also chosen as a good indication for determining the residence time of water and karst development find the origin of water evaluate the mean residence time of water and karst development evaluation hydrochemical parameters including major ions ca 2 mg 2 na hco 3 cl so 4 2 as well as total dissolved solids tds and ph were selected as the key parameters to investigate the water evolution the concentration of no 3 is also considered due to its effects on human health furthermore to independently confirm the efficiency of the analytical outcomes the charge balance error cbe in this study has been calculated by the following equation eq 1 represented by freeze and cherry freeze and cherry 1979 1 cbe cations anions cations anions 100 the calculated cbe was less than 5 with a mean value of 0 4 which agrees well with the reported criterion by güler et al güler et al 2012 additionally the main statistical analyses were also fulfilled by spss version 24 0 ibm corp 2016 and fuzme software b minasny 1999 the methodology adopted to this study is presented in fig 1 2 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca the invention of the ca method has been a significant aid for better interpretation of cluster separated data with a noticeable resemblance as a data mining approach ca facilitates obtaining membership to individual groups utilizing an n k data matrix that divides data into apparent clusters the clusters should consist of linked points which are separated by small distances between clusters the widely utilized distance procedure is euclidean distance eq 2 in the k dimensional space wilks 2011 2 x y k 1 k x k y k 2 in the hca method the ward method starts with considering n single member groups that will be combined two by two in every successive step ward jr 1963 the selected pair for merging is so that squared error of distances among points was minimized as demonstrated in eq 3 all possible methods are considered in the hca method for merging groups of two g 1 to produce g groups and ward s criterion determines the optimal pair the results of an hca can be illustrated using a tree diagram or a dendrogram ward jr 1963 wilks 2011 3 w g 1 g i 1 n g x i x g 2 g 1 g i 1 n g k 1 k x i k x g k 2 2 3 k means km clustering another proper clustering method applicable for both quantitative numerical and qualitative data or combining these two is k means clustering km as known quantitative or numerical data are the product of observation of the same experimental or physical process every observation indeed consists of n observed variables in an n dimensional vector x k so that x k x k 1 x k 2 x kn t x k r n a set of n measurements that is x k x k k 1 2 n represent a n n matrix the clustering models represent the results based on the similarities of each group accordingly the data similarity pertains to the mathematical similarity s degree considering that the distance between two objects defines their similarity thus the distance of euclidean is mainly utilized as the criterion of similarity fernandez cano 2016 xu et al 2018 in addition km is an algorithm dependent on generalized standard squared error and it uses the following objective function feil 2006 4 j x v i 1 c k i x k i v i where x k i is the distance of the k th object of the i th cluster and v i is the distance between the cluster center i and the origin of coordination the cluster center is then calculated by the following equation eq 5 5 v i k 1 n i x k n i x k a i where n i stands for the quantity of members in a i set in the i th cluster km clustering firstly classifies the objects randomly based on their similarity and continuously amends the classification to correct classification the km algorithm uses the similarities between the cluster centers and objects the algorithm then starts repeating this procedure until identified condition of convergence is met by several iterations the objective function based on squared error eq 4 considerably decreased and objects are not displaced anymore within the clusters for the km method the nearest objects to the mean of data are defined as the cluster centers in one cluster if each data point could precisely define the position of the system the km method could render a decent classification rahimi et al 2019 2 4 fuzzy c mean fcm clustering if an object could be ascribed to all classes but with varying membership degrees soft or fuzzy procedure or fcm is the best method to cauterize this object güler and thyne 2004 the fcm method was proposed by dunn in 1974 and was improved by bezdek in 1981 bezdek 1981 in fcm a dataset x x 1 x n r p is split into c 2 n 1 clusters the cluster center is also determined by v i i 1 c data splitting is then implemented by minimizing the objective function according to the following equation güler and thyne 2004 6 j fcm m c i 1 c k 1 n u ik m x k v i 2 where m c c and n respectively refer the matrix of membership the matrix of cluster center the quantity of clusters and the quantity of data points u ik is the degree of membership degree of sample k within cluster i the larger euclidean distance ed minimizes jfcm and the smaller ed brings about unity höppner 2002 the parameter m 1 is a weighting exponent which controls the classification fuzziness degree or in the other words it indicates the overlapping degree between classes m 1 means the result has a hard partition that is the result is 1 member or 0 non member as m approaches to infinity the solution converges its highest fuzziness degree bezdek 1981 soft clustering methods are chosen if meaningful and logical simplifications could be applied to a large quantity of data by considering basic patterns in the soft fcm clustering method the classes number c and the fuzzification parameter s value m are two critical parameters many functions can help determine optimal values of c and m these values are so called validity functions the applied validity functions proposed by bezdek in 1981 roubens in 1982 and xie and beni in 1991 e g fuzziness performance index or fpi and normalized classification entropy or nce were used as two validation functions according to the eqs 7 and 8 bezdek 1981 roubens 1982 xie and beni 1991 7 fpi 1 cf 1 c 1 where f 1 n j 1 c k 1 n u jk 2 8 nce h c 1 where h 1 n j 1 c k 1 n u jk log u jk fpi and nce are measured by the degree of fuzziness and the amount of disorganization in a specific number of clusters between 0 and 1 lee 2019 the optimal number of groups are then selected according to the computed fpi and nce values by the fuzme program which their results are presented in table 2 fpi and nce are minimal at c 5 with m 1 2 and m 1 25 for the wet and dry seasons respectively 2 5 genetic k means gkm clustering genetic algorithm ga inspired by charles darwin s theory of natural evolution employs the process of natural selection for searching the optimum solution and has been widely utilized in data clustering to solve clustering problems srinivas and patnaik 1994 when ga is merged with clustering algorithms more accurate yet profoundly interpretable results would be generated once compared with only conventional clustering algorithm outputs and in many data clustering cases cowgill et al 1999 for instance ga combined with km algorithm gkm was initially proposed by krishna and murty in 1999 krishna and murty 1999 gkm is particularly beneficial in obtaining a global optimal partition in pattern recognition this algorithm has been proved to converge global optimum as for gkm method the procedure for recombination operator ro and selection operator so is relatively well defined by the so search direction is controlled whereas a ro produces new territories for searching the search procedure in gkm is employed in complex extensive and multipurpose perspectives and it produces optimum and or near optimum outcomes for a fitness function which is necessary for an optimization in this research the gkm search ability was used to properly define the cluster centers locations e g centroids of geochemical data in euclidean space with n dimension thereby correctly clustering the n geochemical samples ghezelbash et al 2020 2 6 study area paveh javanrud pv jr study area consists of significantly developed karstic geological features including caves and springs this area is located at the north west of iran in kermanshah province which is placed between longitude and latitudes of 46 07 46 27 n 34 75 35 18 e pv and 45 33 55 45 n 34 51 35 04 e jr fig 2 a b the region under study which is also located along the zagros mountains annually receives up to 2000 mm of meteoric precipitation mohammadzadeh et al 2020 raziei et al 2008 the high amount of precipitation synergistically affected the karst development in the region particularly in its fault zones the presence of quri qale cave with kilometers of length and giant sinkholes and noticeable discharge of water in karst springs indicate that the karst aquifer in most parts of the area is well developed the total area is about 1750 km2 and the elevation varies from 400 m up to 3000 m amsl with a decreasing mountain altitude trend from east of the area to its west fig 2b based on the data reported by kermanshah meteoric organization the average annual temperature and precipitation are 14 8 c and 654 mm respectively accroding to the de martonne s aridity index calculation the region has a clement to humid moist weather resembling mediterranean climate most of the precipitations occur in winter february and the dry seasons occur mainly in march and april mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2018 the pv jr study areas have several important key characteristics that highlight the necessity for a reliable understanding of this region first it is a complicated highly faulted and fractured karstic region located along the high zagros mountains bult the karstic groundwater resources are the main water source for local usage of the region radiolarite formations chert shale and impure limestone from jurassic cretaceous represent the oldest unite and the quaternary deposits are the youngest units from the hydrogeological point of view the aquifers are developed in three crucial units fig 2c first jurassic cretaceous limestone known as bistoun formation jkb contains pure limestone with a high rate of discharge especially in fractured zones bil spring in the north east of the region with high discharge 4000 l s 1 ilam sarvak formation kil ksv or il sv is another aquifer limestone and dolomite and gray marls finally garu formation gr which contains gray limestone and shale is the last known karstic formation of the region mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2021 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical and isotope evolutions groundwater is greatly replenished by rainfall and is highly affected by rock weathering and evaporation that change its water quality rock weathering processes add various chemical species including ca 2 m g 2 so 4 2 hco 3 and sio 2 to the groundwater hounslow 2018 according to the hydrogeochemical results table 1 all pv jr water resources feature the bicarbonate calcite type due to having interactions with carbonate formations as investigated for both wet and dry season periods the relative ion abundance was identified to be ca 2 mg 2 na k for cations and hco 3 so 4 2 cl for anions isotopic investigations indicate that depleted isotopic values of 7 3 and 38 8 for δ18o and δ2h respectively are due to recharging by high altitudes precipitations while the water resources from lower elevations represent enriched values 6 6 and 35 4 for δ18o and δ2h respectively due to evaporation and mixing processes although the abovementioned hydrochemical and isotopic investigations have revealed crucial hydrogeochemical traits of complex karstic resources of pv jr terrestrial region the use of mathematical models such as clustering methods could increase the accuracy of such investigations which will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 hca results as for all sampling sites in both wet and dry seasons the summarized hca results are presented in table 3a the cluster averages of hca were determined as arithmetic average values of the arguments to find out the most efficient clustering method the particular distribution of each method is shown on the geological map bicarbonate is the main anion in all water samples due to carbonate formations are the significant part of the study bicarbonate vs tds is adopted as a reference plot for water chemistry assessment since the water molecules contain these two stable isotopes 18o and 2h these isotopes can be used to determine the water origination and possible reactions e g evaporation mixing possible reactions which affect isotopic content of groundwater therefore δ18o versus δ2h plot will be applicable in isotopic studies plotting δ18o versus δ2h is a common scientific practice to determine and illustrate the meteoric water line mwl and compare the isotopic content of the water resources with it hca inputs are segregated into separate groups according to their identical or equivalent characteristics based on similarities in hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions water samples were unequivocally classified by hca into five general clusters including hc1 hc2 hc3 hc4 and hc5 as shown in fig 3 the spatial distribution of hca methods is depicted over the pv jr area while simultaneously showing the scattered bicarbonate vs tds and 18o vs 2h plots ward s method ward 1963 as a linkage rule and the euclidean distance as a distance measure could successfully produce distinctive groups euclidean distance is based on eq 9 mohammadrezapour et al 2020 rmse was also selected as a performance index to show the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values in a dataset and assess how well a model fits with the data set which is shown in eq 10 9 d x v i 1 n x i v i 2 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 i n y y 2 squared euclidean distance and ward s methods were employed to measure the linkage and similarity between clusters in addition the stopping level was determined from the merged cluster intervals 3 3 km results km results of the pv jr study area and their clusters averages arithmetic mean of the arguments calculated by spss software are presented in table 3a similar to hca distinct groups with similar apparent characteristics were generated by splitting the inputs accordingly five clusters km1 km2 km3 km4 and km5 were resulted in water samples based on similarity in terms of hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions fig 4 depicts the spatial distribution of the km method over the pv jr area while simultaneously showing the scattered bicarbonate vs tds and 18o vs 2h plots 3 4 fcm results to minimize the interclusters variability of the hydrochemical data while maximizing intracluster variability to provide homogeneous hydrochemical classes the fcm method was applied güler et al 2012 the original data were used without standardization and log transformation in fcm clustering the class number c has been chosen along with the distance measure stopping criterion ε and fuzzification parameter m in addition the stopping criterion was 1 10 3 while ed was decided for measuring distance optimal values of m and c values were decided by the cluster validation functions i e fpi and nce the optimal values of clustering were defined by dividing the hydrochemical and isotopic datasets into a series of m and c values followed by categorizing various c and m values combinations from initial trial and error runs m 1 8 was the optimal fuzzification value resulting in values of membership which were neither too crisp nor too fuzzy güler and thyne 2004 in the present research considering the fpi and nce criteria presented in table 2 the optimal number of cluster number and values of fuzzification parameter were found to be 5 and 1 8 for both seasons respectively the values were then varied from 1 10 to 2 9 by 0 10 stopping level five clusters i e fc1 fc2 fc3 fc4 and fc5 were resulted by fcm method table 3b provides results of fcm clustering for water samples fig 5 exhibits the spatial distribution of fcm methods over the pv jr study area while simultaneously showing the scattered bicarbonate vs tds and 18o vs 2h plots the center of clusters are given by fuzme b minasny 1999 3 5 gkm results table 2 sums up the outcomes of the gkm clustering after analyzing hydrogeochemical and isotopic info of the pv jr karstic area gkm clusters averages are computed as the arithmetic mean of the arguments table 3b similar to the previous three methods in gkm inputs are again divided into several groups with apparent analogous characteristics based on the similarity in hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions water samples of the area under study were classified into five clusters namely gk1 gk2 gk3 gk4 and gk5 demonstratively fig 6 illustrates the spatial distribution of gkm methods over the pv jr study area while simultaneously showing the scattered bicarbonate vs tds and 18o vs 2h plots 4 discussion ultimately clustering approaches including the hca km fcm and gkm applied on the hydrogeochemical and isotopic datasets were comprehensively compared all of which resulted in five distinct clusters according to tds values of resulting clusters samples represent freshwater criteria with tds 1000 mg l 1 which agrees well with literature findings fetter 2018 the relative abundance of ions could be arranged in the following order ca mg na and hco 3 so 4 cl and bicarbonate calcite type 4 1 identification and interpretation of water chemistry the results of fcm and gkm clustering methods were used for the hydrochemical and isotopic investigations figs 5 and 6 while bivariate diagrams were used to find out the critical mechanism controlling the chemistry in each cluster the na versus cl and ca 2 mg 2 versus hco 3 so 4 2 diagrams are shown in fig 7 the clustering results of fcm and gkm are shown as scatter plot of ca 2 mg 2 versus hco 3 so 4 2 in fig 7a b respectively fcm and gkm clusters exhibited the hydrogeochemical and isotopic characteristics of the samples logically which have a reasonable correlation with the geological location of the samples to be specific fc1 gk1 groups demonstrate water mixing between jkb and il sv formations subsequently fc2 gk2 is recharged by il sv formation fc3 gk5 is originated from gr formation and fc4 gk4 is a seasonal spring with a low discharge rate the different trends observed in this water resource were influenced by local drainage with long rt of water and low water quality resulting in a deviation from other samples fc5 gk3 water resources have been originated from the jkb aquifer fc5 gk3 illustrates the best quality referring to the high discharge rate and short rt of water in bil spring due to recharging from high permeability areas rapid infiltration and a short time for water rock interaction fig 7a b the cation exchange could cause an excess of hco 3 so 4 2 and hence causes plotting of the clusters to the right hand side rhs of the 1 1 stoichiometry line whereas reverse cation exchange increases ca 2 mg 2 and leads to the plotting of clusters on the left hand side lhs of the 1 1 stoichiometry line which matches the literature reports belkhiri et al 2011 according to fig 7a b few clusters represent excessively ca 2 and mg 2 fc1 and fc5 gk1 and gk3 and are placed on the lhs of 1 1 stoichiometry line while most of the samples are placed on the rhs of the line and represent an excess of hco 3 so 4 2 which could indicate the cation exchange in the aquifer belkhiri et al 2011 the scatter plot of na versus cl and na cl 1 1 stoichiometry line fig 7c d for fcm and gkm clusters suggest that only several samples have equal na cl ratios which may refer to halite dissolution in clusters that na cl the ratio is larger than one the dissolution of na containing silicate could be the possible source of na this is also in good agreement with literature findings fisher and mullican iii 1997 processes of cation exchange in the aquifer could cause high na concentrations in contrast reverse ion exchange could decrease the na cl ratio to be less than one hounslow 2018 fig 7c d 4 2 water rock interaction as depicted in fcm and gkm clustering special distribution fig 5a d and fig 6a d the concentration of hco 3 increases by increasing tds values fig 5b e and fig 6b e indicating a significant dissolution of carbonate formation in the area of pv jr based on freeze and cherry freeze and cherry 1979 increment in tds values indicates a longer rt for water therefore this parameter was used as a relative comparison basis for understanding the rt in distinct clusters accordingly the clusters could be rearranged from short rt to long rt in this manner and as follows fc5 gk3 jkb fc1 gk1 jkb and il sv fc2 gk2 il sv fc3 gk5 gr fc4 gk4 local drainage fig 5b e and fig 6b e the relative rt of water has a direct relationship with the dissolution of minerals and as a result clusters with short travel time contain less dissolved minerals fc5 gk3 fc4 gk4 represents the longest rt for water on the other hand karst s development is crucial for the rt of water in the aquifer fcm and gkm clustering results could be concluded that karst development in jkb formation is higher than il sv and gr formations fig 5b e and fig 6b e in the following section the ionic ratio of fcm and gkm results were used to evaluate the rock type and the main processes in every cluster hounslow 2018 ionic ratios were used to evaluate the main characteristics of water in both fcm and gkm clustering methods and the results are presented in table 4 halite is the source of sodium but due to the dominance of carbonate formations the ionic ratio of na na cl is not significant hounslow 2018 the ratio of ca 2 ca 2 so 4 2 0 5 suggesting that calcite precipitation or calcium removal is an ion exchange process in the aquifer hco 3 sum of anions values also prove the carbonate weathering in all the clusters all the clusters except for fc4 gk4 represent tds 500 which refers to carbonate weathering fc4 gk4 tds is higher than 500 probably resulting from silicate weathering table 4 hounslow 2018 the main process of controlling groundwater hydrochemistry could be illustrated by the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 the fcm and gkm clustering ratios of na na ca 2 and cl cl hco 3 were plotted as functions of tds on a logarithmic scale the gibbs diagram model indicates that all the clusters are plotted in the rock weathering domain and chemical weathering and mineral dissolution control the water hydrochemistry in the study area fig 8 a b 4 3 stable isotope investigation in fcm and gkm clustering methods in isotopic studies the local meteoric water line lmwl which is based on every region s meteoric precipitation is considered as a reference baseline to evaluate different processes in the water cycle the depletion of isotopic content causes plotting on the lower part and at the left side of the lmwl whereas the enriched values plotted below lmwl which could refer to being affected by secondary processes such as evaporation and or mixing clark and fritz 2013 regarding isotopic investigations the δ18o and δ2h data of fcm and gkm cluster members were plotted simultaneously with the paveh meteoric water line pmwl mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2018 fig 9 a b the majority of fcm and gkm clusters are plotted close to the pmwl while some exhibit a degree of deviation this suggests that meteoric precipitation mainly affects such clusters while the evaporation affects deviated cluster members as it is shown in fig 9a b both fcm and gkm cluster members share the same nature origin except for one cluster member most of the jkb fc5 gk3 cluster members and the mixing jkb and il sv fc1 gk1 group are placed at the lower part at the left side of the pmwl due to well developed and high elevated carbonate formations in pv jr karstic area the precipitations infiltrate rapidly into the karstic aquifer therefore due to the lack of evaporations and low residence time of water the isotopic content in groundwater samples are depleted most of the fc2 gk2 and fc3 gk5 groups are placed under pmwl due to partial evaporation and longer water rt compared to the jkb cluster fc4 gk4 is affected by meteoric water and the evaporation caused the placement of samples in the upper part of pmwl fig 9a b the comparison of fcm and gkm clustering results of δ13c dic concentration indicates that in both methods the clusters bear a close resemblance the results also display meaningful correlation regarding the geological trends hydrogeochemical characteristics and isotopic data fig 9a b the δ13c dic concentrations of the cluster could identify the rt and karstification of distinct groups fc5 gk3 jkb cluster represents the lowest δ13c dic concentration on the contrary the fc4 gk4 has the highest δ13c dic concentration based on the δ13c dic concentration of all fcm and gkm clusters lower δ13c dic concentration could prove higher karst development due to the shorter rt of water and water rock interaction the main characteristics of every cluster based on the fcm and gkm methods are summarized in table 5 the results of ca suggest that the water resources could be divided into five distinctive groups the division was set out based on the physicochemical characteristics major ions stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and δ13c dic concentrations which illustrate four different groundwater originations and the results are summarized in table 5 evaluating the main characteristic of distinct clusters by different hydrogeological conditions and geographical locations could profoundly increase the karst system understanding and help find out the origin of each cluster with more accuracy and precision according to the results water resources from fc5 gk3 located in the east of pv with the low tds major ions δ13c dic concentration and depleted δ18o and δ2h content are considered as the most developed karst system with a short mean rt of water table 2 and fig 5c f and fig 6c f this cluster location shows good agreement with high elevated jkb as shown in fig 2b c recharging from high elevated lands and a low rate of water rock interaction is evident in fc5 gk3 the fc1 gk1 which is a mixing cluster originated from jkb and il sv in the east and center of pv the mixing cluster characteristics compared to the fc5 gk3 which had one origination without mixing shows that water rock interaction is higher and leads to relatively higher tds δ13c dic concentrations increasing the tds and δ13c dic concentrations in fc2 gk2 in the center and south of jr and fc3 gk5 clusters show a less developed karst system the seasonal spring which is individually categorized as fc4 gk4 cluster represented inordinate tds major ions and δ13c dic concentration compared to other clusters table 5 5 conclusion herein the combined use of clustering analysis ca methods in conjunction with graphical plots were employed to profoundly interpret the chemical evolution of water resources of an essential karstic region by using enriched hydro geochemical and isotopic datasets in two different seasons located in kermanshah province iran the karstic region consists of three pivotal karstic formations abbreviated as jkb il sv and gr formations it is referred to as pv jr karstic area ca approaches including hca km fcm and gkm were employed to cauterize the water datasets to reveal the water origination for better water management the comparison of ca results and geological hydrogeological hydro geochemical and isotopic characteristics of pv jr region indicates that the fcm and gkm with significant similarity yielded distinct clusters yet identical and meaningful results with improved spatial variations fcm and gkm clustering results in the pv jr area indicate that water resources could be classified in five distinct clusters including fc1 gk1 mixing between jkb and il sv fc2 gk2 il sv fc3 gk5 gr fc4 gk4 seasonal spring and fc5 gk3 jkb according to fcm and gkm clusters plotted simultaneously with the gibbs diagram models rock weathering was the significant phenomenon shared between all the clusters specifically major ions tds values stable isotopes compositions and δ13c dic concentration in fcm and gkm clustering results are well correlated based on the results of the current study it was proved that when clustering approaches are integrated with graphical methods to realize hydro geochemical and isotopic datasets an improved data interpretation with much more accuracy and precision is yielded the results of this survey could be a framework for water management programs especially in complex regions and borderline aquifers further research is needed to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each method more data is needed with a longer time scale duration multiple sampling from more sufficient sites and a longer time scale could establish more suitable input for the models and make the management plans more reliable

3368,in this work a combination of isotopic and hydrogeochemical data of a karstic region was clustered with four distinct clustering analysis ca methods to study water evolution in a vulnerable karstic region to improve protection sustainability and enhanced water resource management four ca methods including hierarchical cluster analysis hca k means km and fuzzy logic ca methods fuzzy c mean fcm and genetic k means gkm have been utilized to analyze hydrochemical chemical and isotopic datasets including dissolved inorganic carbon dic δ13c dic δ18o and δ2h datasets of water resources of paveh javanrud pv jr karstic region located at the western border of iran and iraq countries the utilized dataset contains 34 water samples with varied origination to evaluate the performance of each model and find the best method based on a meaningful categorization of geological hydrogeochemical and isotopic characteristics finally the best model results were matched graphically with developed geospatial graphs to visualize the correlation between the region s water resources accordingly the fcm and gkm methods represent the same yet meaningful results and have the best performance among the four methods it was also identified that the pv jr water resources could be generally categorized into five distinct clusters including fc1 to fc5 and gk1 to gk5 of which two clusters that have mixing two clusters with solo origination and no sign of mixing and finally a seasonal spring which is categorized as a separate cluster potentially studying water resources via theoretical methods combined with considering isotope hydrology is of particular interest since solving the environmental issues related to karstic regions and their water resource management are shared concerns in most arid and semi arid countries especially in the middle east as this study thus could lay a basis for the following scientific attempts involving hydrogeochemical studies and

the consequences of such changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change also harsher the condition and decline the availability of water resources konapala et al 2020 leading to an increase in the dependency on groundwater reservoirs more than ever this condition is also worse in arid and semi arid areas where groundwater resources are perceived as sustainable water supplies for various usages karstic aquifers procure drinking water for about 20 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2013 in many areas carbonate aquifers are considered a unique water resource bakalowicz 2015 which means there is considerable tension on these water resources on the other hand complex conditions of karstic regions such as heterogenic hydrogeological system and various characteristics regarding the complex condition of karst development ford and williams 2013 intensify the vulnerability of carbonate aquifers and highlight the importance of accurate and reliable water studies in these areas wang et al 2016 to increase the understanding of carbonate aquifers researchers generally consider different techniques environmental stable isotopes including δ13c δ18o and δ2h known as fingerprints in the hydrological cycle have gained widespread interest in water studies in recent decades clark 2015 grimmeisen et al 2017 on the other hand hydrogeochemical investigations are complementary tools to identify the main processes controlling water characteristics mainly influenced by natural processes and anthropogenic activities it also could deliver reliable information about the aquifer azizi et al 2019 mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2018 sánchez et al 2015 wang et al 2016 accordingly the combined use of environmentally stable isotopes and hydrochemistry investigations has been a powerful tool in water studies especially in karstic areas kendall and mcdonnell 2012 liu et al 2019 generally speaking graphical diagrams e g schoeller piper stiff durov etc are utilized to pragmatically interpret the hydro geochemical evolutions of water hounslow 2018 piper 1944 however they are not meant to analyze neutral chemical species such as sio2 and no3 voudouris et al 1997 it should be noted that however data interpretation by graphical methods is not regarded as the most accurate approach thereby it is proposed that using graphical techniques in conjunction with cluster based methods could pave the way to compensate for the existing restrictions of these methods cloutier et al 2008 rahbar et al 2020 vadiati et al 2019 the cluster analysis ca method can distinguish the relationship between the characteristics of the object peng et al 2015 ca method is segregated into two types of soft and hard procedures cassalho et al 2019 and each category is appropriate in different contexts considering hydrogeological systems chemical and physical continuity their corresponding statistical clusters should also be seamless for authentic interpretations güler et al 2002 consequently crisp or hard clustering is unsuitable for hydrological systems since it leads to misclassifications güler and thyne 2004 on the other hand soft or fuzzy clustering methods are more consistent for these integrated systems besides soft clustering methods could ideally differentiate overlapped data that are not decisively categorized in one cluster for a better graphical analysis it is useful to associate the clustering techniques with geostatistical methods that in turn spark a better understanding of spatial features of water resources several studies have implemented ca methods for the hydrochemical analysis güler et al 2012 güler and thyne 2004 in complex aquifers the most responsive yet best applicable method would be the combination of clustering analysis with multivariate statistical analysis cloutier 2004 interestingly the fuzzy c mean fcm clustering method is the most reported method in many water quality studies abu alnaeem et al 2018 cassalho et al 2019 rahbar et al 2020 rakotondrabe et al 2018 artificial intelligence methods have long been practiced widely in many scientific fields as well as hydrologic studies feng et al 2021 ibrahim et al 2022 oyebode and stretch 2019 rezaei et al 2021 including predicting the streamflow londhe and charhate 2010 niu and feng 2021 forecasting surface water level ebtehaj et al 2019 kisi et al 2012 piasecki et al 2018 zakaria et al 2021 and understanding water science alizadeh et al 2018 chen and chau 2019 shamshirband et al 2019 zhou 2020 as well as climate change issues ehteram et al 2018 sharafati and pezeshki 2020 some reports exist on the combined use of genetic algorithms gm and fcm for clustering applications in hydrology beskow et al 2016 while few articles combine these methods for hydrogeochemical evaluations mohammadrezapour et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that based on yang et al yang et al 2020 if the aim of the study is a long term monitoring network many clustering methods may have limitations regarding the classification of the cluster is conducted for temporal means güler and thyne 2004 this cluster analysis identifies the spatial patterns and could not reveal the temporal patterns yang et al 2020 previous studies are the combined use of the environmental tracers hydrogeochemistry and stable isotope although the results reveal some general characteristics of the water resources mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2018 mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2021 it is obvious that a deeper understating is required to unveil the hidden features of all water resources in the region since hydrogeological systems are continuous and physio chemical properties of water change continuously it is recommended to use the soft clustering methods especially the methods which are related to the fuzzy logic and could be the most useful classification güler et al 2012 güler et al 2002 moreover the ca methods could mathematically discriminate the hydrogeological hadrochemical and isotopic characteristics in which reliable results and interpretations would be achievable although some researchers applied clustering methods i e fcm km hca etc to evaluate the hydrogeochemical characteristics of water and reflect the underlying hydrochemical and hydrologic characteristics of the water resources güler et al 2012 rahbar et al 2020 none of them take advantage of genetic algorithm to the best of our knowledge this study is the first effort to assess and address groundwater evolution in a complex karstic region by comparing hca km fcm and gkm clustering methods the present study aims at i evaluating the performance of introduced methods hca km fcm and gkm to identify the main processes affecting hydrochemical and isotopic evolution in a karstic terrain ii comparing the ability of the methods and identifying the best one for the karstic terrain and iii classifying the water resources based on groundwater origin and hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics for this purpose multi tracer exploration water chemistry and stable environmental isotopes of δ13c dic δ18o and δ2h utilizing hca km fcm and gkm clustering methods were adopted due to the vulnerability and complexity of the karstic region especially in border areas accurate studies are demanded to increase the protection of the environment and sustainable water resource management 2 material and methods 2 1 hydrochemical and stable isotopes dataset to investigate and compare trends in groundwater evolution within the study area which will be explained in section 2 6 a dataset consisting of totally 34 water samples including springs wells rivers and watery caves in wet and dry seasons with detailed isotopic and hydrogeochemical information were selected from karstic outlets of pv jr karstic area mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2021 the region is a complicated karstic mountain area and the samples were collected from different geological formations that truly represent the region s features and water resources were the primary groundwater resources with the highest discharge rates the statistical parameters including mean maximum minimum and standard deviation sd of the data are presented in table 1 among conventional hydrochemical variables main parameters have been chosen based on the scientific norm previous studies the aim of the research and the local environment of the region isotopic inputs δ18o and δ2h and δ13c dic concentration have been selected to determine the origin of water and compare the mean residence time of water in the carbonate aquifer the δ13c dic concentration was also chosen as a good indication for determining the residence time of water and karst development find the origin of water evaluate the mean residence time of water and karst development evaluation hydrochemical parameters including major ions ca 2 mg 2 na hco 3 cl so 4 2 as well as total dissolved solids tds and ph were selected as the key parameters to investigate the water evolution the concentration of no 3 is also considered due to its effects on human health furthermore to independently confirm the efficiency of the analytical outcomes the charge balance error cbe in this study has been calculated by the following equation eq 1 represented by freeze and cherry freeze and cherry 1979 1 cbe cations anions cations anions 100 the calculated cbe was less than 5 with a mean value of 0 4 which agrees well with the reported criterion by güler et al güler et al 2012 additionally the main statistical analyses were also fulfilled by spss version 24 0 ibm corp 2016 and fuzme software b minasny 1999 the methodology adopted to this study is presented in fig 1 2 2 hierarchical cluster analysis hca the invention of the ca method has been a significant aid for better interpretation of cluster separated data with a noticeable resemblance as a data mining approach ca facilitates obtaining membership to individual groups utilizing an n k data matrix that divides data into apparent clusters the clusters should consist of linked points which are separated by small distances between clusters the widely utilized distance procedure is euclidean distance eq 2 in the k dimensional space wilks 2011 2 x y k 1 k x k y k 2 in the hca method the ward method starts with considering n single member groups that will be combined two by two in every successive step ward jr 1963 the selected pair for merging is so that squared error of distances among points was minimized as demonstrated in eq 3 all possible methods are considered in the hca method for merging groups of two g 1 to produce g groups and ward s criterion determines the optimal pair the results of an hca can be illustrated using a tree diagram or a dendrogram ward jr 1963 wilks 2011 3 w g 1 g i 1 n g x i x g 2 g 1 g i 1 n g k 1 k x i k x g k 2 2 3 k means km clustering another proper clustering method applicable for both quantitative numerical and qualitative data or combining these two is k means clustering km as known quantitative or numerical data are the product of observation of the same experimental or physical process every observation indeed consists of n observed variables in an n dimensional vector x k so that x k x k 1 x k 2 x kn t x k r n a set of n measurements that is x k x k k 1 2 n represent a n n matrix the clustering models represent the results based on the similarities of each group accordingly the data similarity pertains to the mathematical similarity s degree considering that the distance between two objects defines their similarity thus the distance of euclidean is mainly utilized as the criterion of similarity fernandez cano 2016 xu et al 2018 in addition km is an algorithm dependent on generalized standard squared error and it uses the following objective function feil 2006 4 j x v i 1 c k i x k i v i where x k i is the distance of the k th object of the i th cluster and v i is the distance between the cluster center i and the origin of coordination the cluster center is then calculated by the following equation eq 5 5 v i k 1 n i x k n i x k a i where n i stands for the quantity of members in a i set in the i th cluster km clustering firstly classifies the objects randomly based on their similarity and continuously amends the classification to correct classification the km algorithm uses the similarities between the cluster centers and objects the algorithm then starts repeating this procedure until identified condition of convergence is met by several iterations the objective function based on squared error eq 4 considerably decreased and objects are not displaced anymore within the clusters for the km method the nearest objects to the mean of data are defined as the cluster centers in one cluster if each data point could precisely define the position of the system the km method could render a decent classification rahimi et al 2019 2 4 fuzzy c mean fcm clustering if an object could be ascribed to all classes but with varying membership degrees soft or fuzzy procedure or fcm is the best method to cauterize this object güler and thyne 2004 the fcm method was proposed by dunn in 1974 and was improved by bezdek in 1981 bezdek 1981 in fcm a dataset x x 1 x n r p is split into c 2 n 1 clusters the cluster center is also determined by v i i 1 c data splitting is then implemented by minimizing the objective function according to the following equation güler and thyne 2004 6 j fcm m c i 1 c k 1 n u ik m x k v i 2 where m c c and n respectively refer the matrix of membership the matrix of cluster center the quantity of clusters and the quantity of data points u ik is the degree of membership degree of sample k within cluster i the larger euclidean distance ed minimizes jfcm and the smaller ed brings about unity höppner 2002 the parameter m 1 is a weighting exponent which controls the classification fuzziness degree or in the other words it indicates the overlapping degree between classes m 1 means the result has a hard partition that is the result is 1 member or 0 non member as m approaches to infinity the solution converges its highest fuzziness degree bezdek 1981 soft clustering methods are chosen if meaningful and logical simplifications could be applied to a large quantity of data by considering basic patterns in the soft fcm clustering method the classes number c and the fuzzification parameter s value m are two critical parameters many functions can help determine optimal values of c and m these values are so called validity functions the applied validity functions proposed by bezdek in 1981 roubens in 1982 and xie and beni in 1991 e g fuzziness performance index or fpi and normalized classification entropy or nce were used as two validation functions according to the eqs 7 and 8 bezdek 1981 roubens 1982 xie and beni 1991 7 fpi 1 cf 1 c 1 where f 1 n j 1 c k 1 n u jk 2 8 nce h c 1 where h 1 n j 1 c k 1 n u jk log u jk fpi and nce are measured by the degree of fuzziness and the amount of disorganization in a specific number of clusters between 0 and 1 lee 2019 the optimal number of groups are then selected according to the computed fpi and nce values by the fuzme program which their results are presented in table 2 fpi and nce are minimal at c 5 with m 1 2 and m 1 25 for the wet and dry seasons respectively 2 5 genetic k means gkm clustering genetic algorithm ga inspired by charles darwin s theory of natural evolution employs the process of natural selection for searching the optimum solution and has been widely utilized in data clustering to solve clustering problems srinivas and patnaik 1994 when ga is merged with clustering algorithms more accurate yet profoundly interpretable results would be generated once compared with only conventional clustering algorithm outputs and in many data clustering cases cowgill et al 1999 for instance ga combined with km algorithm gkm was initially proposed by krishna and murty in 1999 krishna and murty 1999 gkm is particularly beneficial in obtaining a global optimal partition in pattern recognition this algorithm has been proved to converge global optimum as for gkm method the procedure for recombination operator ro and selection operator so is relatively well defined by the so search direction is controlled whereas a ro produces new territories for searching the search procedure in gkm is employed in complex extensive and multipurpose perspectives and it produces optimum and or near optimum outcomes for a fitness function which is necessary for an optimization in this research the gkm search ability was used to properly define the cluster centers locations e g centroids of geochemical data in euclidean space with n dimension thereby correctly clustering the n geochemical samples ghezelbash et al 2020 2 6 study area paveh javanrud pv jr study area consists of significantly developed karstic geological features including caves and springs this area is located at the north west of iran in kermanshah province which is placed between longitude and latitudes of 46 07 46 27 n 34 75 35 18 e pv and 45 33 55 45 n 34 51 35 04 e jr fig 2 a b the region under study which is also located along the zagros mountains annually receives up to 2000 mm of meteoric precipitation mohammadzadeh et al 2020 raziei et al 2008 the high amount of precipitation synergistically affected the karst development in the region particularly in its fault zones the presence of quri qale cave with kilometers of length and giant sinkholes and noticeable discharge of water in karst springs indicate that the karst aquifer in most parts of the area is well developed the total area is about 1750 km2 and the elevation varies from 400 m up to 3000 m amsl with a decreasing mountain altitude trend from east of the area to its west fig 2b based on the data reported by kermanshah meteoric organization the average annual temperature and precipitation are 14 8 c and 654 mm respectively accroding to the de martonne s aridity index calculation the region has a clement to humid moist weather resembling mediterranean climate most of the precipitations occur in winter february and the dry seasons occur mainly in march and april mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2018 the pv jr study areas have several important key characteristics that highlight the necessity for a reliable understanding of this region first it is a complicated highly faulted and fractured karstic region located along the high zagros mountains bult the karstic groundwater resources are the main water source for local usage of the region radiolarite formations chert shale and impure limestone from jurassic cretaceous represent the oldest unite and the quaternary deposits are the youngest units from the hydrogeological point of view the aquifers are developed in three crucial units fig 2c first jurassic cretaceous limestone known as bistoun formation jkb contains pure limestone with a high rate of discharge especially in fractured zones bil spring in the north east of the region with high discharge 4000 l s 1 ilam sarvak formation kil ksv or il sv is another aquifer limestone and dolomite and gray marls finally garu formation gr which contains gray limestone and shale is the last known karstic formation of the region mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2021 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical and isotope evolutions groundwater is greatly replenished by rainfall and is highly affected by rock weathering and evaporation that change its water quality rock weathering processes add various chemical species including ca 2 m g 2 so 4 2 hco 3 and sio 2 to the groundwater hounslow 2018 according to the hydrogeochemical results table 1 all pv jr water resources feature the bicarbonate calcite type due to having interactions with carbonate formations as investigated for both wet and dry season periods the relative ion abundance was identified to be ca 2 mg 2 na k for cations and hco 3 so 4 2 cl for anions isotopic investigations indicate that depleted isotopic values of 7 3 and 38 8 for δ18o and δ2h respectively are due to recharging by high altitudes precipitations while the water resources from lower elevations represent enriched values 6 6 and 35 4 for δ18o and δ2h respectively due to evaporation and mixing processes although the abovementioned hydrochemical and isotopic investigations have revealed crucial hydrogeochemical traits of complex karstic resources of pv jr terrestrial region the use of mathematical models such as clustering methods could increase the accuracy of such investigations which will be discussed in the following sections 3 2 hca results as for all sampling sites in both wet and dry seasons the summarized hca results are presented in table 3a the cluster averages of hca were determined as arithmetic average values of the arguments to find out the most efficient clustering method the particular distribution of each method is shown on the geological map bicarbonate is the main anion in all water samples due to carbonate formations are the significant part of the study bicarbonate vs tds is adopted as a reference plot for water chemistry assessment since the water molecules contain these two stable isotopes 18o and 2h these isotopes can be used to determine the water origination and possible reactions e g evaporation mixing possible reactions which affect isotopic content of groundwater therefore δ18o versus δ2h plot will be applicable in isotopic studies plotting δ18o versus δ2h is a common scientific practice to determine and illustrate the meteoric water line mwl and compare the isotopic content of the water resources with it hca inputs are segregated into separate groups according to their identical or equivalent characteristics based on similarities in hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions water samples were unequivocally classified by hca into five general clusters including hc1 hc2 hc3 hc4 and hc5 as shown in fig 3 the spatial distribution of hca methods is depicted over the pv jr area while simultaneously showing the scattered bicarbonate vs tds and 18o vs 2h plots ward s method ward 1963 as a linkage rule and the euclidean distance as a distance measure could successfully produce distinctive groups euclidean distance is based on eq 9 mohammadrezapour et al 2020 rmse was also selected as a performance index to show the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values in a dataset and assess how well a model fits with the data set which is shown in eq 10 9 d x v i 1 n x i v i 2 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 i n y y 2 squared euclidean distance and ward s methods were employed to measure the linkage and similarity between clusters in addition the stopping level was determined from the merged cluster intervals 3 3 km results km results of the pv jr study area and their clusters averages arithmetic mean of the arguments calculated by spss software are presented in table 3a similar to hca distinct groups with similar apparent characteristics were generated by splitting the inputs accordingly five clusters km1 km2 km3 km4 and km5 were resulted in water samples based on similarity in terms of hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions fig 4 depicts the spatial distribution of the km method over the pv jr area while simultaneously showing the scattered bicarbonate vs tds and 18o vs 2h plots 3 4 fcm results to minimize the interclusters variability of the hydrochemical data while maximizing intracluster variability to provide homogeneous hydrochemical classes the fcm method was applied güler et al 2012 the original data were used without standardization and log transformation in fcm clustering the class number c has been chosen along with the distance measure stopping criterion ε and fuzzification parameter m in addition the stopping criterion was 1 10 3 while ed was decided for measuring distance optimal values of m and c values were decided by the cluster validation functions i e fpi and nce the optimal values of clustering were defined by dividing the hydrochemical and isotopic datasets into a series of m and c values followed by categorizing various c and m values combinations from initial trial and error runs m 1 8 was the optimal fuzzification value resulting in values of membership which were neither too crisp nor too fuzzy güler and thyne 2004 in the present research considering the fpi and nce criteria presented in table 2 the optimal number of cluster number and values of fuzzification parameter were found to be 5 and 1 8 for both seasons respectively the values were then varied from 1 10 to 2 9 by 0 10 stopping level five clusters i e fc1 fc2 fc3 fc4 and fc5 were resulted by fcm method table 3b provides results of fcm clustering for water samples fig 5 exhibits the spatial distribution of fcm methods over the pv jr study area while simultaneously showing the scattered bicarbonate vs tds and 18o vs 2h plots the center of clusters are given by fuzme b minasny 1999 3 5 gkm results table 2 sums up the outcomes of the gkm clustering after analyzing hydrogeochemical and isotopic info of the pv jr karstic area gkm clusters averages are computed as the arithmetic mean of the arguments table 3b similar to the previous three methods in gkm inputs are again divided into several groups with apparent analogous characteristics based on the similarity in hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions water samples of the area under study were classified into five clusters namely gk1 gk2 gk3 gk4 and gk5 demonstratively fig 6 illustrates the spatial distribution of gkm methods over the pv jr study area while simultaneously showing the scattered bicarbonate vs tds and 18o vs 2h plots 4 discussion ultimately clustering approaches including the hca km fcm and gkm applied on the hydrogeochemical and isotopic datasets were comprehensively compared all of which resulted in five distinct clusters according to tds values of resulting clusters samples represent freshwater criteria with tds 1000 mg l 1 which agrees well with literature findings fetter 2018 the relative abundance of ions could be arranged in the following order ca mg na and hco 3 so 4 cl and bicarbonate calcite type 4 1 identification and interpretation of water chemistry the results of fcm and gkm clustering methods were used for the hydrochemical and isotopic investigations figs 5 and 6 while bivariate diagrams were used to find out the critical mechanism controlling the chemistry in each cluster the na versus cl and ca 2 mg 2 versus hco 3 so 4 2 diagrams are shown in fig 7 the clustering results of fcm and gkm are shown as scatter plot of ca 2 mg 2 versus hco 3 so 4 2 in fig 7a b respectively fcm and gkm clusters exhibited the hydrogeochemical and isotopic characteristics of the samples logically which have a reasonable correlation with the geological location of the samples to be specific fc1 gk1 groups demonstrate water mixing between jkb and il sv formations subsequently fc2 gk2 is recharged by il sv formation fc3 gk5 is originated from gr formation and fc4 gk4 is a seasonal spring with a low discharge rate the different trends observed in this water resource were influenced by local drainage with long rt of water and low water quality resulting in a deviation from other samples fc5 gk3 water resources have been originated from the jkb aquifer fc5 gk3 illustrates the best quality referring to the high discharge rate and short rt of water in bil spring due to recharging from high permeability areas rapid infiltration and a short time for water rock interaction fig 7a b the cation exchange could cause an excess of hco 3 so 4 2 and hence causes plotting of the clusters to the right hand side rhs of the 1 1 stoichiometry line whereas reverse cation exchange increases ca 2 mg 2 and leads to the plotting of clusters on the left hand side lhs of the 1 1 stoichiometry line which matches the literature reports belkhiri et al 2011 according to fig 7a b few clusters represent excessively ca 2 and mg 2 fc1 and fc5 gk1 and gk3 and are placed on the lhs of 1 1 stoichiometry line while most of the samples are placed on the rhs of the line and represent an excess of hco 3 so 4 2 which could indicate the cation exchange in the aquifer belkhiri et al 2011 the scatter plot of na versus cl and na cl 1 1 stoichiometry line fig 7c d for fcm and gkm clusters suggest that only several samples have equal na cl ratios which may refer to halite dissolution in clusters that na cl the ratio is larger than one the dissolution of na containing silicate could be the possible source of na this is also in good agreement with literature findings fisher and mullican iii 1997 processes of cation exchange in the aquifer could cause high na concentrations in contrast reverse ion exchange could decrease the na cl ratio to be less than one hounslow 2018 fig 7c d 4 2 water rock interaction as depicted in fcm and gkm clustering special distribution fig 5a d and fig 6a d the concentration of hco 3 increases by increasing tds values fig 5b e and fig 6b e indicating a significant dissolution of carbonate formation in the area of pv jr based on freeze and cherry freeze and cherry 1979 increment in tds values indicates a longer rt for water therefore this parameter was used as a relative comparison basis for understanding the rt in distinct clusters accordingly the clusters could be rearranged from short rt to long rt in this manner and as follows fc5 gk3 jkb fc1 gk1 jkb and il sv fc2 gk2 il sv fc3 gk5 gr fc4 gk4 local drainage fig 5b e and fig 6b e the relative rt of water has a direct relationship with the dissolution of minerals and as a result clusters with short travel time contain less dissolved minerals fc5 gk3 fc4 gk4 represents the longest rt for water on the other hand karst s development is crucial for the rt of water in the aquifer fcm and gkm clustering results could be concluded that karst development in jkb formation is higher than il sv and gr formations fig 5b e and fig 6b e in the following section the ionic ratio of fcm and gkm results were used to evaluate the rock type and the main processes in every cluster hounslow 2018 ionic ratios were used to evaluate the main characteristics of water in both fcm and gkm clustering methods and the results are presented in table 4 halite is the source of sodium but due to the dominance of carbonate formations the ionic ratio of na na cl is not significant hounslow 2018 the ratio of ca 2 ca 2 so 4 2 0 5 suggesting that calcite precipitation or calcium removal is an ion exchange process in the aquifer hco 3 sum of anions values also prove the carbonate weathering in all the clusters all the clusters except for fc4 gk4 represent tds 500 which refers to carbonate weathering fc4 gk4 tds is higher than 500 probably resulting from silicate weathering table 4 hounslow 2018 the main process of controlling groundwater hydrochemistry could be illustrated by the gibbs diagram gibbs 1970 the fcm and gkm clustering ratios of na na ca 2 and cl cl hco 3 were plotted as functions of tds on a logarithmic scale the gibbs diagram model indicates that all the clusters are plotted in the rock weathering domain and chemical weathering and mineral dissolution control the water hydrochemistry in the study area fig 8 a b 4 3 stable isotope investigation in fcm and gkm clustering methods in isotopic studies the local meteoric water line lmwl which is based on every region s meteoric precipitation is considered as a reference baseline to evaluate different processes in the water cycle the depletion of isotopic content causes plotting on the lower part and at the left side of the lmwl whereas the enriched values plotted below lmwl which could refer to being affected by secondary processes such as evaporation and or mixing clark and fritz 2013 regarding isotopic investigations the δ18o and δ2h data of fcm and gkm cluster members were plotted simultaneously with the paveh meteoric water line pmwl mohammadzadeh and eskandari 2018 fig 9 a b the majority of fcm and gkm clusters are plotted close to the pmwl while some exhibit a degree of deviation this suggests that meteoric precipitation mainly affects such clusters while the evaporation affects deviated cluster members as it is shown in fig 9a b both fcm and gkm cluster members share the same nature origin except for one cluster member most of the jkb fc5 gk3 cluster members and the mixing jkb and il sv fc1 gk1 group are placed at the lower part at the left side of the pmwl due to well developed and high elevated carbonate formations in pv jr karstic area the precipitations infiltrate rapidly into the karstic aquifer therefore due to the lack of evaporations and low residence time of water the isotopic content in groundwater samples are depleted most of the fc2 gk2 and fc3 gk5 groups are placed under pmwl due to partial evaporation and longer water rt compared to the jkb cluster fc4 gk4 is affected by meteoric water and the evaporation caused the placement of samples in the upper part of pmwl fig 9a b the comparison of fcm and gkm clustering results of δ13c dic concentration indicates that in both methods the clusters bear a close resemblance the results also display meaningful correlation regarding the geological trends hydrogeochemical characteristics and isotopic data fig 9a b the δ13c dic concentrations of the cluster could identify the rt and karstification of distinct groups fc5 gk3 jkb cluster represents the lowest δ13c dic concentration on the contrary the fc4 gk4 has the highest δ13c dic concentration based on the δ13c dic concentration of all fcm and gkm clusters lower δ13c dic concentration could prove higher karst development due to the shorter rt of water and water rock interaction the main characteristics of every cluster based on the fcm and gkm methods are summarized in table 5 the results of ca suggest that the water resources could be divided into five distinctive groups the division was set out based on the physicochemical characteristics major ions stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h and δ13c dic concentrations which illustrate four different groundwater originations and the results are summarized in table 5 evaluating the main characteristic of distinct clusters by different hydrogeological conditions and geographical locations could profoundly increase the karst system understanding and help find out the origin of each cluster with more accuracy and precision according to the results water resources from fc5 gk3 located in the east of pv with the low tds major ions δ13c dic concentration and depleted δ18o and δ2h content are considered as the most developed karst system with a short mean rt of water table 2 and fig 5c f and fig 6c f this cluster location shows good agreement with high elevated jkb as shown in fig 2b c recharging from high elevated lands and a low rate of water rock interaction is evident in fc5 gk3 the fc1 gk1 which is a mixing cluster originated from jkb and il sv in the east and center of pv the mixing cluster characteristics compared to the fc5 gk3 which had one origination without mixing shows that water rock interaction is higher and leads to relatively higher tds δ13c dic concentrations increasing the tds and δ13c dic concentrations in fc2 gk2 in the center and south of jr and fc3 gk5 clusters show a less developed karst system the seasonal spring which is individually categorized as fc4 gk4 cluster represented inordinate tds major ions and δ13c dic concentration compared to other clusters table 5 5 conclusion herein the combined use of clustering analysis ca methods in conjunction with graphical plots were employed to profoundly interpret the chemical evolution of water resources of an essential karstic region by using enriched hydro geochemical and isotopic datasets in two different seasons located in kermanshah province iran the karstic region consists of three pivotal karstic formations abbreviated as jkb il sv and gr formations it is referred to as pv jr karstic area ca approaches including hca km fcm and gkm were employed to cauterize the water datasets to reveal the water origination for better water management the comparison of ca results and geological hydrogeological hydro geochemical and isotopic characteristics of pv jr region indicates that the fcm and gkm with significant similarity yielded distinct clusters yet identical and meaningful results with improved spatial variations fcm and gkm clustering results in the pv jr area indicate that water resources could be classified in five distinct clusters including fc1 gk1 mixing between jkb and il sv fc2 gk2 il sv fc3 gk5 gr fc4 gk4 seasonal spring and fc5 gk3 jkb according to fcm and gkm clusters plotted simultaneously with the gibbs diagram models rock weathering was the significant phenomenon shared between all the clusters specifically major ions tds values stable isotopes compositions and δ13c dic concentration in fcm and gkm clustering results are well correlated based on the results of the current study it was proved that when clustering approaches are integrated with graphical methods to realize hydro geochemical and isotopic datasets an improved data interpretation with much more accuracy and precision is yielded the results of this survey could be a framework for water management programs especially in complex regions and borderline aquifers further research is needed to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each method more data is needed with a longer time scale duration multiple sampling from more sufficient sites and a longer time scale could establish more suitable input for the models and make the management plans more reliable

addition soil moisture products developed at field scale resolutions 250 m have been mostly limited to shallow observations up to 10 cm depth and are impacted by land use the objective of this study was to create an accurate downscaled soil water content product at multiple depths and at a fine 90 m resolution by fusing modelled and remote sensing datasets via deep learning reference data was based on the ozflux and oznet networks covariates included the north america space agency nasa united states department of agriculture usda soil moisture active passive smap remote sensing data assimilation model sentinel 1 from copernicus surface reflectance land surface temperature and land cover from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and gridded soil properties two model approaches were used including a multilayer perceptron for the surface 0 10 cm and recurrent neural networks for the surface subsurface 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil water content the surface prediction performance resulted in a root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and pearson s correlation of 0 073 0 057 and 0 74 degrading in depth to 0 07 0 062 and 0 5 overall these 90 m resolution predictions improve on the performance of nasa usda smap 10 km resolution and the australian landscape water balance 5 km resolution simulated soil water contents land use land cover lulc are important explaining factors for performance and shapley additive explanations shap indicate high importance of nasa usda smap for surface predictions while soil properties and lulc increase in importance with depth keywords soil moisture deep learning remote sensing 1 introduction soil moisture is a key aspect of the storage component in the water budget and plays an important role in the functioning of the different ecosystems and in the water cycle mccoll et al 2017 tian et al 2017 for instance soil moisture at the catchment or regional scale modulates the flood timing wasko et al 2020 affects evapotranspiration which impacts atmospheric dynamics humphrey et al 2021 and strongly affects diffuse recharge to aquifers jackson 2002 it is also critical for agriculture since it drives farm level decisions regarding water management phillips et al 2014 hassan esfahani et al 2015 and crop production for example water irrigation applications can be matched to the crop water needs through soil water content monitoring le page et al 2020 which reduces crop water stress and increases crop yields and can improve water use efficiency therefore quantifying soil water content at the field scale is key to understand eco hydrologic processes and agricultural requirements particularly under water scarcity scenarios wang et al 2019 which are increasingly likely and common mancosu et al 2015 however given the heterogeneity of soils yetbarek et al 2020 and the limited spatial coverage of soil water content monitoring devices dobriyal et al 2012 in situ monitoring may not be representative of the overall soil water content in the field remote sensing can be an alternative to spatially and continuously monitor soil water content for instance several satellites can monitor soil water content mohanty et al 2017 some of these are the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos or the soil moisture active passive smap missions that operate in the l band microwave wavelength of the spectrum kerr et al 2001 entekhabi et al 2010 however these provide soil water content estimates at coarse resolutions 35 50 km and 10 40 km respectively and at the soil surface 0 3 cm depth ma et al 2019 such coarse resolutions are useful for regional or catchment scale studies however monitoring at higher spatial resolutions is required to capture variations related to agricultural management soil properties or localised rainfall events attempts to derive higher resolution surface soil water content monitoring have been based on radar data derived from sentinel hornacek et al 2012 paloscia et al 2013 however in this case vegetation cover affects the backscatter intensity retrieval which influences the estimates amazirh et al 2018 other approaches to improve the spatial resolution of soil water content estimates combine thermal optical satellite data through the thermal optical traapezoid model totram and the optical trapezoid model optram this last model reduces the need for thermal bands sadeghi et al 2017 with the increase in development of artificial intelligence remote sensing inputs have been combined with machine learning techniques to predict soil water content ahmad et al 2010 hassan esfahani et al 2015 amazirh et al 2018 while several studies paloscia et al 2013 el hajj et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2017 babaeian et al 2018 have applied both alternatives i e the use of high resolution satellite data alone or its combination with machine learning techniques obtaining relatively accurate estimates these have been based on limited sets of observed data monitoring points and focused on surface soil water content estimates the extrapolation to different land cover classes and to multiple locations remains a challenge bauer marschallinger et al 2018 this also affects machine learning techniques since they rely heavily on the availability of reference data and therefore combination of large datasets of soil moisture data and machine learning approaches have been developed in recent years abbaszadeh et al 2019 abbaszadeh et al 2021 liu et al 2020 karthikeyan and mishra 2021 as an alternative to developing new algorithms to directly predict soil water content from satellite bands disaggregation methods can be used to downscale the low spatial resolution of existing proven soil water content products derived from microwave remote sensing satellites for example this has been done using the dispatch algorithm malbéteau et al 2016 other alternatives use the modis optical thermal data or sentinel radar data to downscale coarse resolution images to a 100 m resolution eweys et al 2017 however most of these approaches once again are mainly focused on disaggregation of the surface soil water content and have resulted in varying performance depending on the number and location of the validation sites merlin et al 2015 fontanet et al 2018 we have found one example where dispatch data has also been used to downscale deeper root zone soil water content using an evolutionary data assimilation algorithm but this focused on a relatively small agricultural region dumedah et al 2015 given the relatively good performance of existing coarse scale satellite products in capturing the spatiotemporal variability of soil water content beck et al 2021 the now substantial number of soil water content monitoring sites dutta and terhorst 2013 isaac et al 2017 yee et al 2017 and landscape and remote sensing data with different spatial resolutions to support disaggregation of low resolution products it is surprising that disaggregation using machine learning techniques and its extrapolation to different regions have not yet been fully explored progress in this area includes work by abbaszadeh et al 2019 and abbaszadeh et al 2021 using random forests and reference stations from the soil climate analysis networks scan and from the united states climate reference network uscrn to downscale low resolution soil moisture over the continental united states of america similarly karthikeyan and mishra 2021 used the extreme gradient boosting xgboost algorithm and scan snow telemetry snotel and uscrn networks to produce multilayer soil moisture maps at 1 km resolution in the continental united states likewise liu et al 2020 tested six different machine learning algorithms and the use of local reference stations to produce soil moisture maps at 1 km resolution in four different regions building on this downscaling existing coarse scale products such as microwave remote sensing soil moisture from smap or smos or data assimilation models that use remote sensing soil moisture through machine learning tools should be further tested in different regions to develop new remote sensing global useable soil water content products these should apply across multiple spatial scales incorporate different land use land cover classes and specifically include subsurface soil water content this is particularly important since subsurface soil water content corresponds to the water pool stored in soils that contributes most to vegetation transpiration and growth the flexibility of artificial neural networks is often highlighted as a particular advantage krenker et al 2011 as a machine learning method since they can easily combine different data sources deep learning models as an extension of neural networks have been used in many research areas salman et al 2016 shen et al 2017 padarian et al 2019 fuentes et al 2020 including soil moisture mapping since these are particularly able to capture spatio temporal patterns in the datasets elsaadani et al 2021 however deep learning and neural network models are frequently referred to as black box models and therefore providing no information on the importance of covariates used buhrmester et al 2019 this means these models struggle to explain what and how climate landscape or management characteristics make soil moisture actually different at different spatial and temporal locations understanding which variables contribute the most and how these affect the models is important as this can be extended into predictions of change in soil moisture given changes in covariates based on the review in the introduction it is clear that there are two gaps worth exploring to improve predictions of soil moisture in time and space the objective of this study is therefore firstly to develop an alternative method to downscale coarse scale remote sensing derived soil moisture to different soil depth intervals at 90 m local scales across australia using deep learning models and to discuss the challenges associated with this type of downscaling the 90 m spatial resolution corresponds to the resolution of soil properties included in the soil and landscape grid of australia slga grundy et al 2015 which is assumed to be sufficient to capture important variations at the field scale for example associated with agriculture management practices secondly by applying game theory to the machine learning process using shapley additive explanations shap lundberg and lee 2017 the importance of the variables used in the downscaling and how these impact the predictions can be analysed in this study soil moisture and soil water content also referred mathematically as θ are used interchangeably to account for the water content in a volume of soil world meteorological organization 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 reference data this study used two publicly available soil water content datasets from australia fig 1 these consists of the ozflux dataset www ozflux org au and the oznet soil moisture network www oznet org au both of which measure soil water content at different depths the ozflux network consists of a series of flux towers located in different australian and new zealand regions to monitor the fluxes in different ecosystems beringer et al 2016 the flux towers used in this study are summarised in table 1 the soil moisture probes are time domain reflectometry tdr sensors installed near the flux towers however the sensors vary in monitoring depths across the network in some stations several monitoring depth intervals occur other stations have only one monitoring depth and again these observation depths vary between stations the oznet network on the other hand is a set of stations located in the murrumbidgee catchment where soil water content and soil temperature are being monitored at different depths through tdr and electromagnetic sensors smith et al 2012 fig 1 sensors in the oznet network monitor soil moisture at 0 5 cm depth yet a subset of the network also monitor soil water content at 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth given the disparity in monitoring depths among different stations and flux towers we decided to compile two separate dataset first we only selected observations up to 10 cm depth resulting in a subset of 44 oznet stations and 22 ozflux towers second we selected oznet stations with surface subsurface observations in the ranges 0 30 and 30 60 cm depth next since ozflux towers sample at different depths we standardised depth using a fist order spline to interpolate every 1 cm and then calculated the mean soil water content for the same 0 30 and 30 60 cm depth ranges this reduced the surface subsurface soil water content monitoring locations to 20 oznet stations and 14 ozflux towers in the cases where the ozflux observation sites had more than one monitoring location we obtained the average at each depth before standardising the data additionally modelled surface soil moisture from the australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l from the bureau of meteorology was sampled for some stations as a comparison to evaluate the performance of the downscaling against reference stations vaze et al 2013 2 2 input data and pre processing the model developed to downscale soil water content was based on a range of the following input data sets 2 2 1 sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar the remote sensing datasource that limits the modelling the most due to its lower acquisition frequency is the image collection derived from the sentinel 1 satellites s1 the s1 collection of images is derived from the c band synthetic aperture radar sar sensors and has been processed through the sentinel 1 toolbox resulting in calibrated and ortho corrected images filipponi 2019 level 2 scenes in the collection contain backscatter coefficients for 1 or 2 polarization bands additionally each image in the collection contains a band corresponding to an approximation of the incidence angle this collection was included since it has been widely identified that the time series of the sar backscatter intensity correlates with surface soil water content narayan et al 2006 peters et al 2012 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the s1 collection was filtered to select images that were obtained using the interferometric wide swath mode iw in a descending direction of orbit and that derive from a vertical transmit receive polarization vv these parameters were used because they maximised the number of available images subsequently the backscatter intensities were converted to decibels and pixels with less than 20 and more than 5 decibels bauer marschallinger et al 2018 mostly associated with surface water and buildings were masked out backscatter intensities and the incidence angles were both resampled to 90 m resolution by averaging the smaller scale pixels to the target resolution to estimate soil water content at 90 m resolution and a gaussian filter with a 3 pixel kernel was applied to reduce the backscatter noise the resulting collection of images was used to determine extremes in the time series from 2016 to 2021 these extremes are used to normalise the series based on the technische universität wien tu wien methodology eq 1 wagner et al 2008 1 rssm σ 0 30 σ dry 0 30 σ wet 0 30 σ dry 0 30 calculating relative surface soil moisture rssm estimates where σ 0 30 is the corrected backscatter intensity of sentinel 1 at a reference angle of 30 a value chosen due to the limited incidence angle range in sentinel 1 scenes and their relatively central position in this range σ wet 0 is the upper extreme of the corrected signal corresponding to the 95th percentile of the series and assumed as the wet condition while σ dry 0 is the lower extreme corresponding to the 5th percentile and assumed as the dry extreme of the corrected series the correction of the signal is based on a normalisation of the time series using the incidence angle i e the angle between the sar incidence beam and a perpendicular line to the surface at the point of incidence which extrapolates the backscatter observations such that 2 σ 0 30 σ 0 θ β θ 30 o where σ 0 θ is the backscatter intensity at the incidence angle θ with β being the slope of a linear regression between the backscatter intensity and the incidence angle the rssm images were subsequently appended as additional bands to the backscatter intensity band referred to as vv from the s1 collection 2 2 2 modis surface reflectance and land surface temperature as further inputs the surface reflectance sr and the land surface temperature lst bands from the terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 8 day composite surface reflectance mod09a1 and land surface temperature and emissivity mod11a2 datasets were stacked together the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated from the modis sr data through 3 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ nir and ρ red correspond to the reflectances in the near infrared 841 876 nm and red 620 670 nm wavelength spectrum from the modis products respectively the ndvi could also be directly obtained from the mod13 collections which contains different vegetation index bands including ndvi the resulting ndvi was then appended to the bands of modis and these were added to the data resulting from the s1 images based on the date range of the modis 8 days composite images surface reflectance bands referred to as modisi for each band where i is the band name were used because they can shed light on the vegetation status which might reflect the soil water content in soils while lst has also been related to soil water content pablos et al 2016 2 2 3 nasa usda smap soil moisture and chirps rainfall soil moisture rasters from the national aeronautics and space administration united states department of agriculture nasa usda soil moisture active passive smap data assimilation model which have a 3 day frequency and a spatial resolution of 10 km were also used as covariates for the downscaling approach these rasters are produced through the integration of level 3 smap soil moisture observations applying a 1 d ensemble kalman filter in combination with a modified two layer palmer model mladenova et al 2020 which is a water budget model widely used for drought monitoring based on the acquisition date of the s1 images a backward in time window of up to 33 days was used to download sequences of 10 surface and subsurface nasa usda smap images smap tx and ssmap tx respectively being x negative integers from 10 to 0 referring to the backward lagged sequence additionally since rainfall is an input in the hydrologic cycle affecting soil moisture daily rainfall rasters from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 were also included as covariates for the development of the downscaling models chirps rasters were aggregated to the nasa usda smap frequency and combined with the smap collection of images to obtain a sequence of 10 backward rainfall images until the capture of the s1 images the series of lagged rainfall and lagged low resolution soil moisture were converted into multiband images which were subsequently stacked with the s1 processed images and the modis covariates 2 2 4 soil properties and land use land cover lulc in addition the following datasets were used as ancillary input rasters and stacked as multibands with the final input images 1 soil information from the soil and landscape grid of australia slga including modelled clay content clay modelled soil organic carbon soc and modelled available water capacity awc at 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth and at 90 m spatial resolution grundy et al 2015 the soil covariates were also referred to as xxxy z in this study being xxx the soil property i e clay soc or awc while y z corresponds to the depth interval of estimates these properties stored as covariate bands were included because they affect or are indicative of the water retention capacity of soils 2 lulc often relates to different vegetation types and different agricultural practices which are known to affect the soil water status therefore a reclassified lulc map containing 5 classes including irrigated areas rainfed agriculture pasture forest and savannah shrubland referred also to as irrigation agri rainfed pasture forest and savannah respectively was generated combining the mode of the distribution of the 2016 2020 annual international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification rasters from modis mcd12q1 sulla menashe and friedl 2018 and the australian collaborative land use and management program lesslie et al 2006 version 8 map the resulting rasters were stacked together into a time series of multiband images containing all different covariates and covering the 2016 2021 period the multiband image collection of covariates predictors for the study period was sampled using the reference stations at different dates since most inputs correspond to time observations and given the temporal resolution of the less frequent data s1 we assumed those observations as independent all samples containing empty records in any of the input variables were dropped this led to 8 023 and 4 135 samples for the prediction of surface and surface subsurface soil water content respectively these samples were used as inputs for the models 2 3 model description two different approaches were used for modelling soil moisture at different depth intervals using artificial neural network models these approaches are based on the use of different architectures and hyperparameters and they also require the selection of a loss function all of which are described below 2 3 1 loss function the loss function used in the models is the concordance correlation coefficient ρ c pandit and schuller 2019 4 ρ c 2 s xy s x 2 s y 2 x y 2 where s x 2 and s y 2 are the variances for x the actual soil moisture and y the predicted soil moisture x and y are the mean of observed and predicted data while s xy is the covariance 5 s xy 1 n i i n x i x y i y here n x i and y i are the number of observations the observed soil moisture for record i and the predicted soil moisture respectively then 1 ρ c was used as the loss function because it corresponds to a normalised metric that evaluates the distance of the data to the 45 degree line therefore it combines the ability to capture temporal patterns and the reduction of errors in the time series 2 3 2 downscaling surface soil moisture model the first approach consisted of a multilayer perceptron mlp model using four dense layers of 128 64 32 16 neurons with one output to model surface soil moisture 0 10 cm depth fig 2 a all layers used rectified linear unit activators relu and a maximum was set to 1 in the output layer since soil water content values must be below 1 cm3 cm 3 additionally an adam optimiser kingma and ba 2014 was used and the learning rate the batch size and the number of epochs were tested to produce a smooth learning curve resulting in settings of 3e 5 256 and 500 respectively however an early stop threshold was inserted based on the validation loss halting the training if more than 20 epochs did not lead to any improvement this was implemented to avoid over fitting the model 2 3 3 downscaling surface subsurface soil moisture model the second approach was developed for surface subsurface soil moisture modelling predicting at two simultaneous depth intervals 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm in this case two model implementations were tested firstly a mlp model with 5 dense layers of 100 100 100 50 and 25 neurons and with an output layer of two dimensions predicting the surface and subsurface simultaneously additionally a second model was evaluated containing one bidirectional long short term memory layer lstm fed by the lagged variables with a 3 x 10 shape surface and subsurface smap and chirps and passing through a dense layer of size 100 this was concatenated with the input layer of the remaining variables and passed through 4 dense layers of 128 64 32 16 neurons until the output layer of two dimensions fig 2b both alternative models used 150 epochs but and early stop threshold of 10 epochs was applied the concatenation of the lstm and the dense layers was tested since it is known that soil water content at depth may be delayed and attenuated relative to surface changes in soil water content which might be captured through recurrent neural network layers considering the 3 day frequency of smap the same activators and optimizer applied in the surface modelling approach were used however a fine tuning of the learning rate decay batch size and epsilon numerical stability hyperparameters was carried out in one station by running 10 models in each case and averaging the results fig 3 given the overall best performance of the concatenation of lstm and dense layers compared against the model with only dense layers in the surface subsurface modelling approach best mean rmse mae pearson s correlation and 1 ρ c of 0 039 0 034 0 68 and 0 45 compared against 0 036 0 03 0 57 and 0 56 respectively we selected the earlier for further analysis fine tuned learning rate decay batch size and epsilon hyperparameters of 0 003 0 8 100 and 1e 08 were used respectively 2 4 validation interpretability and performance in order to evaluate the modelling of soil moisture we utilised a leave one out cross validation this validation scheme involves training the model with all the stations except for one station randomly selected as the validation subset and another station selected as test subset and repeating this for all the stations which means that it characterises the overall performance of the model in the spatial and temporal dimensions by predicting the entire series of independent stations for each station 10 repetitions of the model were run and the average prediction was used an interpretation of the model was based on the shapley additive explantions shap library implemented in python lundberg and lee 2017 shap uses shapley values from game theory to interpret different models evaluating among others the contribution of different covariates padarian et al 2020 shap achieves this by creating multiple models applying sampling approximations to the marginal contributions of covariates and changing the samples in the training dataset trying to emulate the consequence of removing covariates shap values were obtained from the average of 10 models trained with a k fold cross validation in addition to evaluate the importance and distribution of aggregated covariates shap values were summed across the different time lags and soil depths in covariates an area of interest that combines forests under sandy soils pilliga forest and alluvial soils with agriculture irrigated and rainfed was selected to create example maps of predicted soil water content and associated uncertainties this area was selected as this highlights different soil textural classes and lulc three dates were selected from sampling the palmer drought severity index pdsi bands from the terraclimate collection abatzoglou et al 2018 these dates were chosen identifying three peaks representing contrasting wet and dry conditions fig 4 performance was evaluated for 1 the surface and subsurface nasa usda smap soil water content predictions assuming soil depths in the nasa usda smap modelled data to be 5 cm and 40 cm respectively representing a maximum of 25 mm and 275 mm of water holding capacity 2 the awra l surface soil moisture predictions and 3 both artificial neural network models trained for surface and surface subsurface soil moisture downscaling the performance was evaluated through the pearson correlation coefficient r xy 6 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 and through the calculation of the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse 7 mae i 1 n y i x i n 8 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n additionally prediction performance for different soil water content stations was aggregated into land use land cover lulc classes to evaluate differences among classes using the non parametric kruskal wallis test finally the uncertainty of the modelling approaches was evaluated using the leave one out cross validation and estimating the 5th and 95th prediction percentiles across the stations these were then subtracted to get the 90th confidence interval of predictions from 66 and 34 different models in the surface and surface subsurface downscaling approaches respectively one per reference station 3 results 3 1 performance of nasa usda smap against reference data performance of nasa usda smap soil water content predictions for surface and subsurface are in fig 5 mean rmse mae and correlation for the surface 10 km resolution smap predictions are 0 11 0 08 and 0 70 respectively despite the low spatial resolution of derived smap data it captures the dynamics of surface soil water content quite well which translates into high correlation values similarly the performance for the subsurface soil water content predictions degrades quite substantially especially in terms of errors leading to average rmse mae and correlation of 0 17 0 16 and 0 53 3 2 soil moisture modelling and performance the average learning curve for modelling soil moisture in the surface is in fig 6 it is clear that the spatial and temporal prediction is quite challenging even though the model learns smoothly there is an underlying limit in the validation loss around a ρ c of 0 6 1 ρ c of 0 4 predicting one location from all other locations which do not necessarily cover the entire spatial variability of soils results in a threshold in the prediction performance of the models the spatial distribution of the performance of surface soil moisture modelling using the different stations is in fig 7 pearson correlations are quite variable ranging from 0 14 up to 0 92 however most locations are in the range of 0 60 0 92 furthermore the rmses range from 0 02 up to 0 25 with most stations in the range of 0 02 to 0 11 time series of observed nasa usda smap predictions awra l predictions and our predictions of surface soil moisture are in fig 8 for five example cases based on the leave one out cross validation example cases show that our model predictions follow the temporal patterns of soil moisture which translates into r2 between 0 69 and 0 86 awra l predictions grey line on the other hand show a limited performance at the five stations compared against our surface model with mean rmse mae and pearson correlation of 0 13 0 11 and 0 51 respectively on the other hand nasa usda smap predictions capture the soil moisture dynamic quite well and lead also to small errors the distribution of surface and surface subsurface soil moisture errors and correlations is in fig 9 in general terms the mean rmse mae and pearson correlations of surface soil water content predictions for the 66 stations are 0 073 0 057 and 0 74 respectively this is an overall improvement relative to the nasa usda smap especially in terms of a reduction of errors rmse and mae however predicting soil water contents at depths 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm also leads to a degradation of the model performance to mean rmse mae and correlations of 0 07 0 062 and 0 50 even if correlations reduce slightly compared to the derived smap data in the 30 60 cm depth errors reduce significantly fig 5 this degradation of performance with depth also leads to a progressively larger dispersion in the correlations 3 3 lulc and soil water content table 2 highlights the statistics for predicting surface soil water content for different lulc categories in terms of averages and standard deviations the different categories indicate large variation in the number of stations that are aggregated with the pasture lands covering the most stations while forests had the least in addition greater pearson correlation values are related to pasture and irrigation however the lowest errors occur in savannas and shrublands significant differences among classes were found for all performance metrics similarly the performance of downscaled surface subsurface soil water content aggregated by lulc is in table 3 in this case due to data limitations the number of stations in each class are reduced for all classes while in some cases such as under rainfed agriculture and in pastures errors reduce slightly the general trend is a reduction in the correlations which suggests a decrease in performance with depth in contrast with the surface soil water content modelling significant differences between lulc classes in the surface subsurface downscaling were found only in correlation values at 30 60 cm monitoring depths 3 4 model interpretability the importance of the covariates for the surface and surface subsurface prediction in descending order of importance from the top of the plot and shap values fig 10 show that remote sensing soil moisture soil attributes and lulc are the most important variables that determine the variation in the soil moisture prediction in space and time however when downscaling soil moisture for deeper soil depths sentinel 1 data increases in importance for predictions in general the models capture the positive relationship between clay content and soil moisture and rssm derived from s1 and soil moisture however the relationship between soil moisture and lagged remote sensing predicted soil moisture depends on the lag between the remote sensing product and the observations a similar behaviour is observed with subsurface smap where there is a direct relationship for the first lags additionally soc in the range of 5 60 cm depth indicate a direct relationship with surface soil moisture interestingly rainfed agriculture agri rainfed and irrigation lulc classes have a negative relationship with surface soil moisture the scenario changes for the surface subsurface predictions where the spread of shap values reduces considerably and soil properties clay content and available water capacity are more important forest cover directly affects the predicted values similar to pastures in the case of irrigated land use this land cover type actually indicates a negative relationship with soil water content it is also noteworthy the fact that surface reflectance bands do not play an important role as covariates for the model only short wave infrared band 2 from modis modis swir 2 appears among the top 20 covariates and this only applies for the surface subsurface model aggregated shap values are in fig 11 the two most important covariates for surface soil moisture predictions correspond to remotely sensed soil moisture products smap and ssmap these are followed by soil properties such as clay and soc content rainfall data does not play an important role in this modelling approach most probably because it is obscured by smap sentinel 1 data and the estimated rssm also seem to have a small influence similar to surface reflectance and land surface temperature data from modis the importance of the aggregated covariates changes for the surface subsurface modelling approach here clay has the greatest importance while soc decreases in importance relative to the surface downscaling model in contrast the influence of lulc and modis sr increases 3 5 mapping soil water content and uncertainties maps of predicted surface soil water content and associated uncertainties for three different dates of contrasting dry and wet conditions and at two zoom levels can be found in fig 12 the surface soil water content model correctly captures the temporal moisture patterns given the dryness conditions in the different predicted scenes the sandier soils located in southern areas and in the forest tend to store less water than clayey alluvial soils in the northern areas flood paths in the area of interest can also be observed as areas with lower soil water content under dry conditions most likely because they are also sandier the 90 confidence interval ranges between 0 and 0 3 cm3 cm 3 increasing in wet conditions similarly the surface subsurface soil water content predictions and associated uncertainties are in fig 13 these predictions show similar temporal and spatial patterns to the previously observed soil water content predictions in subsurface 30 60 cm are higher than those observed in surface 0 30 cm uncertainties increase compared with the surface downscaled predictions fig 12 4 discussion soil water content being the stock of water in soils is important for the ecosystems and agricultural regions daly and porporato 2005 phillips et al 2014 however there are multiple factors affecting its dynamics these include the water input rainfall irrigation and capillary movement soil properties including the texture and structure of soils and water outputs driven by subsurface drainage evaporative conditions and by transpiration related to vegetation mccoll et al 2017 in this study soil water content downscaling strongly relies on derived remote sensing soil moisture but soil properties and lulc also play a strong role which gains preponderance when coping with surface subsurface soil water content modelling soil texture is well known to govern the water retention in soils and also influences the separation between matrix and preferential flows fuentes et al 2015 these may contribute to large heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties making soil water content predictions difficult due to the fact that microwave satellites in the x c and l bands can detect the dielectric soil properties at the earth s surface mohanty et al 2017 derived microwave remote sensing datasets tend to be ranked highest among the covariates to predict surface soil water content however the observation capacity of these satellites is limited in depth in both downscaling approaches clay content strongly influences the soil water content o geen 2013 and this is even more evident in depth where satellite s ability to monitor soil water directly vanishes manns and berg 2014 studying the relation between soil organic carbon soc and soil water content found that soil texture and soc explain separately 82 of the variance of soil water content and therefore could be used for downscaling purposes this is confirmed in our study in which soc is also among the most important covariates lulc classes also influence soil moisture niu et al 2015 possibly through the influence on carbon this study complements the results of niu et al 2015 that found that grasslands pastures in our case had higher soil water contents while shrublands the lowest and significant differences were found in monitoring depths for the different classes in our case pasture landuse has an inverse relationship with soil water content for the surface and a direct relationship for root zone soil depths and savannah shrublands had inverse relationships prairies can have a shallow root water uptake depth kulmatiski and beard 2013 which may explain these findings the use of agricultural and irrigated lands in australia for production varies annually depending on the water availability which in fuentes et al 2020 is evident in the active on farm dams fluctuation this implies that a proportion of these follow a fallow management cann et al 2020 this and the sowing and start growth period of crops means exposed soil is directly subjected to evaporation ding et al 2013 gupta et al 2021 subsequent plant growth stages create a large evapotranspiration flux that dries the soil ding et al 2013 in this case soil under agriculture is conceived as a bucket that dries periodically between rainfall irrigation events these factors may explain the inverse relationship of these lulc and soil water content and the ranking of the different lulc classes in the covariates while machine learning has been applied for spatial soil moisture predictions zeng et al 2019 elsaadani et al 2021 the validation schema can have a large influence on the reported performance of models for instance ahmad et al 2010 obtains good results using models that are trained using single stations but splitting the data such that the first 4 years are used for training and the last two for validation they also use another method that combines different stations using the same dataset subset approach and a third approach where test or validation is carried out using 4 stations that were not used in the training while the results seem fairly good in the first two approaches they degrade for the last approach however for validating the model in both space and time the last validation schema is the one that best highlights the prediction performance similarly elsaadani et al 2021 evaluate different deep learning architectures for spatiotemporal soil moisture modelling however the study evaluates the performance by splitting the dataset by time periods which does not address the spatial prediction validation in our study we used a leave one out validation validating the predictions with stations that were not included in the training covering both spatial and temporal dimensions different factors can explain the errors in soil moisture predictions in situ errors given by improper calibration of the actual instruments in the reference data are expected suspected improper calibration of the tdr instruments can be observed for instance in the stuart plains ozflux station where soil moisture indicates values up to 0 8 cm3 cm3 supplementary 1 this issue also results in larger errors in the predictions that might be addressed including a quality indicator or additional information about the calibration status in the reference data while several studies have assumed correlation or r2 as the main metrics to evaluate soil moisture predictions because they capture the dynamic patterns of the data malbéteau et al 2016 eweys et al 2017 beck et al 2021 this study used the concordance correlation coefficient as the loss function with the aim of capturing the temporal dynamic and reducing the absolute errors peng et al 2020 this study also clearly points to the need for a more standardized approach in the installation of a network of soil moisture sensors in the case of the ozflux network different sensors at different depths and in different numbers per monitoring site are used which may translate in prediction errors another issue that arises from the variability in the ozflux instrumentation is that the soil heterogeneity at the 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth intervals may be obscured in stations with few observations within those depths by using the mean of a first order spline interpolation which may propagate into model errors more generally additional stations are needed to capture the entire variability of covariates which would improve the extrapolation of models to different sets of conditions for example the efforts related to the development of an international soil moisture network https ismn geo tuwien ac at en are a step forward in that direction dorigo et al 2011 in australia the cosmoz network hawdon et al 2014 which includes stationary cosmic ray sensors might help to improve the performance of models by increasing the number of observations however the change in monitoring depth with soil water content by station for the cosmic ray sensors needs to be further studied to create a standardisation of observation depths snotel scan and uscrn from the united states department of agriculture usda include hundreds of standardised frequency domain reflectometry fdr and coaxial impedance dielectric reflectometry sensors for soil moisture monitoring covering most of the united states usda natural resources conservation services 2020a usda natural resources conservation services 2020 these can be invaluable sources for soil moisture modelling and downscaling abbaszadeh et al 2019 abbaszadeh et al 2021 karthikeyan and mishra 2021 and their extrapolation to other locations may be further explored different neural network architectures could improve on our results for the surface 0 10 cm mlp obtains similar results compared to the lstm models this might be explained by the rapid response of shallow soil water content to climate drivers whose serial correlation can not be captured with a time frequency of three days however in surface subsurface 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil water content attenuates and delays its response to climate drivers which might explain the better performance of recurrent neural networks compared with mlp convolutional neural networks might help in capturing the spatial correlation in remote sensing data but given the sparse distribution of reference stations evaluating these might be difficult apart from neural networks other machine learning algorithms can be tested abbaszadeh et al 2019 for instance applied random forests using the scan and uscrn networks in the continental u s with accuracies of 0 4 cm3 cm3 and karthikeyan and mishra 2021 evaluated xgboost also in the continental u s using the scan snotel and uscrn stations with an unbiased rmse of 0 4 cm3 cm3 liu et al 2020 tested six different machine learning algorithms including random forests and neural networks and found the best results using random forests while the feed forward neural network trained model led to numerous abnormal values additionally other soil moisture remote sensing alternatives may be used to replace the nasa usda smap data for instance beck et al 2021 evaluated several remote sensing products and model based soil moisture products observing large differences between products which means choosing different products might lead to a better performance lastly the frequency of covariates should also be taken into account if short time scale monitoring is required fuentes et al 2019 sentinel 1 data in this study was the dataset with the lowest frequency unfortunately sentinel 1b has recently stopped to transmit data brainard 2022 which results in a further affectation to the frequency of images future research should focus on these alternatives to improve the modelling results 5 conclusions soil water content can be downscaled by combining different datasets and using deep learning algorithms however this potential is constrained by the current availability of reference data two different machine learning modelling approaches were tested to downscale soil moisture in surface 0 10 cm through a simple mlp model and in the surface subsurface 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm concatenating lstm and dense layers the performance of the models was an improvement compared against the performance of nasa usda smap 10 km resolution and awra l 5 km resolution modelled soil water contents and obtained at 90 m resolution significant differences in all performance metrics and in the correlation coefficients between lulc classes occurred using the surface and surface subsurface downscaling models respectively data assimilated in remote sensing soil moisture models were the most important for predictions of soil moisture in the surface while with depth soil properties and lulc are more important the shap analysis enabled highlighting the most important relationships between covariates and soil water content highlighting the weight of particle size and carbon on the space time distribution of soil water content downscaled soil water content and uncertainty maps indicated spatio temporal patterns that matches a priori knowledge of the focus area and drought characteristics this study overall clearly shows the potential for downscaling coarse scale satellite derived

3369,soil water is a critical component of the water balance to make water management decisions at multiple scales while soil water can be sensed remotely this is generally at coarse scales 12 5 km in addition soil moisture products developed at field scale resolutions 250 m have been mostly limited to shallow observations up to 10 cm depth and are impacted by land use the objective of this study was to create an accurate downscaled soil water content product at multiple depths and at a fine 90 m resolution by fusing modelled and remote sensing datasets via deep learning reference data was based on the ozflux and oznet networks covariates included the north america space agency nasa united states department of agriculture usda soil moisture active passive smap remote sensing data assimilation model sentinel 1 from copernicus surface reflectance land surface temperature and land cover from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and gridded soil properties two model approaches were used including a multilayer perceptron for the surface 0 10 cm and recurrent neural networks for the surface subsurface 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil water content the surface prediction performance resulted in a root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and pearson s correlation of 0 073 0 057 and 0 74 degrading in depth to 0 07 0 062 and 0 5 overall these 90 m resolution predictions improve on the performance of nasa usda smap 10 km resolution and the australian landscape water balance 5 km resolution simulated soil water contents land use land cover lulc are important explaining factors for performance and shapley additive explanations shap indicate high importance of nasa usda smap for surface predictions while soil properties and lulc increase in importance with depth keywords soil moisture deep learning remote sensing 1 introduction soil moisture is a key aspect of the storage component in the water budget and plays an important role in the functioning of the different ecosystems and in the water cycle mccoll et al 2017 tian et al 2017 for instance soil moisture at the catchment or regional scale modulates the flood timing wasko et al 2020 affects evapotranspiration which impacts atmospheric dynamics humphrey et al 2021 and strongly affects diffuse recharge to aquifers jackson 2002 it is also critical for agriculture since it drives farm level decisions regarding water management phillips et al 2014 hassan esfahani et al 2015 and crop production for example water irrigation applications can be matched to the crop water needs through soil water content monitoring le page et al 2020 which reduces crop water stress and increases crop yields and can improve water use efficiency therefore quantifying soil water content at the field scale is key to understand eco hydrologic processes and agricultural requirements particularly under water scarcity scenarios wang et al 2019 which are increasingly likely and common mancosu et al 2015 however given the heterogeneity of soils yetbarek et al 2020 and the limited spatial coverage of soil water content monitoring devices dobriyal et al 2012 in situ monitoring may not be representative of the overall soil water content in the field remote sensing can be an alternative to spatially and continuously monitor soil water content for instance several satellites can monitor soil water content mohanty et al 2017 some of these are the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos or the soil moisture active passive smap missions that operate in the l band microwave wavelength of the spectrum kerr et al 2001 entekhabi et al 2010 however these provide soil water content estimates at coarse resolutions 35 50 km and 10 40 km respectively and at the soil surface 0 3 cm depth ma et al 2019 such coarse resolutions are useful for regional or catchment scale studies however monitoring at higher spatial resolutions is required to capture variations related to agricultural management soil properties or localised rainfall events attempts to derive higher resolution surface soil water content monitoring have been based on radar data derived from sentinel hornacek et al 2012 paloscia et al 2013 however in this case vegetation cover affects the backscatter intensity retrieval which influences the estimates amazirh et al 2018 other approaches to improve the spatial resolution of soil water content estimates combine thermal optical satellite data through the thermal optical traapezoid model totram and the optical trapezoid model optram this last model reduces the need for thermal bands sadeghi et al 2017 with the increase in development of artificial intelligence remote sensing inputs have been combined with machine learning techniques to predict soil water content ahmad et al 2010 hassan esfahani et al 2015 amazirh et al 2018 while several studies paloscia et al 2013 el hajj et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2017 babaeian et al 2018 have applied both alternatives i e the use of high resolution satellite data alone or its combination with machine learning techniques obtaining relatively accurate estimates these have been based on limited sets of observed data monitoring points and focused on surface soil water content estimates the extrapolation to different land cover classes and to multiple locations remains a challenge bauer marschallinger et al 2018 this also affects machine learning techniques since they rely heavily on the availability of reference data and therefore combination of large datasets of soil moisture data and machine learning approaches have been developed in recent years abbaszadeh et al 2019 abbaszadeh et al 2021 liu et al 2020 karthikeyan and mishra 2021 as an alternative to developing new algorithms to directly predict soil water content from satellite bands disaggregation methods can be used to downscale the low spatial resolution of existing proven soil water content products derived from microwave remote sensing satellites for example this has been done using the dispatch algorithm malbéteau et al 2016 other alternatives use the modis optical thermal data or sentinel radar data to downscale coarse resolution images to a 100 m resolution eweys et al 2017 however most of these approaches once again are mainly focused on disaggregation of the surface soil water content and have resulted in varying performance depending on the number and location of the validation sites merlin et al 2015 fontanet et al 2018 we have found one example where dispatch data has also been used to downscale deeper root zone soil water content using an evolutionary data assimilation algorithm but this focused on a relatively small agricultural region dumedah et al 2015 given the relatively good performance of existing coarse scale satellite products in capturing the spatiotemporal variability of soil water content beck et al 2021 the now substantial number of soil water content monitoring sites dutta and terhorst 2013 isaac et al 2017 yee et al 2017 and landscape and remote sensing data with different spatial resolutions to support disaggregation of low resolution products it is surprising that disaggregation using machine learning techniques and its extrapolation to different regions have not yet been fully explored progress in this area includes work by abbaszadeh et al 2019 and abbaszadeh et al 2021 using random forests and reference stations from the soil climate analysis networks scan and from the united states climate reference network uscrn to downscale low resolution soil moisture over the continental united states of america similarly karthikeyan and mishra 2021 used the extreme gradient boosting xgboost algorithm and scan snow telemetry snotel and uscrn networks to produce multilayer soil moisture maps at 1 km resolution in the continental united states likewise liu et al 2020 tested six different machine learning algorithms and the use of local reference stations to produce soil moisture maps at 1 km resolution in four different regions building on this downscaling existing coarse scale products such as microwave remote sensing soil moisture from smap or smos or data assimilation models that use remote sensing soil moisture through machine learning tools should be further tested in different regions to develop new remote sensing global useable soil water content products these should apply across multiple spatial scales incorporate different land use land cover classes and specifically include subsurface soil water content this is particularly important since subsurface soil water content corresponds to the water pool stored in soils that contributes most to vegetation transpiration and growth the flexibility of artificial neural networks is often highlighted as a particular advantage krenker et al 2011 as a machine learning method since they can easily combine different data sources deep learning models as an extension of neural networks have been used in many research areas salman et al 2016 shen et al 2017 padarian et al 2019 fuentes et al 2020 including soil moisture mapping since these are particularly able to capture spatio temporal patterns in the datasets elsaadani et al 2021 however deep learning and neural network models are frequently referred to as black box models and therefore providing no information on the importance of covariates used buhrmester et al 2019 this means these models struggle to explain what and how climate landscape or management characteristics make soil moisture actually different at different spatial and temporal locations understanding which variables contribute the most and how these affect the models is important as this can be extended into predictions of change in soil moisture given changes in covariates based on the review in the introduction it is clear that there are two gaps worth exploring to improve predictions of soil moisture in time and space the objective of this study is therefore firstly to develop an alternative method to downscale coarse scale remote sensing derived soil moisture to different soil depth intervals at 90 m local scales across australia using deep learning models and to discuss the challenges associated with this type of downscaling the 90 m spatial resolution corresponds to the resolution of soil properties included in the soil and landscape grid of australia slga grundy et al 2015 which is assumed to be sufficient to capture important variations at the field scale for example associated with agriculture management practices secondly by applying game theory to the machine learning process using shapley additive explanations shap lundberg and lee 2017 the importance of the variables used in the downscaling and how these impact the predictions can be analysed in this study soil moisture and soil water content also referred mathematically as θ are used interchangeably to account for the water content in a volume of soil world meteorological organization 2014 2 materials and methods 2 1 reference data this study used two publicly available soil water content datasets from australia fig 1 these consists of the ozflux dataset www ozflux org au and the oznet soil moisture network www oznet org au both of which measure soil water content at different depths the ozflux network consists of a series of flux towers located in different australian and new zealand regions to monitor the fluxes in different ecosystems beringer et al 2016 the flux towers used in this study are summarised in table 1 the soil moisture probes are time domain reflectometry tdr sensors installed near the flux towers however the sensors vary in monitoring depths across the network in some stations several monitoring depth intervals occur other stations have only one monitoring depth and again these observation depths vary between stations the oznet network on the other hand is a set of stations located in the murrumbidgee catchment where soil water content and soil temperature are being monitored at different depths through tdr and electromagnetic sensors smith et al 2012 fig 1 sensors in the oznet network monitor soil moisture at 0 5 cm depth yet a subset of the network also monitor soil water content at 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth given the disparity in monitoring depths among different stations and flux towers we decided to compile two separate dataset first we only selected observations up to 10 cm depth resulting in a subset of 44 oznet stations and 22 ozflux towers second we selected oznet stations with surface subsurface observations in the ranges 0 30 and 30 60 cm depth next since ozflux towers sample at different depths we standardised depth using a fist order spline to interpolate every 1 cm and then calculated the mean soil water content for the same 0 30 and 30 60 cm depth ranges this reduced the surface subsurface soil water content monitoring locations to 20 oznet stations and 14 ozflux towers in the cases where the ozflux observation sites had more than one monitoring location we obtained the average at each depth before standardising the data additionally modelled surface soil moisture from the australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l from the bureau of meteorology was sampled for some stations as a comparison to evaluate the performance of the downscaling against reference stations vaze et al 2013 2 2 input data and pre processing the model developed to downscale soil water content was based on a range of the following input data sets 2 2 1 sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar the remote sensing datasource that limits the modelling the most due to its lower acquisition frequency is the image collection derived from the sentinel 1 satellites s1 the s1 collection of images is derived from the c band synthetic aperture radar sar sensors and has been processed through the sentinel 1 toolbox resulting in calibrated and ortho corrected images filipponi 2019 level 2 scenes in the collection contain backscatter coefficients for 1 or 2 polarization bands additionally each image in the collection contains a band corresponding to an approximation of the incidence angle this collection was included since it has been widely identified that the time series of the sar backscatter intensity correlates with surface soil water content narayan et al 2006 peters et al 2012 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the s1 collection was filtered to select images that were obtained using the interferometric wide swath mode iw in a descending direction of orbit and that derive from a vertical transmit receive polarization vv these parameters were used because they maximised the number of available images subsequently the backscatter intensities were converted to decibels and pixels with less than 20 and more than 5 decibels bauer marschallinger et al 2018 mostly associated with surface water and buildings were masked out backscatter intensities and the incidence angles were both resampled to 90 m resolution by averaging the smaller scale pixels to the target resolution to estimate soil water content at 90 m resolution and a gaussian filter with a 3 pixel kernel was applied to reduce the backscatter noise the resulting collection of images was used to determine extremes in the time series from 2016 to 2021 these extremes are used to normalise the series based on the technische universität wien tu wien methodology eq 1 wagner et al 2008 1 rssm σ 0 30 σ dry 0 30 σ wet 0 30 σ dry 0 30 calculating relative surface soil moisture rssm estimates where σ 0 30 is the corrected backscatter intensity of sentinel 1 at a reference angle of 30 a value chosen due to the limited incidence angle range in sentinel 1 scenes and their relatively central position in this range σ wet 0 is the upper extreme of the corrected signal corresponding to the 95th percentile of the series and assumed as the wet condition while σ dry 0 is the lower extreme corresponding to the 5th percentile and assumed as the dry extreme of the corrected series the correction of the signal is based on a normalisation of the time series using the incidence angle i e the angle between the sar incidence beam and a perpendicular line to the surface at the point of incidence which extrapolates the backscatter observations such that 2 σ 0 30 σ 0 θ β θ 30 o where σ 0 θ is the backscatter intensity at the incidence angle θ with β being the slope of a linear regression between the backscatter intensity and the incidence angle the rssm images were subsequently appended as additional bands to the backscatter intensity band referred to as vv from the s1 collection 2 2 2 modis surface reflectance and land surface temperature as further inputs the surface reflectance sr and the land surface temperature lst bands from the terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 8 day composite surface reflectance mod09a1 and land surface temperature and emissivity mod11a2 datasets were stacked together the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated from the modis sr data through 3 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red where ρ nir and ρ red correspond to the reflectances in the near infrared 841 876 nm and red 620 670 nm wavelength spectrum from the modis products respectively the ndvi could also be directly obtained from the mod13 collections which contains different vegetation index bands including ndvi the resulting ndvi was then appended to the bands of modis and these were added to the data resulting from the s1 images based on the date range of the modis 8 days composite images surface reflectance bands referred to as modisi for each band where i is the band name were used because they can shed light on the vegetation status which might reflect the soil water content in soils while lst has also been related to soil water content pablos et al 2016 2 2 3 nasa usda smap soil moisture and chirps rainfall soil moisture rasters from the national aeronautics and space administration united states department of agriculture nasa usda soil moisture active passive smap data assimilation model which have a 3 day frequency and a spatial resolution of 10 km were also used as covariates for the downscaling approach these rasters are produced through the integration of level 3 smap soil moisture observations applying a 1 d ensemble kalman filter in combination with a modified two layer palmer model mladenova et al 2020 which is a water budget model widely used for drought monitoring based on the acquisition date of the s1 images a backward in time window of up to 33 days was used to download sequences of 10 surface and subsurface nasa usda smap images smap tx and ssmap tx respectively being x negative integers from 10 to 0 referring to the backward lagged sequence additionally since rainfall is an input in the hydrologic cycle affecting soil moisture daily rainfall rasters from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 were also included as covariates for the development of the downscaling models chirps rasters were aggregated to the nasa usda smap frequency and combined with the smap collection of images to obtain a sequence of 10 backward rainfall images until the capture of the s1 images the series of lagged rainfall and lagged low resolution soil moisture were converted into multiband images which were subsequently stacked with the s1 processed images and the modis covariates 2 2 4 soil properties and land use land cover lulc in addition the following datasets were used as ancillary input rasters and stacked as multibands with the final input images 1 soil information from the soil and landscape grid of australia slga including modelled clay content clay modelled soil organic carbon soc and modelled available water capacity awc at 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth and at 90 m spatial resolution grundy et al 2015 the soil covariates were also referred to as xxxy z in this study being xxx the soil property i e clay soc or awc while y z corresponds to the depth interval of estimates these properties stored as covariate bands were included because they affect or are indicative of the water retention capacity of soils 2 lulc often relates to different vegetation types and different agricultural practices which are known to affect the soil water status therefore a reclassified lulc map containing 5 classes including irrigated areas rainfed agriculture pasture forest and savannah shrubland referred also to as irrigation agri rainfed pasture forest and savannah respectively was generated combining the mode of the distribution of the 2016 2020 annual international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification rasters from modis mcd12q1 sulla menashe and friedl 2018 and the australian collaborative land use and management program lesslie et al 2006 version 8 map the resulting rasters were stacked together into a time series of multiband images containing all different covariates and covering the 2016 2021 period the multiband image collection of covariates predictors for the study period was sampled using the reference stations at different dates since most inputs correspond to time observations and given the temporal resolution of the less frequent data s1 we assumed those observations as independent all samples containing empty records in any of the input variables were dropped this led to 8 023 and 4 135 samples for the prediction of surface and surface subsurface soil water content respectively these samples were used as inputs for the models 2 3 model description two different approaches were used for modelling soil moisture at different depth intervals using artificial neural network models these approaches are based on the use of different architectures and hyperparameters and they also require the selection of a loss function all of which are described below 2 3 1 loss function the loss function used in the models is the concordance correlation coefficient ρ c pandit and schuller 2019 4 ρ c 2 s xy s x 2 s y 2 x y 2 where s x 2 and s y 2 are the variances for x the actual soil moisture and y the predicted soil moisture x and y are the mean of observed and predicted data while s xy is the covariance 5 s xy 1 n i i n x i x y i y here n x i and y i are the number of observations the observed soil moisture for record i and the predicted soil moisture respectively then 1 ρ c was used as the loss function because it corresponds to a normalised metric that evaluates the distance of the data to the 45 degree line therefore it combines the ability to capture temporal patterns and the reduction of errors in the time series 2 3 2 downscaling surface soil moisture model the first approach consisted of a multilayer perceptron mlp model using four dense layers of 128 64 32 16 neurons with one output to model surface soil moisture 0 10 cm depth fig 2 a all layers used rectified linear unit activators relu and a maximum was set to 1 in the output layer since soil water content values must be below 1 cm3 cm 3 additionally an adam optimiser kingma and ba 2014 was used and the learning rate the batch size and the number of epochs were tested to produce a smooth learning curve resulting in settings of 3e 5 256 and 500 respectively however an early stop threshold was inserted based on the validation loss halting the training if more than 20 epochs did not lead to any improvement this was implemented to avoid over fitting the model 2 3 3 downscaling surface subsurface soil moisture model the second approach was developed for surface subsurface soil moisture modelling predicting at two simultaneous depth intervals 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm in this case two model implementations were tested firstly a mlp model with 5 dense layers of 100 100 100 50 and 25 neurons and with an output layer of two dimensions predicting the surface and subsurface simultaneously additionally a second model was evaluated containing one bidirectional long short term memory layer lstm fed by the lagged variables with a 3 x 10 shape surface and subsurface smap and chirps and passing through a dense layer of size 100 this was concatenated with the input layer of the remaining variables and passed through 4 dense layers of 128 64 32 16 neurons until the output layer of two dimensions fig 2b both alternative models used 150 epochs but and early stop threshold of 10 epochs was applied the concatenation of the lstm and the dense layers was tested since it is known that soil water content at depth may be delayed and attenuated relative to surface changes in soil water content which might be captured through recurrent neural network layers considering the 3 day frequency of smap the same activators and optimizer applied in the surface modelling approach were used however a fine tuning of the learning rate decay batch size and epsilon numerical stability hyperparameters was carried out in one station by running 10 models in each case and averaging the results fig 3 given the overall best performance of the concatenation of lstm and dense layers compared against the model with only dense layers in the surface subsurface modelling approach best mean rmse mae pearson s correlation and 1 ρ c of 0 039 0 034 0 68 and 0 45 compared against 0 036 0 03 0 57 and 0 56 respectively we selected the earlier for further analysis fine tuned learning rate decay batch size and epsilon hyperparameters of 0 003 0 8 100 and 1e 08 were used respectively 2 4 validation interpretability and performance in order to evaluate the modelling of soil moisture we utilised a leave one out cross validation this validation scheme involves training the model with all the stations except for one station randomly selected as the validation subset and another station selected as test subset and repeating this for all the stations which means that it characterises the overall performance of the model in the spatial and temporal dimensions by predicting the entire series of independent stations for each station 10 repetitions of the model were run and the average prediction was used an interpretation of the model was based on the shapley additive explantions shap library implemented in python lundberg and lee 2017 shap uses shapley values from game theory to interpret different models evaluating among others the contribution of different covariates padarian et al 2020 shap achieves this by creating multiple models applying sampling approximations to the marginal contributions of covariates and changing the samples in the training dataset trying to emulate the consequence of removing covariates shap values were obtained from the average of 10 models trained with a k fold cross validation in addition to evaluate the importance and distribution of aggregated covariates shap values were summed across the different time lags and soil depths in covariates an area of interest that combines forests under sandy soils pilliga forest and alluvial soils with agriculture irrigated and rainfed was selected to create example maps of predicted soil water content and associated uncertainties this area was selected as this highlights different soil textural classes and lulc three dates were selected from sampling the palmer drought severity index pdsi bands from the terraclimate collection abatzoglou et al 2018 these dates were chosen identifying three peaks representing contrasting wet and dry conditions fig 4 performance was evaluated for 1 the surface and subsurface nasa usda smap soil water content predictions assuming soil depths in the nasa usda smap modelled data to be 5 cm and 40 cm respectively representing a maximum of 25 mm and 275 mm of water holding capacity 2 the awra l surface soil moisture predictions and 3 both artificial neural network models trained for surface and surface subsurface soil moisture downscaling the performance was evaluated through the pearson correlation

y i x i 2 n additionally prediction performance for different soil water content stations was aggregated into land use land cover lulc classes to evaluate differences among classes using the non parametric kruskal wallis test finally the uncertainty of the modelling approaches was evaluated using the leave one out cross validation and estimating the 5th and 95th prediction percentiles across the stations these were then subtracted to get the 90th confidence interval of predictions from 66 and 34 different models in the surface and surface subsurface downscaling approaches respectively one per reference station 3 results 3 1 performance of nasa usda smap against reference data performance of nasa usda smap soil water content predictions for surface and subsurface are in fig 5 mean rmse mae and correlation for the surface 10 km resolution smap predictions are 0 11 0 08 and 0 70 respectively despite the low spatial resolution of derived smap data it captures the dynamics of surface soil water content quite well which translates into high correlation values similarly the performance for the subsurface soil water content predictions degrades quite substantially especially in terms of errors leading to average rmse mae and correlation of 0 17 0 16 and 0 53 3 2 soil moisture modelling and performance the average learning curve for modelling soil moisture in the surface is in fig 6 it is clear that the spatial and temporal prediction is quite challenging even though the model learns smoothly there is an underlying limit in the validation loss around a ρ c of 0 6 1 ρ c of 0 4 predicting one location from all other locations which do not necessarily cover the entire spatial variability of soils results in a threshold in the prediction performance of the models the spatial distribution of the performance of surface soil moisture modelling using the different stations is in fig 7 pearson correlations are quite variable ranging from 0 14 up to 0 92 however most locations are in the range of 0 60 0 92 furthermore the rmses range from 0 02 up to 0 25 with most stations in the range of 0 02 to 0 11 time series of observed nasa usda smap predictions awra l predictions and our predictions of surface soil moisture are in fig 8 for five example cases based on the leave one out cross validation example cases show that our model predictions follow the temporal patterns of soil moisture which translates into r2 between 0 69 and 0 86 awra l predictions grey line on the other hand show a limited performance at the five stations compared against our surface model with mean rmse mae and pearson correlation of 0 13 0 11 and 0 51 respectively on the other hand nasa usda smap predictions capture the soil moisture dynamic quite well and lead also to small errors the distribution of surface and surface subsurface soil moisture errors and correlations is in fig 9 in general terms the mean rmse mae and pearson correlations of surface soil water content predictions for the 66 stations are 0 073 0 057 and 0 74 respectively this is an overall improvement relative to the nasa usda smap especially in terms of a reduction of errors rmse and mae however predicting soil water contents at depths 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm also leads to a degradation of the model performance to mean rmse mae and correlations of 0 07 0 062 and 0 50 even if correlations reduce slightly compared to the derived smap data in the 30 60 cm depth errors reduce significantly fig 5 this degradation of performance with depth also leads to a progressively larger dispersion in the correlations 3 3 lulc and soil water content table 2 highlights the statistics for predicting surface soil water content for different lulc categories in terms of averages and standard deviations the different categories indicate large variation in the number of stations that are aggregated with the pasture lands covering the most stations while forests had the least in addition greater pearson correlation values are related to pasture and irrigation however the lowest errors occur in savannas and shrublands significant differences among classes were found for all performance metrics similarly the performance of downscaled surface subsurface soil water content aggregated by lulc is in table 3 in this case due to data limitations the number of stations in each class are reduced for all classes while in some cases such as under rainfed agriculture and in pastures errors reduce slightly the general trend is a reduction in the correlations which suggests a decrease in performance with depth in contrast with the surface soil water content modelling significant differences between lulc classes in the surface subsurface downscaling were found only in correlation values at 30 60 cm monitoring depths 3 4 model interpretability the importance of the covariates for the surface and surface subsurface prediction in descending order of importance from the top of the plot and shap values fig 10 show that remote sensing soil moisture soil attributes and lulc are the most important variables that determine the variation in the soil moisture prediction in space and time however when downscaling soil moisture for deeper soil depths sentinel 1 data increases in importance for predictions in general the models capture the positive relationship between clay content and soil moisture and rssm derived from s1 and soil moisture however the relationship between soil moisture and lagged remote sensing predicted soil moisture depends on the lag between the remote sensing product and the observations a similar behaviour is observed with subsurface smap where there is a direct relationship for the first lags additionally soc in the range of 5 60 cm depth indicate a direct relationship with surface soil moisture interestingly rainfed agriculture agri rainfed and irrigation lulc classes have a negative relationship with surface soil moisture the scenario changes for the surface subsurface predictions where the spread of shap values reduces considerably and soil properties clay content and available water capacity are more important forest cover directly affects the predicted values similar to pastures in the case of irrigated land use this land cover type actually indicates a negative relationship with soil water content it is also noteworthy the fact that surface reflectance bands do not play an important role as covariates for the model only short wave infrared band 2 from modis modis swir 2 appears among the top 20 covariates and this only applies for the surface subsurface model aggregated shap values are in fig 11 the two most important covariates for surface soil moisture predictions correspond to remotely sensed soil moisture products smap and ssmap these are followed by soil properties such as clay and soc content rainfall data does not play an important role in this modelling approach most probably because it is obscured by smap sentinel 1 data and the estimated rssm also seem to have a small influence similar to surface reflectance and land surface temperature data from modis the importance of the aggregated covariates changes for the surface subsurface modelling approach here clay has the greatest importance while soc decreases in importance relative to the surface downscaling model in contrast the influence of lulc and modis sr increases 3 5 mapping soil water content and uncertainties maps of predicted surface soil water content and associated uncertainties for three different dates of contrasting dry and wet conditions and at two zoom levels can be found in fig 12 the surface soil water content model correctly captures the temporal moisture patterns given the dryness conditions in the different predicted scenes the sandier soils located in southern areas and in the forest tend to store less water than clayey alluvial soils in the northern areas flood paths in the area of interest can also be observed as areas with lower soil water content under dry conditions most likely because they are also sandier the 90 confidence interval ranges between 0 and 0 3 cm3 cm 3 increasing in wet conditions similarly the surface subsurface soil water content predictions and associated uncertainties are in fig 13 these predictions show similar temporal and spatial patterns to the previously observed soil water content predictions in subsurface 30 60 cm are higher than those observed in surface 0 30 cm uncertainties increase compared with the surface downscaled predictions fig 12 4 discussion soil water content being the stock of water in soils is important for the ecosystems and agricultural regions daly and porporato 2005 phillips et al 2014 however there are multiple factors affecting its dynamics these include the water input rainfall irrigation and capillary movement soil properties including the texture and structure of soils and water outputs driven by subsurface drainage evaporative conditions and by transpiration related to vegetation mccoll et al 2017 in this study soil water content downscaling strongly relies on derived remote sensing soil moisture but soil properties and lulc also play a strong role which gains preponderance when coping with surface subsurface soil water content modelling soil texture is well known to govern the water retention in soils and also influences the separation between matrix and preferential flows fuentes et al 2015 these may contribute to large heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties making soil water content predictions difficult due to the fact that microwave satellites in the x c and l bands can detect the dielectric soil properties at the earth s surface mohanty et al 2017 derived microwave remote sensing datasets tend to be ranked highest among the covariates to predict surface soil water content however the observation capacity of these satellites is limited in depth in both downscaling approaches clay content strongly influences the soil water content o geen 2013 and this is even more evident in depth where satellite s ability to monitor soil water directly vanishes manns and berg 2014 studying the relation between soil organic carbon soc and soil water content found that soil texture and soc explain separately 82 of the variance of soil water content and therefore could be used for downscaling purposes this is confirmed in our study in which soc is also among the most important covariates lulc classes also influence soil moisture niu et al 2015 possibly through the influence on carbon this study complements the results of niu et al 2015 that found that grasslands pastures in our case had higher soil water contents while shrublands the lowest and significant differences were found in monitoring depths for the different classes in our case pasture landuse has an inverse relationship with soil water content for the surface and a direct relationship for root zone soil depths and savannah shrublands had inverse relationships prairies can have a shallow root water uptake depth kulmatiski and beard 2013 which may explain these findings the use of agricultural and irrigated lands in australia for production varies annually depending on the water availability which in fuentes et al 2020 is evident in the active on farm dams fluctuation this implies that a proportion of these follow a fallow management cann et al 2020 this and the sowing and start growth period of crops means exposed soil is directly subjected to evaporation ding et al 2013 gupta et al 2021 subsequent plant growth stages create a large evapotranspiration flux that dries the soil ding et al 2013 in this case soil under agriculture is conceived as a bucket that dries periodically between rainfall irrigation events these factors may explain the inverse relationship of these lulc and soil water content and the ranking of the different lulc classes in the covariates while machine learning has been applied for spatial soil moisture predictions zeng et al 2019 elsaadani et al 2021 the validation schema can have a large influence on the reported performance of models for instance ahmad et al 2010 obtains good results using models that are trained using single stations but splitting the data such that the first 4 years are used for training and the last two for validation they also use another method that combines different stations using the same dataset subset approach and a third approach where test or validation is carried out using 4 stations that were not used in the training while the results seem fairly good in the first two approaches they degrade for the last approach however for validating the model in both space and time the last validation schema is the one that best highlights the prediction performance similarly elsaadani et al 2021 evaluate different deep learning architectures for spatiotemporal soil moisture modelling however the study evaluates the performance by splitting the dataset by time periods which does not address the spatial prediction validation in our study we used a leave one out validation validating the predictions with stations that were not included in the training covering both spatial and temporal dimensions different factors can explain the errors in soil moisture predictions in situ errors given by improper calibration of the actual instruments in the reference data are expected suspected improper calibration of the tdr instruments can be observed for instance in the stuart plains ozflux station where soil moisture indicates values up to 0 8 cm3 cm3 supplementary 1 this issue also results in larger errors in the predictions that might be addressed including a quality indicator or additional information about the calibration status in the reference data while several studies have assumed correlation or r2 as the main metrics to evaluate soil moisture predictions because they capture the dynamic patterns of the data malbéteau et al 2016 eweys et al 2017 beck et al 2021 this study used the concordance correlation coefficient as the loss function with the aim of capturing the temporal dynamic and reducing the absolute errors peng et al 2020 this study also clearly points to the need for a more standardized approach in the installation of a network of soil moisture sensors in the case of the ozflux network different sensors at different depths and in different numbers per monitoring site are used which may translate in prediction errors another issue that arises from the variability in the ozflux instrumentation is that the soil heterogeneity at the 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm depth intervals may be obscured in stations with few observations within those depths by using the mean of a first order spline interpolation which may propagate into model errors more generally additional stations are needed to capture the entire variability of covariates which would improve the extrapolation of models to different sets of conditions for example the efforts related to the development of an international soil moisture network https ismn geo tuwien ac at en are a step forward in that direction dorigo et al 2011 in australia the cosmoz network hawdon et al 2014 which includes stationary cosmic ray sensors might help to improve the performance of models by increasing the number of observations however the change in monitoring depth with soil water content by station for the cosmic ray sensors needs to be further studied to create a standardisation of observation depths snotel scan and uscrn from the united states department of agriculture usda include hundreds of standardised frequency domain reflectometry fdr and coaxial impedance dielectric reflectometry sensors for soil moisture monitoring covering most of the united states usda natural resources conservation services 2020a usda natural resources conservation services 2020 these can be invaluable sources for soil moisture modelling and downscaling abbaszadeh et al 2019 abbaszadeh et al 2021 karthikeyan and mishra 2021 and their extrapolation to other locations may be further explored different neural network architectures could improve on our results for the surface 0 10 cm mlp obtains similar results compared to the lstm models this might be explained by the rapid response of shallow soil water content to climate drivers whose serial correlation can not be captured with a time frequency of three days however in surface subsurface 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm soil water content attenuates and delays its response to climate drivers which might explain the better performance of recurrent neural networks compared with mlp convolutional neural networks might help in capturing the spatial correlation in remote sensing data but given the sparse distribution of reference stations evaluating these might be difficult apart from neural networks other machine learning algorithms can be tested abbaszadeh et al 2019 for instance applied random forests using the scan and uscrn networks in the continental u s with accuracies of 0 4 cm3 cm3 and karthikeyan and mishra 2021 evaluated xgboost also in the continental u s using the scan snotel and uscrn stations with an unbiased rmse of 0 4 cm3 cm3 liu et al 2020 tested six different machine learning algorithms including random forests and neural networks and found the best results using random forests while the feed forward neural network trained model led to numerous abnormal values additionally other soil moisture remote sensing alternatives may be used to replace the nasa usda smap data for instance beck et al 2021 evaluated several remote sensing products and model based soil moisture products observing large differences between products which means choosing different products might lead to a better performance lastly the frequency of covariates should also be taken into account if short time scale monitoring is required fuentes et al 2019 sentinel 1 data in this study was the dataset with the lowest frequency unfortunately sentinel 1b has recently stopped to transmit data brainard 2022 which results in a further affectation to the frequency of images future research should focus on these alternatives to improve the modelling results 5 conclusions soil water content can be downscaled by combining different datasets and using deep learning algorithms however this potential is constrained by the current availability of reference data two different machine learning modelling approaches were tested to downscale soil moisture in surface 0 10 cm through a simple mlp model and in the surface subsurface 0 30 cm and 30 60 cm concatenating lstm and dense layers the performance of the models was an improvement compared against the performance of nasa usda smap 10 km resolution and awra l 5 km resolution modelled soil water contents and obtained at 90 m resolution significant differences in all performance metrics and in the correlation coefficients between lulc classes occurred using the surface and surface subsurface downscaling models respectively data assimilated in remote sensing soil moisture models were the most important for predictions of soil moisture in the surface while with depth soil properties and lulc are more important the shap analysis enabled highlighting the most important relationships between covariates and soil water content highlighting the weight of particle size and carbon on the space time distribution of soil water content downscaled soil water content and uncertainty maps indicated spatio temporal patterns that matches a priori knowledge of the focus area and drought characteristics this study overall clearly shows the potential for downscaling coarse scale satellite derived
