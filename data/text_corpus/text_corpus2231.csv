11155,percolation in farmland increasingly is needed to be quantified to improve water use efficiency and mitigate accompanying nutrient loss experiments were conducted to measure the soil properties and moisture in a consolidated paddy field bund landscape during the rice growing season in 2014 2015 the hydrus 2d model simulated soil water movement in the landscape with an excellent performance in the study the soil properties of the bund were similar to those of the paddy field after land consolidation modelling results showed that most percolation in the paddy field occurred along with water input rainfall and irrigation groundwater capillary rise was detected in the coupled conditions of low soil moisture in the root zone and the shallow groundwater table percolation accounted for 23 2 31 3 of water input and groundwater capillary rise contributed 26 1 31 2 to rice evapotranspiration the variation of the soil water content of the bund indicated that lateral infiltration from the paddy field to the bund primarily occurred in the upper bund adjacent to the field while the lateral seepage was only found in the lower bund below the groundwater level vertical percolation and lateral seepage accounted for 10 5 14 8 of water input lost through the bund in which the lateral seepage contributed 77 6 88 4 scenario simulation with the calibrated model investigated the impacts of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the irrigation amount on the percolation and lateral seepage in the landscape the results implied that percolation increased with the increasing ks of soil the percolation in the paddy bund landscape and lateral seepage were most influenced by the illuvial horizon layer of the paddy field furthermore a higher irrigation amount decreased the groundwater capillary rise and aggravated percolation linearly while it had few effects on lateral seepage the research suggests a potential adjustment in making irrigation schedules and conducting land consolidation in the rice planting areas with shallow groundwater depths keywords water loss pathway groundwater capillary rise hydraulic conductivity irrigation amount hydrus 2d 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is a crucial food staple that consumes 50 of irrigated water and large amounts of chemical fertilizer bouman et al 2007 cui et al 2018 however the water use efficiency and productivity is only 36 4 and 0 2 1 2 kg m 3 because of non beneficial water consumption such as percolation and soil evaporation bouman et al 2007 pereira et al 2012 furthermore the solute leaching along with percolation reduces the fertilizer use efficiency and threatens water quality wang et al 2014 since water is becoming increasingly scarce and the sustainable production is being promoted in rice planting areas tuong et al 2005 roost et al 2008 it is necessary to study the percolation process in paddy fields for economic and environmental aims percolation represents hydrological interactions between soil water and groundwater belder et al 2007 cesari de maria et al 2016 li et al 2017a or between irrigated fields and adjacent landscapes chen et al 2002 yi et al 2015 li et al 2017b the paddy field is always ponded or periodically ponded during the growing season since paddy soil water is driven by the potential gradients it percolates vertically in the root zone experimental and numerical studies have concentrated on the vertical percolation under different irrigation and drainage modes and tillage methods boling et al 2007 tan et al 2013 peng et al 2011 kukal and sidhu 2004 dwivedi et al 2012 he et al 2017 and have identified its primary influencing factors wopereis et al 1994 kukal and aggarwal 2002 xu et al 2017a compared with the vertical percolation process the horizontal or lateral seepage is often considered to be a relatively weak process and negligible in irrigation scheduling due to the surrounding bund paddy soil is generally horizontally stratified because of the puddling and ploughing practices particularly a compacted soil layer plough pan layer or hardpan layer can be commonly formed by the illuviation of finer soil fractions between the puddled topsoil and the non puddled subsoil although the plough pan layer mitigates vertical percolation soil water can laterally flow along or beneath the dense layer janssen and lennartz 2007 shao et al 2017 in agricultural watersheds dominated by paddy fields paddy field bund is a common landscape which is often near the drainage ditch lateral and vertical percolation through the bund is prone to happen under the hydraulic gradient between the paddy field and drainage ditch which makes it a source transport channel for water and nutrients the water balance method and field measurements have been used for the percolation through the bund and found that it could be a vital source of water loss from paddy fields wopereis et al 1994 kukal and aggarwal 2002 schmitter et al 2015 xu et al 2017b uncertainties in measuring water balance terms may reduce the reliability and it is difficult to detect the pathway of percolation through the bund janssen and lennartz 2009 experimentally and numerically investigated water losses through bunds in terraced paddy fields after rice harvest these researchers concluded that lateral soil movement primarily occurred in the upper highly permeable bund and that hydraulic conductivity in the upper bund and the hardpan played important roles in determining the vertical percolation of the bund nevertheless percolation especially for the lateral seepage is a slow and random process due to the changing water regime during the growing season and may not fully develop in short term huang et al 2003 furthermore water loss through the bund originated from the lateral movement of soil water and it is supposed to be affected by irrigation and the soil properties of the paddy field however relevant research has not been seen therefore the generation and pathway of percolation through the bund and their contributions to water loss during the rice growing season need to be further explored and decisive factors should be identified for better water and land management the zhanghe irrigation district is one of the largest rice production zones in china land consolidation in certain sub irrigation areas is applied for land integration and levelling after land transfer which is encouraged in china for agricultural modernization however the impacts of land consolidation on percolation of the paddy field bund landscape have rarely been reported therefore experiments over two years 2014 2015 were conducted in a consolidated paddy field in the study the physical properties of the soil in the paddy field and bund soil moisture were measured hydrus is a numerical model and it has been widely used to evaluate hydrological process of rice paddy fields and corresponding environmental issues the model performs excellently in simulating soil water dynamics the water flux and solute leaching tan et al 2014 janssen and lennartz 2009 amin salehi et al 2017 li et al 2015 phogat et al 2010 hence hydrus 2d was used to investigate the soil water dynamics and percolation of the paddy field and the bund the objectives of the study are to 1 analyse soil water movement in the paddy field bund landscape in response to water input rainfall and irrigation 2 quantify soil water groundwater interactions 3 estimate pathways of water loss through the bund and their contributions to water input and 4 elucidate how the hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil and the irrigation amount influence the percolation of the landscape 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area has a temperate subtropical monsoon climate condition with a mean annual air temperature of 16 0 c and 267 frost free days annual average rainfall in the zhanghe irrigation district zid is 915 0 mm annual evaporation measured by a 200 mm diameter pan ranges from 1300 0 to 1800 0 mm as one of the primary grain producing areas in china the zid is suitable for rice planting with deep and fertile soil however the zid is a low hilly plain comprised of rolling country and terraced fields the experimental site is located in tandian village 30 91 n 112 16 e and is irrigated by the third distribution channel of the general main channel in the zid the total area of this experimental region is 2 782 ha and the altitude is between 80 and 100 m the monitored paddy fields have been cultivated for many years before the land transfer in 2012 and were subsequently levelled and integrated the paddy field was kept flooded during the early rice growing season from transplanting to the early tillering period while alternate wetting and slight drying irrigation a water saving irrigation mode for rice was adopted since the middle tillering period most rainfall occurred between july and september during which the rainfall varied greatly in intensity and duration because of the complex water management and weather conditions field experiments were performed in july and september from the middle tillering period to the yellow ripening period an on farm irrigation pond irrigation channel and drainage ditch and bunds constituted the farmland engineering the layout of the paddy field bund is illustrated in fig 1 the bunds were newly built using the original paddy soil in land consolidation the u typed irrigation channel was concrete lined and the earth ditch was excavated after land consolidation the pond water gravitationally flowed into the irrigation channel and was delivered into the fields only when irrigation was needed according to the local farmers practice 2 2 field monitoring and measurements water depth and velocity were measured daily with a digital water velocity meter fp 211 at the channel intake the flow velocity at each site was the averaged velocities at different depths the daily amount of irrigation was calculated by the observed flow velocity and depth a groundwater depth meter was set up in the bund adjacent to the drainage ditch which was formed with a pvc tube 4 cm in inner diameter the pvc meter was upward extended to 30 cm above the bund surface and the top was sealed with a lid to avoid evaporation the unsealed bottom of the meter was buried at the depth of 150 cm beneath the bund the detailed manufacture of the groundwater depth meter was described in tan et al 2013 the daily groundwater depth was manually recorded according to the observations of the soil profile the soil in the paddy field can be divided into three layers the cultivated horizon layer chl plough pan layer ppl and the illuvial horizon layer ihl soil in the bund also comprised three layers the upper layer upl the middle layer mdl and the lower layer lwl table 1 100 cm3 of undisturbed soil cores of each layer in the paddy field and the bund were sampled to analyse the bulk density and particle size distribution bulk density was estimated with the stove drying method and the soil particle size distribution was determined by the hydrometer method the depth bulk density and soil particle distribution of each soil layer are shown in table 1 the soil moisture in the paddy field was monitored at the depths of 15 30 40 and 55 cm the soil was manually sampled weekly at a distance of 50 cm to the bund and additional soil moisture was measured when rainfall or irrigation occurred the weight of the soil water content was determined using the stove drying method and was converted to a volumetric soil water content by multiplying by bulk density 2 3 model description the simulated soil domain was generated using the geometry module in the hydrus 2d package version 1 06 including the paddy field the bund and the drainage ditch fig 1 hydrus 2d was developed to simulate water heat and solute movement in variably saturated media šimůnek et al 2008 water flow is described by the richards equation 1 θ t x k h h x z k h h z 1 s h where h is the soil water pressure head l and θ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 t is time t z is the vertical coordinate positive upward and x is the horizontal coordinate k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function l t 1 and s is the sink term referring to root water uptake l3 l 3 t 1 the unsaturated soil hydraulic k h and θ h relationships are generally highly nonlinear and were modelled by the equations of van genuchten 1980 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 a h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 4 s

coefficients of the soil water characteristic curve l is the pore connectivity parameter 0 5 and se is the effective saturation l3 l 3 2 3 1 root water uptake of rice the estimation of rice root water uptake considered the potential transpiration soil water regimes and root growth and its distribution and it was calculated according to the general function of feddes et al 1978 5 s x z t α h β x z t

from the unit volume of soil per unit of time l3 l 3 t 1 β x z t is the normalized water uptake distribution l 2 which describes the spatial variation of the potential extraction term over the root zone tp and ta are the potential and actual transpiration respectively l t 1 lr is the root depth l α h is the dimensionless function of the soil pressure head in response to water stress taking values between 0 and 1 and is determined following feddes et al 1978 by adopting a piecewise linear reduction function and parameterized by critical soil pressure head values h1 h2 h3 high h3 low h4 l the critical soil pressure head values are estimated according to singh et al 2003 in the simulation according to the verhulst pearl logistic growth function šimůnek and suarez 1993 the length of rice roots reached 85 5 and 93 1 of the maximum length when the experiment started in 2014 and 2015 because water uptake in root zone decreases with depth raats 1974 it is reasonable to assume that water uptake distribution in the z direction remained unchanged in the simulated period the normalized water uptake distribution function β x z t was estimated by the method of vrugt et al 2001 in the hydrus 2d package since rice is a kind of dense planting crop rice plants are distributed evenly in paddy fields therefore the water uptake distribution in the x direction could be considered to be uniform in the soil profile the normalized water uptake distribution function β x z t was described as 8 β z t 1 z z m e λ λ p z z m z z where zm is the maximum rooting length in the z direction 60 cm z is the location at which the maximum root water uptake occurs and is set as 5 cm in the model and pz is the empirical parameter vrugt et al 2001 2 3 2 estimation and partition of evapotranspiration rice potential evapotranspiration etc was obtained by multiplying rice coefficients in different growing stages by the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 which was estimated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 potential soil evaporation ep and potential rice transpiration tp were determined using the equations ritchie and burnett 1971 9 e p e t c e x p β l a i 10 t p e t c e p where β is an extension coefficient for global solar radiation and is taken as 0 3 for rice singh et al 2003 lai is estimated by the logistic function with the measured data 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the schematic diagram of the paddy field bund drainage ditch and soil layers in the simulation is displayed in fig 1 the initial conditions in the calibrating and validating period were defined by the soil pressure head derived from the measured soil water content of the paddy field the upper boundary ab was set as the atmospheric boundary condition in the paddy field represented by rainfall irrigation evaporation and transpiration at the bottom of the soil domain hi ij jk the variable head 1 estimated by measured groundwater depth was applied the seepage face boundary was used to represent the slope surface of the bund de the boundary of the ditch bottom ef was defined as the variable head 2 derived from the measured water depth and no flux boundary was applied to the other boundaries 2 4 evaluation of simulation performance to evaluate the model performance the simulated soil water contents were compared with the observed values using two statistical parameters 11 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 12 n s e 1 i 1 n m i s i 2 i 1 n m i m m 2 where rmse and nse are the root mean square error and the nash sutcliffe modelling efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 respectively n is the number of measurements mi is the measured values mm is the mean values of the measured data and si is the simulated values 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate characteristics and irrigation rainfall irrigation potential evaporation and potential transpiration during the rice growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 are presented in fig 2 rainfall in 2014 was 117 7 mm and distributed evenly with low intensity in the growing season while rainfall in 2015 184 0 mm primarily occurred immediately before and after the late tillering period with considerably greater intensity the amount of irrigation water was 218 1 mm and 358 6 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively in both years irrigation was primarily implemented in the periods of middle tillering booting and heading and the early stage of milk ripening similar to the rainfall the amount and intensity of irrigation water in 2014 was much lower than in 2015 the potential evaporation and transpiration were 85 4 mm and 263 4 mm in 2014 respectively and were slightly lower than those in 2015 97 1 mm and 291 6 mm respectively which might be attributed to the higher temperature in 2015 during the experimental period the amount of irrigation water was considerably less compared to flooding irrigation with the adoption of alternate wetting and slight drying irrigation in addition the infiltration rate was high because of the permeable soil therefore ponding was seldom observed in our experiment 3 2 soil properties and groundwater depth the soil properties of paddy field and the bund are shown in table 1 soil textures were both dominated by clay and silt particles the bulk density at the depth of 30 40 cm ppl was the largest in the paddy field land consolidation focused on aggregating uneven and fragmentary fields such that soil layers in the paddy field were not obviously damaged the soil particle size distribution and stratified depth in the bund were similar to those of paddy soil because the bund was newly built and compacted with corresponding paddy soil the bulk density in the middle layer of the bund was the highest followed by the upper layer and they were both larger than those of the paddy field while the bulk density of the lower layer lwl was similar to the illuvial horizon layer ihl the encircling bund was more compact and could maintain water input to the paddy field the similarity of soil texture below the depth of 40 cm between the paddy field and the bund indicated that soil properties in the monitoring site were not altered by land consolidation therefore the lwl in the bund was considered to be the same material as the ihl in the simulation the groundwater depth was shallow in both years being within the range of 63 0 80 0 cm as shown in fig 3 the groundwater generally fluctuated with water input rainfall and irrigation and was slightly deeper in 2014 than in 2015 owing to less water input 3 3 soil water dynamics of the paddy field and simulation results as shown in fig 4 the measured soil water content covered the variation of the soil water content during the growing season and reflected its dynamics in the climate and irrigation conditions in 2014 and 2015 despite the long measurement interval due to the larger saturated hydraulic conductivity ks there was almost no delay in the changes of soil water contents at different depths when rainfall and irrigation occurred soil water contents at the depths of 15 and 30 cm chl showed the largest variation followed by that at the 40 cm depth ppl soil at the depth of 50 cm ihl was almost saturated in both years the soil water content was lower in late tillering and yellow ripening periods because of field drying although irrigation was carried out on july 24th after late tillering the soil water content of each layer in 2014 continued to decline due to the higher evapotranspiration fig 2 similar to that in 2014 the soil water content declined as soon as the late tillering and yellow ripening periods began in 2015 however the soil water content in 2015 experienced dramatic declines and the minimum value occurred when irrigation was not applied in time while rice transpiration was high fig 2 rice almost consumed soil water at the rate of the potential transpiration in both years even though soil water content was low in chl several times during the monitoring period the lower soil was nearly saturated which supplied adequate water to the rice roots moreover driven by capillarity and transpiration suction groundwater rise could be active with shallow depths which subsequently alleviated water deficit in the root zone boling et al 2007 xu et al 2017a as is well known the atmospheric bc in hydrus 2d does not allow ponding and assumes that all excess water is immediately removed by surface runoff in our study no runoff was generated in 2014 simulation and runoff in the 2015 simulation was 2 5 mm which was generated in the 27th day of the simulation and only accounted for 0 46 of water inputs in other words water inputs were lower than infiltration and ponding will not occur except for 1 day which is consistent with field observations therefore it is reasonable to use the atmospheric bc in the study the soil water contents measured at the depths of 15 30 40 55 cm in 2014 and 2015 were used to calibrate and validate the model based on the inverse simulation fig 4 shows that the simulated soil water content matched well with the measured values the rmse ranged from 0 0026 to 0 0123 cm3 cm 3 and the nse varied between 0 681 0 918 in the simulation table 2 implying that the model could reflect soil water dynamics in the paddy field admittedly there were deviations between the simulated and the measured soil water contents these diviations may be attributed to the following reasons 1 the soil profile was assumed to be strictly layered in the model whereas there were transition zones between soil layers and 2 channel leakage and surplus irrigation were found in the experiment however the simulation did not consider the water losses 3 4 simulated soil water content of the bund to dettermine how soil water entered the bund from the paddy field observation nodes in the model were added at the locations of x 12 5 cm b1 and x 40 0 cm b2 at the depths of 0 15 30 40 55 cm in the z direction as shown in fig 5 the bund soil was unsaturated at both locations soil moisture at b1 was consistent with the variation of that in the paddy field and increased as rainfall or irrigation occurred suggesting that paddy soil water horizontally infiltrated into the bund soil water in the upl changed greatly while soil water in the mdl and lwl changed little implying that soil water in the lower bund did not obviously respond to rainfall and irrigation hence horizontal infiltration from the paddy field caused by rainfall and irrigation primarily occurred in the upper bund similar to that at b1 the soil water content at b2 was steady at the depth of 40 and 55 cm the soil water content at the location was hardly affected by rainfall and irrigation in the paddy field which suggested that soil water movement to the bund from the paddy field just occurred in the upper adjacent layer however the soil movement did not trigger lateral seepage in this layer as observed the water flow direction in the simulation also showed that lateral seepage primarily occurred below the depth of 55 cm and below the soil was highly permeable and provided a channel for lateral seepage notably the soil water content at b2 showed smaller variation in 2014 indicating the potential effects of optimized irrigation on alleviating water loss through the bund 3 5 bottom fluxes and lateral seepage in the paddy field bund landscape to study the exchange between soil water and groundwater and to quantitatively analyse the pathways of water loss in the landscape the simulated bottom fluxes and lateral seepage were demonstrated and discussed in the study the fluxes mentioned below are values per unit of boundary length 3 5 1 the simulated bottom fluxes of paddy field btf the simulated bottom fluxes of the paddy field in 2014 and 2015 are shown in fig 6 percolation primarily occurred in rainfall or irrigation periods especially in the first several days after heavy rain and irrigation which was similar to the results of tan et al 2013 the groundwater capillary rise dominated vertical soil water flow in other periods the btf presented as net groundwater capillary rise in 2014 while it presented as net percolation in 2015 percolation was found in 20 days in 2014 accounted for 23 2 of the total water input the largest daily percolation was 17 5 mm d 1 on august 12th and it accounted for 55 2 of the irrigation water that day the amount of groundwater capillary rise in 2014 was 27 1 and 26 1 of water input and evapotranspiration respectively the maximum daily groundwater capillary rise 6 2 mm d 1 occurred on july 29th on which the soil water content in chl and ppl was the lowest in 2014 fig 4 the amount and variation of btf in 2015 were both higher than those in 2014 the bottom flux in 2015 was as high as 170 0 mm and was slightly less than transpiration the percolation was 291 2 mm and the greatest daily percolation was also detected when the daily water input was the highest the groundwater capillary rise in 2015 accounted for 22 3 and 31 2 of water input and evapotranspiration respectively which was higher than those in 2014 even though it happened in fewer days in particular groundwater capillary rise was stronger during the booting and heading periods in 2015 fig 6 to satisfy the intensive transpiration fig 2 the soil water potential gradients between the upper and bottom soil in 2015 were higher compared with those in 2014 fig 4 thereby leading to more groundwater capillary rise consequently the groundwater compensated for the rice root uptake with shallow depth and eliminated the risk of water stress in the study the mean daily percolation and groundwater capillary rise were larger than the reported values bouman et al 2007 tan et al 2014 which could be explained by the more permeable soil fig 7 a shows that the btf in the paddy field had a significant linear correlation with water input moreover the percolation occurred predominantly at the high end of the water input in 2014 the percolation in days with water input higher than the 50th 75th 90th percentiles contributed 69 6 42 6 and 32 8 to the total percolation respectively in 2015 the corresponding proportions were 79 7 58 0 and 38 0 respectively the percolation process in the paddy field was strengthened by the larger irrigation intensity xu et al 2017a which should be avoided in irrigation scheduling especially when field soil was highly permeable 3 5 2 the simulated bottom fluxes btb and lateral seepage ls of the bund the infiltrated water from the paddy field may move vertically and horizontally in the bund janssen and lennartz 2009 the former recharges the groundwater chen et al 2002 and the latter flows through the bund as lateral seepage or cross flow huang et al 2003 tsubo et al 2007 in the study percolation and groundwater capillary rise were both found in the bund fig 6 the btb presented as net groundwater capillary rise in both years the groundwater capillary rise was 71 0 mm and 57 8 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively while percolation was 19 3 mm and 42 7 mm respectively the peaks of percolation under the bund also accompanied water input peaks and it was more obvious in 2015 the groundwater capillary rise in the bund frequently occurred just before or at the beginning of an irrigation event and in the late growing season a significant linear regression correlation between the btb and water input was also found and a stronger correlation was also detected in 2015 indicating that the linear regression correlation was enhanced by the larger water input fig 7b the amount of lateral seepage in 2014 and 2015 was 150 1 mm and 151 1 mm respectively and accounted for 13 1 and 8 2 of respective water input there was no significant difference between the two years despite the water input difference the compact bund eliminated the risk of lateral seepage at the depths of 0 40 cm as mentioned above although the horizontal movement of the soil water primarily occurred in the upper layer shao et al 2017 instead lateral seepage was only detected below the groundwater table while lateral seepage primarily occurred in the upper layer of a young bund in a terraced paddy field janssen and lennartz 2009 the discrepancy may be attributed to the preferential flow and different soil properties in the bund the ks of the upper bund in janssen and lennartz 2009 was greater than that of the lower layer while it showed the opposite tendency in the study table 1 in the study water loss through the bund was 0 15 m3 m 1 0 17 m3 m 1 and accounted for 14 8 and 10 5 of the water input in 2014 and 2015 respectively lower than the result of huang et al 2003 water losses of 88 4 and 77 6 through the bund were attributed to lateral seepage in 2014 and 2015 respectively the upper bund layer retarded downward soil water flow in addition large soil water potential gradients between the upper middle layer and the lower layer and shallow groundwater depth both boosted the capillary rise thus reducing the risk of percolation as the major pathway of water loss lateral seepage was primarily driven by the groundwater level gradients and the layered soil provided a channel for it in the monitoring period the hydraulic gradient remained relatively steady between the lower bund and the drainage ditch percolation and lateral seepage happened at the same time when the high rainfall and irrigation intensity was detected or after continuous irrigation thus resulting in large water loss however as the area of farmland increased the ratio of water loss through the farmland boundary decreased li et al 2017b the proportion of water loss through the bund was rather low 0 26 in 2014 and 0 18 in 2015 when the whole paddy field 2 782 ha was considered therefore the integration of small and terraced paddy fields in land consolidation could reduce water loss through the bund and improve water use efficiency 3 6 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted in the climate conditions of 2015 to evaluate the impacts of soil hydraulic conductivity and the irrigation amount on water loss of the paddy field bund landscape in this analysis 70 80 90 110 120 and 130 of the original ks of each soil layer was specified and a scenario analysis was simulated by changing one soil layer s ks at a time the water input in 2015 was used as the model input in the varied ks simulation with the original ks a scenario analysis was performed with 70 80 90 110 120 and 130 of the original irrigation amount in 2015 it is worthy of note that the maximum possible runoff is less than 5 of the original water input in the sensitivity analysis the relative differences between the original flux and the simulated flux in the scenario analysis are shown in table 3 3 6 1 impacts of soil properties on btf btb and ls the btf presented as the net percolation and was most sensitive to the ks of the ihl followed by that of the chl and mdl the btf increased with the increase in ks of each paddy soil layer nevertheless it slightly decreased as the increase of ks of the mdl because horizontal infiltration was more possible with a larger ks of mdl thus weakening the vertical flow the bottom flux under the bund btb presented as the net groundwater capillary rise and rose with the increase of ks the btb was most sensitive to the varied ks of the ihl on one hand the ihl was the thickest such that the varied ks of the ihl had the greatest effects on the whole soil domain on the other hand the exchange between groundwater and soil water primarily occurred in the ihl and the btb was directly affected by its changing ks when ks decreased the btb was more sensitive to the ks of the paddy field than that of the bund table 3 the decrease of paddy soil ks restricted horizontal infiltration and then mitigated percolation under the bund when ks increased the sensitivity of the btb to the paddy soil ks declined because the soil permeability of the bund played a more important role in the horizontal infiltration lateral seepage was most sensitive to the ihl ks and significantly rose as it increased while it was not sensitive to the other layers ks the results were not consistent with the study of janssen and lennartz 2009 because lateral seepage occurred in different soil layers in the simulation horizontal infiltration into the upper and middle bund did not penetrate the bund and brought about no lateral seepage so that soil property of the upper and middle paddy field bund had little effect lateral seepage was only found in the ihl and changed greatly with the variation in ks of the ihl therefore compaction or impervious measures on the ihl should also be considered in land consolidation to reduce lateral seepage and it is more necessary in a paddy field adjacent to a drainage ditch with a shallow groundwater depth during paddy cultivation repeated submerged conditions cause eluviation in the bund and increase the clay contents in deeper soil layers patil et al 2011 thus decreasing the permeability in the upper bund while increasing the permeability of the lower bund which makes anti seep treatments and maintenance necessary in the upper bund over time 3 6 2 impacts of irrigation on btf btb and ls fig 8 a shows that the btf and btb linearly changed with the increase of the irrigation amount which agreed with the results of the correlation analysis the btf presented the net percolation under different irrigation amounts as the irrigation amount rose the net percolation in the paddy field soared and its ratio to water input increased when the irrigation amount declined to 70 80 and 90 of the original irrigation amount the net percolation decreased by 89 58 58 39 and 28 13 respectively then the corresponding ratios of the btf to water input declined to 4 66 16 29 and 25 04 respectively fig 8b with the increase of the irrigation amount the relative difference of btb decreased and it transferred to net percolation from net groundwater capillary rise the ratio of btb to water input was low the irrigation amount hardly had an effect on lateral seepage and the ratio of the lateral seepage declined as irrigation amount increased which was consistent with the results described above 4 conclusions to clarify the generation of percolation in the paddy field bund landscape and its influencing factors a field experiment and model simulation using hydrus 2d were conducted during the rice growing season in 2014 2015 the soil texture of the bund was similar to that of the paddy field after land consolidation in both years the soil water content in the chl was alternately saturated and unsaturated while the soil in the ihl was nearly saturated the simulated soil water content agreed well with the measured rmse ranging from 0 0026 to 0 0123 cm3 cm 3 and the nse ranging from 0 681 to 0 918 indicating a good performance of the hydrus 2d model the modelling results showed that the transpiration of rice was not affected by the dry environment due to the capillary rise with shallow groundwater depth the amount of groundwater capillary rise was 91 0 mm in 2014 and 121 2 mm in 2015 the percolation in 2014 was 82 1 mm which was lower than that in 2015 291 2 mm under a much larger amount and intensity of water input based on the simulated results horizontal infiltration was primarily found in the upper bund adjacent to the field while lateral seepage was only detected in the lower bund under the groundwater level water loss through the bund constituted the vertical percolation and lateral seepage which was dominated by the lateral seepage in the scenario simulation the btf and btb increased with the increase of ks in each soil layer and were linearly correlated with the irrigation amount however lateral seepage was not sensitive to the variation of the irrigation amount the percolation in the paddy field and vertical horizontal percolation in the bund were most sensitive to the ks of the ihl this study enhanced our understanding of the percolation process in the paddy field bund landscape and was helpful in optimizing the water management and land consolidation in rice planting areas acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the referees and the editors for their valuable comments and suggestions which significantly improve this paper and

11155,percolation in farmland increasingly is needed to be quantified to improve water use efficiency and mitigate accompanying nutrient loss experiments were conducted to measure the soil properties and moisture in a consolidated paddy field bund landscape during the rice growing season in 2014 2015 the hydrus 2d model simulated soil water movement in the landscape with an excellent performance in the study the soil properties of the bund were similar to those of the paddy field after land consolidation modelling results showed that most percolation in the paddy field occurred along with water input rainfall and irrigation groundwater capillary rise was detected in the coupled conditions of low soil moisture in the root zone and the shallow groundwater table percolation accounted for 23 2 31 3 of water input and groundwater capillary rise contributed 26 1 31 2 to rice evapotranspiration the variation of the soil water content of the bund indicated that lateral infiltration from the paddy field to the bund primarily occurred in the upper bund adjacent to the field while the lateral seepage was only found in the lower bund below the groundwater level vertical percolation and lateral seepage accounted for 10 5 14 8 of water input lost through the bund in which the lateral seepage contributed 77 6 88 4 scenario simulation with the calibrated model investigated the impacts of saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the irrigation amount on the percolation and lateral seepage in the landscape the results implied that percolation increased with the increasing ks of soil the percolation in the paddy bund landscape and lateral seepage were most influenced by the illuvial horizon layer of the paddy field furthermore a higher irrigation amount decreased the groundwater capillary rise and aggravated percolation linearly while it had few effects on lateral seepage the research suggests a potential adjustment in making irrigation schedules and conducting land consolidation in the rice planting areas with shallow groundwater depths keywords water loss pathway groundwater capillary rise hydraulic conductivity irrigation amount hydrus 2d 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is a crucial food staple that consumes 50 of irrigated water and large amounts of chemical fertilizer bouman et al 2007 cui et al 2018 however the water use efficiency and productivity is only 36 4 and 0 2 1 2 kg m 3 because of non beneficial water consumption such as percolation and soil evaporation bouman et al 2007 pereira et al 2012 furthermore the solute leaching along with percolation reduces the fertilizer use efficiency and threatens water quality wang et al 2014 since water is becoming increasingly scarce and the sustainable production is being promoted in rice planting areas tuong et al 2005 roost et al 2008 it is necessary to study the percolation process in paddy fields for economic and environmental aims percolation represents hydrological interactions between soil water and groundwater belder et al 2007 cesari de maria et al 2016 li et al 2017a or between irrigated fields and adjacent landscapes chen et al 2002 yi et al 2015 li et al 2017b the paddy field is always ponded or periodically ponded during the growing season since paddy soil water is driven by the potential gradients it percolates vertically in the root zone experimental and numerical studies have concentrated on the vertical percolation under different irrigation and drainage modes and tillage methods boling et al 2007 tan et al 2013 peng et al 2011 kukal and sidhu 2004 dwivedi et al 2012 he et al 2017 and have identified its primary influencing factors wopereis et al 1994 kukal and aggarwal 2002 xu et al 2017a compared with the vertical percolation process the horizontal or lateral seepage is often considered to be a relatively weak process and negligible in irrigation scheduling due to the surrounding bund paddy soil is generally horizontally stratified because of the puddling and ploughing practices particularly a compacted soil layer plough pan layer or hardpan layer can be commonly formed by the illuviation of finer soil fractions between the puddled topsoil and the non puddled subsoil although the plough pan layer mitigates vertical percolation soil water can laterally flow along or beneath the dense layer janssen and lennartz 2007 shao et al 2017 in agricultural watersheds dominated by paddy fields paddy field bund is a common landscape which is often near the drainage ditch lateral and vertical percolation through the bund is prone to happen under the hydraulic gradient between the paddy field and drainage ditch which makes it a source transport channel for water and nutrients the water balance method and field measurements have been used for the percolation through the bund and found that it could be a vital source of water loss from paddy fields wopereis et al 1994 kukal and aggarwal 2002 schmitter et al 2015 xu et al 2017b uncertainties in measuring water balance terms may reduce the reliability and it is difficult to detect the pathway of percolation through the bund janssen and lennartz 2009 experimentally and numerically investigated water losses through bunds in terraced paddy fields after rice harvest these researchers concluded that lateral soil movement primarily occurred in the upper highly permeable bund and that hydraulic conductivity in the upper bund and the hardpan played important roles in determining the vertical percolation of the bund nevertheless percolation especially for the lateral seepage is a slow and random process due to the changing water regime during the growing season and may not fully develop in short term huang et al 2003 furthermore water loss through the bund originated from the lateral movement of soil water and it is supposed to be affected by irrigation and the soil properties of the paddy field however relevant research has not been seen therefore the generation and pathway of percolation through the bund and their contributions to water loss during the rice growing season need to be further explored and decisive factors should be identified for better water and land management the zhanghe irrigation district is one of the largest rice production zones in china land consolidation in certain sub irrigation areas is applied for land integration and levelling after land transfer which is encouraged in china for agricultural modernization however the impacts of land consolidation on percolation of the paddy field bund landscape have rarely been reported therefore experiments over two years 2014 2015 were conducted in a consolidated paddy field in the study the physical properties of the soil in the paddy field and bund soil moisture were measured hydrus is a numerical model and it has been widely used to evaluate hydrological process of rice paddy fields and corresponding environmental issues the model performs excellently in simulating soil water dynamics the water flux and solute leaching tan et al 2014 janssen and lennartz 2009 amin salehi et al 2017 li et al 2015 phogat et al 2010 hence hydrus 2d was used to investigate the soil water dynamics and percolation of the paddy field and the bund the objectives of the study are to 1 analyse soil water movement in the paddy field bund landscape in response to water input rainfall and irrigation 2 quantify soil water groundwater interactions 3 estimate pathways of water loss through the bund and their contributions to water input and 4 elucidate how the hydraulic conductivity of saturated soil and the irrigation amount influence the percolation of the landscape 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area has a temperate subtropical monsoon climate condition with a mean annual air temperature of 16 0 c and 267 frost free days annual average rainfall in the zhanghe irrigation district zid is 915 0 mm annual evaporation measured by a 200 mm diameter pan ranges from 1300 0 to 1800 0 mm as one of the primary grain producing areas in china the zid is suitable for rice planting with deep and fertile soil however the zid is a low hilly plain comprised of rolling country and terraced fields the experimental site is located in tandian village 30 91 n 112 16 e and is irrigated by the third distribution channel of the general main channel in the zid the total area of this experimental region is 2 782 ha and the altitude is between 80 and 100 m the monitored paddy fields have been cultivated for many years before the land transfer in 2012 and were subsequently levelled and integrated the paddy field was kept flooded during the early rice growing season from transplanting to the early tillering period while alternate wetting and slight drying irrigation a water saving irrigation mode for rice was adopted since the middle tillering period most rainfall occurred between july and september during which the rainfall varied greatly in intensity and duration because of the complex water management and weather conditions field experiments were performed in july and september from the middle tillering period to the yellow ripening period an on farm irrigation pond irrigation channel and drainage ditch and bunds constituted the farmland engineering the layout of the paddy field bund is illustrated in fig 1 the bunds were newly built using the original paddy soil in land consolidation the u typed irrigation channel was concrete lined and the earth ditch was excavated after land consolidation the pond water gravitationally flowed into the irrigation channel and was delivered into the fields only when irrigation was needed according to the local farmers practice 2 2 field monitoring and measurements water depth and velocity were measured daily with a digital water velocity meter fp 211 at the channel intake the flow velocity at each site was the averaged velocities at different depths the daily amount of irrigation was calculated by the observed flow velocity and depth a groundwater depth meter was set up in the bund adjacent to the drainage ditch which was formed with a pvc tube 4 cm in inner diameter the pvc meter was upward extended to 30 cm above the bund surface and the top was sealed with a lid to avoid evaporation the unsealed bottom of the meter was buried at the depth of 150 cm beneath the bund the detailed manufacture of the groundwater depth meter was described in tan et al 2013 the daily groundwater depth was manually recorded according to the observations of the soil profile the soil in the paddy field can be divided into three layers the cultivated horizon layer chl plough pan layer ppl and the illuvial horizon layer ihl soil in the bund also comprised three layers the upper layer upl the middle layer mdl and the lower layer lwl table 1 100 cm3 of undisturbed soil cores of each layer in the paddy field and the bund were sampled to analyse the bulk density and particle size distribution bulk density was estimated with the stove drying method and the soil particle size distribution was determined by the hydrometer method the depth bulk density and soil particle distribution of each soil layer are shown in table 1 the soil moisture in the paddy field was monitored at the depths of 15 30 40 and 55 cm the soil was manually sampled weekly at a distance of 50 cm to the bund and additional soil moisture was measured when rainfall or irrigation occurred the weight of the soil water content was determined using the stove drying method and was converted to a volumetric soil water content by multiplying by bulk density 2 3 model description the simulated soil domain was generated using the geometry module in the hydrus 2d package version 1 06 including the paddy field the bund and the drainage ditch fig 1 hydrus 2d was developed to simulate water heat and solute movement in variably saturated media šimůnek et al 2008 water flow is

coefficients of the soil water characteristic curve l is the pore connectivity parameter 0 5 and se is the effective saturation l3 l 3 2 3 1 root water uptake of rice the estimation of rice root water uptake considered the potential transpiration soil water regimes and root growth and its distribution and it was calculated according to the general function of feddes et al 1978 5 s x z t α h β x z t

from the unit volume of soil per unit of time l3 l 3 t 1 β x z t is the normalized water uptake distribution l 2 which describes the spatial variation of the potential extraction term over the root zone tp and ta are the potential and actual transpiration respectively l t 1 lr is the root depth l α h is the dimensionless function of the soil pressure head in response to water stress taking values between 0 and 1 and is determined following feddes et al 1978 by adopting a piecewise linear reduction function and parameterized by critical soil pressure head values h1 h2 h3 high h3 low h4 l the critical soil pressure head values are estimated according to singh et al 2003 in the simulation according to the verhulst pearl logistic growth function šimůnek and suarez 1993 the length of rice roots reached 85 5 and 93 1 of the maximum length when the experiment started in 2014 and 2015 because water uptake in root zone decreases with depth raats 1974 it is reasonable to assume that water uptake distribution in the z direction remained unchanged in the simulated period the normalized water uptake distribution function β x z t was estimated by the method of vrugt et al 2001 in the hydrus 2d package since rice is a kind of dense planting crop rice plants are distributed evenly in paddy fields therefore the water uptake distribution in the x direction could be considered to be uniform in the soil profile the normalized water uptake distribution function β x z t was described as 8 β z t 1 z z m e λ λ p z z m z z where zm is the maximum rooting length in the z direction 60 cm z is the location at which the maximum root water uptake occurs and is set as 5 cm in the model and pz is the empirical parameter vrugt et al 2001 2 3 2 estimation and partition of evapotranspiration rice potential evapotranspiration etc was obtained by multiplying rice coefficients in different growing stages by the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 which was estimated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 potential soil evaporation ep and potential rice transpiration tp were determined using the equations ritchie and burnett 1971 9 e p e t c e x p β l a i 10 t p e t c e p where β is an extension coefficient for global solar radiation and is taken as 0 3 for rice singh et al 2003 lai is estimated by the logistic function with the measured data 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the schematic diagram of the paddy field bund drainage ditch and soil layers in the simulation is displayed in fig 1 the initial conditions in the calibrating and validating period were defined by the soil pressure head derived from the measured soil water content of the paddy field the upper boundary ab was set as the atmospheric boundary condition in the paddy field represented by rainfall irrigation evaporation and transpiration at the bottom of the soil domain hi ij jk the variable head 1 estimated by measured groundwater depth was applied the seepage face boundary was used to represent the slope surface of the bund de the boundary of the ditch bottom ef was defined as the variable head 2 derived from the measured water depth and no flux boundary was applied to the other boundaries 2 4 evaluation of simulation performance to evaluate the model performance the simulated soil water contents were compared with the observed values using two statistical parameters 11 r m s

the number of measurements mi is the measured values mm is the mean values of the measured data and si is the simulated values 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate characteristics and irrigation rainfall irrigation potential evaporation and potential transpiration during the rice growing seasons in 2014 and 2015 are presented in fig 2 rainfall in 2014 was 117 7 mm and distributed evenly with low intensity in the growing season while rainfall in 2015 184 0 mm primarily occurred immediately before and after the late tillering period with considerably greater intensity the amount of irrigation water was 218 1 mm and 358 6 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively in both years irrigation was primarily implemented in the periods of middle tillering booting and heading and the early stage of milk ripening similar to the rainfall the amount and intensity of irrigation water in 2014 was much lower than in 2015 the potential evaporation and transpiration were 85 4 mm and 263 4 mm in 2014 respectively and were slightly lower than those in 2015 97 1 mm and 291 6 mm respectively which might be attributed to the higher temperature in 2015 during the experimental period the amount of irrigation water was considerably less compared to flooding irrigation with the adoption of alternate wetting and slight drying irrigation in addition the infiltration rate was high because of the permeable soil therefore ponding was seldom observed in our experiment 3 2 soil properties and groundwater depth the soil properties of paddy field and the bund are shown in table 1 soil textures were both dominated by clay and silt particles the bulk density at the depth of 30 40 cm ppl was the largest in the paddy field land consolidation focused on aggregating uneven and fragmentary fields such that soil layers in the paddy field were not obviously damaged the soil particle size distribution and stratified depth in the bund were similar to those of paddy soil because the bund was newly built and compacted with corresponding paddy soil the bulk density in the middle layer of the bund was the highest followed by the upper layer and they were both larger than those of the paddy field while the bulk density of the lower layer lwl was similar to the illuvial horizon layer ihl the encircling bund was more compact and could maintain water input to the paddy field the similarity of soil texture below the depth of 40 cm between the paddy field and the bund indicated that soil properties in the monitoring site were not altered by land consolidation therefore the lwl in the bund was considered to be the same material as the ihl in the simulation the groundwater depth was shallow in both years being within the range of 63 0 80 0 cm as shown in fig 3 the groundwater generally fluctuated with water input rainfall and irrigation and was slightly deeper in 2014 than in 2015 owing to less water input 3 3 soil water dynamics of the paddy field and simulation results as shown in fig 4 the measured soil water content covered the variation of the soil water content during the growing season and reflected its dynamics in the climate and irrigation conditions in 2014 and 2015 despite the long measurement interval due to the larger saturated hydraulic conductivity ks there was almost no delay in the changes of soil water contents at different depths when rainfall and irrigation occurred soil water contents at the depths of 15 and 30 cm chl showed the largest variation followed by that at the 40 cm depth ppl soil at the depth of 50 cm ihl was almost saturated in both years the soil water content was lower in late tillering and yellow ripening periods because of field drying although irrigation was carried out on july 24th after late tillering the soil water content of each layer in 2014 continued to decline due to the higher evapotranspiration fig 2 similar to that in 2014 the soil water content declined as soon as the late tillering and yellow ripening periods began in 2015 however the soil water content in 2015 experienced dramatic declines and the minimum value occurred when irrigation was not applied in time while rice transpiration was high fig 2 rice almost consumed soil water at the rate of the potential transpiration in both years even though soil water content was low in chl several times during the monitoring period the lower soil was nearly saturated which supplied adequate water to the rice roots moreover driven by capillarity and transpiration suction groundwater rise could be active with shallow depths which subsequently alleviated water deficit in the root zone boling et al 2007 xu et al 2017a as is well known the atmospheric bc in hydrus 2d does not allow ponding and assumes that all excess water is immediately removed by surface runoff in our study no runoff was generated in 2014 simulation and runoff in the 2015 simulation was 2 5 mm which was generated in the 27th day of the simulation and only accounted for 0 46 of water inputs in other words water inputs were lower than infiltration and ponding will not occur except for 1 day which is consistent with field observations therefore it is reasonable to use the atmospheric bc in the study the soil water contents measured at the depths of 15 30 40 55 cm in 2014 and 2015 were used to calibrate and validate the model based on the inverse simulation fig 4 shows that the simulated soil water content matched well with the measured values the rmse ranged from 0 0026 to 0 0123 cm3 cm 3 and the nse varied between 0 681 0 918 in the simulation table 2 implying that the model could reflect soil water dynamics in the paddy field admittedly there were deviations between the simulated and the measured soil water contents these diviations may be attributed to the following reasons 1 the soil profile was assumed to be strictly layered in the model whereas there were transition zones between soil layers and 2 channel leakage and surplus irrigation were found in the experiment however the simulation did not consider the water losses 3 4 simulated soil water content of the bund to dettermine how soil water entered the bund from the paddy field observation nodes in the model were added at the locations of x 12 5 cm b1 and x 40 0 cm b2 at the depths of 0 15 30 40 55 cm in the z direction as shown in fig 5 the bund soil was unsaturated at both locations soil moisture at b1 was consistent with the variation of that in the paddy field and increased as rainfall or irrigation occurred suggesting that paddy soil water horizontally infiltrated into the bund soil water in the upl changed greatly while soil water in the mdl and lwl changed little implying that soil water in the lower bund did not obviously respond to rainfall and irrigation hence horizontal infiltration from the paddy field caused by rainfall and irrigation primarily occurred in the upper bund similar to that at b1 the soil water content at b2 was steady at the depth of 40 and 55 cm the soil water content at the location was hardly affected by rainfall and irrigation in the paddy field which suggested that soil water movement to the bund from the paddy field just occurred in the upper adjacent layer however the soil movement did not trigger lateral seepage in this layer as observed the water flow direction in the simulation also showed that lateral seepage primarily occurred below the depth of 55 cm and below the soil was highly permeable and provided a channel for lateral seepage notably the soil water content at b2 showed smaller variation in 2014 indicating the potential effects of optimized irrigation on alleviating water loss through the bund 3 5 bottom fluxes and lateral seepage in the paddy field bund landscape to study the exchange between soil water and groundwater and to quantitatively analyse the pathways of water loss in the landscape the simulated bottom fluxes and lateral seepage were demonstrated and discussed in the study the fluxes mentioned below are values per unit of boundary length 3 5 1 the simulated bottom fluxes of paddy field btf the simulated bottom fluxes of the paddy field in 2014 and 2015 are shown in fig 6 percolation primarily occurred in rainfall or irrigation periods especially in the first several days after heavy rain and irrigation which was similar to the results of tan et al 2013 the groundwater capillary rise dominated vertical soil water flow in other periods the btf presented as net groundwater capillary rise in 2014 while it presented as net percolation in 2015 percolation was found in 20 days in 2014 accounted for 23 2 of the total water input the largest daily percolation was 17 5 mm d 1 on august 12th and it accounted for 55 2 of the irrigation water that day the amount of groundwater capillary rise in 2014 was 27 1 and 26 1 of water input and evapotranspiration respectively the maximum daily groundwater capillary rise 6 2 mm d 1 occurred on july 29th on which the soil water content in chl and ppl was the lowest in 2014 fig 4 the amount and variation of btf in 2015 were both higher than those in 2014 the bottom flux in 2015 was as high as 170 0 mm and was slightly less than transpiration the percolation was 291 2 mm and the greatest daily percolation was also detected when the daily water input was the highest the groundwater capillary rise in 2015 accounted for 22 3 and 31 2 of water input and evapotranspiration respectively which was higher than those in 2014 even though it happened in fewer days in particular groundwater capillary rise was stronger during the booting and heading periods in 2015 fig 6 to satisfy the intensive transpiration fig 2 the soil water potential gradients between the upper and bottom soil in 2015 were higher compared with those in 2014 fig 4 thereby leading to more groundwater capillary rise consequently the groundwater compensated for the rice root uptake with shallow depth and eliminated the risk of water stress in the study the mean daily percolation and groundwater capillary rise were larger than the reported values bouman et al 2007 tan et al 2014 which could be explained by the more permeable soil fig 7 a shows that the btf in the paddy field had a significant linear correlation with water input moreover the percolation occurred predominantly at the high end of the water input in 2014 the percolation in days with water input higher than the 50th 75th 90th percentiles contributed 69 6 42 6 and 32 8 to the total percolation respectively in 2015 the corresponding proportions were 79 7 58 0 and 38 0 respectively the percolation process in the paddy field was strengthened by the larger irrigation intensity xu et al 2017a which should be avoided in irrigation scheduling especially when field soil was highly permeable 3 5 2 the simulated bottom fluxes btb and lateral seepage ls of the bund the infiltrated water from the paddy field may move vertically and horizontally in the bund janssen and lennartz 2009 the former recharges the groundwater chen et al 2002 and the latter flows through the bund as lateral seepage or cross flow huang et al 2003 tsubo et al 2007 in the study percolation and groundwater capillary rise were both found in the bund fig 6 the btb presented as net groundwater capillary rise in both years the groundwater capillary rise was 71 0 mm and 57 8 mm in 2014 and 2015 respectively while percolation was 19 3 mm and 42 7 mm respectively the peaks of percolation under the bund also accompanied water input peaks and it was more obvious in 2015 the groundwater capillary rise in the bund frequently occurred just before or at the beginning of an irrigation event and in the late growing season a significant linear regression correlation between the btb and water input was also found and a stronger correlation was also detected in 2015 indicating that the linear regression correlation was enhanced by the larger water input fig 7b the amount of lateral seepage in 2014 and 2015 was 150 1 mm and 151 1 mm respectively and accounted for 13 1 and 8 2 of respective water input there was no significant difference between the two years despite the water input difference the compact bund eliminated the risk of lateral seepage at the depths of 0 40 cm as mentioned above although the horizontal movement of the soil water primarily occurred in the upper layer shao et al 2017 instead lateral seepage was only detected below the groundwater table while lateral seepage primarily occurred in the upper layer of a young bund in a terraced paddy field janssen and lennartz 2009 the discrepancy may be attributed to the preferential flow and different soil properties in the bund the ks of the upper bund in janssen and lennartz 2009 was greater than that of the lower layer while it showed the opposite tendency in the study table 1 in the study water loss through the bund was 0 15 m3 m 1 0 17 m3 m 1 and accounted for 14 8 and 10 5 of the water input in 2014 and 2015 respectively lower than the result of huang et al 2003 water losses of 88 4 and 77 6 through the bund were attributed to lateral seepage in 2014 and 2015 respectively the upper bund layer retarded downward soil water flow in addition large soil water potential gradients between the upper middle layer and the lower layer and shallow groundwater depth both boosted the capillary rise thus reducing the risk of percolation as the major pathway of water loss lateral seepage was primarily driven by the groundwater level gradients and the layered soil provided a channel for it in the monitoring period the hydraulic gradient remained relatively steady between the lower bund and the drainage ditch percolation and lateral seepage happened at the same time when the high rainfall and irrigation intensity was detected or after continuous irrigation thus resulting in large water loss however as the area of farmland increased the ratio of water loss through the farmland boundary decreased li et al 2017b the proportion of water loss through the bund was rather low 0 26 in 2014 and 0 18 in 2015 when the whole paddy field 2 782 ha was considered therefore the integration of small and terraced paddy fields in land consolidation could reduce water loss through the bund and improve water use efficiency 3 6 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was conducted in the climate conditions of 2015 to evaluate the impacts of soil hydraulic conductivity and the irrigation amount on water loss of the paddy field bund landscape in this analysis 70 80 90 110 120 and 130 of the original ks of each soil layer was specified and a scenario analysis was simulated by changing one soil layer s ks at a time the water input in 2015 was used as the model input in the varied ks simulation with the original ks a scenario analysis was performed with 70 80 90 110 120 and 130 of the original irrigation amount in 2015 it is worthy of note that the maximum possible runoff is less than 5 of the original water input in the sensitivity analysis the relative differences between the original flux and the simulated flux in the scenario analysis are shown in table 3 3 6 1 impacts of soil properties on btf btb and ls the btf presented as the net percolation and was most sensitive to the ks of the ihl followed by that of the chl and mdl the btf increased with the increase in ks of each paddy soil layer nevertheless it slightly decreased as the increase of ks of the mdl because horizontal infiltration was more possible with a larger ks of mdl thus weakening the vertical flow the bottom flux under the bund btb presented as the net groundwater capillary rise and rose with the increase of ks the btb was most sensitive to the varied ks of the ihl on one hand the ihl was the thickest such that the varied ks of the ihl had the greatest effects on the whole soil domain on the other hand the exchange between groundwater and soil water primarily occurred in the ihl and the btb was directly affected by its changing ks when ks decreased the btb was more sensitive to the ks of the paddy field than that of the bund table 3 the decrease of paddy soil ks restricted horizontal infiltration and then mitigated percolation under the bund when ks increased the sensitivity of the btb to the paddy soil ks declined because the soil permeability of the bund played a more important role in the horizontal infiltration lateral seepage was most sensitive to the ihl ks and significantly rose as it increased while it was not sensitive to the other layers ks the results were not consistent with the study of janssen and lennartz 2009 because lateral seepage occurred in different soil layers in the simulation horizontal infiltration into the upper and middle bund did not penetrate the bund and brought about no lateral seepage so that soil property of the upper and middle paddy field bund had little effect lateral seepage was only found in the ihl and changed greatly with the variation in ks of the ihl therefore compaction or impervious measures on the ihl should also be considered in land consolidation to reduce lateral seepage and it is more necessary in a paddy field adjacent to a drainage ditch with a shallow groundwater depth during paddy cultivation repeated submerged conditions cause eluviation in the bund and increase the clay contents in deeper soil layers patil et al 2011 thus decreasing the permeability in the upper bund while increasing the permeability of the lower bund which makes anti seep treatments and maintenance necessary in the upper bund over time 3 6 2 impacts of irrigation on btf btb and ls fig 8 a shows that the btf and btb linearly changed with the increase of the irrigation amount which agreed with the results of the correlation analysis the btf presented the net percolation under different irrigation amounts as the irrigation amount rose the net percolation in the paddy field soared and its ratio to water input increased when the irrigation amount declined to 70 80 and 90 of the original irrigation amount the net percolation decreased by 89 58 58 39 and 28 13 respectively then the corresponding ratios of the btf to water input declined to 4 66 16 29 and 25 04 respectively fig 8b with the increase of the irrigation amount the relative difference of btb decreased and it transferred to net percolation from net groundwater capillary rise the ratio of btb to water input was low the irrigation amount hardly had an effect on lateral seepage and the ratio of the lateral seepage declined as irrigation amount increased which was consistent with the results described above 4 conclusions to clarify the generation of percolation in the paddy field bund landscape and its influencing factors a field experiment and model simulation using hydrus 2d were conducted during the rice growing season in 2014 2015 the soil texture of the bund was similar to that of the paddy field after land consolidation in both years the soil water content in the chl was alternately saturated and unsaturated while the soil in the ihl was nearly saturated the simulated soil water content agreed well with the measured rmse ranging from 0 0026 to 0 0123 cm3 cm 3 and the nse ranging from 0 681 to 0 918 indicating a good performance of the hydrus 2d model the modelling results showed that the transpiration of rice was not affected by the dry environment due to the capillary rise with shallow groundwater depth the amount of groundwater capillary rise was 91 0 mm in 2014 and 121 2 mm in 2015 the percolation in 2014 was 82 1 mm which was lower than that in 2015 291 2 mm under a much larger amount and intensity of water input based on the simulated results horizontal infiltration was primarily found in the upper bund adjacent to the field while lateral seepage was only detected in the lower bund under the groundwater level water loss through the bund constituted the vertical percolation and lateral seepage which was dominated by the lateral seepage in the scenario simulation the btf and btb increased with the increase of ks in each soil layer and were linearly correlated with the irrigation amount however lateral seepage was not sensitive to the variation of the irrigation amount the percolation in the paddy field and vertical horizontal percolation in the bund were most sensitive to the ks of the ihl this study enhanced our understanding of the percolation process in the paddy field bund landscape and was helpful in optimizing the water management and land consolidation in rice planting areas acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the referees and the editors for their valuable comments and suggestions which significantly improve this paper and

11156,improving resource use efficiency is vital for sustainable agricultural production and food security in water scarce regions such as north china plain the aim of this study was to assess the effects of irrigation and straw mulch on accumulated intercepted photosynthetically active radiation aipar radiation use efficiency rue and water use efficiency wue of wheat a two factorial field experiment was carried out at luancheng research station china during 2015 16 and 2016 17 the factors included three irrigation levels full fi deficit di and partial root zone drying prd which besides rainfall received 200 100 and 100 mm of irrigation respectively and two mulching strategies mulch and no mulch 8 and 0 mg ha 1 respectively the results showed that mulch reduced aipar 6 11 and increased rue for total aboveground dry biomass 3 9 mulch affected intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar between the tillering and anthesis stages largely because of reduced soil surface temperature 0 8 1 5 c which led to delayed growth development and impaired light interception no significant difference was observed between di and prd for grain yield however effects on wue varied during the two seasons di led to higher wue during season i compared to prd while prd resulted in highest wue during season ii aipar was reduced under di and prd however rue remained unaffected for irrigation treatments the complementary effects of mulch were observed only under di where wue was increased by 4 6 the results imply that the prd irrigation under field conditions is not as effective as it has been anticipated especially in soils with high clay content mulch induced reduction in growth development tends to nullify its positive effects through water conservation taken together these results reiterate the need to further optimize mulching and prd irrigation practices before recommending their use under field conditions especially for small grain cereals keywords partial root zone drying water conservation water use efficiency radiation use efficiency soil water depletion soil temperature 1 introduction water scarcity is a serious concern in north china plain ncp which is the most important region in china for grain production zhao et al 2015 the dominant cropping system in this region is double cropping of winter wheat and summer maize the geo climatic conditions in this region are favourable for arable farming however water resources exclusively depend on monsoon rainfall the distribution of rainfall is not uniform and about 70 of the total annual rainfall occurs in summer during the maize season zhang et al 2010 winter wheat is irrigated by groundwater extraction which has led to a drop in the groundwater table to 30 m below the soil surface zhang et al 2003 thus substantial efforts are needed either to reduce groundwater depletion rates or to replenish the groundwater with sources other than rainfall the first option is more pragmatic and can be adopted by increasing crop water use efficiency wue through improved on farm water management deficit irrigation di is a common on farm water saving strategy that involves irrigating crops below requirements defined by crop evapotranspiration et fereres and soriano 2007 the amount of water applied under di is reduced relative to the amount required to meet maximum et english 1990 generally it aims to increase wue with minimal reduction in crop yields saving water for alternate purposes partial root zone drying prd is a modified form of di in which two distinct sides of plant root systems are alternatively irrigated with reduced amount of water kang and zhang 2004 alternate wetting and drying of the soil induces aba abscisic acid production in the root system which in turn increases wue through stomatal and transpirational regulation kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 wang et al 2012 since prd affects both physical evaporation and physiological transpiration components of evapotranspiration et it has generally been proved more beneficial than di kang and zhang 2004 shao et al 2008 prd has been used extensively for many field and horticultural crops such as grapevine stoll et al 2000 apple leib et al 2006 papaya de lima et al 2015 cotton du et al 2006 potato liu et al 2017a 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 tomato pazzagli et al 2016 and maize hu et al 2011 prd has also been used for wheat but mainly under greenhouse conditions saradadevi et al 2014 a few studies on wheat used alternate furrow irrigation under field conditions to mimic prd sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 thind et al 2010 yang et al 2011 the execution of prd irrigation under controlled conditions e g pot experiments is different however irrigation practices involving partial wetting and drying of the rootzone under field conditions i e alternate furrow or drip follow the same principle as prd and the terms has been used interchangeably du et al 2006 kang and zhang 2004 shahnazari et al 2007 tang et al 2005 nonetheless prd should be tested for field grown winter wheat to explore benefits for wue also with respect to needs for enhancing wue under future climate change additionally bed sowing of wheat is becoming popular and has shown potential to conserve water under field conditions loper et al 2018 majeed et al 2015 waraich et al 2011 the furrow bed planting system can be used to implement prd irrigation under field conditions e g alternate furrow irrigation the efficacy and suitability of deficit irrigation practices di and prd under field conditions depend on climate and soil water storage in the root zone fereres and soriano 2007 if the root zone have enough water and et is not limited by climate vapour pressure deficit denmead and shaw 1962 actual et eta and yield are not affected under reduced irrigation steduto et al 2009 in this case deficit irrigation will not result in net water saving because water use eta remains the same however the practice is considered sustainable assuming that depleting the soil water will reduce drainage once it s replenished by subsequent rainfall events fereres and soriano 2007 the situation in ncp fits this situation where soil water depleted by winter wheat is replenished by summer monsoon rains if however water in the root zone is depleted so much that it s insufficient to meet crop requirements deficit irrigation reduces both eta and yield fereres et al 2003 under such conditions the aim should be to maximize water productivity yield net income per unit of et rather than crop yield fereres and soriano 2007 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 there are two major arguments for adopting deficit irrigation practices 1 the reduction in dry matter yield under reduced irrigation is less than the reduction in eta which ultimately increases wue liu et al 2006 wakrim et al 2005 this however contradicts the well known concept that biomass water productivity is a conservative parameter steduto et al 2007 also embedded in the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 2 deficit irrigation induced reduction in biomass during the vegetative phase may not severely limit grain yield chai et al 2015 xue et al 2006 although it reduces total biomass a farmer would want to not only maximize the crop yield and deplete soil water to enable the retention of subsequent monsoon rainfall but also to conserve soil water for the next crop partially this is possible by conserving water through reduction in non productive water loss evaporation chen et al 2015 ram et al 2013 stagnari et al 2014 covering soil surface with straw mulch has proven effective to reduce evaporative losses in wheat chen et al 2007 liu et al 2017b qin et al 2015 application of maize straw as mulch in wheat is a cost effective practice in ncp because maize produce large quantity of straw that can be applied to following wheat crop yet straw mulch has been shown to negatively affect crop growth and yield balwinder et al 2011 chen et al 2007 li et al 2008 negative effects of mulch on crop growth and development has been attributed to changes in microclimate soil surface temperature balwinder et al 2011 chen et al 2007 nevertheless due to increasing water scarcity improved water management practices have to be adopted exploring new and or unconventional practices and combination of existing practices could be useful it is also vital to optimize and improve the existing practices such as straw mulching to the best of our knowledge the combination of prd irrigation and straw mulching has rarely been studied for winter wheat in the ncp the aim of this work was to study whether it is possible to maintain both crop yield and stored soil moisture by combining reduced irrigation di and prd and maize straw mulch in winter wheat the objectives were three fold 1 to study the efficacy of prd irrigation for winter wheat under field conditions 2 to study the combined effects of deficit irrigation practices di and prd and straw mulch on resource use efficiency water and radiation and productivity of wheat 3 to reveal the main mechanism behind the negative effects of straw mulch on crop growth and development 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and experimental setup a two year field study was carried out during 2015 16 season i and 2016 17 season ii at luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences the site is located in the north china plain ncp at the base of taihang mountain 37 53 n 114 40 e altitude 50 m ncp has monsoon climate and is known for its double cropping system winter wheat and summer maize weather conditions during the two seasons are given in fig 1 the soil at this site is loamy and well drained with deep profile that is suitable for arable farming average field capacity and wilting point for 2 m soil profile are 36 and 13 v v respectively the total available and readily available water content in the 2 m deep soil profile is around 460 mm and 240 mm respectively soil organic matter and total nitrogen were 1 814 and 1 15 g kg 1 respectively available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were 96 7 19 7 and 96 5 mg kg 1 respectively in the top 20 cm layer the seedbed was prepared by levelling the field followed by soil cultivation and planking basal fertilizers of 300 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate and 150 kg ha 1 urea were applied at the time of sowing and additional 150 kg ha 1 urea was applied at jointing stage wheat was sown in a furrow bed system fig 2 with a seed rate of 240 kg ha 1 sowing was on 19 october 2015 and 8 october 2016 in the two seasons respectively the experiment included two factors irrigation and mulching in a randomized complete block design with split plot arrangement keeping irrigation in main plots and mulching in sub plots supplementary material fig 1s sub plot size was 16 4 m 4 m length width and 13 4 m2 5 m 2 68 m during the two seasons respectively the length of the furrows was same as the length of the sub plots each treatment had 4 and 3 replicates during the two years respectively three irrigation treatments viz full irrigation fi deficit irrigation di and partial root zone drying irrigation prd were included in the experiment the amounts and timing of different irrigation events under three irrigation treatments are given in table 1 the total seasonal irrigation amount for fi was decided on the basis of experience at the luancheng experimental station considering the seasonal crop et long term average seasonal rainfall and expected contribution from the stored soil water zhang et al 2008 the irrigation timings were decided on the basis of crop development and also considering the atmospheric evaporative demand the di and prd received 50 of the full irrigation all furrows were irrigated during all irrigation events for fi and di however for prd treatment alternate furrows were irrigated each sub plot was irrigated separately and the amount applied was measured with a water gauge water meter r80 accuracy 0 001 m3 wuhan china in order to ensure the exact irrigation amount water was applied with a controlled irrigation system briefly the source of irrigation water was an elevated water tank the water coming from the tank was passed through a water gauge before entering a tube diameter 125 mm this tube was connected with small tubes diameter 38 mm which were directly placed in the furrows for irrigation each of these small tubes had knobs to control the flow of water in order to avoid surface runoff and to ensure uniform water application infiltration all experimental plots both main and sub plots were diked two mulching levels 0 and 8 mg ha 1 were included as a second factor maize straw was chopped into pieces 3 10 cm length followed by manual spreading on soil surface furrows and beds the straw was applied at three leaf stage 17 20 days after planting to ensure a uniform mulch layer three leaf stage was chosen to avoid the effects of strong wind which can disturb the uniformity of mulch layer 2 2 measurements and calculations 2 2 1 radiation interception accumulated intercepted photosynthetically active radiation aipar depends on fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation fipar and incoming photosynthetically active radiation par there is a relation between fipar and ratio vegetation index rvi that can be used to estimate fipar from canopy reflectance measurements christensen and goudriaan 1993 olesen et al 2000 zhou et al 2017 canopy reflectance was measured n 6 8 on weekly basis after the start of regrowth in march using rapidscan cs 45 holland scientific lincoln ne usa reflectance was measured around solar noon 11 a m 2 pm every 6 8 days by holding the instrument about 90 cm above the canopy and walking along the rows for the entire plot length manevski et al 2017 olesen et al 2000 zhou et al 2017 the instrument measures reflectance in three bands 670 nm 760 nm and 780 nm rvi was calculated as a ratio between near infrared 780 nm and red 670 nm reflectance fipar was estimated from rvi using the model eq 1 derived by christensen and goudriaan 1993 1 r v i ρ n i r ρ r ρ n i r θ n i r ρ n i r 1 f i p a r 1 θ r 1 f i p a r 2 ρ r θ r ρ r 1 f i p a r 1 f i p a r 1 θ n i r 1 f i p a r 2 where ρnir and ρr are near infrared and red reflectance and ρnir and ρr represent near infrared and red reflectance at highest leaf area index lai 8 θnir and θr are defined as 2 θ j ρ j ρ j s ρ j s 1 ρ j where j is r or nir and ρj s denotes red or near infrared reflectance from bare soil lai 0 which was same for mulch and no mulch since the eq 1 is nonlinear and cannot be solved for fipar as a function of rvi a power function eq 3 was used to approximate it as described by zhou et al 2017 briefly fipar was varied from 0 to 1 with steps of 0 1 and corresponding rvi values according to eq 1 were tabulated the fitting parameters a b and c initially started with arbitrary values followed by optimization of these parameters using grg nonlinear algorithm in microsoft excel 2016 optimization was done to minimize the sum of squared deviation between fipar estimated with eqs 1 and 3 after having the optimized values of a b and c fipar was calculated using the measured rvi values as input to eq 3 3 fipar a b rvi c fipar values were interpolated linearly between measurement dates daily intercepted par ipar was then calculated as 4 ipar i0 fipar where 5 i0 0 50 q q is total daily incoming solar radiation 300 2800 nm measured at the meteorological station at luancheng and i0 is total incoming par during a day aipar was then calculated as the sum of daily ipar during the season start of regrowth until harvest 6 aipar i0 fipar fipar duration sumfpar was calculated from daily estimates of fipar as 7 sumfpar fipar sumfpar is considered as a proxy for leaf area duration and has been shown to correlate with dry matter production bangemann et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 2 2 2 soil temperature soil moisture and crop water use soil temperature was measured at 0 and 5 cm depth throughout the crop season using automatic temperature sensors hobo onset computer co bourne ma usa sensors were installed n 1 2 between the rows after seedling emergence only in the prd treatment soil temperature was logged every 30 min soil water content swc v v was measured every 10 15 days at 20 cm depth intervals up to 1 9 m depth using neutron meter 503 dr cpn international inc usa access tubes were installed in the centre of the plots at the time of sowing at the time of installation of access tubes soil samples were taken from different depths to calibrate the neutron meter during both seasons two access tubes were installed on either side of a bed in prd fig 2 while for fi and di only one access tube was installed measuring the swc with neutron probe is useful because it integrates a sphere around the access tube the neutron probe s sphere of influence is greater than other systems and can cover the spatial variability in swc which may provide better estimate of crop water use especially in furrow irrigation system where water moves both horizontally and vertically total crop water use from sowing to harvest eta was calculated with eq 8 zhang et al 2008 considering soil water measurements up to 1 7 m depth 8 eta i r cr d ro δsw where i is irrigation r is rainfall cr is capillary rise d is drainage beyond the root zone ro is surface runoff and δsw is change in soil water from sowing to harvest ro was never observed because of controlled irrigation and no heavy rainfall during the wheat growing seasons cr was not considered because the groundwater table in that region is 30 m below the soil surface drainage beyond the root zone 1 7 m depth was negligible because of small irrigation amounts and large water holding capacity of the soil difference in soil water content at sowing and at harvest was taken as the depletion of the inherent soil water all the weather conditions including rainfall temperature and solar radiation were observed at a meteorological station situated ca 50 m away from the experimental field 2 2 3 nitrogen availability and plant n content soil available mineral n content no3 and nh4 was measured from the samples taken from 20 40 and 60 cm depths in the second week of march tillering stage air dried and finely ground samples were shaken for 1 h after mixing the soil with 1 m kcl and then the filtrate was analysed for nh4 n and no3 n using uv spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan liu et al 2016 aboveground seedlings and flag leaves were randomly sampled at tillering and anthesis stages respectively samples were washed dried and ground to fine powder plant tissue n content was extracted using sulphuric acid and a mixture of k2so2 cuso4 followed by analysis with the kjeldahl method as described by liu et al 2016 2 2 4 dry matter accumulation grain yield rue and wue crop dry matter accumulation was measured by destructive sampling 20 50 stems per sub plot on fortnightly basis harvested samples were dried in an oven at 80 c for 48 h to determine dry biomass plants from the two central beds 4 75 m2 were harvested manually at maturity june 12 and 8 during 2016 and 2017 respectively followed by threshing using a stationary thresher grains were air dried to a constant weight 13 water content before taking the weight for grain yield gy the yield response factor ky was calculated as ky 1 y ym 1 et etm where ym and etm are the maximum potential yield and corresponding maximum et while y and et are the actual yield and et under suboptimal deficit conditions the ky for di and prd was calculated by taking the highest yield and corresponding et under full irrigation as ym and etm respectively just before the final harvest 60 80 stems were randomly selected and harvested to measure 1000 grain weight grain number per spike and harvest index hi wue was calculated as the ratio of gy to eta irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated as the ratio of gy to irrigation amount rue for gy and total aboveground dry biomass tab at final harvest was calculated as a ratio of gy to aipar ruegy and tab to aipar ruetab respectively 2 3 statistical analysis data on all parameters were checked for normality shapiro and wilk 1965 the effects of irrigation mulching and their interaction were analysed using factorial anova for split plot design in statistix ver 8 1 statistix tallahassee fl usa treatment means were compared using tukey s hsd test at 5 level of significance the slopes of regression lines between aipar and dry matter accumulation were compared with a t test 3 results 3 1 weather weather conditions were slightly different during the two seasons fig 1 season ii was warmer than season i especially during the first two months after sowing and during the grain filling period in may reference evapotranspiration eto calculated with penman monteith equation during seasons i and ii was 550 and 615 mm respectively total rainfall during the two seasons of wheat was 90 and 108 mm respectively and it was scattered over the whole season fig 1 highest daily rainfall during the two seasons was 14 8 and 11 2 mm respectively 3 2 grain yield final biomass and harvest index grain yield was about 1 mg ha 1 higher during season ii than season i table 2 gy was reduced under di and prd treatments during both seasons mulch also reduced gy during season i results showed that regardless of the irrigation treatments the ky was lower under mulch than no mulch table 4 the ky values ranged between 0 15 1 31 and there was great variation during the two seasons season i had higher ky than season ii the ky values under two irrigations were also different during the two seasons where prd had higher values during the season i while di had higher values during the season ii final biomass was not affected by any of the irrigation or mulching treatment however with a tendency of lower values under deficit irrigation and mulching mulch increased hi during the second season positive relation was found between gy and final biomass r2 0 79 p 0 01 final dry biomass and sumfpar r2 0 27 p 0 01 and final dry biomass and aipar r2 0 27 p 0 01 fig 3 abc significant inverse relation was found between gy and grains per spike fig 4 a no relation was found between gy and 1000 grain weight fig 4b 3 3 soil water content and crop water use measurements indicate that swc in the top 0 70 cm layer gradually decreased after the start of regrowth in spring and this was irrespective of irrigation and mulching treatments fig 5 the reduction was higher under di and prd than under fi as indicated by the error bars the difference between full and deficit di and prd irrigation treatments was significant during the season i however less clear during the second season gradual decrease in the swc was due to the depletion of soil water pool the swc in the top 0 30 cm layer on two sides of a bed which were alternately irrigated under prd was different especially under no mulch fig 6 bd clear wetting and drying patterns were observed in prd treatment in the top 0 30 cm layer mulch however tended to minimize the difference in swc on two sides of the bed fig 6ac this difference also decreased at deeper depths i e 50 and 70 cm supplementary material fig 3s 4s the difference in swc among different irrigation treatments decreased with increasing soil depth supplementary material fig 7s the swc at deeper layers also indicate lack of drainage beyond 1 7 m depth supplementary material fig 7s effects of irrigation and mulching on crop water use eta were not consistent during the two seasons table 3 highest and lowest eta were estimated under fi with mulch and di with mulch respectively during season i during season ii the lowest eta was estimated for prd without mulch from irrigation treatments eta was highest under fi followed by prd and di during season i however with no significant difference between three treatments during season ii the least amount of eta was observed under prd the difference in eta between fi and deficit treatments di and prd was smaller than the difference in irrigation amounts table 3 this was due to the contribution depletion of moisture stored in the root zone table 3 the depletion was less under fi than in deficit treatments season i the contribution of depletion to total eta under fi was higher during the second season the contribution of soil water depletion to eta under fi prd and di was around 24 47 and 45 during season i and 36 44 and 49 during season ii respectively overall the effect of mulch on crop water use eta was not sizeable however some interactions were observed mulch increased eta under prd during season ii the mulch effects were different during different growth stages of crop in general mulch decreased eta from tillering to anthesis when soil was not fully covered with vegetation and later in the hot and dry month of may eta under mulch was increased supplementary material table 1s the increase in eta under mulch during the post anthesis period might also be the result of high transpiration because mulch delayed crop growth and development fig 7 no clear trend was observed in the temporal changes of eta under mulch during the second season supplementary material table 1s 3 4 crop dry matter accumulation and radiation interception mulch substantially reduced fipar especially before anthesis fig 7 the peak fipar under no mulch was higher and reached earlier than that under mulch differences in fipar with and without mulch minimized around anthesis 5 may fig 7 mulch effect on fipar was consistent across irrigation treatments and seasons the aipar was significantly reduced under mulch during both seasons table 2 however due to delayed development the proportion of intercepted light during the grain filling period was higher under mulch than no mulch supplementary material fig 2s the magnitude of aipar was higher during the season ii reduction in aipar was also observed under di and prd when compared to fi table 2 positive relation was found between dry matter accumulation and aipar under all treatment combinations and during both seasons r2 0 50 fig 8 the slope of linear regressions between aipar and dry matter accumulation ranged from 3 27 to 4 30 g mj 1 and it was 0 to 15 higher under mulch than no mulch the slopes of regression lines for mulch and no mulch were not statistically different p 0 05 overall the slope was higher during season ii 3 5 radiation and water use efficiency radiation use efficiency for gy with 13 grain moisture ruegy and final dry biomass ruetab was not affected by irrigation table 2 mulching increased ruegy and ruetab under all irrigations during both seasons wue was 10 and 19 higher under di and prd treatments compared to fi during season ii table 3 di under mulch increased wue by 4 6 during both seasons prd under mulch resulted in highest wue 1 95 kg grain m 3 however mulch did not have a consistent positive effect on wue under all irrigations the iwue was significantly higher under di and prd as compared to fi during both seasons while mulch did not affect iwue table 3 3 6 soil temperature plant n content and n availability in soil mulch increased soil temperature during the months when air temperature was decreasing october to february and afterwards until harvest in june the effect was opposite fig 9 during the critical month of march when wheat starts its regrowth after winter the average reductions in soil temperature at 0 and 5 cm depth were 1 5 and 0 8 c respectively during season i these values were 0 3 and 0 2 c during season ii plant available n at different soil depths measured at tillering early march was not affected by mulch supplementary material fig 5s likewise n content in plants was not affected by mulch supplementary material fig 6s n content in plant tissue was slightly lower under mulch at tillering however the effect disappeared before anthesis 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation effects on resource use efficiency and productivity of wheat the results indicate that regardless of irrigation practice di and prd reduced water application reduced grain yield and biomass at maturity table 2 lack of significant positive effects of prd contrasts with other studies where prd have performed better than di chai et al 2015 shao et al 2008 however thind et al 2010 reported a reduction in grain yield of wheat under alternate furrow irrigation the main reason for prd not being as effective as anticipated is likely that its execution under field conditions is not as accurate as in pot experiments although prd resulted in wetting and drying cycles in the top 0 30 cm layer fig 6 swc on two sides of a bed at 50 and 70 cm depths was not so different supplementary material fig 3s 4s for winter wheat having a rooting depth of 2 m zhang et al 2004 wetting and drying cycles in the top soil layer probably could not induce sufficient yield related physiological changes this is also because 60 of the water used by winter wheat in ncp after the jointing stage is extracted from deeper 40 cm soil layers zhang et al 2004 in pot experiments the whole root system is often split into two equal halves using an impermeable sheet that allows to have a precise control over wetting and drying cycles saradadevi et al 2014 however in the field such splitting of the entire root system is not possible the efficacy of prd under field conditions also depends on soil type where heavy soils tends to slow down water infiltration and increase lateral water transport that ultimately minimize the difference between wet and dry furrows conversely in sandy soils where clear alternate wetting patterns were obtained prd not only increased wue but also maintained yield of field grown table potato shahnazari et al 2007 the yield response factor ky initially developed by stewart et al 1977 and adopted by fao doorenbos and kassam 1979 describes the relation between the et reduction with corresponding reduction in yield the ky highlights the crop response to water deficit that could be sensitive tolerant or proportional fereres and soriano 2007 steduto et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 the ky from season i indicate that the yield reduction was either directly proportional to reduced water use ky 1 or the reduction in yield was greater than the proportional reduction in crop water use ky 1 except under di with mulch that had smaller ky ky 1 table 4 the crop yield response to water deficit depends on among others seasonal weather conditions cultivars and agronomic management zhang et al 2017 the ky values has been shown to vary greatly with season wet dry normal zhang et al 2017 and management e g mulching and irrigation igbadun and oiganji 2012 where mulching can lower the ky igbadun and oiganji 2012 we also observed smaller ky values under mulch since the ky varied both under the irrigation treatments and during the two seasons we therefore refrain from generalizing the relation between yield and crop water use under di and prd in the ncp and emphasize the need for future work in general the estimated eta for winter wheat was quite in line with other studies from the ncp qiu et al 2008 zhang et al 2005 2008 zhang et al 2010 our results also support the fact that deficit irrigation may not increase wue due to increased soil water depletion table 3 season i fereres and soriano 2007 conversely if depletion is similar under full and deficit irrigation wue is increased table 3 season ii fereres et al 2003 deficit irrigation treatments di and prd have been shown to increase wue of crops pazzagli et al 2016 we found a comparable reduction in yield and eta thus no clear difference was observed between di and prd for wue during season i the depletion and eta were similar for di and prd during the grain filling period season i supplementary material table 1s and since this is the most important phase for grain yield andersen et al 1996 wue was not affected conversely prd increased wue compared to di during season ii table 3 this was due to higher eta under di during the grain filling period supplementary material table 1s these results indicate that the di and prd effects are also influenced by weather conditions and prd tends to work better during the hot and dry seasons periods fig 1 table 3 despite having no clear effect on wue gy eta deficit irrigation treatments resulted in significantly higher iwue table 3 the increase in iwue was largely due to higher depletion of stored soil water content depletion table 3 depleting the soil during wheat season is useful for sustainable management of crop water use in the ncp this is because wheat and maize are grown in rotation where monsoon rains after the wheat harvest replenish the soil profile for summer maize zhang et al 2008 depletion of soil profile increases its capacity to store water before the monsoon rains that is helpful to conserve water by avoiding runoff and deep drainage long term experimental work has indicated that the contribution of stored soil water depletion to total wheat eta in the ncp can be more than 60 zhang et al 2008 this also highlights the great ability of extensive rooting system of wheat to extract water from deeper soil layers nonetheless regardless of the effects on physiology and yield of wheat deficit irrigation practices can be helpful to bring sustainability in water use for winter wheat summer maize rotation in the ncp the effects of irrigation on ruetab and ruegy were not significant table 2 because deficit irrigation treatments di and prd reduced radiation interception fig 7 table 2 which had long lasting effects on final biomass and yield table 2 estimated ruetab ranged between 2 84 3 28 g mj 1 table 2 which is high for a c3 crop wheat the high rue may have resulted from a high proportion of diffuse light under ncp conditions increase in rue with higher diffuse proportion of incoming light has been reported rodriguez and sadras 2007 sinclair et al 1992 and the high air pollution at luancheng research station in ncp may give rise to high proportion of diffuse light 4 2 mulch effects on resource use efficiency and productivity of wheat slight negative effects of mulch on gy and biomass table 2 confirmed results of previous studies balwinder et al 2011 chen et al 2007 mulch effects can be attributed to decrease in soil surface temperature chen et al 2007 kumar and goh 2002 li et al 2008 n uptake kumar and goh 2002 n availability chen et al 2014 and allelopathic suppression jabran 2017 the major reason behind mulch effects was reduction in soil temperature at 0 and 5 cm depths especially during march when wheat starts to regrow after winter fig 9 lower temperature reduced crop growth and slowed down development which ultimately reduced light interception fig 7 table 2 mulch effects on n availability supplementary material fig 5s and plant n content supplementary material fig 6s cannot explain the variation in yield and biomass the allelopathic effects of mulch on growth and development of wheat were not investigated thus meriting further work mulch increased soil temperature after sowing and before overwintering fig 9 the increase in temperature during this period is generally not effective because air temperature is not a limiting factor for crop growth and development the mulch induced increase in soil temperature during the overwintering period is also not effective because the air temperature during this period remains below the base temperature 0 ºc for wheat thus it does not significantly affect the crop growth and development the most critical time for the effects of mulch induced changes in soil surface temperature is the beginning of spring when active plant growth and development is started after the overwintering although we found strong relation between accumulation of dry matter and aipar fig 3 differences in aipar and sumfpar could only account for 27 r2 of variation in final biomass fig 3bc this was because severe competition during later stages post anthesis leads to death of many plants tillers therefore despite intercepting more light crop under no mulch could not produce correspondingly high biomass since final biomass and gy were highly correlated fig 3a mulch increased rue both for gy and tab table 2 this was also because due to delayed growth mulched plants intercepted more light during grain filling fig 7 supplementary material fig 2s and light interception during this period is vital for grain yield andersen et al 1996 it has been widely reported that straw mulch increases wue of crops peng et al 2015 qin et al 2015 zhang et al 2003 however that was not the case in our study table 2 lack of significant positive effect of straw mulch on wue could be due to the facts that i mulch delays crop growth development fig 7 which can increase crop water use after anthesis ii mulch induced reduction in grain yield tends to nullify its positive effects through water conservation balwinder et al 2011 chen et al 2007 taken together mulch increased rue but did not have consistent positive effect on wue we therefore refrain from generalizing the role of straw mulch in complementing deficit irrigation practices for improving the resource use efficiency and yield of wheat in ncp 5 conclusions and perspectives results showed that reduced irrigation leads to higher depletion of soil water hence when trying to manage the water resources in the north china plain requirements of both wheat and subsequent maize crop should be kept in mind as monsoon rains in ncp tends to replenish soil water applying less water to winter wheat and exploiting the water stored in the root zone is a sustainable practice application of prd irrigation under field conditions is complicated especially in soils with high clay content that favour lateral transport of irrigation water however prd tended to perform better under hot and dry conditions e g the grain filling period during 2016 17 where higher irrigation depth under prd increased infiltration compared to lower irrigation depth under di which results in rapid evaporative loss it is however worth testing to change the prd design i e to increase bed width and decrease water amount per irrigation straw mulch in general has a yield reducing effect that tends to nullify the positive effects through water conservation reduction in soil surface temperature was the major reason behind the mulch effects that delayed crop growth and development ultimately reducing light interception mulching practice should be optimized to minimize its negative effects by considering alternative options i e mulch material size application time spring instead of winter and application method acknowledgement

11156,improving resource use efficiency is vital for sustainable agricultural production and food security in water scarce regions such as north china plain the aim of this study was to assess the effects of irrigation and straw mulch on accumulated intercepted photosynthetically active radiation aipar radiation use efficiency rue and water use efficiency wue of wheat a two factorial field experiment was carried out at luancheng research station china during 2015 16 and 2016 17 the factors included three irrigation levels full fi deficit di and partial root zone drying prd which besides rainfall received 200 100 and 100 mm of irrigation respectively and two mulching strategies mulch and no mulch 8 and 0 mg ha 1 respectively the results showed that mulch reduced aipar 6 11 and increased rue for total aboveground dry biomass 3 9 mulch affected intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar between the tillering and anthesis stages largely because of reduced soil surface temperature 0 8 1 5 c which led to delayed growth development and impaired light interception no significant difference was observed between di and prd for grain yield however effects on wue varied during the two seasons di led to higher wue during season i compared to prd while prd resulted in highest wue during season ii aipar was reduced under di and prd however rue remained unaffected for irrigation treatments the complementary effects of mulch were observed only under di where wue was increased by 4 6 the results imply that the prd irrigation under field conditions is not as effective as it has been anticipated especially in soils with high clay content mulch induced reduction in growth development tends to nullify its positive effects through water conservation taken together these results reiterate the need to further optimize mulching and prd irrigation practices before recommending their use under field conditions especially for small grain cereals keywords partial root zone drying water conservation water use efficiency radiation use efficiency soil water depletion soil temperature 1 introduction water scarcity is a serious concern in north china plain ncp which is the most important region in china for grain production zhao et al 2015 the dominant cropping system in this region is double cropping of winter wheat and summer maize the geo climatic conditions in this region are favourable for arable farming however water resources exclusively depend on monsoon rainfall the distribution of rainfall is not uniform and about 70 of the total annual rainfall occurs in summer during the maize season zhang et al 2010 winter wheat is irrigated by groundwater extraction which has led to a drop in the groundwater table to 30 m below the soil surface zhang et al 2003 thus substantial efforts are needed either to reduce groundwater depletion rates or to replenish the groundwater with sources other than rainfall the first option is more pragmatic and can be adopted by increasing crop water use efficiency wue through improved on farm water management deficit irrigation di is a common on farm water saving strategy that involves irrigating crops below requirements defined by crop evapotranspiration et fereres and soriano 2007 the amount of water applied under di is reduced relative to the amount required to meet maximum et english 1990 generally it aims to increase wue with minimal reduction in crop yields saving water for alternate purposes partial root zone drying prd is a modified form of di in which two distinct sides of plant root systems are alternatively irrigated with reduced amount of water kang and zhang 2004 alternate wetting and drying of the soil induces aba abscisic acid production in the root system which in turn increases wue through stomatal and transpirational regulation kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2006 wang et al 2012 since prd affects both physical evaporation and physiological transpiration components of evapotranspiration et it has generally been proved more beneficial than di kang and zhang 2004 shao et al 2008 prd has been used extensively for many field and horticultural crops such as grapevine stoll et al 2000 apple leib et al 2006 papaya de lima et al 2015 cotton du et al 2006 potato liu et al 2017a 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 tomato pazzagli et al 2016 and maize hu et al 2011 prd has also been used for wheat but mainly under greenhouse conditions saradadevi et al 2014 a few studies on wheat used alternate furrow irrigation under field conditions to mimic prd sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 thind et al 2010 yang et al 2011 the execution of prd irrigation under controlled conditions e g pot experiments is different however irrigation practices involving partial wetting and drying of the rootzone under field conditions i e alternate furrow or drip follow the same principle as prd and the terms has been used interchangeably du et al 2006 kang and zhang 2004 shahnazari et al 2007 tang et al 2005 nonetheless prd should be tested for field grown winter wheat to explore benefits for wue also with respect to needs for enhancing wue under future climate change additionally bed sowing of wheat is becoming popular and has shown potential to conserve water under field conditions loper et al 2018 majeed et al 2015 waraich et al 2011 the furrow bed planting system can be used to implement prd irrigation under field conditions e g alternate furrow irrigation the efficacy and suitability of deficit irrigation practices di and prd under field conditions depend on climate and soil water storage in the root zone fereres and soriano 2007 if the root zone have enough water and et is not limited by climate vapour pressure deficit denmead and shaw 1962 actual et eta and yield are not affected under reduced irrigation steduto et al 2009 in this case deficit irrigation will not result in net water saving because water use eta remains the same however the practice is considered sustainable assuming that depleting the soil water will reduce drainage once it s replenished by subsequent rainfall events fereres and soriano 2007 the situation in ncp fits this situation where soil water depleted by winter wheat is replenished by summer monsoon rains if however water in the root zone is depleted so much that it s insufficient to meet crop requirements deficit irrigation reduces both eta and yield fereres et al 2003 under such conditions the aim should be to maximize water productivity yield net income per unit of et rather than crop yield fereres and soriano 2007 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 there are two major arguments for adopting deficit irrigation practices 1 the reduction in dry matter yield under reduced irrigation is less than the reduction in eta which ultimately increases wue liu et al 2006 wakrim et al 2005 this however contradicts the well known concept that biomass water productivity is a conservative parameter steduto et al 2007 also embedded in the aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 2 deficit irrigation induced reduction in biomass during the vegetative phase may not severely limit grain yield chai et al 2015 xue et al 2006 although it reduces total biomass a farmer would want to not only maximize the crop yield and deplete soil water to enable the retention of subsequent monsoon rainfall but also to conserve soil water for the next crop partially this is possible by conserving water through reduction in non productive water loss evaporation chen et al 2015 ram et al 2013 stagnari et al 2014 covering soil surface with straw mulch has proven effective to reduce evaporative losses in wheat chen et al 2007 liu et al 2017b qin et al 2015 application of maize straw as mulch in wheat is a cost effective practice in ncp because maize produce large quantity of straw that can be applied to following wheat crop yet straw mulch has been shown to negatively affect crop growth and yield balwinder et al 2011 chen et al 2007 li et al 2008 negative effects of mulch on crop growth and development has been attributed to changes in microclimate soil surface temperature balwinder et al 2011 chen et al 2007 nevertheless due to increasing water scarcity improved water management practices have to be adopted exploring new and or unconventional practices and combination of existing practices could be useful it is also vital to optimize and improve the existing practices such as straw mulching to the best of our knowledge the combination of prd irrigation and straw mulching has rarely been studied for winter wheat in the ncp the aim of this work was to study whether it is possible to maintain both crop yield and stored soil moisture by combining reduced irrigation di and prd and maize straw mulch in winter wheat the objectives were three fold 1 to study the efficacy of prd irrigation for winter wheat under field conditions 2 to study the combined effects of deficit irrigation practices di and prd and straw mulch on resource use efficiency water and radiation and productivity of wheat 3 to reveal the main mechanism behind the negative effects of straw mulch on crop growth and development 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and experimental setup a two year field study was carried out during 2015 16 season i and 2016 17 season ii at luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences the site is located in the north china plain ncp at the base of taihang mountain 37 53 n 114 40 e altitude 50 m ncp has monsoon climate and is known for its double cropping system winter wheat and summer maize weather conditions during the two seasons are given in fig 1 the soil at this site is loamy and well drained with deep profile that is suitable for arable farming average field capacity and wilting point for 2 m soil profile are 36 and 13 v v respectively the total available and readily available water content in the 2 m deep soil profile is around 460 mm and 240 mm respectively soil organic matter and total nitrogen were 1 814 and 1 15 g kg 1 respectively available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were 96 7 19 7 and 96 5 mg kg 1 respectively in the top 20 cm layer the seedbed was prepared by levelling the field followed by soil cultivation and planking basal fertilizers of 300 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate and 150 kg ha 1 urea were applied at the time of sowing and additional 150 kg ha 1 urea was applied at jointing stage wheat was sown in a furrow bed system fig 2 with a seed rate of 240 kg ha 1 sowing was on 19 october 2015 and 8 october 2016 in the two seasons respectively the experiment included two factors irrigation and mulching in a randomized complete block design with split plot arrangement keeping irrigation in main plots and mulching in sub plots supplementary material fig 1s sub plot size was 16 4 m 4 m length width and 13 4 m2 5 m 2 68 m during the two seasons respectively the length of the furrows was same as the length of the sub plots each treatment had 4 and 3 replicates during the two years respectively three irrigation treatments viz full irrigation fi deficit irrigation di and partial root zone drying irrigation prd were included in the experiment the amounts and timing of different irrigation events under three irrigation treatments are given in table 1 the total seasonal irrigation amount for fi was decided on the basis of experience at the luancheng experimental station considering the seasonal crop et long term average seasonal rainfall and expected contribution from the stored soil water zhang et al 2008 the irrigation timings were decided on the basis of crop development and also considering the atmospheric evaporative demand the di and prd received 50 of the full irrigation all furrows were irrigated during all irrigation events for fi and di however for prd treatment alternate furrows were irrigated each sub plot was irrigated separately and the amount applied was measured with a water gauge water meter r80 accuracy 0 001 m3 wuhan china in order to ensure the exact irrigation amount water was applied with a controlled irrigation system briefly the source of irrigation water was an elevated water tank the water coming from the tank was passed through a water gauge before entering a tube diameter 125 mm this tube was connected with small tubes diameter 38 mm which were directly placed in the furrows for irrigation each of these small tubes had knobs to control the flow of water in order to avoid surface runoff and to ensure uniform water application infiltration all experimental plots both main and sub plots were diked two mulching levels 0 and 8 mg ha 1 were included as a second factor maize straw was chopped into pieces 3 10 cm length followed by manual spreading on soil surface furrows and beds the straw was applied at three leaf stage 17 20 days after planting to ensure a uniform mulch layer three leaf stage was chosen to avoid the effects of strong wind which can disturb the uniformity of mulch layer 2 2 measurements and calculations 2 2 1 radiation interception accumulated intercepted photosynthetically active radiation aipar depends on fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation fipar and incoming photosynthetically active radiation par there is a relation between fipar and ratio vegetation index rvi that can be used to estimate fipar from canopy reflectance measurements christensen and goudriaan 1993 olesen et al 2000 zhou et al 2017 canopy reflectance was measured n 6 8 on weekly basis after the start of regrowth in march using rapidscan cs 45 holland scientific lincoln ne usa reflectance was measured around solar noon 11 a m 2 pm every 6 8 days by holding the instrument about 90 cm above the canopy and walking along the rows for the entire plot length manevski et al 2017 olesen et al 2000 zhou et al 2017 the instrument measures reflectance in three bands 670 nm 760 nm and 780 nm rvi was calculated as a ratio between near infrared 780 nm and red 670 nm reflectance fipar was estimated from rvi using the model eq 1 derived by christensen and goudriaan 1993 1 r v i ρ n i r ρ r ρ n i r θ n i r ρ n i r 1 f i p a r 1 θ r 1 f i p a r 2 ρ r θ r ρ r 1 f i p a r 1 f i p a r 1 θ n i r 1 f i p a r 2 where ρnir and ρr are near infrared and red reflectance and ρnir and ρr represent near infrared and red reflectance at highest leaf area index lai 8 θnir and θr are defined as 2 θ j ρ j ρ j s ρ j s 1 ρ j where j is r or nir and ρj s denotes red or near infrared reflectance from bare soil lai 0 which was same for mulch and no mulch since the eq 1 is nonlinear and cannot be solved for fipar as a function of rvi a power function eq 3 was used to approximate it as described by zhou et al 2017 briefly fipar was varied from 0 to 1 with steps of 0 1 and corresponding rvi values according to eq 1 were tabulated the fitting parameters a b and c initially started with arbitrary values followed by optimization of these parameters using grg nonlinear algorithm in microsoft excel 2016 optimization was done to minimize the sum of squared deviation between fipar estimated with eqs 1 and 3 after having the optimized values of a b and c fipar was calculated using the measured rvi values as input to eq 3 3 fipar a b rvi c fipar values were interpolated linearly between measurement dates daily intercepted par ipar was then calculated as 4 ipar i0 fipar where 5 i0 0 50 q q is total daily incoming solar radiation 300 2800 nm measured at the meteorological station at luancheng and i0 is total incoming par during a day aipar was then calculated as the sum of daily ipar during the season start of regrowth until harvest 6 aipar i0 fipar fipar duration sumfpar was calculated from daily estimates of fipar as 7 sumfpar fipar sumfpar is considered as a proxy for leaf area duration and has been shown to correlate with dry matter production bangemann et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 2 2 2 soil temperature soil moisture and crop water use soil temperature was measured at 0 and 5 cm depth throughout the crop season using automatic temperature sensors hobo onset computer co bourne ma usa sensors were installed n 1 2 between the rows after seedling emergence only in the prd treatment soil temperature was logged every 30 min soil water content swc v v was measured every 10 15 days at 20 cm depth intervals up to 1 9 m depth using neutron meter 503 dr cpn international inc usa access tubes were installed in the centre of the plots at the time of sowing at the time of installation of access tubes soil samples were taken from different depths to calibrate the neutron meter during both seasons two access tubes were installed on either side of a bed in prd fig 2 while for fi and di only one access tube was installed measuring the swc with neutron probe is useful because it integrates a sphere around the access tube the neutron probe s sphere of influence is greater than other systems and can cover the spatial variability in swc which may provide better estimate of crop water use especially in furrow irrigation system where water moves both horizontally and vertically total crop water use from sowing to harvest eta was calculated with eq 8 zhang et al 2008 considering soil water measurements up to 1 7 m depth 8 eta i r cr d ro δsw where i is irrigation r is rainfall cr is capillary rise d is drainage beyond the root zone ro is surface runoff and δsw is change in soil water from sowing to harvest ro was never observed because of controlled irrigation and no heavy rainfall during the wheat growing seasons cr was not considered because the groundwater table in that region is 30 m below the soil surface drainage beyond the root zone 1 7 m depth was negligible because of small irrigation amounts and large water holding capacity of the soil difference in soil water content at sowing and at harvest was taken as the depletion of the inherent soil water all the weather conditions including rainfall temperature and solar radiation were observed at a meteorological station situated ca 50 m away from the experimental field 2 2 3 nitrogen availability and plant n content soil available mineral n content no3 and nh4 was measured from the samples taken from 20 40 and 60 cm depths in the second week of march tillering stage air dried and finely ground samples were shaken for 1 h after mixing the soil with 1 m kcl and then the filtrate was analysed for nh4 n and no3 n using uv spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu japan liu et al 2016 aboveground seedlings and flag leaves were randomly sampled at tillering and anthesis stages respectively samples were washed dried and ground to fine powder plant tissue n content was extracted using sulphuric acid and a mixture of k2so2 cuso4 followed by analysis with the kjeldahl method as described by liu et al 2016 2 2 4 dry matter accumulation grain yield rue and wue crop dry matter accumulation was measured by destructive sampling 20 50 stems per sub plot on fortnightly basis harvested samples were dried in an oven at 80 c for 48 h to determine dry biomass plants from the two central beds 4 75 m2 were harvested manually at maturity june 12 and 8 during 2016 and 2017 respectively followed by threshing using a stationary thresher grains were air dried to a constant weight 13 water content before taking the weight for grain yield gy the yield response factor ky was calculated as ky 1 y ym 1 et etm where ym and etm are the maximum potential yield and corresponding maximum et while y and et are the actual yield and et under suboptimal deficit conditions the ky for di and prd was calculated by taking the highest yield and corresponding et under full irrigation as ym and etm respectively just before the final harvest 60 80 stems were randomly selected and harvested to measure 1000 grain weight grain number per spike and harvest index hi wue was calculated as the ratio of gy to eta irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated as the ratio of gy to irrigation amount rue for gy and total aboveground dry biomass tab at final harvest was calculated as a ratio of gy to aipar ruegy and tab to aipar ruetab respectively 2 3 statistical analysis data on all parameters were checked for normality shapiro and wilk 1965 the effects of irrigation mulching and their interaction were analysed using factorial anova for split plot design in statistix ver 8 1 statistix tallahassee fl usa treatment means were compared using tukey s hsd test at 5 level of significance the slopes of regression lines between aipar and dry matter accumulation were compared with a t test 3 results 3 1 weather weather conditions were slightly different during the two seasons fig 1 season ii was warmer than season i especially during the first two months after sowing and during the grain filling period in may reference evapotranspiration eto calculated with penman monteith equation during seasons i and ii was 550 and 615 mm respectively total rainfall during the two seasons of wheat was 90 and 108 mm respectively and it was scattered over the whole season fig 1 highest daily rainfall during the two seasons was 14 8 and 11 2 mm respectively 3 2 grain yield final biomass and harvest index grain yield was about 1 mg ha 1 higher during season ii than season i table 2 gy was reduced under di and prd treatments during both seasons mulch also reduced gy during season i results showed that regardless of the irrigation treatments the ky was lower under mulch than no mulch table 4 the ky values ranged between 0 15 1 31 and there was great variation during the two seasons season i had higher ky than season ii the ky values under two irrigations were also different during the two seasons where prd had higher values during the season i while di had higher values during the season ii final biomass was not affected by any of the irrigation or mulching treatment however with a tendency of lower values under deficit irrigation and mulching mulch increased hi during the second season positive relation was found between gy and final biomass r2 0 79 p 0 01 final dry biomass and sumfpar r2 0 27 p 0 01 and final dry biomass and aipar r2 0 27 p 0 01 fig 3 abc significant inverse relation was found between gy and grains per spike fig 4 a no relation was found between gy and 1000 grain weight fig 4b 3 3 soil water content and crop water use measurements indicate that swc in the top 0 70 cm layer gradually decreased after the start of regrowth in spring and this was irrespective of irrigation and mulching treatments fig 5 the reduction was higher under di and prd than under fi as indicated by the error bars the difference between full and deficit di and prd irrigation treatments was significant during the season i however less clear during the second season gradual decrease in the swc was due to the depletion of soil water pool the swc in the top 0 30 cm layer on two sides of a bed which were alternately irrigated under prd was different especially under no mulch fig 6 bd clear wetting and drying patterns were observed in prd treatment in the top 0 30 cm layer mulch however tended to minimize the difference in swc on two sides of the bed fig 6ac this difference also decreased at deeper depths i e 50 and 70 cm supplementary material fig 3s 4s the difference in swc among different irrigation treatments decreased with increasing soil depth supplementary material fig 7s the swc at deeper layers also indicate lack of drainage beyond 1 7 m depth supplementary material fig 7s effects of irrigation and mulching on crop water use eta were not consistent during the two seasons table 3 highest and lowest eta were estimated under fi with mulch and di with mulch respectively during season i during season ii the lowest eta was estimated for prd without mulch from irrigation treatments eta was highest under fi followed by prd and di during season i however with no significant difference between three treatments during season ii the least amount of eta was observed under prd the difference in eta between fi and deficit treatments di and prd was smaller than the difference in irrigation amounts table 3 this was due to the contribution depletion of moisture stored in the root zone table 3 the depletion was less under fi than in deficit treatments season i the contribution of depletion to total eta under fi was higher during the second season the contribution of soil water depletion to eta under fi prd and di was around 24 47 and 45 during season i and 36 44 and 49 during season ii respectively overall the effect of mulch on crop water use eta was not sizeable however some interactions were observed mulch increased eta under prd during season ii the mulch effects were different during different growth stages of crop in general mulch decreased eta from tillering to anthesis when soil was not fully covered with vegetation and later in the hot and dry month of may eta under mulch was increased supplementary material table 1s the increase in eta under mulch during the post anthesis period might also be the result of high transpiration because mulch delayed crop growth and development fig 7 no clear trend was observed in the temporal changes of eta under mulch during the second season supplementary material table 1s 3 4 crop dry matter accumulation and radiation interception mulch substantially reduced fipar especially before anthesis fig 7 the peak fipar under no mulch was higher and reached earlier than that under mulch differences in fipar with and without mulch minimized around anthesis 5 may fig 7 mulch effect on fipar was consistent across irrigation treatments and seasons the aipar was significantly reduced under mulch during both seasons table 2 however due to delayed development the proportion of intercepted light during the grain filling period was higher under mulch than no mulch supplementary material fig 2s the magnitude of aipar was higher during the season ii reduction in aipar was also observed under di and prd when compared to fi table 2 positive relation was found between dry matter accumulation and aipar under all treatment combinations and during both seasons r2 0 50 fig 8 the slope of linear regressions between aipar and dry matter accumulation ranged from 3 27 to 4 30 g mj 1 and it was 0 to 15 higher under mulch than no mulch the slopes of regression lines for mulch and no mulch were not statistically different p 0 05 overall the slope was higher during season ii 3 5 radiation and water use efficiency radiation use efficiency for gy with 13 grain moisture ruegy and final dry biomass ruetab was not affected by irrigation table 2 mulching increased ruegy and ruetab under all irrigations during both seasons wue was 10 and 19 higher under di and prd treatments compared to fi during season ii table 3 di under mulch increased wue by 4 6 during both seasons prd under mulch resulted in highest wue 1 95 kg grain m 3 however mulch did not have a consistent positive effect on wue under all irrigations the iwue was significantly higher under di and prd as compared to fi during both seasons while mulch did not affect iwue table 3 3 6 soil temperature plant n content and n availability in soil mulch increased soil temperature during the months when air temperature was decreasing october to february and afterwards until harvest in june the effect was opposite fig 9 during the critical month of march when wheat starts its regrowth after winter the average reductions in soil temperature at 0 and 5 cm depth were 1 5 and 0 8 c respectively during season i these values were 0 3 and 0 2 c during season ii plant available n at different soil depths measured at tillering early march was not affected by mulch supplementary material fig 5s likewise n content in plants was not affected by mulch supplementary material fig 6s n content in plant tissue was slightly lower under mulch at tillering however the effect disappeared before anthesis 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation effects on resource use efficiency and productivity of wheat the results indicate that regardless of irrigation practice di and prd reduced water application reduced grain yield and biomass at maturity table 2 lack of significant positive effects of prd contrasts with other studies where prd have performed better than di chai et al 2015 shao et al 2008 however thind et al 2010 reported a reduction in grain yield of wheat under alternate furrow irrigation the main reason for prd not being as effective as anticipated is likely that its execution under field conditions is not as accurate as in pot experiments although prd resulted in wetting and drying cycles in the top 0 30 cm layer fig 6 swc on two sides of a bed at 50 and 70 cm depths was not so different supplementary material fig 3s 4s for winter wheat having a rooting depth of 2 m zhang et al 2004 wetting and drying cycles in the top soil layer probably could not induce sufficient yield related physiological changes this is also because 60 of the water used by winter wheat in ncp after the jointing stage is extracted from deeper 40 cm soil layers zhang et al 2004 in pot experiments the whole root system is often split into two equal halves using an impermeable sheet that allows to have a precise control over wetting and drying cycles saradadevi et al 2014 however in the field such splitting of the entire root system is not possible the efficacy of prd under field conditions also depends on soil type where heavy soils tends to slow down water infiltration and increase lateral water transport that ultimately minimize the difference between wet and dry furrows conversely in sandy soils where clear alternate wetting patterns were obtained prd not only increased wue but also maintained yield of field grown table potato shahnazari et al 2007 the yield response factor ky initially developed by stewart et al 1977 and adopted by fao doorenbos and kassam 1979 describes the relation between the et reduction with corresponding reduction in yield the ky highlights the crop response to water deficit that could be sensitive tolerant or proportional fereres and soriano 2007 steduto et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 the ky from season i indicate that the yield reduction was either directly proportional to reduced water use ky 1 or the reduction in yield was greater than the proportional reduction in crop water use ky 1 except under di with mulch that had smaller ky ky 1 table 4 the crop yield response to water deficit depends on among others seasonal weather conditions cultivars and agronomic management zhang et al 2017 the ky values has been shown to vary greatly with season wet dry normal zhang et al 2017 and management e g mulching and irrigation igbadun and oiganji 2012 where mulching can lower the ky igbadun and oiganji 2012 we also observed smaller ky values under mulch since the ky varied both under the irrigation treatments and during the two seasons we therefore refrain from generalizing the relation between yield and crop water use under di and prd in the ncp and emphasize the need for future work in general the estimated eta for winter wheat was quite in line with other studies from the ncp qiu et al 2008 zhang et al 2005 2008 zhang et al 2010 our results also support the fact that deficit irrigation may not increase wue due to increased soil water depletion table 3 season i fereres and soriano 2007 conversely if depletion is similar under full and deficit irrigation wue is increased table 3 season ii fereres et al 2003 deficit irrigation treatments di and prd have been shown to increase wue of crops pazzagli et al 2016 we found a comparable reduction in yield and eta thus no clear difference was observed between di and prd for wue during season i the depletion and eta were similar for di and prd during the grain filling period season i supplementary material table 1s and since this is the most important phase for grain yield andersen et al 1996 wue was not affected conversely prd increased wue compared to di during season ii table 3 this was due to higher eta under di during the grain filling period supplementary material table 1s these results indicate that the di and prd effects are also influenced by weather conditions and prd tends to work better during the hot and dry seasons periods fig 1 table 3 despite having no clear effect on wue gy eta deficit irrigation treatments resulted in significantly higher iwue table 3 the increase in iwue was largely due to higher depletion of stored soil water content depletion table 3 depleting the soil during wheat season is useful for sustainable management of crop water use in the ncp this is because wheat and maize are grown in rotation where monsoon rains after the wheat harvest replenish the soil profile for summer maize zhang et al 2008 depletion of soil profile increases its capacity to store water before the monsoon rains that is helpful to conserve water by avoiding runoff and deep drainage long term experimental work has indicated that the contribution of stored soil water depletion to total wheat eta in the ncp can be more than 60 zhang et al 2008 this also highlights the great ability of extensive rooting system of wheat to extract water from deeper soil layers nonetheless regardless of the effects on physiology and yield of wheat deficit irrigation practices can be helpful to bring sustainability in water use for winter wheat summer maize rotation in the ncp the effects of irrigation on ruetab and ruegy were not significant table 2 because deficit irrigation treatments di and prd reduced radiation interception fig 7 table 2 which had long lasting effects on final biomass and yield table 2 estimated ruetab ranged between 2 84 3 28 g mj 1 table 2 which is high for a c3 crop wheat the high rue may have resulted from a high proportion of diffuse light under ncp conditions increase in rue with higher diffuse proportion of incoming light has been reported rodriguez and sadras 2007 sinclair et al 1992 and the high air pollution at luancheng research station in ncp may give rise to high proportion of diffuse light 4 2 mulch effects on resource use efficiency and productivity of wheat slight negative effects of mulch on gy and biomass table 2 confirmed results of previous studies balwinder et al 2011 chen et al 2007 mulch effects can be attributed to decrease in soil surface temperature chen et al 2007 kumar and goh 2002 li et al 2008 n uptake kumar and goh 2002 n availability chen et al 2014 and allelopathic suppression jabran 2017 the major reason behind mulch effects was reduction in soil temperature at 0 and 5 cm depths especially during march when wheat starts to regrow after winter fig 9 lower temperature reduced crop growth and slowed down development which ultimately reduced light interception fig 7 table 2 mulch effects on n availability supplementary material fig 5s and plant n content supplementary material fig 6s cannot explain the variation in yield and biomass the allelopathic effects of mulch on growth and development of wheat were not investigated thus meriting further work mulch increased soil temperature after sowing and before overwintering fig 9 the increase in temperature during this period is generally not effective because air temperature is not a limiting factor for crop growth and development the mulch induced increase in soil temperature during the overwintering period is also not effective because the air temperature during this period remains below the base temperature 0 ºc for wheat thus it does not significantly affect the crop growth and development the most critical time for the effects of mulch induced changes in soil surface temperature is the beginning of spring when active plant growth and development is started after the overwintering although we found strong relation between accumulation of dry matter and aipar fig 3 differences in aipar and sumfpar could only account for 27 r2 of variation in final biomass fig 3bc this was because severe competition during later stages post anthesis leads to death of many plants tillers therefore despite intercepting more light crop under no mulch could not produce correspondingly high biomass since final biomass and gy were highly correlated fig 3a mulch increased rue both for gy and tab table 2 this was also because due to delayed growth mulched plants intercepted more light during grain filling fig 7 supplementary material fig 2s and light interception during this period is vital for grain yield andersen et al 1996 it has been widely reported that straw mulch increases wue of crops peng et al 2015 qin et al 2015 zhang et al 2003 however that was not the case in our study table 2 lack of significant positive effect of straw mulch on wue could be due to the facts that i mulch delays crop growth development fig 7 which can increase crop water use after anthesis ii mulch induced reduction in grain yield tends to nullify its positive effects through water conservation balwinder et al 2011 chen et al 2007 taken together mulch increased rue but did not have consistent positive effect on wue we therefore refrain from generalizing the role of straw mulch in complementing deficit irrigation practices for improving the resource use efficiency and yield of wheat in ncp 5 conclusions and perspectives results showed that reduced irrigation leads to higher depletion of soil water hence when trying to manage the water resources in the north china plain requirements of both wheat and subsequent maize crop should be kept in mind as monsoon rains in ncp tends to replenish soil water applying less water to winter wheat and exploiting the water stored in the root zone is a sustainable practice application of prd irrigation under field conditions is complicated especially in soils with high clay content that favour lateral transport of irrigation water however prd tended to perform better under hot and dry conditions e g the grain filling period during 2016 17 where higher irrigation depth under prd increased infiltration compared to lower irrigation depth under di which results in rapid evaporative loss it is however worth testing to change the prd design i e to increase bed width and decrease water amount per irrigation straw mulch in general has a yield reducing effect that tends to nullify the positive effects through water conservation reduction in soil surface temperature was the major reason behind the mulch effects that delayed crop growth and development ultimately reducing light interception mulching practice should be optimized to minimize its negative effects by considering alternative options i e mulch material size application time spring instead of winter and application method acknowledgement

11157,fertility and crop production in soils of the recently glaciated agricultural midwestern u s link to soil inorganic and organic carbon soil nitrogen and nitrogen inputs research relating transport of each to the others through the constructed drainage network to receiving streams is sparse the main objective of this work was to quantify and characterize concentrations and yields of inorganic and organic carbon ic and oc along with nitrate nitrogen no3 n using a four year dataset that included discharge from two managed drainage districts in the cornbelt state of iowa our analysis shows loss of carbon through these constructed drainage networks averages 124 kg ha 1 yr 1 with more than 90 of this total in carbonate form and only 7 in organic forms a small amount relative to soil organic stores transport of no3 n can total as much as 97 kg ha 1 yr 1 although loads of ic oc and no3 n all vary similarly with discharge no3 n is especially transport limited elevated oc concentrations in march are likely linked to recent manure application to soil surfaces with concentrations returning to a consistent baseline thereafter concentrations of ic are lowest at high flows indicating dilution by fresh water from recent hydrologic events into the drainage system which disproportionately mobilize no3 n compared to ic although yields of ic and oc to the drainage system indicate tile drainage does not threaten to deplete soil organic matter stores returning the system to a condition where carbon and nitrogen cycle together could improve stream water quality keywords nitrate nitrogen alkalinity inorganic carbon organic carbon tile soil drainage water quality 1 introduction the u s state of iowa lies within the midwest cornbelt and contains some of the world s most productive farmland frequently topping all other states in the harvested totals of corn zea mays l and soybeans glycine max l merr and helping the u s be the world s largest producer of corn every year since at least 1961 heinemann et al 2014 a level landscape a temperate climate abundant precipitation and soils rich in nitrogen and both inorganic ic and organic carbon oc ruhe 1969

the most recently glaciated area the des moines lobe dml calcareous soils were formed as these carbonate rich glacial deposits weathered over time rabenhorst et al 1991 rogovska et al 2007 atmospheric carbon co2 is sequestered in the pedosphere through the production of oc by photosynthesis eq 1 stryer 1995 oxidation of oc through natural and agricultural processes eq 2 amiotte suchet et al 2003 liberates co2 from organic compounds and this carbon subsequently returns to the atmosphere or reacts with carbonate rocks chemical weathering eq 3 the presence of ca2 ions in the soil profile is

result being a relatively high organic matter content al kaisi et al 2012 soils with ample oc are especially suitable for corn production al kaisi et al 2012 because oc enhances nutrient and water availability soil aggregation aeration hydraulic conductivity and cation exchange capacity khan et al 2007 much of the oc in cornbelt soils has been lost through soil erosion fenton et al 2005 and other processes such as oxidation resulting from soil tillage ding et al 2002 the effects on productivity resulting from depletion of soil oc have been masked by increased use of chemical inputs such as nitrogen fertilizers this along with other improvements in farming practices have prevented decreases in crop yields in most areas fenton et al 2005 nitrogen fertilizer is very commonly applied by iowa farmers as anhydrous ammonia nh3 which is subsequently oxidized to nitrate no3 n during processes mediated by microbes acidifying the soil eq 4 and hastening the dissolution and leaching of calcium bicarbonate in the process barak et al 1997 because of soil acidification and depletion of ic many iowa farmers apply agricultural lime to cropped fields to improve soil structure and optimize crop production conditions jones and schilling 2013 4 nh3 2o2 h no3 h2o in addition to chemical perturbation resulting from agricultural activities the moisture condition of dml soils has been drastically altered through the installation of constructed drainage artificial subsurface drain tiles perforated pipes are installed 1 2 m below the soil surface in nearly all dml farmed fields to lower the water table in areas where natural drainage is insufficient for maximum crop yields singh et al 2006 streeter and schilling 2017 these drain tiles provide an easy pathway for ic oc and no3 n to enter the stream network of the dml loss of no3 n in tile drained landscapes has been well characterized over the past 40 years baker et al 1975 randall et al 1997 ikenberry et al 2014 three notable studies have evaluated transport of ic at the mississippi basin scale gaillardet et al 1999 raymond and cole 2003 raymond et al 2008 while jones and schilling 2013 characterized ic transport from one mississippi river tributary vidon et al 2008 2009 and wagner et al 2008 investigated storm event oc and no3 n transport from two small 11 km2 indiana watersheds royer and david 2005 quantified dissolved oc in agricultural drainage tile water in the cornbelt state of illinois concluding that loading was driven mainly by water yield and was small relative to soil organic matter pools the character and amount of stream dissolved oc was found to be influenced by agricultural land use by wilson and xenopoulos 2009 with nitrogen enrichment a probable mechanism for changes in the predominant types of carbon exported by streams further they reported that pore water oc under tilled land tends to contain lower molecular weight carbon compounds to our knowledge however no research exists relating long term ic oc and no3 n transport from an artificially drained catchment devoted almost entirely to crop production considering the importance of fertility and the relevance of ic oc and no3 n to continued robust corn and soybean production a more complete understanding of how soil carbon is being lost to the stream network through constructed drainage networks is needed our specific research objectives were to 1 quantify ic and oc export through constructed drainage networks and compare c export to soil organic matter stores 2 compare and contrast the timing and amounts of carbon and no3 n export and 3 develop a conceptual model for c and no3 n export from the tile drained watershed that accounts for different sources and transport pathways to achieve these objectives we evaluated the loss patterns of c and n from a 4 year data record of discharge alkalinity ic total organic carbon oc and no3 n from two organized and managed dml constructed drainage networks to gain insights into the magnitude of these losses and the sources of these water quality constituents 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this research was focused on tile drainage from two organized and managed drainage districts within the western cornbelt of the u s both discharge to lyons creek which drains a 42 km2 watershed situated on the dml landform of central iowa prior

2015 productive soils temperate climate and gentle relief maximum 45 m are highly favorable for cultivation of corn and soybeans soil in webster county where most of the watersheds lies has an iowa carbon index of 38 and a corn suitability rating of 74 both well above the state average al kaisi et al 2012 area planted to these two crops covers approximately 84 of the lyons catchment area schilling et al 2012 lyons creek is a tributary to the boone and des moines rivers the latter a source of municipal supply for the downstream iowa cities of boone ottumwa des moines and its surrounding metropolitan area the two drainage districts hereafter designated 3 t and 5 t drain water from 600 and 1096 ha respectively constructed drainage within the districts consists of subsurface pipe networks 15 23 cm diameter spaced 24 30 m apart singh et al 2006 installed 1 2 m below the surface in cropped fields these field tiles feed into systematically larger main trunk lines before terminating in a 91 cm diameter pipe at both the 3 t and 5 t outlets vertical surface inlets connect to field tiles in some depressional spots that otherwise would accumulate standing water following rain and snowmelt individual farmers and landowners install and manage the field tile networks while the larger downstream infrastructure is managed at the county government level row crop land coverage is greater within the 3 t and 5 t drainage districts than in the lyons creek watershed as a whole with corn and soybean fields occupying 87 91 of the drainage district area schilling et al 2012 2 2 hydrology flow volumes from 3 t and 5 t were quantified from 1 feb 2012 to 31 dec 2015 with isco 2150 area velocity flow modules the sensors were secured with expansion rings on the inside of the pipes 2 m from the outlet the apparatus measured water depth with a pressure transducer and water velocity with ultrasonic sound waves measurements were taken and stored at intervals of 5 min and then aggregated to daily averages daily and monthly average precipitation and air temperature data were gathered from the webster city iowa location fig 1 located near the mouth of lyons creek iowa state university 2018 2 3 water quality sampling and analysis grab samples were collected at approximately biweekly intervals as part of the iowa soybean association ambient water monitoring program which is governed by a quality assurance project plan approved by the iowa department of natural resources dnr samplers are certified in proper sample collection techniques using iowater volunteer water monitoring program protocols iowa dnr 2014 a dipper apparatus was used to collect water flowing from the main trunk tile and the water was then transferred to a 500 ml polyethylene terephthalate bottle ic and no3 n the bottles were placed in ice and transported to the laboratory on the day of collection where a 125 ml portion of the sample was transferred to an amber glass bottle containing acid preservative oc alkalinity and ic were quantified in the state certified iowa soybean association laboratory using standard methods procedure 2320b apha 2005 alkalinity was quantified by titration with acid to ph 4 5 and reported as mg l 1 caco3 inorganic carbon ic was quantified from the alkalinity data assuming a factor of 2 correction for the charge difference between carbonate and bicarbonate bicarbonate concentrations were calculated using ph and total alkalinity on a subset of samples to ensure that this form of alkalinity was dominant 0 98 total organic carbon toc here referred to as oc was quantified using standard methods procedure 5310b high temperature combustion apha 2005 this analysis was conducted in the des moines water works testing laboratory also state certified nitrate n was quantified in the iowa soybean association laboratory using usepa method 300 0 ion chromatography edgell et al 1994 laboratory quality control procedures included blanks spiked samples replicates and known concentration samples although many studies focus on dissolved oc doc the low turbidity 1 nephelometric turbidity units of tile water samples implied most of the organic carbon was in the dissolved form we analyzed a subset of 12 samples for both doc and toc and found the values to be nearly equivalent for that reason and to avoid the inconvenience of filtering samples in the field for this analysis we chose to use toc as the metric for assessing movement of organic carbon from these tiled systems 2 4 data analysis discharge data was recorded every day of the study while water quality measurements were far less frequent collected approximately biweekly during the study period for this reason calculated monthly loads of ic oc and no3 n were the product of monthly average discharge and monthly average concentration of all available samples annual loads were calculated by summing the monthly loads yields of ic oc and no3 n were calculated by dividing these monthly and annual loads by catchment area for 3 t and 5 t no data were available for january 2012 and thus 2012 loads and average concentrations were calculated only with feb dec data january is typically a low load month in iowa because of frozen conditions and low discharges although concentrations of some parameters including alkalinity and no3 n can be somewhat high compared to entire calendar year relations between sites 3 t and 5 t and between ic oc and no3 n were quantified using the r project for statistical computing dessau and pipper 2008 3 results 3 1 weather annual precipitation mm at the webster city ia station totaled 646 2012 823 2013 1008 2014 and 1071 2015 widespread drought and unseasonably warm weather affected the region throughout 2012 and extended dryness dominated in the second half of 2013 long term annual average precipitation for the site since 1893 is 784 mm and the most recent 30 yr average is 909 mm for the period of study here 2012 2015 may was the wettest month average 146 mm while january was the driest 13 mm a total of 46 5 of the precipitation was recorded in the months of april may and june the single wettest month was aug 2015 248 mm while the driest was mar 2015 8 mm none of the four years included in our study was in the top 10 wettest or driest years recorded since 1893 average annual air temperature c ranged from 6 5 2014 to 10 2 2012 monthly average temperatures ranged from 7 7 c feb to 22 1 c jul the single warmest month was jul 2012 25 5 c while the single coldest month was feb 2014 12 0 c long term annual average temperature at the site since 1893 is 8 6 c while the average for the most recent 30 yrs is 8 5 c the year of 2014 was the coldest year ever recorded at the site since 1893 while 2012 was the 5th warmest 3 2 discharge discharge averaged 3120 and 6685 m3 day 1 in 3 t and 5 t respectively table 1 fig 2 equating to average water yields of 190 and 223 mm yr 1 the receiving boone river draining a total area of 218 600 ha had an average water yield of 200 mm yr 1 for the same period discharge was highest in both drainage districts in 2015 with 3 t averaging 5342 m3 day 1 and 5 t 10 086 m3 day 1 each drainage district also had its lowest discharge year in 2012 when drought was widespread across the region with flows averaging 517 m3 day 1 from 3 t and 1033 m3 day 1 from 5 t maximum flows measured were 67 800 3 t and 107 000 m3 day 1 5 t together the two drainage districts on average comprised 0 8 of the total boone river flow recorded flow was 0 01 m3 day 1 in 3 t on 94 of the 1430 study days 6 6 while 5 t flow was 0 01 m3 day 1 flow on 349 days 24 4 thus while 3 t had more reliable flow overall water yield was higher in 5 t fig 2 illustrates there were two periods of very low or no flow aug 2012 through mar 2013 and aug 2013 through mar 2014 flows 0 01 m3 day 1 were continuously recorded from both drainage districts from 9 mar 2014 through the end of the monitoring period 31 dec 2015 a period of 663 consecutive days 3 3 inorganic carbon ic average ic concentrations over the study period were 62 mg l 1 σ 15 3 t and 16 5 t in both 3 t and 5 t while maximum values were 84 3 t and 91 mg l 1 5 t table 1 figs 2 4 concentrations between 3 t and 5 t correlated significantly at p 0 01 monthly averages were highest from sep jan while lowest in mar jun period for both tiles fig 4 annual averages were lowest in 2013 and highest in 2015 with both tiles following this pattern fig 4 values in 2015 were more than 40 higher than those measured in 2013 annual average yields fig 5 of ic were 111 3 t and 121 kg ha 1 5 t yields were highest in 2015 with both drainage districts delivering around 240 kg ha 1 the drought year of 2012 produced yields of 20 kg ha 1 from both catchments may and jun produced the highest monthly yields while jan and feb produced the lowest 3 4 organic carbon oc concentrations of oc were much lower than ic and averaged 3 1 3 t and 3 8 mg l 1 5 t over the period of study σ 1 7 3 t and 2 1 5 t maximum oc concentrations were 14 3 and 15 mg l 1 in 3 t and 5 t respectively while ic concentrations were lowest in both 3 t and 5 t during 2013 oc concentrations averaged highest in that year for both tiles fig 4 concentrations of oc were lowest in the winter dec feb period but were decidedly higher in march than in any other month concentrations between 3 t and 5 t correlated significantly at p 0 01 yields of oc over the four year period averaged 6 2 and 9 2 kg ha 1 in 3 t and 5 t respectively only 6 6 that of ic when the two drainage districts are considered in aggregate fig 5 in contrast to concentration average yields were highest in may as loads tracked with discharge yields of oc were lowest in jan and feb 3 5 nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentrations of no3 n fig 4 averaged considerably higher in 5 t 25 6 mg l 1 than in 3 t 19 4 mg l 1 σ 13 0 3 t and 13 9 5 t maximum concentrations were 47 9 3 t and 77 4 5 t mg l 1 with both of these occurring in 2013 average concentrations were lowest in the drought year of 2012 7 0 and 13 3 mg l 1 in 3 t and 5 t respectively and highest in 2013 for 5 t 30 4 mg l 1 and 2015 for 3 t 27 4 mg l 1 interestingly 3 t concentrations increased each year of the study concentrations between 3 t and 5 t correlated significantly at p 0 01 annual yields fig 5 of no3 n averaged 52 3 3 t and 61 3 kg ha 1 5 t over the four year study period like ic and oc yields were lowest in the drought year of 2012 7 kg ha 1 for both drainage districts and highest in the wet year of 2015 88 6 and 97 4 kg ha 1 for 3 t and 5 t respectively average monthly yields were highest in the may jun period with 49 8 of the total annual no3 n delivery occurring in these two months when the drainage districts are considered in aggregate smallest average monthly yields occurred in january and february when less than 1 kg ha 1 was lost from the two catchments combined 3 6 relations between ic oc no3 n and discharge while correlations are not statistically significant oc and ic relate inversely in both drainage tiles fig 6 levels of oc greater than 8 mg l 1 double the average are associated with ic concentrations of 40 mg l 1 or less 2 3 of the average likewise the highest concentrations of ic are associated with oc levels well below average while no3 n concentrations do not link with either oc or ic overall like the oc ic relationship the highest oc concentrations coincide with very low no3 n levels indicating the sources of the oc ic and no3 n are distinct daily concentration histograms are shown in fig 7 mainly because of many low concentration samples the range of no3 n results 2 orders of magnitude is much wider than that for ic and oc 1 order of magnitude for each concentrations are not normally distributed for any of the parameters in either of the tiles for ic 68 of the samples had concentrations between 60 and 80 mg l 1 and for oc 84 were between 1 5 and 4 5 mg l 1 concentrations of no3 n were less easily generalized with 70 between 16 and 40 mg l 1 but also 24 less than 8 mg l 1 percentile load and discharge curves are shown in fig 8 while loads track well with discharge for all three parameters in both tiles this relationship is especially close for no3 n loads of ic and oc both deviate from discharge in the largest 50 of discharges with these higher flows containing a disproportionately small amount of ic and large amount of oc again implying the sources of ic oc and no3 n differ 4 discussion 4 1 concentration and loading patterns of carbon and nitrate when the two drained catchments are considered in aggregate ic loss to the stream network averaged 116 kg ha 1 yr 1 very similar to the 124 kg ha 1 yr 1 jones and schilling 2013 reported for the neighboring raccoon river watershed for the period 2000 2011 raymond and cole 2003 using annual average discharge and alkalinity data calculated upper mississippi river ic yields of 193 kg ha 1 yr 1 using annual average discharge and alkalinity data although the raccoon watershed and the 3 t and 5 t catchments evaluated comprise tiny portions of the upper mississippi watershed it is interesting that 3 t and 5 t ic yields are substantially smaller than those from the larger basin yields calculated by raymond and cole 2003 this likely is an indication of greater water yield in the larger basin for the period of study here 2012 2015 upper mississippi river basin water yield was 288 mm jones et al 2018a compared to 190 and 223 mm for 3 t and 5 t respectively however the ratio of water yield in the lyons creek catchments versus the upper mississippi is 0 72 while the ic yield ratio is 0 60 indicating that the ic concentrations in lyons catchments are about 17 less than the upper mississippi this indicates relatively lower alkalinity water is discharging from 3 t and 5 t compared to that entering the rest of the upper mississippi the monthly concentration patterns of ic indicate consistent levels in the jul through feb period average 69 mg l 1 for 3 t and 5 t with lower values from mar jun 53 mg l 1 typically this is a wet period in iowa when there is little crop water uptake declines in ic concentration from mar jun illustrate the effects of lower ic water quickly infiltrating downward through a soil profile that has been depleted of carbonates during drier months tiles are affected more by deeper groundwater or water that has had a greater amount of time to dissolve carbonates both concentrations and loads of ic were substantially higher in the wettest year of the study 2015 interestingly total discharge in the two tiles was 41 greater in 2015 than in 2014 even though precipitation was only 6 greater since 2014 was also quite wet this indicates abundant soil moisture going into 2015 the second half of 2013 was very dry and even though precipitation was 22 greater in 2014 than 2013 total discharge in the two tiles increased less than 3 from 2013 to 2014 the large 2015 load illustrates how flux of ic in these tile drained systems is largely transport limited jones and schilling 2013 mirroring the mississippi river basin as a whole raymond et al 2008 estimated that over half of the increased mississippi river basin flux observed from 1954 to 2001 was driven by increased discharge the data presented in this study illustrate how year to year variations of discharge are also the primary drivers of variable ic flux in these managed catchments of the mississippi basin yields of oc from the two tiles combined average 7 7 kg ha 1 ranging from 1 to 12 4 kg ha 1 while concentrations averaged 3 4 mg l 1 over the four years in the nearby state of illinois royer and david 2005 reported nearly identical concentrations 3 1 to 3 9 mg l 1 with slightly higher yields ranging from 3 to 23 kg ha 1 yr 1 over a ten year period from agricultural drainage tiles in headwater areas similar to the lyons creek catchments the maximum concentration reported in that study 16 mg l 1 was also similar to the maximum value observed in 3 t and 5 t 15 mg l 1 elsewhere dissolved oc concentrations from farms in germany have been reported at levels about double to lyons creek with overall averages of 7 6 mg l 1 measured by graeber et al 2012 average concentrations ranged from 1 3 to 35 3 mg l 1 and yields from 0 1 to 8 75 kg ha 1 yr 1 among seven catchments in 3 t and 5 t oc concentrations were far higher in march than any other month this typically is the month when winter snows completely melt and soil temperatures regularly begin to exceed freezing in iowa coupled with the fact that late fall and early spring are the most favorable times for manure application to farmed fields in the western cornbelt region randall and schmitt 1998 dinnes et al 2002 lawlor et al 2011 the march flush of oc through the drainage system is likely due to both snowmelt manure application and crop residue from the previous harvest this observation is consistent with vidon et al 2008 2009 who found that tile drainage provided a quick transfer mechanism for near surface oc to the stream network and many other studies showing the importance of soil macropores to oc transport kladivko et al 1991 kung et al 2000 stone and wilson 2006 hruby et al 2016 furthermore vidon et al 2008 2009 determined that oc originating from mineral soils provides stream baseflow oc they reported that as a runoff event begins oc richer in aromatic substances at or near the soil surface is mobilized royer and david 2005 also observed march spikes in oc concentrations in illinois tiles additional evidence of the march oc levels being linked to surface applied manure and crop residue is the ratio of ic oc for the entire period of record this ratio is 20 8 for all months but only 3 8 during march thus we believe the march oc concentration peak for 3 t and 5 t is a result of these surface applied materials adding to the baseflow oc solubilized from deeper within the soil profile the concentration of which likely varies little throughout the rest of the year this surface material is quickly exhausted with the result being a return to baseline oc concentration levels yields of oc from 3 t and 5 t combined averaged 10 15 kg ha 1 yr 1 which is only about 1 10th of the ic yield however oc concentrations and loads should not be used as an indicator of how much soil organic matter is being lost to the tile network the processes shown in eqs 1 3 illustrate how soil organic matter can exit the tile drainage system after being converted to ic with one of the bicarbonate carbon atoms in eq 3 originating from carbonate rock and one from oxidized soil organic matter jones and schilling 2013 in the combined 3 t and 5 t drainage catchments total loss of carbon through the drainage system averaged 124 kg ha 1 yr 1 116 as ic and 8 as oc with a maximum of ½ of the ic linked back to soil organic matter 66 kg ha 1 yr 1 of soil organic carbon is being lost to the stream network at most and the origin of some portion of this amount is almost certainly linked to recently applied manure and other surface materials such as crop residue this compares favorably with the amount reported by jones and schilling 2013 for the far larger 9389 km2 raccoon river watershed which lies 50 km to the west of the lyons watershed and also drains the dml landform they calculated 61 kg ha 1 yr 1 as the maximum possible soil carbon loss to the stream network using alkalinity and oc data for the period 2000 2011 this amount was found to be small relative to measured soil oc stores 0 03 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 and oc exported in the grain harvest royer and david 2005 also found carbon flux from illinois tiles to be small relative to soil pools although they focused solely on oc and not ic since the ic yields from 3 t and 5 t are similar to those for the much larger raccoon river watershed we believe that the soil processes and transport mechanisms in the smaller drainage catchments are similar to those in the larger watershed overall thus carbon transported through the tile network in the organic form is delivered mainly during baseflows with the march flush of surface material adding to this amount annual yields of no3 n over the 4 yr study period averaged 57 kg ha 1 3 t and 5 t combined and when the 2012 drought year is excluded 74 kg ha 1 although our primary research objective was not to characterize no3 n yields these values are similar to somewhat higher for other dml studies ikenberry et al 2014 reported annual no3 n yields from these two and one additional lyons catchment to be 29 to 52 kg ha 1 2009 2013 jones et al 2017 reported an annual average yield for the north raccoon river watershed 50 km to the west of lyons creek of 35 kg ha 1 2008 2015 while david et al 2010 estimated north raccoon watershed jan jun yield of 15 25 kg ha 1 1997 to 2006 similar to 3 t and 5 t des moines lobe yields as high as 60 kg ha 1 were reported by tomer et al 2003 average concentrations of 3 t and 5 t no3 n were approximately double the u s standard for municipal drinking water 10 mg l 1 sayre 1988 and that of the receiving boone river reported by jones et al 2018b when examining the time series of ic and no3 n concentrations fig 2 it is interesting that there are periods when drops in ic are accompanied by increases in no3 n notably spring of 2012 and 2013 at both of these times spring rains followed a period of dryness especially spring of 2013 where the supply of loss vulnerable no3 n on the landscape could be expected to be high as a result of drought lucey and goolsby 1993 copious rains in spring 2013 hillaker 2013 encountered abundant soil no3 n left behind by poor crop uptake during summer 2012 jones et al 2016 the data shown in fig 2 imply that this abundant moisture infiltrating from the surface was able to disproportionately solubilize no3 n relative to ic richard and steenhuis 1988 demonstrated that preferential flows in tiled systems could rapidly increase the concentration of chloride from near surface areas in tile drains and that the chloride travel time was two orders of magnitude more rapid than that predicted by flow models similarly baker et al 2004 stated that as the carrier volume for no3 n increases the time for attenuation of surface applied nitrogen i e denitrification decreases effectively increasing no3 n in tile drains at the same time upper soil profiles and well drained areas have often been leached of carbonate rock a source of ic in soil water stumm and morgan 1996 jones and schilling 2013 and it is known that inherited carbonates have been depleted in the upper soil horizons of many iowa soils ruhe 1969 hallberg 1978 kemmis et al 1981 it must be pointed out that some farmers do apply agricultural lime to farmed fields where carbonates have been depleted however jones and schilling 2013 estimated that if all these lime inputs were lost as bicarbonate they would still only represent 31 of ic in the nearby raccoon river thus we believe the drops in ic concentration that coincide with increases in no3 n concentrations reflect low alkalinity surface water from recent precipitation events dissolving near surface no3 n and then quickly making its way to drainage tiles 4 2 sources and pathways the concentration data shown in figs 2 4 show that the no3 n concentrations vary over a larger range of values than either ic or oc loads of no3 n align very closely with discharge indicating that flow weighted average concentrations are similar throughout the range of flow regimes while loads of ic and oc each decouple from discharge in the upper half of flows fig 8 loads of oc are disproportionately high in the higher discharges indicating that large hydrologic events are able to access supplies of oc on the landscape that smaller flows do not surface applied manure contains much larger amounts of oc than the underlying soil copious rains and snowmelt have a larger capacity to drive manure oc to subsurface flow pathways and surface intakes elevating concentrations and likely explaining the march spike in concentrations loads of ic also decouple from discharge in the upper half of flows but in the opposite direction of oc i e high flows have lower concentrations with lower and mid range flows delivering a disproportionately high load and large discharges containing the lowest concentrations fig 8 as much of the upper soil profile has been leached of alkalinity stumm and morgan 1996 jones and schilling 2013 abundant rain and large hydrologic events do not access any special sources of ic unless lime has been recently applied to the farmed field water from recent heavy rains intruding into the tile system is relatively fresh and of a lower mineral content diluting more stable flows of deeper and older groundwater that contain higher carbonate concentrations loads of no3 n tracking closely with discharge indicate supplies of this contaminant are relatively homogenous throughout the soil profile with no dominant source area and the only factor limiting amounts in tiles is water throughput clearly supplies of no3 n are amended each year through fertilization however as has been shown by christianson et al 2012 these amendments are small relative to dml soil n stores water traveling from the soil surface to the tile depth encountered a nearly inexhaustible supply of no3 otherwise we would expect the load and discharge percentile curves shown in fig 8 to decouple in some way these conclusions about sources and pathways are illustrated in the conceptual model shown in fig 9 the origin of the arrow indicates source within the areas above and around the tiles and the arrow width indicates the approximate proportion to tile water loads from each area high flows with low concentrations and low to mid range flows with higher concentrations indicate sources of ic are mainly the areas closest to the tile itself i e deeper soil profiles and resident groundwater that has had sufficient time to dissolve carbonates large hydrologic events mobilizing oc loads and the march spike in concentration imply sources of oc are surface and near surface areas that have had recent amendments of manure and crop residue large stores of soil n and the close relationship between loads and discharge fig 8 indicate the entire soil profile between the soil surface and the tile can be a source of no3 n in a system that is highly transport limited for this pollutant 4 3 implications while loss of carbon through the lyons creek watershed tile system is small relative to soil stores nitrogen loss is substantial water quality and hydrologic data indicate that the sources and cycling of nitrogen and carbon are distinct and mostly disconnected in this engineered system stemming the loss of no3 n is an ongoing effort and continues to be a daunting challenge in the dml and the surrounding region helmers et al 2017 in the agroecosystems of the u s cornbelt farmers keep the soil profile saturated with no3 n by amending large stores of soil n with fertilizer prior to and during the early part of the growing season and these additions do not often correspond with any carbon inputs gardner and drinkwater 2009 this contrasts to natural systems where carbon and nitrogen cycle together through photosynthesis decomposition ammonification and denitrification recoupling the carbon and nitrogen cycles through more diversified crop rotations better input management and use of cover crop plants presents an opportunity to reduce tile and stream water no3 n and enhance downstream water quality farahbakhshazad et al 2008 gillette et al 2018 jarecki et al 2018 tile water monitoring data for ic oc and no3 n can inform these efforts by tracking loss patterns from this intensely managed system 4 4 study limitations while our discharge and water quality dataset is robust we have little detailed knowledge of the form timing and rate of nitrogen inputs in these catchments likewise we are not aware of lime applications which could conceivably affect water quality data by elevating ic concentrations future research on how the rate timing and form of nitrogen and manure inputs vary between the two drainage districts would help further explain the loss patterns reported here 5 conclusions total carbon yields from the two dml drainage districts averaged 124 kg ha 1 yr 1 with 116 kg of this as ic and 8 kg as oc this amount is small relative to soil organic matter stores 0 03 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 and carbon exported in grain harvest for most of the year concentrations of oc remain stable however concentrations of oc are much higher in the month of march likely reflective of recently applied animal manure to surface and near surface soils and accumulated crop residue these sources are quickly depleted and oc concentrations return to baseline levels soon after declines in ic concentrations are at certain times accompanied by increases in no3 n concentrations especially during extremely wet weather as was observed in spring 2013 this implies that abundant low alkalinity water infiltrating from the surface was able to disproportionately solubilize no3 n relative to ic concentrations of ic are lowest at high flows and higher at low to mid range flows indicating deeper and older resident groundwater that has had time to solubilize carbonates is the predominant source of ic in tile water annual no3 n yields were highly variable i e 10 kg ha 1 in the drought year of 2012 but nearing 100 kg ha 1 in 2015 loads of no3 n track very closely with discharge demonstrating that water throughput and not soil n supplies are controlling levels in the constructed drainage system this contrasts with both ic and oc where loads decouple from discharge in the upper half of the flow regime sources and pathways of ic oc and no3 n to the tiles are distinct with no dominant source area for no3 n while dominant sources of ic deep and oc surface are traveling to the tiles from opposite ends of the soil profile although ic and oc water quality data imply tile drainage is not a threat to soil organic matter stores a return to a system where carbon and nitrogen cycle together in the soil profile provides an opportunity to reduce stream impairment

11157,fertility and crop production in soils of the recently glaciated agricultural midwestern u s link to soil inorganic and organic carbon soil nitrogen and nitrogen inputs research relating transport of each to the others through the constructed drainage network to receiving streams is sparse the main objective of this work was to quantify and characterize concentrations and yields of inorganic and organic carbon ic and oc along with nitrate nitrogen no3 n using a four year dataset that included discharge from two managed drainage districts in the cornbelt state of iowa our analysis shows loss of carbon through these constructed drainage networks averages 124 kg ha 1 yr 1 with more than 90 of this total in carbonate form and only 7 in organic forms a small amount relative to soil organic stores transport of no3 n can total as much as 97 kg ha 1 yr 1 although loads of ic oc and no3 n all vary similarly with discharge no3 n is especially transport limited elevated oc concentrations in march are likely linked to recent manure application to soil surfaces with concentrations returning to a consistent baseline thereafter concentrations of ic are lowest at high flows indicating dilution by fresh water from recent hydrologic events into the drainage system which disproportionately mobilize no3 n compared to ic although yields of ic and oc to the drainage system indicate tile drainage does not threaten to deplete soil organic matter stores returning the system to a condition where carbon and nitrogen cycle together could improve stream water quality

availability soil aggregation aeration hydraulic conductivity and cation exchange capacity khan et al 2007 much of the oc in cornbelt soils has been lost through soil erosion fenton et al 2005 and other processes such as oxidation resulting from soil tillage ding et al 2002 the effects on productivity resulting from depletion of soil oc have been masked by increased use of chemical inputs such as nitrogen fertilizers this along with other improvements in farming practices have prevented decreases in crop yields in most areas fenton et al 2005 nitrogen fertilizer is very commonly applied by iowa farmers as anhydrous ammonia nh3 which is subsequently oxidized to nitrate no3 n during processes mediated by microbes acidifying the soil eq 4 and hastening the dissolution and leaching of calcium bicarbonate in the process barak et al 1997 because of soil acidification and depletion of ic many iowa farmers apply agricultural lime to cropped fields to improve soil structure and optimize crop production conditions jones and schilling 2013 4 nh3 2o2 h no3 h2o in addition to chemical perturbation resulting from agricultural activities the moisture condition of dml soils has been drastically altered through the installation of constructed drainage artificial subsurface drain tiles perforated pipes are installed 1 2 m below the soil surface in nearly all dml farmed fields to lower the water table in areas where natural drainage is insufficient for maximum crop yields singh et al 2006 streeter and schilling 2017 these drain tiles provide an easy pathway for ic oc and no3 n to enter the stream network of the dml loss of no3 n in tile drained landscapes has been well characterized over the past 40 years baker et al 1975 randall et al 1997 ikenberry et al 2014 three notable studies have evaluated transport of ic at the mississippi basin scale gaillardet et al 1999 raymond and cole 2003 raymond et al 2008 while jones and schilling 2013 characterized ic transport from one mississippi river tributary vidon et al 2008 2009 and wagner et al 2008 investigated storm event oc and no3 n transport from two small 11 km2 indiana watersheds royer and david 2005 quantified dissolved oc in agricultural drainage tile water in the cornbelt state of illinois concluding that loading was driven mainly by water yield and was small relative to soil organic matter pools the character and amount of stream dissolved oc was found to be influenced by agricultural land use by wilson and xenopoulos 2009 with nitrogen enrichment a probable mechanism for changes in the predominant types of carbon exported by streams further they reported that pore water oc under tilled land tends to contain lower molecular weight carbon compounds to our knowledge however no research exists relating long term ic oc and no3 n transport from an artificially drained catchment devoted almost entirely to crop production considering the importance of fertility and the relevance of ic oc and no3 n to continued robust corn and soybean production a more complete understanding of how soil carbon is being lost to the stream network through constructed drainage networks is needed our specific research objectives were to 1 quantify ic and oc export through constructed drainage networks and compare c export to soil organic matter stores 2 compare and contrast the timing and amounts of carbon and no3 n export and 3 develop a conceptual model for c and no3 n export from the tile drained watershed that accounts for different sources and transport pathways to achieve these objectives we evaluated the loss patterns of c and n from a 4 year data record of discharge alkalinity ic total organic carbon oc and no3 n from two organized and managed dml constructed drainage networks to gain insights into the magnitude of these losses and the sources of these water quality constituents 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this research was focused on tile drainage from two organized and managed drainage districts within the western cornbelt of the u s both discharge to lyons creek which drains a 42 km2 watershed situated on the dml landform of central iowa prior

carbon index of 38 and a corn suitability rating of 74 both well above the state average al kaisi et al 2012 area planted to these two crops covers approximately 84 of the lyons catchment area schilling et al 2012 lyons creek is a tributary to the boone and des moines rivers the latter a source of municipal supply for the downstream iowa cities of boone ottumwa des moines and its surrounding metropolitan area the two drainage districts hereafter designated 3 t and 5 t drain water from 600 and 1096 ha respectively constructed drainage within the districts consists of subsurface pipe networks 15 23 cm diameter spaced 24 30 m apart singh et al 2006 installed 1 2 m below the surface in cropped fields these field tiles feed into systematically larger main trunk lines before terminating in a 91 cm diameter pipe at both the 3 t and 5 t outlets vertical surface inlets connect to field tiles in some depressional spots that otherwise would accumulate standing water following rain and snowmelt individual farmers and landowners install and manage the field tile networks while the larger downstream infrastructure is managed at the county government level row crop land coverage is greater within the 3 t and 5 t drainage districts than in the lyons creek watershed as a whole with corn and soybean fields occupying 87 91 of the drainage district area schilling et al 2012 2 2 hydrology flow volumes from 3 t and 5 t were quantified from 1 feb 2012 to 31 dec 2015 with isco 2150 area velocity flow modules the sensors were secured with expansion rings on the inside of the pipes 2 m from the outlet the apparatus measured water depth with a pressure transducer and water velocity with ultrasonic sound waves measurements were taken and stored at intervals of 5 min and then aggregated to daily averages daily and monthly average precipitation and air temperature data were gathered from the webster city iowa location fig 1 located near the mouth of lyons creek iowa state university 2018 2 3 water quality sampling and analysis grab samples were collected at approximately biweekly intervals as part of the iowa soybean association ambient water monitoring program which is governed by a quality assurance project plan approved by the iowa department of natural resources dnr samplers are certified in proper sample collection techniques using iowater volunteer water monitoring program protocols iowa dnr 2014 a dipper apparatus was used to collect water flowing from the main trunk tile and the water was then transferred to a 500 ml polyethylene terephthalate bottle ic and no3 n the bottles were placed in ice and transported to the laboratory on the day of collection where a 125 ml portion of the sample was transferred to an amber glass bottle containing acid preservative oc alkalinity and ic were quantified in the state certified iowa soybean association laboratory using standard methods procedure 2320b apha 2005 alkalinity was quantified by titration with acid to ph 4 5 and reported as mg l 1 caco3 inorganic carbon ic was quantified from the alkalinity data assuming a factor of 2 correction for the charge difference between carbonate and bicarbonate bicarbonate concentrations were calculated using ph and total alkalinity on a subset of samples to ensure that this form of alkalinity was dominant 0 98 total organic carbon toc here referred to as oc was quantified using standard methods procedure 5310b high temperature combustion apha 2005 this analysis was conducted in the des moines water works testing laboratory also state certified nitrate n was quantified in the iowa soybean association laboratory using usepa method 300 0 ion chromatography edgell et al 1994 laboratory quality control procedures included blanks spiked samples replicates and known concentration samples although many studies focus on dissolved oc doc the low turbidity 1 nephelometric turbidity units of tile water samples implied most of the organic carbon was in the dissolved form we analyzed a subset of 12 samples for both doc and toc and found the values to be nearly equivalent for that reason and to avoid the inconvenience of filtering samples in the field for this analysis we chose to use toc as the metric for assessing movement of organic carbon from these tiled systems 2 4 data analysis discharge data was recorded every day of the study while water quality measurements were far less frequent collected approximately biweekly during the study period for this reason calculated monthly loads of ic oc and no3 n were the product of monthly average discharge and monthly average concentration of all available samples annual loads were calculated by summing the monthly loads yields of ic oc and no3 n were calculated by dividing these monthly and annual loads by catchment area for 3 t and 5 t no data were available for january 2012 and thus 2012 loads and average concentrations were calculated only with feb dec data january is typically a low load month in iowa because of frozen conditions and low discharges although concentrations of some parameters including alkalinity and no3 n can be somewhat high compared to entire calendar year relations between sites 3 t and 5 t and between ic oc and no3 n were quantified using the r project for statistical computing dessau and pipper 2008 3 results 3 1 weather annual

5th warmest 3 2 discharge discharge averaged 3120 and 6685 m3 day 1 in 3 t and 5 t respectively table 1 fig 2 equating to average water yields of 190 and 223 mm yr 1 the receiving boone river draining a total area of 218 600 ha had an average water yield of 200 mm yr 1 for the same period discharge was highest in both drainage districts in 2015 with 3 t averaging 5342 m3 day 1 and 5 t 10 086 m3 day 1 each drainage district also had its lowest discharge year in 2012 when drought was widespread across the region with flows averaging 517 m3 day 1 from 3 t and 1033 m3 day 1 from 5 t maximum flows measured were 67 800 3 t and 107 000 m3 day 1 5 t together the two drainage districts on average comprised 0 8 of the total boone river flow recorded flow was 0 01 m3 day 1 in 3 t on 94 of the 1430 study days 6 6 while 5 t flow was 0 01 m3 day 1 flow on 349 days 24 4 thus while 3 t had more reliable flow overall water yield was higher in 5 t fig 2 illustrates there were two periods of very low or no flow aug 2012 through mar 2013 and aug 2013 through mar 2014 flows 0 01 m3 day 1 were continuously recorded from both drainage districts from 9 mar 2014 through the end of the monitoring period 31 dec 2015 a period of 663 consecutive days 3 3 inorganic carbon ic average ic concentrations over the study period were 62 mg l 1 σ 15 3 t and 16 5 t in both 3 t and 5 t while maximum values were 84 3 t and 91 mg l 1 5 t table 1 figs 2 4 concentrations between 3 t and 5 t correlated significantly at p 0 01 monthly averages were highest from sep jan while lowest in mar jun period for both tiles fig 4 annual averages were lowest in 2013 and highest in 2015 with both tiles following this pattern fig 4 values in 2015 were more than 40 higher than those measured in 2013 annual average yields fig 5 of ic were 111 3 t and 121 kg ha 1 5 t yields were highest in 2015 with both drainage districts delivering around 240 kg ha 1 the drought year of 2012 produced yields of 20 kg ha 1 from both catchments may and jun produced the highest monthly yields while jan and feb produced the lowest 3 4 organic carbon oc concentrations of oc were much lower than ic and averaged 3 1 3 t and 3 8 mg l 1 5 t over the period of study σ 1 7 3 t and 2 1 5 t maximum oc concentrations were 14 3 and 15 mg l 1 in 3 t and 5 t respectively while ic concentrations were lowest in both 3 t and 5 t during 2013 oc concentrations averaged highest in that year for both tiles fig 4 concentrations of oc were lowest in the winter dec feb period but were decidedly higher in march than in any other month concentrations between 3 t and 5 t correlated significantly at p 0 01 yields of oc over the four year period averaged 6 2 and 9 2 kg ha 1 in 3 t and 5 t respectively only 6 6 that of ic when the two drainage districts are considered in aggregate fig 5 in contrast to concentration average yields were highest in may as loads tracked with discharge yields of oc were lowest in jan and feb 3 5 nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentrations of no3 n fig 4 averaged considerably higher in 5 t 25 6 mg l 1 than in 3 t 19 4 mg l 1 σ 13 0 3 t and 13 9 5 t maximum concentrations were 47 9 3 t and 77 4 5 t mg l 1 with both of these occurring in 2013 average concentrations were lowest in the drought year of 2012 7 0 and 13 3 mg l 1 in 3 t and 5 t respectively and highest in 2013 for 5 t 30 4 mg l 1 and 2015 for 3 t 27 4 mg l 1 interestingly 3 t concentrations increased each year of the study concentrations between 3 t and 5 t correlated significantly at p 0 01 annual yields fig 5 of no3 n averaged 52 3 3 t and 61 3 kg ha 1 5 t over the four year study period like ic and oc yields were lowest in the drought year of 2012 7 kg ha 1 for both drainage districts and highest in the wet year of 2015 88 6 and 97 4 kg ha 1 for 3 t and 5 t respectively average monthly yields were highest in the may jun period with 49 8 of the total annual no3 n delivery occurring in these two months when the drainage districts are considered in aggregate smallest average monthly yields occurred in january and february when less than 1 kg ha 1 was lost from the two catchments combined 3 6 relations between ic oc no3 n and discharge while correlations are not statistically significant oc and ic relate inversely in both drainage tiles fig 6 levels of oc greater than 8 mg l 1 double the average are associated with ic concentrations of 40 mg l 1 or less 2 3 of the average likewise the highest concentrations of ic are associated with oc levels well below average while no3 n concentrations do not link with either oc or ic overall like the oc ic relationship the highest oc concentrations coincide with very low no3 n levels indicating the sources of the oc ic and no3 n are distinct daily concentration histograms are shown in fig 7 mainly because of many low concentration samples the range of no3 n results 2 orders of magnitude is much wider than that for ic and oc 1 order of magnitude for each concentrations are not normally distributed for any of the parameters in either of the tiles for ic 68 of the samples had concentrations between 60 and 80 mg l 1 and for oc 84 were between 1 5 and 4 5 mg l 1 concentrations of no3 n were less easily generalized with 70 between 16 and 40 mg l 1 but also 24 less than 8 mg l 1 percentile load and discharge curves are shown in fig 8 while loads track well with discharge for all three parameters in both tiles this relationship is especially close for no3 n loads of ic and oc both deviate from discharge in the largest 50 of discharges with these higher flows containing a disproportionately small amount of ic and large amount of oc again implying the sources of ic oc and no3 n differ 4 discussion 4 1 concentration and loading patterns of carbon and nitrate when the two drained catchments are considered in aggregate ic loss to the stream network averaged 116 kg ha 1 yr 1 very similar to the 124 kg ha 1 yr 1 jones and schilling 2013 reported for the neighboring raccoon river watershed for the period 2000 2011 raymond and cole 2003 using annual average discharge and alkalinity data calculated upper mississippi river ic yields of 193 kg ha 1 yr 1 using annual average discharge and alkalinity data although the raccoon watershed and the 3 t and 5 t catchments evaluated comprise tiny portions of the upper mississippi watershed it is interesting that 3 t and 5 t ic yields are substantially smaller than those from the larger basin yields calculated by raymond and cole 2003 this likely is an indication of greater water yield in the larger basin for the period of study here 2012 2015 upper mississippi river basin water yield was 288 mm jones et al 2018a compared to 190 and 223 mm for 3 t and 5 t respectively however the ratio of water yield in the lyons creek catchments versus the upper mississippi is 0 72 while the ic yield ratio is 0 60 indicating that the ic concentrations in lyons catchments are about 17 less than the upper mississippi this indicates relatively lower alkalinity water is discharging from 3 t and 5 t compared to that entering the rest of the upper mississippi the monthly concentration patterns of ic indicate consistent levels in the jul through feb period average 69 mg l 1 for 3 t and 5 t with lower values from mar jun 53 mg l 1 typically this is a wet period in iowa when there is little crop water uptake declines in ic concentration from mar jun illustrate the effects of lower ic water quickly infiltrating downward through a soil profile that has been depleted of carbonates during drier months tiles are affected more by deeper groundwater or water that has had a greater amount of time to dissolve carbonates both concentrations and loads of ic were substantially higher in the wettest year of the study 2015 interestingly total discharge in the two tiles was 41 greater in 2015 than in 2014 even though precipitation was only 6 greater since 2014 was also quite wet this indicates abundant soil moisture going into 2015 the second half of 2013 was very dry and even though precipitation was 22 greater in 2014 than 2013 total discharge in the two tiles increased less than 3 from 2013 to 2014 the large 2015 load illustrates how flux of ic in these tile drained systems is largely transport limited jones and schilling 2013 mirroring the mississippi river basin as a whole raymond et al 2008 estimated that over half of the increased mississippi river basin flux observed from 1954 to 2001 was driven by increased discharge the data presented in this study illustrate how year to year variations of discharge are also the primary drivers of variable ic flux in these managed catchments of the mississippi basin yields of oc from the two tiles combined average 7 7 kg ha 1 ranging from 1 to 12 4 kg ha 1 while concentrations averaged 3 4 mg l 1 over the four years in the nearby state of illinois royer and david 2005 reported nearly identical concentrations 3 1 to 3 9 mg l 1 with slightly higher yields ranging from 3 to 23 kg ha 1 yr 1 over a ten year period from agricultural drainage tiles in headwater areas similar to the lyons creek catchments the maximum concentration reported in that study 16 mg l 1 was also similar to the maximum value observed in 3 t and 5 t 15 mg l 1 elsewhere dissolved oc concentrations from farms in germany have been reported at levels about double to lyons creek with overall averages of 7 6 mg l 1 measured by graeber et al 2012 average concentrations ranged from 1 3 to 35 3 mg l 1 and yields from 0 1 to 8 75 kg ha 1 yr 1 among seven catchments in 3 t and 5 t oc concentrations were far higher in march than any other month this typically is the month when winter snows completely melt and soil temperatures regularly begin to exceed freezing in iowa coupled with the fact that late fall and early spring are the most favorable times for manure application to farmed fields in the western cornbelt region randall and schmitt 1998 dinnes et al 2002 lawlor et al 2011 the march flush of oc through the drainage system is likely due to both snowmelt manure application and crop residue from the previous harvest this observation is consistent with vidon et al 2008 2009 who found that tile drainage provided a quick transfer mechanism for near surface oc to the stream network and many other studies showing the importance of soil macropores to oc transport kladivko et al 1991 kung et al 2000 stone and wilson 2006 hruby et al 2016 furthermore vidon et al 2008 2009 determined that oc originating from mineral soils provides stream baseflow oc they reported that as a runoff event begins oc richer in aromatic substances at or near the soil surface is mobilized royer and david 2005 also observed march spikes in oc concentrations in illinois tiles additional evidence of the march oc levels being linked to surface applied manure and crop residue is the ratio of ic oc for the entire period of record this ratio is 20 8 for all months but only 3 8 during march thus we believe the march oc concentration peak for 3 t and 5 t is a result of these surface applied materials adding to the baseflow oc solubilized from deeper within the soil profile the concentration of which likely varies little throughout the rest of the year this surface material is quickly exhausted with the result being a return to baseline oc concentration levels yields of oc from 3 t and 5 t combined averaged 10 15 kg ha 1 yr 1 which is only about 1 10th of the ic yield however oc concentrations and loads should not be used as an indicator of how much soil organic matter is being lost to the tile network the processes shown in eqs 1 3 illustrate how soil organic matter can exit the tile drainage system after being converted to ic with one of the bicarbonate carbon atoms in eq 3 originating from carbonate rock and one from oxidized soil organic matter jones and schilling 2013 in the combined 3 t and 5 t drainage catchments total loss of carbon through the drainage system averaged 124 kg ha 1 yr 1 116 as ic and 8 as oc with a maximum of ½ of the ic linked back to soil organic matter 66 kg ha 1 yr 1 of soil organic carbon is being lost to the stream network at most and the origin of some portion of this amount is almost certainly linked to recently applied manure and other surface materials such as crop residue this compares favorably with the amount reported by jones and schilling 2013 for the far larger 9389 km2 raccoon river watershed which lies 50 km to the west of the lyons watershed and also drains the dml landform they calculated 61 kg ha 1 yr 1 as the maximum possible soil carbon loss to the stream network using alkalinity and oc data for the period 2000 2011 this amount was found to be small relative to measured soil oc stores 0 03 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 and oc exported in the grain harvest royer and david 2005 also found carbon flux from illinois tiles to be small relative to soil pools although they focused solely on oc and not ic since the ic yields from 3 t and 5 t are similar to those for the much larger raccoon river watershed we believe that the soil processes and transport mechanisms in the smaller drainage catchments are similar to those in the larger watershed overall thus carbon transported through the tile network in the organic form is delivered mainly during baseflows with the march flush of surface material adding to this amount annual yields of no3 n over the 4 yr study period averaged 57 kg ha 1 3 t and 5 t combined and when the 2012 drought year is excluded 74 kg ha 1 although our primary research objective was not to characterize no3 n yields these values are similar to somewhat higher for other dml studies ikenberry et al 2014 reported annual no3 n yields from these two and one additional lyons catchment to be 29 to 52 kg ha 1 2009 2013 jones et al 2017 reported an annual average yield for the north raccoon river watershed 50 km to the west of lyons creek of 35 kg ha 1 2008 2015 while david et al 2010 estimated north raccoon watershed jan jun yield of 15 25 kg ha 1 1997 to 2006 similar to 3 t and 5 t des moines lobe yields as high as 60 kg ha 1 were reported by tomer et al 2003 average concentrations of 3 t and 5 t no3 n were approximately double the u s standard for municipal drinking water 10 mg l 1 sayre 1988 and that of the receiving boone river reported by jones et al 2018b when examining the time series of ic and no3 n concentrations fig 2 it is interesting that there are periods when drops in ic are accompanied by increases in no3 n notably spring of 2012 and 2013 at both of these times spring rains followed a period of dryness especially spring of 2013 where the supply of loss vulnerable no3 n on the landscape could be expected to be high as a result of drought lucey and goolsby 1993 copious rains in spring 2013 hillaker 2013 encountered abundant soil no3 n left behind by poor crop uptake during summer 2012 jones et al 2016 the data shown in fig 2 imply that this abundant moisture infiltrating from the surface was able to disproportionately solubilize no3 n relative to ic richard and steenhuis 1988 demonstrated that preferential flows in tiled systems could rapidly increase the concentration of chloride from near surface areas in tile drains and that the chloride travel time was two orders of magnitude more rapid than that predicted by flow models similarly baker et al 2004 stated that as the carrier volume for no3 n increases the time for attenuation of surface applied nitrogen i e denitrification decreases effectively increasing no3 n in tile drains at the same time upper soil profiles and well drained areas have often been leached of carbonate rock a source of ic in soil water stumm and morgan 1996 jones and schilling 2013 and it is known that inherited carbonates have been depleted in the upper soil horizons of many iowa soils ruhe 1969 hallberg 1978 kemmis et al 1981 it must be pointed out that some farmers do apply agricultural lime to farmed fields where carbonates have been depleted however jones and schilling 2013 estimated that if all these lime inputs were lost as bicarbonate they would still only represent 31 of ic in the nearby raccoon river thus we believe the drops in ic concentration that coincide with increases in no3 n concentrations reflect low alkalinity surface water from recent precipitation events dissolving near surface no3 n and then quickly making its way to drainage tiles 4 2 sources and pathways the concentration data shown in figs 2 4 show that the no3 n concentrations vary over a larger range of values than either ic or oc loads of no3 n align very closely with discharge indicating that flow weighted average concentrations are similar throughout the range of flow regimes while loads of ic and oc each decouple from discharge in the upper half of flows fig 8 loads of oc are disproportionately high in the higher discharges indicating that large hydrologic events are able to access supplies of oc on the landscape that smaller flows do not surface applied manure contains much larger amounts of oc than the underlying soil copious rains and snowmelt have a larger capacity to drive manure oc to subsurface flow pathways and surface intakes elevating concentrations and likely explaining the march spike in concentrations loads of ic also decouple from discharge in the upper half of flows but in the opposite direction of oc i e high flows have lower concentrations with lower and mid range flows delivering a disproportionately high load and large discharges containing the lowest concentrations fig 8 as much of the upper soil profile has been leached of alkalinity stumm and morgan 1996 jones and schilling 2013 abundant rain and large hydrologic events do not access any special sources of ic unless lime has been recently applied to the farmed field water from recent heavy rains intruding into the tile system is relatively fresh and of a lower mineral content diluting more stable flows of deeper and older groundwater that contain higher carbonate concentrations loads of no3 n tracking closely with discharge indicate supplies of this contaminant are relatively homogenous throughout the soil profile with no dominant source area and the only factor limiting amounts in tiles is water throughput clearly supplies of no3 n are amended each year through fertilization however as has been shown by christianson et al 2012 these amendments are small relative to dml soil n stores water traveling from the soil surface to the tile depth encountered a nearly inexhaustible supply of no3 otherwise we would expect the load and discharge percentile curves shown in fig 8 to decouple in some way these conclusions about sources and pathways are illustrated in the conceptual model shown in fig 9 the origin of the arrow indicates source within the areas above and around the tiles and the arrow width indicates the approximate proportion to tile water loads from each area high flows with low concentrations and low to mid range flows with higher concentrations indicate sources of ic are mainly the areas closest to the tile itself i e deeper soil profiles and resident groundwater that has had sufficient time to dissolve carbonates large hydrologic events mobilizing oc loads and the march spike in concentration imply sources of oc are surface and near surface areas that have had recent amendments of manure and crop residue large stores of soil n and the close relationship between loads and discharge fig 8 indicate the entire soil profile between the soil surface and the tile can be a source of no3 n in a system that is highly transport limited for this pollutant 4 3 implications while loss of carbon through the lyons creek watershed tile system is small relative to soil stores nitrogen loss is substantial water quality and hydrologic data indicate that the sources and cycling of nitrogen and carbon are distinct and mostly disconnected in this engineered system stemming the loss of no3 n is an ongoing effort and continues to be a daunting challenge in the dml and the surrounding region helmers et al 2017 in the agroecosystems of the u s cornbelt farmers keep the soil profile saturated with no3 n by amending large stores of soil n with fertilizer prior to and during the early part of the growing season and these additions do not often correspond with any carbon inputs gardner and drinkwater 2009 this contrasts to natural systems where carbon and nitrogen cycle together through photosynthesis decomposition ammonification and denitrification recoupling the carbon and nitrogen cycles through more diversified crop rotations better input management and use of cover crop plants presents an opportunity to reduce tile and stream water no3 n and enhance downstream water quality farahbakhshazad et al 2008 gillette et al 2018 jarecki et al 2018 tile water monitoring data for ic oc and no3 n can inform these efforts by tracking loss patterns from this intensely managed system 4 4 study limitations while our discharge and water quality dataset is robust we have little detailed knowledge of the form timing and rate of nitrogen inputs in these catchments likewise we are not aware of lime applications which could conceivably affect water quality data by elevating ic concentrations future research on how the rate timing and form of nitrogen and manure inputs vary between the two drainage districts would help further explain the loss patterns reported here 5 conclusions total carbon yields from the two dml drainage districts averaged 124 kg ha 1 yr 1 with 116 kg of this as ic and 8 kg as oc this amount is small relative to soil organic matter stores 0 03 hernandez ramirez et al 2011 and carbon exported in grain harvest for most of the year concentrations of oc remain stable however concentrations of oc are much higher in the month of march likely reflective of recently applied animal manure to surface and near surface soils and accumulated crop residue these sources are quickly depleted and oc concentrations return to baseline levels soon after declines in ic concentrations are at certain times accompanied by increases in no3 n concentrations especially during extremely wet weather as was observed in spring 2013 this implies that abundant low alkalinity water infiltrating from the surface was able to disproportionately solubilize no3 n relative to ic concentrations of ic are lowest at high flows and higher at low to mid range flows indicating deeper and older resident groundwater that has had time to solubilize carbonates is the predominant source of ic in tile water annual no3 n yields were highly variable i e 10 kg ha 1 in the drought year of 2012 but nearing 100 kg ha 1 in 2015 loads of no3 n track very closely with discharge demonstrating that water throughput and not soil n supplies are controlling levels in the constructed drainage system this contrasts with both ic and oc where loads decouple from discharge in the upper half of the flow regime sources and pathways of ic oc and no3 n to the tiles are distinct with no dominant source area for no3 n while dominant sources of ic deep and oc surface are traveling to the tiles from opposite ends of the soil profile although ic and oc water quality data imply tile drainage is not a threat to soil organic matter stores a return to a system where carbon and nitrogen cycle together in the soil profile provides an opportunity to reduce stream impairment

11158,the landscape of water in utah is changing due to population growth conversion of agricultural land to urban development and increasing awareness of water scarcity at the same time utah is experiencing a growing number of urban and small farms but knowledge of water use in this sector is limited better understanding of what occurs at the field level on urban and small farms can aid state water use estimates and conservation efforts and assist farmers in moving towards wiser water management for the 2015 growing season we performed irrigation evaluations for 24 urban and small farms in cache valley utah and we explore the results through case studies and identify trends among gross irrigation depth and field variables including field size irrigation method application uniformity and scheduling practices results show a great degree of heterogeneity in irrigation methods equipment used and management practices the beneficial consumed fraction of irrigation water ranged from 0 06 to 1 0 small fields had lower application uniformities and greater irrigation depths than large fields surface irrigated fields had higher irrigation depths than sprinkle and drip irrigated fields additionally fields using a fixed irrigation schedule had higher depths than fields that were irrigated inconsistently due to other factors the results show that urban and small farm irrigators need improved knowledge of proper irrigation management irrigators university extension services and state water authorities working in this sector need to recognize the link between proper management and total water use and focus more efforts on improving management specifically how to use 1 low cost methods to measure flow rates 2 simple irrigation scheduling tools and 3 improve application uniformity keywords beneficial consumed fraction water management urban agriculture irrigation scheduling application uniformity water conservation 1 introduction the socioeconomic landscape of water in utah is undergoing a transformation and there is much debate about how water should be managed to meet the present and future needs of the state according to the u s census bureau the 2010 utah population is expected to more than double by 2060 giving the state the fourth highest growth rate in the country united states census bureau 2016 the growth is happening largely by sprawl of new residential and commercial land onto agricultural land at the edge of urban boundaries this sprawl creates a mosaic of mixed agricultural residential and commercial land use li 2013 mcginty 2009 that is the second highest rate of urban sprawl by percentage in the u s kolankiewics et al 2014 in utah between the years 1982 and 2012 over 26 100 ha 64 500 acres of farmland converted to urban use an increase in developed land of 16 the utah division of water resources dwre estimates that by 2050 an additional 10 of farm land will be urbanized utah division of water resources 2013 as agricultural land is developed the spatial and temporal water use on the landscape changes and can affect other water users in the basin by changing the quantities and timing of water demands environmental flows in rivers and wetlands and the quantity and destination of agricultural return flows in 2015 utah ranked the second highest state in municipal and industrial m i per capita water use usgs 2014 being the second driest state in the nation this exceptionally high use is due to the large volumes of water used for outdoor irrigation coupled with a culture that encourages verdant landscapes and gardens additionally many urban areas in utah have unmetered secondary water systems where users typically pay a flat fee for outdoor landscape water use the term secondary water system is used in utah to describe any non potable water delivery system i e not treated to drinking water standards non potable systems typically consist of either a canal network or a piped pressurized supply intended for irrigation while these secondary systems are usually metered at the original diversion the actual water delivered to each end user is unmetered and typically unknown yet numerous studies have shown that providing unmetered water results in 39 100 increases in use cole 2015 richards 2009 to address water use in the urban environment utah has invested in numerous conservation efforts including utah state university s center for water efficient landscaping cwel water conservation programs sponsored by water conservation districts and municipalities and the state s slow the flow campaign among others however these programs focus on landscape irrigation rather than urban agricultural irrigation simultaneous with urban growth utah is experiencing a quickly growing sector of urban and small farm agriculture urban agriculture is defined as the growing processing and distribution of food and other products through intensive plant cultivation and animal husbandry in and around cities brown and carter 2003 nationwide the number of farms and total acreage is decreasing as agricultural land is converted to urban development similarly in utah agricultural acreage is likewise decreasing but the number of farms is increasing for example in weber davis and salt lake counties that are mostly urbanized the number of farms between 0 4 and 4 ha 1 and 9 acres has increased 245 from 1974 to 2007 in cache county the number of farms in this category increased 24 between 2007 to 2012 downen 2009 usda 2016 a recent survey of 253 urban farms around the country found that the median income of the farms in their study was 5000 this income amount suggests that recent growth is not motivated by economics but rather factors such as interest in locally produced foods nutrition and health food security education environmental benefits and community building dimitri et al 2015 curtis 2013 salt lake city for example set a goal of increasing direct access to fresh foods community groups and public officials are actively working to identify vacant lots that can be used to grow food in the city utah division of water resources 2003 most of the academic literature pertaining to urban and small farms is focused on developing countries where farmers face very different situations than in developed countries most u s irrigation research focuses on large field sizes and irrigated areas usda 2013 of the limited documentation that does exist for small farms two particular trends stand out first there is little knowledge exchange between academia and small farmers second farmers adopt more efficient practices only if they see benefits or economics gains to do so levidow et al 2014 new research into urban and small farms must identify the issues and challenges these irrigators face at all scales of consideration from the field to basin level additionally research must apply the right metrics to determine beneficial and reasonable use of water based on the scale of interest for use of the wrong term can lead to misinterpretation of its value and meaning perry 2007 2011 at the field level irrigators have a high incentive to apply the minimum amount of water necessary to obtain a good yield to reduce pumping costs labor leaching of nutrients and water logging from over irrigation at the district level excess applied water may not be available to other irrigators depending on the pathway of the return flows at the basin level over irrigating at the field level does not necessarily result in wasted water as in multiple use cycle basins this water may be available to other users lower in the basin keller and keller 1995 in this study we investigate what is occurring at the field level on urban and small farms the volume of applied irrigation water was measured on 24 urban and small farm fields in cache valley utah for the entirety of an irrigation season and full field irrigation evaluations were conducted the fields selected were typical and representative of urban and small farm fields in the arid intermountain west the results are explored through case studies and trends in gross irrigation depth gid the total depth of applied irrigation water and field size irrigation method uniformity and irrigation scheduling are identified insights from the study can help the participants and other urban and small farm irrigators across the u s recognize trends between total water use and irrigation parameters improve irrigation practices and grow healthier crops with fewer resources results also help university extension hereafter referred to as extension and state water authorities gain insights about actual irrigation practices see shifts in agricultural and urban water uses and develop more effective technical programs and approaches to water conservation in the growing urban and small farm sector all of the above can help managers reach state water goals 2 materials and methods 2 1 collect field data 2 1 1 find participants numerous irrigation districts local farms and regional water planners were contacted and asked to recommend small farm and urban irrigators to participate in the study participation criteria were that participants need to produce an agricultural product on more than 93 square meters 1000 square feet to rule out plots that were not producing a marketable good or a significant share of the irrigator s diet and less than 8 1 ha 20 acres in area a size which is increasingly less common on the urban fringe through a snowball sampling approach we identified 20 participants irrigating a total of 24 fields across cache valley fig 1 the fields consisted of small commercial farms community gardens large backyard gardens orchards pastures alfalfa fields and university research farms the crops included mixed vegetables grass pasture grass and alfalfa hay apples wheat corn quinoa tomatoes peppers winter squash and watermelon a wide range of methods were used for irrigation including surface drip and numerous methods of sprinkle to maintain the anonymity of the fields we refer to each field with a letter a through x a complete table of field metadata is provided in table 1 on page 28 in pratt 2016 2 1 2 install measurement devices from a site visit we determined the most practical method to measure flow rates throughout the season methods used included flumes weirs flowmeters and a one time volumetric measurement for fields with challenging layouts that would necessitate multiple meters for those fields with open channel flow measurements the irrigation schedule and staff gauge readings were recorded manually by the irrigator for the fields with a one time volumetric measurement the schedule was recorded with pressure event dataloggers for one site where the event datalogger was impractical the schedule was recorded manually the methods used are shown in table 1 2 1 3 conduct field measurements the collected field data included field size planting and harvest dates observations of overspray and runoff maintenance and application uniformity field size was determined using aerial imagery in gis software for sprinkle and drip irrigated fields an evaluation team conducted catch can tests to calculate the coefficient of uniformity cu for the drip irrigated field we calculated the emission uniformity eu using specifications from the drip tape datasheet and equations from keller and bliesner 1990 as shown in pratt 2016 appendix d 2 2 calculate irrigation performance this section provides a general overview of the methods and equations used to calculate the irrigation variables in this study for a more thorough explanation of these methods refer to pratt 2016 pp 14 24 2 2 1 gross irrigation depth we calculated the average depth of water applied to the field over the season by dividing the total applied volume by the field size giving a season gross irrigation depth gid the accuracies used are explained in detail in appendix c in pratt 2016 2 2 2 time series water balance a time series soil water balance was calculated using irrigation i and precipitation p events crop et etcrop calculated from crop coefficients and adjustment factors change in soil moisture storage δsm and return flows rf using a control volume of field area by mature rooting depth of the crop as shown in eq 1 a spreadsheet with the time series calculation is available in an open source repository pratt 2018 the daily time step of the water balance allows for the temporal variability to be observed 1 r f i p e t c r o p δ s m precipitation p and reference evapotranspiration etref data for each field were collected from the utah climate center s agricultural weather network station with the closest proximity to the field we assumed that the effective precipitation peff was 80 of the total precipitation for reasons including 1 it was impractical to measure soil moisture with sensors due to the number of fields in our study and the spatial variability within fields 2 most effective precipitation calculations require assumptions and the 80 assumption is also used by the utah dwre utah division of water resources 2010 3 because of weather and soils very little surface runoff from precipitation is observed on irrigated fields in utah and 4 precipitation is such a small fraction of et that further detail would likely not change results the utah climate center etref estimate uses the asce standardized reference penman monteith et equation to calculate the crop et etcrop we used procedures from food and agriculture organization irrigation and drainage paper 56 fao 56 and when available locally derived crop coefficients hill et al 2011 for the δsm variable we calculated the total available water taw of the soil from the available water capacity awc collected from the usda s web soil survey database and a calculation of crop rooting depth then using table 22 from fao 56 the management allowed depletion mad was calculated allen et al 1998 the precipitation in cache valley in april and may of 2015 was 63 5 and 135 mm 2 50 and 5 30 in respectively which was higher than the average april and may precipitation of 52 1 and 53 3 mm 2 05 and 2 10 in utah climate center 2016 therefore we assumed the root zone depletion dr at the beginning the time series was 0 and 25 of the taw for annuals and perennials respectively because annuals are typically planted into a barren field where no et for the year would have yet occurred and perennials would likely have been evapotranspirating and depleting the soil moisture in spring before the beginning of the time series calculation note an accurate estimate of initial depletion should take into context the precipitation of a particular year and when practical rely on actual soil moisture measurements values and methods from clemmens and burt 1997 were used to calculate the accuracy in our time series calculation the equations used and calculated accuracies are included in appendix c in pratt 2016 2 2 3 water use metrics the water use metric typically most relevant to irrigators considers the amount of water needed to grow the crop i e the beneficial and reasonable use and the amount of water applied to the crop irrigation water applied in excess of what is required often means that resources e g time labor and money have been used unnecessarily and in some cases yield has been compromised from loss of fertility via leaching and waterlogging in cache valley utah where leaching requirements are minimal due to low water salinity the bulk of the water beneficially applied is for evapotranspiration in this study we use the beneficial consumed fraction metric which is ratio of irrigation water consumed by the crop to the total irrigation water applied this metric avoids the use of the value laden term efficiency and is adopted by the international committee on irrigation and drainage icid perry 2011 the beneficial consumed fraction equation is shown in eq 2 2 b e n e f i c i a l c o n s u m e d f r a c t i o n e t c r o p i r r i g a t i o n v o l i r r i g w a t e r a p p l i e d 2 2 4 application uniformity a properly designed sprinkle system will attempt to achieve a balance between high application uniformity and low cost typically the higher the uniformity the more expensive the system using catch can data we wrote a script in matlab to calculate field cu and generate a 3d plot of field application uniformity that takes into account sprinkler and lateral spacing and field edges the script is included in appendix d of pratt 2016 with the cu values the water distribution efficiency depa was used to determine the percentage of the field over and under irrigated using data from keller and bliesner 1995 2 2 5 scheduling method after collecting the seasonal data we gave each field two qualitative ratings regarding the irrigation scheduling method to compare trends between the gid and different scheduling methods the first rating is of schedule interval which includes the ratings fixed irrigations occurred at a fixed interval all season partially fixed irrigations occurred at a fixed interval for most of the season variable numerous irrigations occurred but at no identifiable interval and other only a couple of irrigations occurred at no identifiable interval the second rating is the frequency of return flow occurrence and includes the ratings rf every irr return flows occurred on every irrigation rf early season return flows occurred at the beginning of the season only rf late season return flows occurred late in the season only and zero rf no return flow events occurred during the season 2 2 6 data analysis with the irrigation metrics calculated the trends between gid and field variables were explored using a variety of graphical methods 3 results 3 1 gross irrigation depth and gross return flows the gid and gross return flows grf the seasonal total depth of return flow for each field show the majority of fields applied less than 640 mm 25 in fig 2 three distinct outlier fields k n and v had gid and grf significantly higher than the other fields the majority of fields had some return flows while seven fields had no return flows at all 3 2 case studies in this section we present four cases to illustrate examples of good and poor irrigation practices and provide recommendations to improve these fields irrigation configuration and management 3 2 1 case study 1 sprinkle irrigated pasture with good performance field w field w is a 0 38 hectare 0 93 acre pasture of mixed grasses the field is located in north logan surrounded by other urban hay fields intermixed with new residential developments the pasture is grazed by horses and cut and bailed three times a season the water supply is a pressurized piped secondary system the irrigator can irrigate whenever he chooses the field is irrigated from two risers with 76 mm 3 0 inch o d aluminum hand move pipe and has a challenging geometry because of the long and narrow shape and resulting high perimeter to area ratio a time series plot of soil water balance for the season shows very few return flows fig 3 precipitation continually recharged the soil in may and irrigation did not begin until mid june the field received seven irrigations during the season six of which applied around 50 mm 2 in of water and one that applied nearly 100 mm 4 in of water the calculated irrigation return flows only happened on two occasions in early july and late august and the depth of these flows was minimal because no surface runoff or standing water was ever observed on this field the return flows went to deep percolation additionally the aw red line was kept well above the mad dashed grey line in fig 3 the cumulative irrigation depth was calculated to be 399 mm 15 7 in total return flows from irrigation of 43 mm 1 7 in and the change in soil moisture from irrigation was a positive 69 mm 2 7 in the irrigation management was very good resulting in a beneficial consumed fraction of 0 8 the 3d plot of the application uniformity at 3 0 meter 10 foot intervals across the field shows that the field receives the most water in a strip down the middle and that the south and east edges receive significantly less water than the rest of the field due to the lack of overlap that occurs at the field edge fig 4 the cu and du are 71 8 and 0 49 respectively fairly good values for a field with a small area to perimeter ratio yet still lower than recommended values distribution efficiency depa analysis shows that 72 of the field receives more water than the 318 mm 12 5 in water requirement for net et while 28 of the field is under irrigated fig 5 in summary this irrigator applied adequate but not excessive irrigation depths to avoid crop water stress minimize return flows and obtain a high beneficial consumed fraction the soil moisture depletion was timed perfectly with the rain events so that all of the precipitation was utilized however this irrigator could have saved labor by adjusting the schedule irrigating less frequently but for longer duration thereby reducing the work to move sprinkler laterals the field cu was low but decent considering the challenging field geometry this was one of the best managed fields in the study 3 2 2 case study 2 drip irrigated vegetable field with good performance field l is a 1 02 hectare 2 51 acre vegetable field using plastic mulch and 16 mm 5 8 in low flow drip tape on uniform topography detailed information on the drip tape is provided in case study 2 in pratt 2016 the crops included tomatoes sweet peppers winter squash and watermelons a pump feeds the drip tape through a sand media filter pressure regulator and lay flat hose manifold and was run at the irrigator s discretion the volume of water used for backflushing the filter was nominal compared with the total applied water and therefore the backflush water was not subtracted from the applied water volume in the analysis the drip tape laterals were 290 m 950 foot and 171 m 560 foot for different field sections we recorded the flow rates and irrigation schedule with an electromagnetic datalogging flow meter which was installed for the duration of the irrigation season in the time series water balance we used an area weighted average of the four crops for the depletion fraction rooting depth and crop coefficient once the rooting depth was fully established in mid july the soil moisture closely followed the average mad fig 6 note how the soil moisture does not oscillate much at all indicating that the sum of irrigation and precipitation almost perfectly matched the crop et making the total water received by the crop nearly optimal although frequent irrigations are common with drip systems due to the smaller volume of soil receiving irrigation the irrigations could have been at a lesser frequency but longer duration to reduce the time and labor required to turn the pump on and off no return flow events occurred during the season which led to a very high beneficial consumed fraction the total applied irrigation depth was only 200 mm 7 7 in and the precipitation was 53 mm 2 1 in the beneficial consumed fraction was 1 0 drip system emission uniformity eu for the 171 m and 290 m drip tape runs was calculated to be 81 and 72 respectively the 81 eu for the 171 m drip tape is above the minimum recommended value of 80 for line source tubing on uniform topography the eu of the 290 m length however was significantly lower than ideal merriam and keller 1978 to improve the eu of the 290 m runs the irrigator could either 1 increase the size of the drip tubing from 16 mm to 22 mm 7 8 in 2 decrease the drip tube flow rate or 3 run more lay flat hose manifold to reduce the length of the 290 m run to 171 m or less increasing the tubing size is most likely the preferable option because the pump would operate at the same flow rate according to the calculations both options 1 and 2 would increase the eu to 80 3 2 3 case study 3 sprinkle irrigated garden with low beneficial consumed fraction field d is a 0 016 hectare 0 039 acre large backyard garden and orchard surrounded by quickly growing urban development the garden is irrigated with a fixed sprinkler system from an irrigation pump that draws water from an adjacent ditch seven sprinkler nozzles of mixed types are set at varying heights around the perimeter of the garden the crops included densely planted mixed vegetables and half a dozen apple and pear trees we used a 19 mm 3 4 in totalizer electromagnetic flow meter to measure the irrigation volume and took meter readings approximately every three weeks dividing the difference between each meter reading by the number of irrigation events in that time period gave the depth applied at each irrigation the time series plot fig 7 shows that irrigation frequency was close to ideal before mid july however the water depth of each irrigation application was high and 75 or more of irrigations went to deep percolation return flows two irrigations went almost entirely to return flow the cumulative irrigation depth was calculated to be 1380 mm 54 4 in with irrigation return flows of 1040 mm 41 0 in these excessive applications led to a beneficial consumed fraction of only 0 25 using a catch can evaluation we determined the irrigation cu and du of 66 and 0 41 respectively the nozzles were in very poor shape with two completely clogged the spray of one immediately blocked by vegetation and two rotating far outside of the garden and lawn area the low uniformity may have been a part of the reason that this garden received so much water because in order to adequately irrigate the dry spots the majority of the garden had to be excessively over watered to improve irrigation in this garden the irrigator should improve the application uniformity by fixing clogged and improperly rotating nozzles as well as improve the irrigation scheduling by irrigating at the same frequency but a much shorter duration especially early in the season when the root zone is shallow 3 2 4 case study 4 surface irrigated garden with low beneficial consumed fraction field v is a 0 076 hectare 0 19 acre large backyard garden growing a wide variety of crops including mixed vegetables grains berries cover crops and fruit trees the garden is surface irrigated via an open ditch secondary system the main distribution channel in the garden is lined with plastic to reduce seepage losses the irrigation flow rates were measured with an s m flume designed by samani and magallanez 2000 and the irrigation schedule and staff gauge readings were recorded by the irrigator the vast majority of irrigations went directly to return flows fig 8 the excessive return flows were likely due to sandy soils with high infiltration rates that make efficient flood irrigation challenging the irrigation frequency for this field was very consistent typically three times per week at every irrigation turn additionally the soil moisture seldom approached even 50 of the mad therefore once the crops had reached full rooting depth mid august the irrigation frequency could have been halved still there were a couple of occasions in the summer where the soil moisture dropped slightly below the mad the total irrigation depth was the highest of all fields in the study at 4783 mm 188 3 in with calculated return flows of 4491 mm 176 8 in resulting in a beneficial consumed fraction of only 0 06 because there was no observed surface runoff on the property the return flows went to deep percolation and thus were not available to other users in the irrigation district improving the beneficial consumed fraction early in the season would be very difficult with surface irrigation because of the frequent irrigations needed for seed germination in the sandy soil and the shallow root zone of young vegetable crops if the irrigator wishes to save time and water during this period they should consider sprinkle irrigating possibly with culinary water shallow rooted crops until roots become more developed depending on how surface irrigation is controlled throughout the garden deep rooted crops e g trees berries and perennials could still be surface irrigated once the full rooting zone of vegetables crops is developed the irrigator could surface irrigate half as frequently and for less duration to ensure adequate water distribution with a changed schedule the rate of advance of the water towards the far side of the garden should be increased as much as possible by lining more of the distribution furrows with plastic sheeting by installing more pipes and gates for better flow control or by creating berms parallel to the water flow to allow higher flow rates over smaller areas 3 3 summary observations 3 3 1 beneficial consumed fraction a bar chart of the beneficial consumed fraction for each field fig 9 shows that seven of the fields had a calculated value of 1 0 because an application uniformity of 100 is not possible the fraction value of 1 0 results from under irrigation that causes crop water stress and can be detrimental to yield these irrigators should assess their application uniformity and consider applying more water to prevent yield loss a low beneficial consumed fraction on the other hand does not necessarily indicate a potential for water savings at the district or basin level for example field k a surface irrigated pasture has a beneficial consumed fraction of 0 19 but the return flows go directly back into the canal via surface runoff these return flows can be used by farmers located downstream on the canal in contrast return flows for field n a sprinkle irrigated field on a pumped system fed from a canal with a beneficial consumed fraction of 0 16 go to deep percolation thus reducing the applied water is still a good target as the over irrigating results in high pumping costs and unnecessary leaching of nutrients 3 3 2 field size and gross irrigation depth we hypothesized that small fields are more likely to be over irrigated than large fields as small fields are easier to irrigate because they require less time and effort to do so this hypothesis is supported by numerous studies around the globe speelman et al 2008 which find farm scale to be a significant factor in total water use to investigate this hypothesis we created a scatter chart of gid and grf vs field size fig 10 in addition to depths the plot shows the distribution of field sizes in the study sample with field sizes as small as 0 02 ha 0 04 acres up to 4 974 ha 12 29 acres with a slight concentration towards small fields the black lines connecting the gid and grf in fig 10 approximately represent net et et minus precipitation minus the change in soil moisture as calculated from the water balance in eq 1 all black lines have a similar height and indicate that the net et is similar across field sizes note that two of the three fields with the highest gid were less than 0 08 ha 0 2 acres and a third field was less than 1 6 ha 4 0 acres additionally with the exception of two fields all fields greater than 0 08 ha had gids less than 510 mm 20 in and calculated grfs of zero therefore the hypothesis that small fields are more likely to be over irrigated than large fields appears to have some validity however there are also a lot of small fields that do not over irrigate indicating that there are other factors that contribute to over irrigating rather than field size alone 3 3 3 method and application uniformity vs gross irrigation depth a four dimensional plot shows the relationship between gid and field size irrigation method and sprinkler application uniformity fig 11 the dark green circles are sprinkle irrigated fields where a cu was calculated and the light green circles are fields where a cu was not calculated because the irrigators did not attempt to sprinkle uniformly due to the diversity of crops grown or an awkward field shape the size of the circle represents the cu of the sprinkle system with larger cus having larger circles the yellow triangles are the surface irrigated fields and the purple diamond is the drip irrigated field the plot shows that most larger fields used sprinkle irrigation the variability of gid for the four surface irrigators yellow triangles was high two of the three outliers were surface irrigated but two surface irrigated fields had only approximately 700 mm 27 5 in performing better than many of the sprinkle irrigated fields indicating that well managed surface irrigation can perform better than a poorly managed sprinkle system the field with drip irrigation purple diamond had one of the lowest gids in the study in general all sprinkle fields larger than 1 0 hectare 2 5 acres had high cus and low gids indicated by large green circles on the lower right side of the plot while fields smaller than 1 0 hectare had lower cus and higher gids indicated by smaller circles on the left side of the plot above 500 mm 19 7 in almost all of the sprinkle fields had varying nozzle sizes throughout their systems and most of the fixed sprinkle fields had more than one clogged nozzle at the time of the evaluation a more detailed discussion of the circumstances surrounding the irrigation of each plot is provided in pratt 2016 from the plot multiple trends are observed 1 gid increases with decreasing field size and cu 2 large fields are more likely to use sprinkle than surface irrigation and 3 cu increases with increasing field size 3 3 4 scheduling and gross irrigation depth table 2 shows the two scheduling ratings for each field along with their respective gids and beneficial consumed fraction ranked in decreasing order of gid two significant patterns are evident from the table the fields at the top of the table with the highest gid and lowest beneficial consumed fraction received irrigations at fixed intervals return flows occurred on almost every irrigation throughout the season these farmers likely did not know the depths of water they were applying how much water their soil was capable of holding or both however there were a few irrigators with fixed interval schedules that had zero return flows so in these cases the fixed interval did not result in over irrigating for the majority of fields without fixed interval schedules farmers chose when to irrigate based on their judgement and return flows were generally low these results indicate that the role of irrigation scheduling and frequency is very significant in regards to gid and beneficial consumed fraction 4 discussion the above relationships between the beneficial consumed fraction and gid and field size irrigation method application uniformity and scheduling method provide important insights into what is actually occurring at the field level in urban and small farm irrigation practices since there is very little prior work that has studied the irrigation practices of urban and small farmers our discussion compares results to residential landscape practices and potential impacts to study participants other urban and small farm irrigators with similar situations in the u s extension programs and the utah dwre 4 1 irrigators the study results directly benefit the irrigators who took part in the study by providing them their own field s performance metrics e g gid grf cu crop water stress soil moisture management and timing of return flows and customized recommendations for how they can improve their irrigation operations pratt 2016 appendix f presents analysis for the 20 other fields not included in the case studies in section 3 2 from the 24 field sample three areas of management stand out as needing improvement 1 the knowledge of application rate and its importance in scheduling 2 how to schedule irrigation frequency and duration and 3 how to improve application uniformity although many educational resources exist in these areas all study irrigators said they only used their own judgement this is not surprising as research shows that most growers make their irrigation decisions subjectively based on their practical experience and observations knox et al 2012 and that there often exists a default assumption that irrigation practices are already adequately efficient levidow et al 2014 thus there are often weak perceived incentives to improve irrigation practices table 3 shows some of the actions and associated costs and benefits that could result from improved irrigation scheduling for each field in the study the recommendations were developed by observing the time series water balance for each field and noting when in the season return flows or crop water stress occurred the potential benefits include savings of water pumping energy and labor reduced leaching and improved yield 4 2 urban and small farm irrigators across the u s the circumstances of the fields in this study are not unique to cache valley utah but are undoubtedly common across the u s where irrigators find themselves in similar situations to the irrigators in this study e g small field size surface irrigation systems poor sprinkle uniformity or fixed irrigation schedule they should focus their efforts on learning how to measure their application rate schedule irrigations and improve application uniformity doing so has the potential to bring them similar benefits as those described in table 3 4 3 extension extension can benefit greatly from our findings by understanding the link between water use and irrigation management on urban and small farms training and educational efforts should focus on the three main areas of management needing improvement 1 the measurement of application rates 2 how to properly schedule irrigations and 3 how to improve application uniformity our results confirm the findings of levidow et al 2014 in that most irrigators will not improve their irrigation practices unless they understand the direct correlation between good irrigation management and savings in money time and yield this begins with knowing how to measure their flow rate technology and cost does not need to be an impediment for drip and sprinkle systems flow measurement could be as simple as conducting a volumetric test with a hose bucket and stopwatch for surface systems use the float method with a staff gauge these methods would be a vast improvement over no measurements second irrigators should use basic irrigation scheduling methods at present the easiest scheduling tool for use in utah is washington state university s mobile phone application irrigation scheduler which uses a series of weather networks that cover a large portion of the western u s and canada including northern utah washington state university 2016 this simple tool allows the irrigator to input field location soil type and crop type and helps estimate the ideal irrigation schedule another option for consideration is weekly emails or web postings of water use for various crops and planting dates extension programs should promote the use of these or other similar scheduling tools in education efforts keeping in mind that tools must be fast reliable and easy to use to find widespread use lastly irrigators should be aware of their field application uniformity and how poor uniformity means that either 1 some areas of the field are under watered reducing yield while other areas of the field are over watered leaching fertility or 2 crop water requirements of the entire field are met but significant volumes of water still go directly to return flows also wasting resources although improving sprinkler uniformities can be constrained by field shape and size labor and equipment costs and system layout encouraging simple low cost measures such as nozzle maintenance e g cleaning clogged nozzles repairing nozzle arc and rotation and replacing worn nozzles and gaskets and the use of standardized and uniform nozzles may have the most effective results 4 4 utah division of water resources conservation efforts this study also benefits the utah dwre by providing valuable insights that can improve statewide water use estimation and conservation efforts specifically dwre programs should highlight the important role of irrigation management measurement scheduling and application uniformity and target urban farmers with small fields and unmetered secondary water sources that are more prone to over irrigate compared to farmers with large fields or metered sources as also found in speelman et al 2008 additionally dwre should partner with extension to deliver programs as urban and small farm irrigators are likely already familiar with extension the crop type most likely to occur in residential landscapes is mixed gardens comparing area weighted average irrigation depth for the garden category in this study of 493 mm 19 4 in to utah landscape primarily turfgrass values of 826 mm 32 5 in utah division of water resources 2010 suggests dwre can promote urban agriculture as an alternative to conventional landscaping such promotion can save water in the m i sector while building community improving nutrition and promoting local food security additionally this promotion would reduce fall over watering of turfgrass which is the season when residents fail to adjust irrigation timers to respond to reduced et and urban water supplies are most scarce utah division of water resources 2010 unlike landscape irrigation our study results show that if urban and small farmers over irrigate they do so in early season or over the entire season but never just in fall 5 conclusion urban and small farming is growing yet relatively little is known about the sector s water use practices we conducted comprehensive season long evaluations of 24 urban and small farm fields in cache valley utah we measured applied irrigation depths and gathered time series data to calculate the changing soil moisture and the depth and timing of return flows throughout the season for sprinkle systems we conducted catch can tests to calculate the cu results showed that large fields generally have lower gid and higher cu than small fields we also found that surface systems are more likely to have excessive gid than sprinkle systems although well managed surface irrigation systems can outperform poorly managed sprinkle systems lastly scheduling played a big role in gid fields irrigating on a fixed interval schedule applied more water than fields irrigating with a partially fixed variable or other interval the majority of the excess irrigation went directly to deep percolation and occurred either early season or all season long these timings contrast with residential landscapes where excess irrigation often occurs late in the season three of the 24 fields had extremely high irrigation depths four case studies identified two fields with good management and two fields with poor management these results illustrate the variability of irrigation circumstances and practices and the effect of scheduling including irrigation duration and interval and application uniformity on total water use and beneficial consumed fraction study results can help participating urban and small farm irrigators and irrigators with similar situations in other areas these users can improve by learning 1 low cost methods to measure application rates 2 proper irrigation scheduling and 3 improving application uniformity extension and utah dwre water conservation efforts should prioritize programs that teach irrigators techniques for improving management in these areas and consider promoting small gardens over conventional turfgrass landscapes for

11158,the landscape of water in utah is changing due to population growth conversion of agricultural land to urban development and increasing awareness of water scarcity at the same time utah is experiencing a growing number of urban and small farms but knowledge of water use in this sector is limited better understanding of what occurs at the field level on urban and small farms can aid state water use estimates and conservation efforts and assist farmers in moving towards wiser water management for the 2015 growing season we performed irrigation evaluations for 24 urban and small farms in cache valley utah and we explore the results through case studies and identify trends among gross irrigation depth and field variables including field size irrigation method application uniformity and scheduling practices results show a great degree of heterogeneity in irrigation methods equipment used and management practices the beneficial consumed fraction of irrigation water ranged from 0 06 to 1 0 small fields had lower application uniformities and greater irrigation depths than large fields surface irrigated fields had higher irrigation depths than sprinkle and drip irrigated fields additionally fields using a fixed irrigation schedule had higher depths than fields that were irrigated inconsistently due to other factors the results show that urban and small farm irrigators need improved knowledge of proper irrigation management irrigators university extension services and state water authorities working in this sector need to recognize the link between proper management and total water use and focus more efforts on improving management specifically how to use 1 low cost methods to measure flow rates 2 simple irrigation scheduling tools and 3 improve application uniformity keywords beneficial consumed fraction water management urban agriculture irrigation scheduling application uniformity water conservation 1 introduction the socioeconomic landscape of water in utah is undergoing a transformation and there is much debate about how water should be managed to meet the present and future needs of the state according to the u s census bureau the 2010 utah population is expected to more than double by 2060 giving the state the fourth highest growth rate in the country united states census bureau 2016 the growth is happening largely by sprawl of new residential and commercial land onto agricultural land at the edge of urban boundaries this sprawl creates a mosaic of mixed agricultural residential and commercial land use li 2013 mcginty 2009 that is the second highest rate of urban sprawl by percentage in the u s kolankiewics et al 2014 in utah between the years 1982 and 2012 over 26 100 ha 64 500 acres of farmland converted to urban use an increase in developed land of 16 the utah division of water resources dwre estimates that by 2050 an additional 10 of farm land will be urbanized utah division of water resources 2013 as agricultural land is developed the spatial and temporal water use on the landscape changes and can affect other water users in the basin by changing the quantities and timing of water demands environmental flows in rivers and wetlands and the quantity and destination of agricultural return flows in 2015 utah ranked the second highest state in municipal and industrial m i per capita water use usgs 2014 being the second driest state in the nation this exceptionally high use is due to the large volumes of water used for outdoor irrigation coupled with a culture that encourages verdant landscapes and gardens additionally many urban areas in utah have unmetered secondary water systems where users typically pay a flat fee for outdoor landscape water use the term secondary water system is used in utah to describe any non potable water delivery system i e not treated to drinking water standards non potable systems typically consist of either a canal network or a piped pressurized supply intended for irrigation while these secondary systems are usually metered at the original diversion the actual water delivered to each end user is unmetered and typically unknown yet numerous studies have shown that providing unmetered water results in 39 100 increases in use cole 2015 richards 2009 to address water use in the urban environment utah has invested in numerous conservation efforts including utah state university s center for water efficient landscaping cwel water conservation programs sponsored by water conservation districts and municipalities and the state s slow the flow campaign among others however these programs focus on landscape irrigation rather than urban agricultural irrigation simultaneous with urban growth utah is experiencing a quickly growing sector of urban and small farm agriculture urban agriculture is defined as the growing processing and distribution of food and other products through intensive plant cultivation and animal husbandry in and around cities brown and carter 2003 nationwide the number of farms and total acreage is decreasing as agricultural land is converted to urban development similarly in utah agricultural acreage is likewise decreasing but the number of farms is increasing for example in weber davis and salt lake counties that are mostly urbanized the number of farms between 0 4 and 4 ha 1 and 9 acres has increased 245 from 1974 to 2007 in cache county the number of farms in this category increased 24 between 2007 to 2012 downen 2009 usda 2016 a recent survey of 253 urban farms around the country found that the median income of the farms in their study was 5000 this income amount suggests that recent growth is not motivated by economics but rather factors such as interest in locally produced foods nutrition and health food security education environmental benefits and community building dimitri et al 2015 curtis 2013 salt lake city for example set a goal of increasing direct access to fresh foods community groups and public officials are actively working to identify vacant lots that can be used to grow food in the city utah division of water resources 2003 most of the academic literature pertaining to urban and small farms is focused on developing countries where farmers face very different situations than in developed countries most u s irrigation research focuses on large field sizes and irrigated areas usda 2013 of the limited documentation that does exist for small farms two particular trends stand out first there is little knowledge exchange between academia and small farmers second farmers adopt more efficient practices only if they see benefits or economics gains to do so levidow et al 2014 new research into urban and small farms must identify the issues and challenges these irrigators face at all scales of consideration from the field to basin level additionally research must apply the right metrics to determine beneficial and reasonable use of water based on the scale of interest for use of the wrong term can lead to misinterpretation of its value and meaning perry 2007 2011 at the field level irrigators have a high incentive to apply the minimum amount of water necessary to obtain a good yield to reduce pumping costs labor leaching of nutrients and water logging from over irrigation at the district level excess applied water may not be available to other irrigators depending on the pathway of the return flows at the basin level over irrigating at the field level does not necessarily result in wasted water as in multiple use cycle basins this water may be available to other users lower in the basin keller and keller 1995 in this study we investigate what is occurring at the field level on urban and small farms the volume of applied irrigation water was measured on 24 urban and small farm fields in cache valley utah for the entirety of an irrigation season and full field irrigation evaluations were conducted the fields selected were typical and representative of urban and small farm fields in the arid intermountain west the results are explored through case studies and trends in gross irrigation depth gid the total depth of applied irrigation water and field size irrigation method uniformity and irrigation scheduling are identified insights from the study can help the participants and other urban and small farm irrigators across the u s recognize trends between total water use and irrigation parameters improve irrigation practices and grow healthier crops with fewer resources results also help university extension hereafter referred to as extension and state water authorities gain insights about actual irrigation practices see shifts in agricultural and urban water uses and develop more effective technical programs and approaches to water conservation in the growing urban and small farm sector all of the above can help managers reach state water goals 2 materials and methods 2 1 collect field data 2 1 1 find participants numerous irrigation districts local farms and regional water planners were contacted and asked to recommend small farm and urban irrigators to participate in the study participation criteria were that participants need to produce an agricultural product on more than 93 square meters 1000 square feet to rule out plots that were not producing a marketable good or a significant share of the irrigator s diet and less than 8 1 ha 20 acres in area a size which is increasingly less common on the urban fringe through a snowball sampling approach we identified 20 participants irrigating a total of 24 fields across cache valley fig 1 the fields consisted of small commercial farms community gardens large backyard gardens orchards pastures alfalfa fields and university research farms the crops included mixed vegetables grass pasture grass and alfalfa hay apples wheat corn quinoa tomatoes peppers winter squash and watermelon a wide range of methods were used for irrigation including surface drip and numerous methods of sprinkle to maintain the anonymity of the fields we refer to each field with a letter a through x a complete table of field metadata is provided in table 1 on page 28 in pratt 2016 2 1 2 install measurement devices from a site visit we determined the most practical method to measure flow rates throughout the season methods used included flumes weirs flowmeters and a one time volumetric measurement for fields with challenging layouts that would necessitate multiple meters for those fields with open channel flow measurements the irrigation schedule and staff gauge readings were recorded manually by the irrigator for the fields with a one time volumetric measurement the schedule was recorded with pressure event dataloggers for one site where the event datalogger was impractical the schedule was recorded manually the methods used are shown in table 1 2 1 3 conduct field measurements the collected field data included field size planting and harvest dates observations of overspray and runoff maintenance and application uniformity field size was determined using aerial imagery in gis software for sprinkle and drip irrigated fields an evaluation team conducted catch can tests to calculate the coefficient of uniformity cu for the drip irrigated field we calculated the emission uniformity eu using specifications from the drip tape datasheet and equations from keller and bliesner 1990 as shown in pratt 2016 appendix d 2 2 calculate irrigation performance this section provides a general overview of the methods and equations used to calculate the irrigation variables in this study for a more thorough explanation of these methods refer to pratt 2016 pp 14 24 2 2 1 gross irrigation depth we calculated the average depth of water applied to the field over the season by dividing the total applied volume by the field size giving a season gross irrigation depth gid the accuracies used are explained in detail in appendix c in pratt 2016 2 2 2 time series water balance a time series soil water balance was calculated using irrigation i and precipitation p events crop et etcrop calculated from crop coefficients and adjustment factors change in soil moisture storage δsm and return flows rf using a control volume of field area by mature rooting depth of the crop as shown in eq 1 a spreadsheet with the time series calculation is available in an open source repository pratt 2018 the daily time step of the water balance allows for the temporal variability to be observed 1 r f i p e t c r o p δ s m precipitation p and reference evapotranspiration etref data for each field were collected from the utah climate center s agricultural weather network station with the closest proximity to the field we assumed that the effective precipitation peff was 80 of the total precipitation for reasons including 1 it was impractical to measure soil moisture with sensors due to the number of fields in our study and the spatial variability within fields 2 most effective precipitation calculations require assumptions and the 80 assumption is also used by the utah dwre utah division of water resources 2010 3 because of weather and soils very little surface runoff from precipitation is observed on irrigated fields in utah and 4 precipitation is such a small fraction of et that further detail would likely not change results the utah climate center etref estimate uses the asce standardized reference penman monteith et equation to calculate the crop et etcrop we used procedures from food and agriculture organization irrigation and drainage paper 56 fao 56 and when available locally derived crop coefficients hill et al 2011 for the δsm variable we calculated the total available water taw of the soil from the available water capacity awc collected from the usda s web soil survey database and a calculation of crop rooting depth then using table 22 from fao 56 the management allowed depletion mad was calculated allen et al 1998 the precipitation in cache valley in april and may of 2015 was 63 5 and 135 mm 2 50 and 5 30 in respectively which was higher than the average april and may precipitation of 52 1 and 53 3 mm 2 05 and 2 10 in utah climate center 2016 therefore we assumed the root zone depletion dr at the beginning the time series was 0 and 25 of the taw for annuals and perennials respectively because annuals are typically planted into a barren field where no et for the year would have yet occurred and perennials would likely have been evapotranspirating and depleting the soil moisture in spring before the beginning of the time series calculation note an accurate estimate of initial depletion should take into context the precipitation of a particular year and when practical rely on actual soil moisture measurements values and methods from clemmens and burt 1997 were used to calculate the accuracy in our time series calculation the equations used and calculated accuracies are included in appendix c in pratt 2016 2 2 3 water use metrics the water use metric typically most relevant to irrigators considers the amount of water needed to grow the crop i e the beneficial and reasonable use and the amount of water applied to the crop irrigation water applied in excess of what is required often means that resources e g time labor and money have been used unnecessarily and in some cases yield has been compromised from loss of fertility via leaching and waterlogging in cache valley utah where leaching requirements are minimal due to low water salinity the bulk of the water beneficially applied is for evapotranspiration in this study we use the beneficial consumed fraction metric which is ratio of irrigation water consumed by the crop to the total irrigation water applied this metric avoids the use of the value laden term efficiency and is adopted by the international committee on irrigation and drainage icid perry 2011 the beneficial consumed fraction equation is shown in eq 2 2 b e n e f i c i a l c o n s u m e d f r a c t i o n e t c r o p i r r i g a t i o n v o l i r r i g w a t e r a p p l i e d 2 2 4 application uniformity a properly designed sprinkle system will attempt to achieve a balance between high application uniformity and low cost typically the higher the uniformity the more expensive the system using catch can data we wrote a script in matlab to calculate field cu and generate a 3d plot of field application uniformity that takes into account sprinkler and lateral spacing and field edges the script is included in appendix d of pratt 2016 with the cu values the water distribution efficiency depa was used to determine the percentage of the field over and under irrigated using data from keller and bliesner 1995 2 2 5 scheduling method after collecting the seasonal data we gave each field two qualitative ratings regarding the irrigation scheduling method to compare trends between the gid and different scheduling methods the first rating is of schedule interval which includes the ratings fixed irrigations occurred at a fixed interval all season partially fixed irrigations occurred at a fixed interval for most of the season variable numerous irrigations occurred but at no identifiable interval and other only a couple of irrigations occurred at no identifiable interval the second rating is the frequency of return flow occurrence and includes the ratings rf every irr return flows occurred on every irrigation rf early season return flows occurred at the beginning of the season only rf late season return flows occurred late in the season only and zero rf no return flow events occurred during the season 2 2 6 data analysis with the irrigation metrics calculated the trends between gid and field variables were explored using a variety of graphical methods 3 results 3 1 gross irrigation depth and gross return flows the gid and gross return flows grf the seasonal total depth of return flow for each field show the majority of fields applied less than 640 mm 25 in fig 2 three distinct outlier fields k n and v had gid and grf significantly higher than the other fields the majority of fields had some return flows while seven fields had no return flows at all 3 2 case studies in this section we present four cases to illustrate examples of good and poor irrigation practices and provide recommendations to improve these fields irrigation configuration and management 3 2 1 case study 1 sprinkle irrigated pasture with good performance field w field w is a 0 38 hectare 0 93 acre pasture of mixed grasses the field is located in north logan surrounded by other urban hay fields intermixed with new residential developments the pasture is grazed by horses and cut and bailed three times a season the water supply is a pressurized piped secondary system the irrigator can irrigate whenever he chooses the field is irrigated from two risers with 76 mm 3 0 inch o d aluminum hand move pipe and has a challenging geometry because of the long and narrow shape and resulting high perimeter to area ratio a time series plot of soil water balance for the season shows very few return flows fig 3 precipitation continually recharged the soil in may and irrigation did not begin until mid june the field received seven irrigations during the season six of which applied around 50 mm 2 in of water and one that applied nearly 100 mm 4 in of water the calculated irrigation return flows only happened on two occasions in early july and late august and the depth of these flows was minimal because no surface runoff or standing water was ever observed on this field the return flows went to deep percolation additionally the aw red line was kept well above the mad dashed grey line in fig 3 the cumulative irrigation depth was calculated to be 399 mm 15 7 in total return flows from irrigation of 43 mm 1 7 in and the change in soil moisture from irrigation was a positive 69 mm 2 7 in the irrigation management was very good resulting in a beneficial consumed fraction of 0 8 the 3d plot of the application uniformity at 3 0 meter 10 foot intervals across the field shows that the field receives the most water in a strip down the middle and that the south and east edges receive significantly less water than the rest of the field due to the lack of overlap that occurs at the field edge fig 4 the cu and du are 71 8 and 0 49 respectively fairly good values for a field with a small area to perimeter ratio yet still lower than recommended values distribution efficiency depa analysis shows that 72 of the field receives more water than the 318 mm 12 5 in water requirement for net et while 28 of the field is under irrigated fig 5 in summary this irrigator applied adequate but not excessive irrigation depths to avoid crop water stress minimize return flows and obtain a high beneficial consumed fraction the soil moisture depletion was timed perfectly with the rain events so that all of the precipitation was utilized however this irrigator could have saved labor by adjusting the schedule irrigating less frequently but for longer duration thereby reducing the work to move sprinkler laterals the field cu was low but decent considering the challenging field geometry this was one of the best managed fields in the study 3 2 2 case study 2 drip irrigated vegetable field with good performance field l is a 1 02 hectare 2 51 acre vegetable field using plastic mulch and 16 mm 5 8 in low flow drip tape on uniform topography detailed information on the drip tape is provided in case study 2 in pratt 2016 the crops included tomatoes sweet peppers winter squash and watermelons a pump feeds the drip tape through a sand media filter pressure regulator and lay flat hose manifold and was run at the irrigator s discretion the volume of water used for backflushing the filter was nominal compared with the total applied water and therefore the backflush water was not subtracted from the applied water volume in the analysis the drip tape laterals were 290 m 950 foot and 171 m 560 foot for different field sections we recorded the flow rates and irrigation schedule with an electromagnetic datalogging flow meter which was installed for the duration of the irrigation season in the time series water balance we used an area weighted average of the four crops for the depletion fraction rooting depth and crop coefficient once the rooting depth was fully established in mid july the soil moisture closely followed the average mad fig 6 note how the soil moisture does not oscillate much at all indicating that the sum of irrigation and precipitation almost perfectly matched the crop et making the total water received by the crop nearly optimal although frequent irrigations are common with drip systems due to the smaller volume of soil receiving irrigation the irrigations could have been at a lesser frequency but longer duration to reduce the time and labor required to turn the pump on and off no return flow events occurred during the season which led to a very high beneficial consumed fraction the total applied irrigation depth was only 200 mm 7 7 in and the precipitation was 53 mm 2 1 in the beneficial consumed fraction was 1 0 drip system emission uniformity eu for the 171 m and 290 m drip tape runs was calculated to be 81 and 72 respectively the 81 eu for the 171 m drip tape is above the minimum recommended value of 80 for line source tubing on uniform topography the eu of the 290 m length however was significantly lower than ideal merriam and keller 1978 to improve the eu of the 290 m runs the irrigator could either 1 increase the size of the drip tubing from 16 mm to 22 mm 7 8 in 2 decrease the drip tube flow rate or 3 run more lay flat hose manifold to reduce the length of the 290 m run to 171 m or less increasing the tubing size is most likely the preferable option because the pump would operate at the same flow rate according to the calculations both options 1 and 2 would increase the eu to 80 3 2 3 case study 3 sprinkle irrigated garden with low beneficial consumed fraction field d is a 0 016 hectare 0 039 acre large backyard garden and orchard surrounded by quickly growing urban development the garden is irrigated with a fixed sprinkler system from an irrigation pump that draws water from an adjacent ditch seven sprinkler nozzles of mixed types are set at varying heights around the perimeter of the garden the crops included densely planted mixed vegetables and half a dozen apple and pear trees we used a 19 mm 3 4 in totalizer electromagnetic flow meter to measure the irrigation volume and took meter readings approximately every three weeks dividing the difference between each meter reading by the number of irrigation events in that time period gave the depth applied at each irrigation the time series plot fig 7 shows that irrigation frequency was close to ideal before mid july however the water depth of each irrigation application was high and 75 or more of irrigations went to deep percolation return flows two irrigations went almost entirely to return flow the cumulative irrigation depth was calculated to be 1380 mm 54 4 in with irrigation return flows of 1040 mm 41 0 in these excessive applications led to a beneficial consumed fraction of only 0 25 using a catch can evaluation we determined the irrigation cu and du of 66 and 0 41 respectively the nozzles were in very poor shape with two completely clogged the spray of one immediately blocked by vegetation and two rotating far outside of the garden and lawn area the low uniformity may have been a part of the reason that this garden received so much water because in order to adequately irrigate the dry spots the majority of the garden had to be excessively over watered to improve irrigation in this garden the irrigator should improve the application uniformity by fixing clogged and improperly rotating nozzles as well as improve the irrigation scheduling by irrigating at the same frequency but a much shorter duration especially early in the season when the root zone is shallow 3 2 4 case study 4 surface irrigated garden with low beneficial consumed fraction field v is a 0 076 hectare 0 19 acre large backyard garden growing a wide variety of crops including mixed vegetables grains berries cover crops and fruit trees the garden is surface irrigated via an open ditch secondary system the main distribution channel in the garden is lined with plastic to reduce seepage losses the irrigation flow rates were measured with an s m flume designed by samani and magallanez 2000 and the irrigation schedule and staff gauge readings were recorded by the irrigator the vast majority of irrigations went directly to return flows fig 8 the excessive return flows were likely due to sandy soils with high infiltration rates that make efficient flood irrigation challenging the irrigation frequency for this field was very consistent typically three times per week at every irrigation turn additionally the soil moisture seldom approached even 50 of the mad therefore once the crops had reached full rooting depth mid august the irrigation frequency could have been halved still there were a couple of occasions in the summer where the soil moisture dropped slightly below the mad the total irrigation depth was the highest of all fields in the study at 4783 mm 188 3 in with calculated return flows of 4491 mm 176 8 in resulting in a beneficial consumed fraction of only 0 06 because there was no observed surface runoff on the property the return flows went to deep percolation and thus were not available to other users in the irrigation district improving the beneficial consumed fraction early in the season would be very difficult with surface irrigation because of the frequent irrigations needed for seed germination in the sandy soil and the shallow root zone of young vegetable crops if the irrigator wishes to save time and water during this period they should consider sprinkle irrigating possibly with culinary water shallow rooted crops until roots become more developed depending on how surface irrigation is controlled throughout the garden deep rooted crops e g trees berries and perennials could still be surface irrigated once the full rooting zone of vegetables crops is developed the irrigator could surface irrigate half as frequently and for less duration to ensure adequate water distribution with a changed schedule the rate of advance of the water towards the far side of the garden should be increased as much as possible by lining more of the distribution furrows with plastic sheeting by installing more pipes and gates for better flow control or by creating berms parallel to the water flow to allow higher flow rates over smaller areas 3 3 summary observations 3 3 1 beneficial consumed fraction a bar chart of the beneficial consumed fraction for each field fig 9 shows that seven of the fields had a calculated value of 1 0 because an application uniformity of 100 is not possible the fraction value of 1 0 results from under irrigation that causes crop water stress and can be detrimental to yield these irrigators should assess their application uniformity and consider applying more water to prevent yield loss a low beneficial consumed fraction on the other hand does not necessarily indicate a potential for water savings at the district or basin level for example field k a surface irrigated pasture has a beneficial consumed fraction of 0 19 but the return flows go directly back into the canal via surface runoff these return flows can be used by farmers located downstream on the canal in contrast return flows for field n a sprinkle irrigated field on a pumped system fed from a canal with a beneficial consumed fraction of 0 16 go to deep percolation thus reducing the applied water is still a good target as the over irrigating results in high pumping costs and unnecessary leaching of nutrients 3 3 2 field size and gross irrigation depth we hypothesized that small fields are more likely to be over irrigated than large fields as small fields are easier to irrigate because they require less time and effort to do so this hypothesis is supported by numerous studies around the globe speelman et al 2008 which find farm scale to be a significant factor in total water use to investigate this hypothesis we created a scatter chart of gid and grf vs field size fig 10 in addition to depths the plot shows the distribution of field sizes in the study sample with field sizes as small as 0 02 ha 0 04 acres up to 4 974 ha 12 29 acres with a slight concentration towards small fields the black lines connecting the gid and grf in fig 10 approximately represent net et et minus precipitation minus the change in soil moisture as calculated from the water balance in eq 1 all black lines have a similar height and indicate that the net et is similar across field sizes note that two of the three fields with the highest gid were less than 0 08 ha 0 2 acres and a third field was less than 1 6 ha 4 0 acres additionally with the exception of two fields all fields greater than 0 08 ha had gids less than 510 mm 20 in and calculated grfs of zero therefore the hypothesis that small fields are more likely to be over irrigated than large fields appears to have some validity however there are also a lot of small fields that do not over irrigate indicating that there are other factors that contribute to over irrigating rather than field size alone 3 3 3 method and application uniformity vs gross irrigation depth a four dimensional plot shows the relationship between gid and field size irrigation method and sprinkler application uniformity fig 11 the dark green circles are sprinkle irrigated fields where a cu was calculated and the light green circles are fields where a cu was not calculated because the irrigators did not attempt to sprinkle uniformly due to the diversity of crops grown or an awkward field shape the size of the circle represents the cu of the sprinkle system with larger cus having larger circles the yellow triangles are the surface irrigated fields and the purple diamond is the drip irrigated field the plot shows that most larger fields used sprinkle irrigation the variability of gid for the four surface irrigators yellow triangles was high two of the three outliers were surface irrigated but two surface irrigated fields had only approximately 700 mm 27 5 in performing better than many of the sprinkle irrigated fields indicating that well managed surface irrigation can perform better than a poorly managed sprinkle system the field with drip irrigation purple diamond had one of the lowest gids in the study in general all sprinkle fields larger than 1 0 hectare 2 5 acres had high cus and low gids indicated by large green circles on the lower right side of the plot while fields smaller than 1 0 hectare had lower cus and higher gids indicated by smaller circles on the left side of the plot above 500 mm 19 7 in almost all of the sprinkle fields had varying nozzle sizes throughout their systems and most of the fixed sprinkle fields had more than one clogged nozzle at the time of the evaluation a more detailed discussion of the circumstances surrounding the irrigation of each plot is provided in pratt 2016 from the plot multiple trends are observed 1 gid increases with decreasing field size and cu 2 large fields are more likely to use sprinkle than surface irrigation and 3 cu increases with increasing field size 3 3 4 scheduling and gross irrigation depth table 2 shows the two scheduling ratings for each field along with their respective gids and beneficial consumed fraction ranked in decreasing order of gid two significant patterns are evident from the table the fields at the top of the table with the highest gid and lowest beneficial consumed fraction received irrigations at fixed intervals return flows occurred on almost every irrigation throughout the season these farmers likely did not know the depths of water they were applying how much water their soil was capable of holding or both however there were a few irrigators with fixed interval schedules that had zero return flows so in these cases the fixed interval did not result in over irrigating for the majority of fields without fixed interval schedules farmers chose when to irrigate based on their judgement and return flows were generally low these results indicate that the role of irrigation scheduling and frequency is very significant in regards to gid and beneficial consumed fraction 4 discussion the above relationships between the beneficial consumed fraction and gid and field size irrigation method application uniformity and scheduling method provide important insights into what is actually occurring at the field level in urban and small farm irrigation practices since there is very little prior work that has studied the irrigation practices of urban and small farmers our discussion compares results to residential landscape practices and potential impacts to study participants other urban and small farm irrigators with similar situations in the u s extension programs and the utah dwre 4 1 irrigators the study results directly benefit the irrigators who took part in the study by providing them their own field s performance metrics e g gid grf cu crop water stress soil moisture management and timing of return flows and customized recommendations for how they can improve their irrigation operations pratt 2016 appendix f presents analysis for the 20 other fields not included in the case studies in section 3 2 from the 24 field sample three areas of management stand out as needing improvement 1 the knowledge of application rate and its importance in scheduling 2 how to schedule irrigation frequency and duration and 3 how to improve application uniformity although many educational resources exist in these areas all study irrigators said they only used their own judgement this is not surprising as research shows that most growers make their irrigation decisions subjectively based on their practical experience and observations knox et al 2012 and that there often exists a default assumption that irrigation practices are already adequately efficient levidow et al 2014 thus there are often weak perceived incentives to improve irrigation practices table 3 shows some of the actions and associated costs and benefits that could result from improved irrigation scheduling for each field in the study the recommendations were developed by observing the time series water balance for each field and noting when in the season return flows or crop water stress occurred the potential benefits include savings of water pumping energy and labor reduced leaching and improved yield 4 2 urban and small farm irrigators across the u s the circumstances of the fields in this study are not unique to cache valley utah but are undoubtedly common across the u s where irrigators find themselves in similar situations to the irrigators in this study e g small field size surface irrigation systems poor sprinkle uniformity or fixed irrigation schedule they should focus their efforts on learning how to measure their application rate schedule irrigations and improve application uniformity doing so has the potential to bring them similar benefits as those described in table 3 4 3 extension extension can benefit greatly from our findings by understanding the link between water use and irrigation management on urban and small farms training and educational efforts should focus on the three main areas of management needing improvement 1 the measurement of application rates 2 how to properly schedule irrigations and 3 how to improve application uniformity our results confirm the findings of levidow et al 2014 in that most irrigators will not improve their irrigation practices unless they understand the direct correlation between good irrigation management and savings in money time and yield this begins with knowing how to measure their flow rate technology and cost does not need to be an impediment for drip and sprinkle systems flow measurement could be as simple as conducting a volumetric test with a hose bucket and stopwatch for surface systems use the float method with a staff gauge these methods would be a vast improvement over no measurements second irrigators should use basic irrigation scheduling methods at present the easiest scheduling tool for use in utah is washington state university s mobile phone application irrigation scheduler which uses a series of weather networks that cover a large portion of the western u s and canada including northern utah washington state university 2016 this simple tool allows the irrigator to input field location soil type and crop type and helps estimate the ideal irrigation schedule another option for consideration is weekly emails or web postings of water use for various crops and planting dates extension programs should promote the use of these or other similar scheduling tools in education efforts keeping in mind that tools must be fast reliable and easy to use to find widespread use lastly irrigators should be aware of their field application uniformity and how poor uniformity means that either 1 some areas of the field are under watered reducing yield while other areas of the field are over watered leaching fertility or 2 crop water requirements of the entire field are met but significant volumes of water still go directly to return flows also wasting resources although improving sprinkler uniformities can be constrained by field shape and size labor and equipment costs and system layout encouraging simple low cost measures such as nozzle maintenance e g cleaning clogged nozzles repairing nozzle arc and rotation and replacing worn nozzles and gaskets and the use of standardized and uniform nozzles may have the most effective results 4 4 utah division of water resources conservation efforts this study also benefits the utah dwre by providing valuable insights that can improve statewide water use estimation and conservation efforts specifically dwre programs should highlight the important role of irrigation management measurement scheduling and application uniformity and target urban farmers with small fields and unmetered secondary water sources that are more prone to over irrigate compared to farmers with large fields or metered sources as also found in speelman et al 2008 additionally dwre should partner with extension to deliver programs as urban and small farm irrigators are likely already familiar with extension the crop type most likely to occur in residential landscapes is mixed gardens comparing area weighted average irrigation depth for the garden category in this study of 493 mm 19 4 in to utah landscape primarily turfgrass values of 826 mm 32 5 in utah division of water resources 2010 suggests dwre can promote urban agriculture as an alternative to conventional landscaping such promotion can save water in the m i sector while building community improving nutrition and promoting local food security additionally this promotion would reduce fall over watering of turfgrass which is the season when residents fail to adjust irrigation timers to respond to reduced et and urban water supplies are most scarce utah division of water resources 2010 unlike landscape irrigation our study results show that if urban and small farmers over irrigate they do so in early season or over the entire season but never just in fall 5 conclusion urban and small farming is growing yet relatively little is known about the sector s water use practices we conducted comprehensive season long evaluations of 24 urban and small farm fields in cache valley utah we measured applied irrigation depths and gathered time series data to calculate the changing soil moisture and the depth and timing of return flows throughout the season for sprinkle systems we conducted catch can tests to calculate the cu results showed that large fields generally have lower gid and higher cu than small fields we also found that surface systems are more likely to have excessive gid than sprinkle systems although well managed surface irrigation systems can outperform poorly managed sprinkle systems lastly scheduling played a big role in gid fields irrigating on a fixed interval schedule applied more water than fields irrigating with a partially fixed variable or other interval the majority of the excess irrigation went directly to deep percolation and occurred either early season or all season long these timings contrast with residential landscapes where excess irrigation often occurs late in the season three of the 24 fields had extremely high irrigation depths four case studies identified two fields with good management and two fields with poor management these results illustrate the variability of irrigation circumstances and practices and the effect of scheduling including irrigation duration and interval and application uniformity on total water use and beneficial consumed fraction study results can help participating urban and small farm irrigators and irrigators with similar situations in other areas these users can improve by learning 1 low cost methods to measure application rates 2 proper irrigation scheduling and 3 improving application uniformity extension and utah dwre water conservation efforts should prioritize programs that teach irrigators techniques for improving management in these areas and consider promoting small gardens over conventional turfgrass landscapes for

11159,evaluation of the sustainability of grain production systems requires knowledge of long term crop yields and edge of field runoff volumes and water quality when measured data are limited computer simulation models calibrated and validated with the available data are well suited for this type of inquiry in this study the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model was used to investigate how management affects crop yields runoff volume and water quality on claypan soils specific objectives were to determine the ability of apex to simulate the variability of corn and soybean yields on claypan soils and the transport of dissolved phase atrazine and nutrients via surface runoff and how management affects long term runoff and associated loss of these constituents in spite of satisfactory model performance for corn yields and acceptable relative differences for soybean yields the model was not capable of simulating the effects of management or landscape position on crop yields model performance was very good for runoff and mostly satisfactory for dissolved constituents long term simulation along with uncertainty analysis indicated that a no till 3 year corn soybean wheat rotation with cover crops provides the most benefits to water quality by reducing nutrient transport in runoff this system appeared to mitigate the negative effects of no till on the surface transport of non incorporated dissolved chemicals because of improved fertilizer management in terms of rate placement and timing of application cover crops appeared to reduce nitrate leaching compared to a 2 year no till system this research highlights the need for further research in crop growth modeling as inconsistent crop yield results undermine the usefulness of the model for making recommendations about management overall the long term simulations support the concept of multiple practices addressing tillage fertilizer management longer crop rotations and use of cover crops to achieve desired environmental and production goals keywords model simulation apex cover crops no till claypan 1 introduction long term sustainability of agricultural systems includes goals of productivity to meet the food fuel and fiber demand but also of economic environmental and social integrity robertson et al 2008 to that end the usda initiated the long term agro ecosystem research ltar network with the goal of ensuring sustainability of agricultural systems at multiple spatial and temporal scales in the face of trends such as land use change and climate variability walbridge and shafer 2011 one component of ltar is the common experiment a long term contrast of innovative agricultural systems that optimize productivity ecosystem services and adaptability to climate variability with the regional conventional systems the common experiment relies in part on replicated plot experiments that compare productivity and eco system services of various agricultural systems the goals of the common experiment are to develop and evaluate sustainable agricultural systems that balance productivity and environmental impacts steiner et al 2016 the central mississippi river basin cmrb site of the ltar network is located in north central missouri claypan soils give the region unique hydrologic features that affect agricultural production and its environmental effects sadler et al 2015a document the establishment of the cmrb site provide an overview and describe available data the current ltar research infrastructure builds upon previous long term research 1991 2010 conducted on large replicated plots 0 34 ha that have been established to study and compare diverse agricultural systems including grain cropping systems cs and grass systems previous findings from this large plot long term study include 1 a strong linkage between landscape position lp and depth to the claypan 2 significant differences by lp and cs in soil properties jung et al 2007 jiang

increased pesticide loss via surface runoff in no till systems ghidey et al 2005 mudgal et al 2010 and nitrogen loss through denitrification kitchen et al 1998 compared to tilled cs and 5 similar crop productivity but greater yield stability and reduced yield variability in conservation cs than in conventional systems on these soils yost et al 2016 while crop yield data cover the whole 1991 2010 period past water quality data are limited in duration and in scope during this period water quality monitoring was limited to 1997 2002 ghidey et al 2005 which did not include years of extreme drought 1992 2005 and rain 2008 2010 the monitoring focused on the growing season and did not include winter periods which can be a time of considerable nutrient losses additionally it was limited to the corn phase of the rotation because the focus was on atrazine which is applied primarily to corn in this region in summary the data are not suited for the analysis of the long term effects of these cs as a whole on water quantity and quality however we can extend the usefulness of these data by estimating the effects of these cs using other means computer simulation models calibrated and validated with the available data are well suited for this type of inquiry the agricultural policy environmental extender apex wang et al 2012 simulates hydrologic and agronomic processes water movement biomass and crop growth and pollutant transport in fields farms and small to medium watersheds the model offers flexibility in terms of spatial discretization of the study area based on characteristics relevant to the modeling objectives i e soil properties topography and management for a field or subwatersheds for a larger watershed gassman et al 2010 it is also flexible in terms of

and management practices specification originally developed to simulate hydrologic processes that were not represented in either field scale models such as the environmental policy impact climate epic model williams et al 1984 or watershed models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 apex is particularly well suited to represent the cmrb research plots and account for the detailed management practices that have been recorded apex model calibration often relies on relatively short term datasets 6 years wang et al 2007 yin et al 2009 mudgal et al 2010 francesconi et al 2015 bhandari et al 2017 as few long term datasets exist it is understandable that only few studies can take advantage of longer calibration and validation datasets wang et al 2005 kumar et al 2011 plotkin et al 2013 senaviratne et al 2014 2018 nelson et al 2017b the 1991 2010 cmrb crop yield dataset and the measurement of crop yields by lp provide an opportunity to evaluate whether apex captures the spatial and temporal variability of crop yields on these plots the runoff and water quality dataset provides data needed to calibrate and validate the model for these outputs and then estimate the long term effects of these cs on water quality in this study the apex model was used to investigate how cs affect crop yields runoff and water quality on claypan soils specific objectives were to determine 1 the ability of apex to simulate the variability of corn and soybean yields on claypan soils 2 the ability of apex to simulate the transport of dissolved phase atrazine nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate phosphosrus po4 p on claypan soils via surface runoff and 3 how cs affect long term runoff and associated loss of atrazine no3 n and po4 p 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the field site consists of replicated plots with several cs treatments located just north of centralia missouri 39 13 48 n 92 07 14 w at the southwestern edge of goodwater creek experimental watershed fig 1 it lies in the central claypan region major land resource area 113 usda nrcs 2006 and based on detailed characterization by missouri cooperative soil survey personnel soils at the site were designated as typical upland claypan soils belonging to the adco mexico putnam association kitchen et al 1998 in 1991 30 large plots 189 m 18 m 0 34 ha were established to study long term effects of tillage rotation and other management decisions on productivity using the soil survey information and topographic maps the plots were established to encompass a catena sequence consisting of summit backslope and footslope positions soil series found at the site are adco silt loam fine smectitic mesic vertic albaqualfs with 0 to 1 slope at the summit position mexico silty clay loam fine smectitic mesic aeric vertic epiaqualfs with 1 to 3 slope at the backslope position and mexico silty clay loam or silt loam at the footslope position these claypan soils have an abrupt increase in clay content at depths that range from 5 cm at the backslope to 40 cm at the footslope on these plots among the management systems established in 1991 were three cs a minimum tilled corn soybean mtcs rotation a no till corn soybean ntcs rotation and a minimum till corn soybean wheat rotation with winter and summer cover crops in 1996 the latter one became a no till system no till corn soybean wheat rotation with winter and summer cover crops ntcsw in mtcs all inputs were broadcast applied and incorporated with a tillage operation immediately following the application in the no till systems phosphorus fertilizer and herbicides were broadcast applied but not incorporated nitrogen management was not entirely consistent throughout the period n fertilizer applied to corn was done by injection from 1996 to 2002 i e throughout the monitoring period afterwards it was broadcast without being incorporated fertilizer applied to wheat and cover crops was broadcast throughout the study the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three blocks i e replications where all rotation phases of each cs were present each year thus each 2 year rotation was implemented on six plots and the 3 year rotation was implemented on nine plots the three selected cs represented systems used during that period 1992 2010 to manage different kinds of risk in the claypan context the minimum tilled system represented the dominant copping system in the region and was expected to produce the highest grain yields the 2 year no till system was expected to decrease environmental and long term agronomic risk by decreasing erosion and sediment loss thus limiting soil degradation and improving water quality of downstream waters the 3 year no till system with cover crops was expected to further decrease environmental risks by ensuring ground cover throughout the year crediting potential n fixation from cover crops and relying on low rate pre emergence herbicides or post emergence herbicides based on weed pressure daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were derived from data collected at the weather station directly adjacent and east of the plots these variables were measured at sub hourly frequency and aggregated to a daily time step sadler et al 2015b described the monitoring equipment and data quality process surface runoff monitoring quantified flow and dissolved pollutant transport herbicides and nutrients from 1997 to 2002 runoff monitoring occurred only in the corn phase of each rotation and for only two of the three replicates this monitoring took place during the growing season equipment was installed as soon as possible after planting and removed immediately before harvest baffaut et al 2015 and lerch et al 2015a b described the monitoring infrastructure the chemical analysis methods the methods used to calculate daily loads and the discharge and water quality database grain yields were measured at harvest for each of the grain crops on all replicates cover crop yields or biomass in the ntcsw were not measured from 1991 1999 grain yields were measured separately for each lp using a weigh bin equipped combine yost et al 2016 afterwards the harvest combine was equipped with yield monitoring ability to collect continuous yield data processing of yield data produced mean yields for each lp 2 2 model representation of soils and agronomic management the plots under study were long 189 m and captured a catena of soils along a claypan soil landscape they were therefore not homogeneous in slope soil profile and soil properties within each plot mudgal et al 2012 showed that the claypan index depth to clay i e the distance between the soil surface and the first bt horizon divided by topographic slope was useful to identify sub plot areas that were most vulnerable to runoff sediment transport and atrazine transport original definition of the plots lps kitchen et al 1998 jung et al 2010 was based on topography and on site evaluation for this study a revised definition was developed based on the claypan index calculated at each of 30 points along each plot profile with 6 m separation the 50 m segment with the lowest mean claypan index was designated as the most critical area up to three additional segments were defined above and below this critical segment by finding the greatest difference of mean claypan index between each segment for each segment the depth to clay was set to the mean value for that segment soil properties had been measured during initial soil characterization in 1991 by lp for nine randomly selected plots three in each block before any cs was implemented on these plots jung et al 2008 2010 average soil properties were calculated for each horizon and each lp across the nine plots sampled one summary profile was developed for each lp based on horizonation and soil physical properties horizons that were identified only occasionally once or twice were not included in this summary profile the following parameters were specified into apex soil files by layer layer bottom depth texture clay sand and silt content ph carbon content and cec final soil profiles for each plot and lp were determined using the summary profiles obtained for each lp and the longitudinal profiles that give depth to clay for each lp of each plot the point of reference was the bt1 horizon which was set at the average depth to clay for each lp in each plot other horizons were shifted up or down while maintaining the depth of each soil layer for example if the summary profile indicated that the ae horizon started 137 mm above the bt1 horizon the top depth of the ae horizon was determined by subtracting 137 mm from the depth to clay identified at that plot for this lp if there was not enough soil to accommodate the summary profile the layers were thinned from the surface down in 2005 jiang et al 2007 measured hydraulic conductivity and bulk density of the soils by lp for three 10 cm samples 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 for the summit and backslope positions with a fourth depth 30 40 on the footslope position for 2 cs mtcs and ntcsw the 2005 analyses showed some significant alteration of hydraulic properties by cs jiang et al 2007 since dynamic evolution of bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity is not feasible in apex we used the 2005 values from the onset for the experiment from these data and the depth to clay at each lp of each plot we determined bulk density and hydraulic conductivity ksat above and in the claypan for each lp of mtcs and ntcsw since ntcs and ntcsw were both no till systems we assigned ntcsw hydraulic properties to the ntcs plots as well field capacity and wilting point water contents were not experimentally determined we utilized the apex option to dynamically i e for each simulation year estimate these values using the rawls method steglich and williams 2013 since we did not have any data for hydraulic properties of layers below the claypan we used those from the mexicosle ssurgo data soil survey staff usda nrcs 2018 management of the plots followed a protocol established in 1991 and modified in 1996 field notes were taken during all operations and recorded electronically afterwards in 2014 a thorough review of the management records highlighted missing ones which were then recreated using the best possible information all seeding tillage harvest and cover crop termination operations as well as pesticide and fertilizer applications were specified into apex management input files covering the 1996 2009 period with few exceptions when reseeding occurred because of poor germination only the latter one was included and applications of chemicals that we did not monitor e g glyphosate s metolachlor potassium were excluded lime applications were not included as we selected automatic lime applications as needed specification of tillage implements was based on the tillage depth and purpose specified for each tillage operation tillage efficiency fraction of soil and residues that are mixed was not recorded and we relied on the implement named in the plot management database e g disk cultivator soil finisher and the tillage purpose e g prepare seed bed break up clods incorporate herbicide to select a tillage implement from the apex tillage database commercial crops included corn and soybean on all the cs plus wheat on ntcsw or oats when wheat could not be planted the growing season length for the variety planted was sometimes but not always recorded and we used an average of the recorded values to estimate the potential heat units of these crops for the whole simulation period cover crops were usually a mixture of different grasses and legumes only the species that were included in the apex crop database were specified and simulated fertilizer specific n and p formulation was entered additives that affected compound release into the soil were not specified because their effect cannot be simulated with apex for ease of entering the information all n was entered as elemental n or ammonium n no organic fertilizer was applied to any cs during the study of all the chemicals applied for insect disease and weed control we focused on the fate and transport of only atrazine because of its lasting interest to stakeholders state and federal agencies chemical companies atrazine applications were therefore specified in the management files but we did not attempt to simulate weed or pest pressure as herbicides were applied at allowed rates or as needed to avoid possibilities of lower crop yields because of pests or weeds cover crops were always terminated before seeding the following crop with a burndown herbicide application a kill operation was entered three weeks after the herbicide application to give time for the chemical to act 2 3 apex modeling wang et al 2012 gave general recommendations for the calibration and validation of apex in an apex parameterization study baffaut et al 2017 and nelson et al 2017a applied apex to 12 missouri and kansas sites all characterized by soils with an argillic rich restrictive layer baffaut et al 2017 concluded that calibration against measured data was necessary to ensure good model performance for edge of field water quality however nelson et al 2017a defined a set of options and global input parameters that led to good model performance for edge of field runoff quantification which we used as our starting point this parameterization included the revised soil moisture index as the method to adjust the daily value of the retention parameter of the curve number the adjustment is a function of soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration and has been recommended for shallow soils that have low water storage capacity such as claypan soils williams et al 2012 santhi et al 2001 however early runs showed that against all expectations the method resulted in higher runoff for soils with higher ksat than with lower ksat values this was an important consideration since soil property measurements showed that claypan ksat for the no till systems was one order of magnitude greater than for the tilled system jiang et al 2007 thus we selected the method that adjusts the retention parameter based on soil moisture alone which resulted in runoff volumes consistent with ksat values other process equations were selected as recommended by nelson et al 2017a we then calibrated and validated the global model parameters against runoff and water quality data available from 1997 to 2002 the same land use number which controls the curve number was adopted for all cs row crops in straight rows and poor conditions previous studies in missouri and kansas have shown no significant differences in runoff volume between tilled and no till cs on restrictive layer soils at plot baffaut et al 2015 buckley et al 2010 ghidey et al 2005 or field scales ghidey et al 2010 2 4 model calibration and performance evaluation 2 4 1 calibration process for yields sensitivity analysis was conducted for corn and soybean yields separately using plots 19 and 13 fig 1 as representative of mtcs and ntcs to identify the most sensitive global parameters for crop yield during 1996 2009 although the simulation started in 1991 the management protocol was stable only from 1996 on and we selected 1991 1995 as model warmup years the one parameter at a time sensitivity analysis was automated with an in house program and crop yield sensitive parameters were then adjusted by trial and error based on percent differences in average corn and soybean yields for plots 13 for ntcs and 19 for mtcs from 1996 to 2009 after calibration model performance was assessed for crop yields across all the plots and lp based on average annual crop yields standard deviations of annual yields and differences between lp results were compared with the previously reported results of the measured crop yield statistical analysis yost et al 2016 2 4 2 calibration and validation process for flow and water quality discharge and water quality data for each cs were available at the two replicate plots that were in the corn phase of the rotation from 1997 to 2002 because apex is a daily time step model we combined daily runoff and pollutant transport of successive days when those belonged to the same event based on hydrograph dynamics these data were examined prior to calibration to evaluate obvious errors based on runoff amounts across all the plots size of the water sample relative to volume of runoff and differences between replicate plots large differences 100 between total event runoff or any of the constituent load for the two replicates were removed from the calibration and initial validation data sets for each cs one plot was selected for calibrating the model model validation used data from the replicate plot with the same rotation phase same events different plot and from the plots in the same cs with a different rotation phase different events different plots the measured data and simulated results for the plots in a different rotation phase were averaged before being used for model performance evaluation thus the validation dataset had both temporal and spatial elements after initial model performance evaluation to exclude gross errors in parameter values automated sensitivity analysis was conducted for runoff atrazine and dissolved nutrient loads using the same program as for crop yields selection of calibration parameters was based on the sensitivity of the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the regression slope and the mean square error to changes of global input parameters within a range of values that was consistent for the site calibration was conducted for each cs using paropt senaviratne et al 2013 a step wise multi objective multi variable automated method for the parameters selected after sensitivity analysis this parameter optimization process was customized to this study by including five successive steps for parameters that primarily affected 1 runoff 2 atrazine fate and transport 3 biological processes e g biological degradation 4 n fate and transport and 5 p fate and transport for each step the objective function combined nse r2 and regression slopes between the measured and simulated runoff event variables for discharge and unit area loads of atrazine no3 n and po4 p in runoff eq 1 senaviratne et al 2013 thus the objective function included information about the four variables at each step of the process 1 o b j θ i o 1 2 m e a n θ i o r v 2 x s l o p e v m e a n θ i o n s e v v 1 2 3 4 where obj the multi objective function for the i th iteration corresponds to i th set of parameters θ i and o corresponds to the observation vector of runoff atrazine no3 n and po4 p the objective function averaged r2 x slope and nse values over the four variables and calculated the mean between these two quantities senaviratne et al 2013 after each step the optimal values of the parameters considered in that step were used for the following step the above process resulted in an optimal parameter set for each cs these were analyzed for similarities and differences if a parameter value was common to all cs confidence in that value increased and we selected it as the final value parameters that had different values for at least one cs were included in a final automatic optimization with paropt for each cs all parameters were considered together no step wise process and results were analyzed manually to identify optimal values for each parameter and each cs given all the possible combinations of the other parameters considered parameters that had different values between the 3 cs were included in the uncertainty analysis for long term cs evaluation 2 4 3 model performance evaluation for runoff and water quality edge of field monitoring of runoff and water quality is difficult and many potential sources of error exist ranging from equipment accuracy equipment malfunction errors introduced during sample transport and analysis or changes in constituent concentration while the samples are in the field waiting to be collected while the monitoring and laboratory protocols were designed to reduce these errors baffaut et al 2015 lerch et al 2015a b the monitoring data still held some uncertainty performance for each calibration and validation dataset used qualitative scatter graphs of simulated results versus measured data and quantitative nse and percent bias pbias methods in order to take into account the uncertainty of the data and the random errors introduced by the replication threshold values of indicators for acceptable model performance were set as a function of pbias and nse values obtained for pairs of replicate plots since the replicate plot can be considered as the best physical model for that plot nearing 2000 nse and pbias values were calculated for measured data from each pair of replicate plots these values provided an upper benchmark against which to evaluate apex model performance as follows for each variable pbias and nse values were determined for each pair of replicates and average pbias and nse were calculated for each cs if up to 3 points caused these indicators to have very high for pbias or low for nse values pbias and nse values were re calculated without these points criteria for acceptable and good model performance were that pbias was twice the maximum average value the average value among the 3 cs rounded to the nearest multiple of five and nse was half the minimum average value the average value rounded to the nearest 0 05 2 5 cropping system long term evaluation in order to assess the long term effects of these tillage systems 1991 2009 simulations were run for each of the replicates at a monthly time step the 1991 1995 years were then excluded from result analysis to let unknown state variables at the beginning of the simulation reach meaningful values thus simulated results covered 14 years from 1996 to 2009 parameters that could not be restricted to one optimal value represented uncertainty about model parameterization which needed to be accounted for during cs evaluation the model was run for each combination of these parameter values for each replicate outputs runoff atrazine no3 n and po4 p were then averaged across all the replicates of the same cs for each month of the simulation and each model run in order to compare the effects of the cs as a whole 6 replicates for mtcs and ntcs 9 replicates for ntcsw averages obtained for each month of the simulation were then averaged across the 14 years to obtain average annual monthly outputs for each model run average annual values were also calculated common statistics summarized the distributions of these average annual monthly outputs across all the model runs minimum maximum mean and standard deviations for each month a confidence interval of the mean one standard deviation quantified uncertainties of the averages caused by the inability to constrain all the parameters to a single value differences between output variables for each cs were evaluated in light of these modeling uncertainties at the annual and monthly time step only when the expected change in average annual and average annual monthly output was greater than the uncertainty of these variables did we conclude that the cs had an effect on that variable 3 results and discussion 3 1 plot discretization and soil properties fig 2 shows the discretization outcome for plot 20 in most cases the toposequence of each plot included a summit shoulder backslope the critical area and a footslope however for plots 4 7 11 and 22 the backslope came in second position with a transition zone between it and the footslope for plots 12 and 25 only 3 positions were defined summit backslope and footslope with no transition between them at the top of the last four plots 27 30 slopes were either flat or sloped toward the east instead of westward thus the simulated areas were shorter than on the other plots and started at the beginning of the westward slope table 1 shows the values of soil hydraulic properties in the top soil and the claypan layers measured bulk densities in the no till systems were greater than or equal to those in mtcs jiang et al 2007 myers et al 2007 and were greater in the top soil than in the claypan layer except on the backslope of the no till systems table 1 similar observations have been found at adjacent as well as more distant sites with claypan soils seobi et al 2005 mudgal et al 2010 saturated hydraulic conductivities were also greater in the no till systems than in the minimum till system in both layers values in the claypan layer were all 1 mm h 1 except for the summit lp of the no till systems 3 2 crop yields for both crops average annual simulated mtcs yields were greater than measured table 2 negative bias while for the no till systems they were either smaller positive bias or very similar pbias 10 simulated corn and soybean yields were less affected by precipitation and temperature than measured ones fig 3 the 1999 and 2005 near or total mtcs corn failures caused by warm temperatures and very little precipitation were not simulated by apex which led to the overall strong negative bias without those two years mtcs corn yield bias was reduced to 15 corn crop pbias for ntcs and ntcsw and coefficients of determination between measured and simulated yields for all cs were within the range of acceptability wang et al 2012 and comparable to previously published crop yield simulation results mudgal et al 2012 senaviratne et al 2013 bhandari et al 2017 however soybean pbias and the coefficient of determination between measured and simulated annual yields indicated unsatisfactory results while simulated yields responded to environmental conditions temperature and precipitation in the same direction as measured yields fig 3 the temporal standard deviations of simulated yields were generally smaller than for measured yields table 2 spatial standard deviations of simulated yields across the three replicated plots were similar to those of the measured yields for mtcs and for the corn crop of ntcsw for ntcs and the soybean crop of ntcsw simulated spatial standard deviation was about half of the measured value thus apex did simulate some but not all of the observed plot to plot crop yield variability unaccounted spatial variability could be caused by differences in soil properties not accounted for in the model by crop yield random measurement errors or by misrepresented processes in the model when this experiment started in 1991 n management protocols called for lower n fertilizer application rates in the two no till systems 150 kg n ha 1 than in mtcs 190 kg n ha 1 in anticipation of slightly lower corn yields and or higher n fertilizer use efficiency for corn yields the statistical analysis performed by yost et al 2016 did not support a difference between measured corn yields from mtcs ntcs or ntcsw fig 4 thus no till systems proved to have an agronomic advantage as measured yields were similar or greater than in the minimum till system in spite of lower n inputs model results however showed that simulated corn and soybean yields were typically 30 and 20 lower for the two nt systems than for mtcs fig 4 the problem seemed to be over estimated mtcs yields and correct or under estimated no till yields as a result simulated mtcs yields were greater than ntcs ones the impact of lp also differed between measured and simulated yields for all cs footslope simulated yields were lower than on the summit and the backslope not shown something that was not found by yost et al 2016 on the other hand yost et al showed lower corn yields on the backslope for mtcs but apex results did not show any difference on the backslope compared to the summit not shown on ntcs lp did not affect measured yields yost et al 2016 but simulated results showed an effect of lp with greater simulated corn and soybean yields on the summit followed by the backslope and the footslope not shown in summary average corn yields over lp appeared to be well simulated for all cs table 2 while in comparison simulation of soybean yields was inferior greater bias and low r2 however if apex results were considered accurate they would lead to conclusions contrary to those obtained with measured yields with respect to the effect of cs and lp measured mtcs yields appeared to be strongly affected by water availability as the very low 1999 and 2005 corn yields and lower corn and soybean yields on the backslope demonstrate yost et al 2016 yet apex outputs showed that even in 1999 and 2005 the model considered that corn plant roots should have been able to capture moisture from practically the whole soil profile in spite of the claypan measured yields also showed that the no till systems provided an agronomic advantage with overall similar yields for mtcs and the no till systems and less spatial variability with no till the simulated results did not match the measurements plant growth in apex follows an algorithm in which potential growth is a function of heat units and crop parameters potential growth is then reduced to account for different stress factors factors that lowered simulated productivity in ntcs and ntcsw included increased water stress 30 more than for mtcs and soil strength stress 15 more there was also more temperature stress for corn but not for soybean in spite of lower n application rates in the no till systems fertilization was sufficient to avoid any n stress averaging less than 1 day per year on average for any of the cs no other stress p aluminum toxicity excess moisture and salinity had any impact thus we conclude that water availability soil strength and temperature caused lower simulated yields in the no till systems for crop yield calibration we adjusted the p2 parameter following recommendations by wang et al 2012 the p2 parameter is a global parameter that controls the effect of bulk density on soil strength which limits root weight growth potential for each cs and lp soil properties that affect water stress were either assigned measured values bulk density ksat or they were calculated by apex field capacity and wilting point it could be possible that apex calculation of field capacity and wilting point was not accurately reflecting the effect of tillage on these properties leading to the difference in simulated yields alternatively the interaction of the p2 parameter with measured bulk densities may also have caused this difference as indicated earlier measured bulk densities in the no till systems were greater than or equal to those in mtcs and were greater in the top soil than in the claypan layer except on the backslope of the no till systems table 1 these measured bulk density values and the adjusted value of p2 1 0 led to more simulated bulk density stress on root growth in the top soil layer than in the claypan which is contradictory to measured root growth by myers et al 2007 namely that root density of mature plants is normal in the top soil layer very small in the claypan and resumes below the claypan similarly with a higher bulk density in the top soil layer at the footslope there was more simulated soil strength stress and lower simulated crop yields there than on the backslope and summit finally greater bulk density for the no till systems resulted in additional simulated stress and lower yields for these systems adjustment of the p2 parameter was necessary to obtain acceptable average plot yields but created inconsistencies in the yield variations with lp and cs additional research is needed to better understand the processes that cause spatial variability of crop yields in claypan soils and the determination of the p2 parameter in spite of this limitation the effects of these cs on water quantity and quality were analyzed runoff and pollutant transport processes were calibrated using data collected during the corn phase of the rotation the only available runoff and water quality data for which crop yield model performance was better and acceptable according to published standards wang et al 2012 for modeling studies data from one single cs are often the only available data used to calibrate the model which is then used to estimate the effect of other cs 3 3 number of events used for flow and water quality calibration and validation the number of events used for model calibration and initial evaluation ranged from 9 calibration of mtcs and ntcsw models to 16 validation of mtcs model table 3 these numbers are rather small for model calibration and validation however we calibrated the model simultaneously for runoff atrazine no3 n and po4 p and used information from the 3 cs to further constrain the parameter space thus what was not available in number of events was compensated by the variety of the processes involved in the fate and transport of multiple constituents under different cs 3 4 performance evaluation criteria for runoff and water quality there were significant event runoff and constituent load differences between the replicates ranging from 3 to 28 for runoff 5 49 for atrazine 12 68 for no3 n and 8 82 for po4 p these differences are within the range of typical uncertainties 6 29 for runoff 8 69 for no3 n and 11 104 for po4 p according to harmel et al 2006 corresponding nse values hovered around 0 9 for runoff for all cs but were lower and inconsistent for atrazine and nutrients ranging from 0 44 to 0 67 for atrazine 0 39 to 0 78 for no3 n and from 0 41 to 0 88 for po4 p table 4 runoff measured from the different replicates was similar with the largest differences 18 being obtained for ntcs however differences increased for water quality constituents up to 35 for atrazine 34 for no3 n and 51 for po4 p the resulting performance evaluation criteria for acceptable and good model performance for runoff were slightly lower but close to values proposed by others asabe 2017 for nutrients these resulting performance criteria suggest a lower standard than proposed by others however these reflect the reality of monitoring water quality under field conditions and the limitations of how well discrete flow based sample collection of runoff represents the temporal dynamics in dissolved constituent concentrations differences between replicates also occurred because of variations in the timing of runoff initiation and therefore subsequent water collection further water suction into the sample container can vary during runoff events due to the effect of turbulent conditions in the intake line bends in the line crop residue and or sediment blockage in the flume and bubbles in the system if the suction was not successful the sampler was programmed to purge the line and try again the resulting differences in sampling timing can amount to several minutes and given the highly dynamic nature of some of these events likely affected the amount of constituent collected these differences between replicates runoff and contaminant loadings emphasize the uncertainty of the measured amounts in this dataset and force us to use less stringent performance standards 3 5 runoff and water quality calibration table 5 presents the final values of all performance indicators obtained for each of the four output variables and each of the three cs after calibration and validation of the apex model apex performed well for runoff across the 3 cs with r2 and nse exceeding 0 7 and a maximum pbias of 29 the performance was acceptable for all cs and exceeded our performance criteria on the validation datasets for water quality constituents performance was usually acceptable except for po4 p on mtcs atrazine on ntcs and no3 n on ntcsw uncertainty of the measured data was a factor in poor performance even though the calibration and validation data sets included only events for which measured runoff and loads differed by less than 100 between replicated plots differences in measured amounts are likely to have affected the calibration and the model performance average differences of total measured amounts between replicated plots of each cs reached 7 25 for runoff 5 80 for atrazine 14 46 for no3 n and 16 48 for po4 p in contrast average differences of simulated amounts were much smaller 2 3 for runoff 2 14 for atrazine 1 14 for no3 n and 1 20 for po4 p the differences in simulated amounts for replicated plots reflect what we knew about the physical characteristics of these plots longitudinal slope profile and depth to clay along the hillslope differences in measured amounts reflect these differences as well however they also reflect measurement errors as well as anything that we did not know differed between the replicated plots estimates of po4 p were too high compared to the measured loads in the mtcs calibration dataset plot 19 in spite of a good correlation between simulated and measured loads r2 0 82 results were satisfactory for the validation dataset and for all the ntcs and ntcsw datasets while all the cumulative simulated amounts for the mtcs datasets were in the range of 380 440 g ha 1 only two of the plots had measured p transport in that range plots 22 and 11 both of which were part of the validation datasets the two other plots had measured cumulative p transport of 260 270 g ha 1 plot 19 which was used for calibration and plot 23 which was used for validation it is not clear what would explain such behavior it cannot be attributed to one event as event loads from replicate plots were well correlated r2 0 75 the difference was systematic but the cause was unclear estimates of no3 n did meet performance criteria for mtcs and ntcs but not for ntcsw however two events were suspicious a july 2001 event for which measured no3 n load estimates were high despite the absence of a record for nitrogen application prior to that time and a june 1998 event for which there was an unexpectedly low number of samples given the event size when we removed these two events performance values improved r2 0 34 nse 0 07 pbias 21 performance values for the corresponding validation dataset did not meet the performance criteria because of the nse value being right under the threshold performance for atrazine was good across all cs except for the ntcs validation dataset we do not have explanations for this other than the fact that estimates of measured atrazine loads from the ntcs calibration plot plot 18 were 55 greater than those from the replicate plot this may have affected the adjustment of atrazine related parameters and produced the poor performance with the validation dataset the bias on validation results was 53 which is of the same magnitude as the difference between the two replicate plots however atrazine simulation was acceptable for all the other cs 3 6 final parameters parameters selected after sensitivity analysis for optimization are shown in table 6 the same parameters were investigated with the same range of possible values for all cs for many parameters final values were the same for the three cs indicating that their value was not affected by the cs however values appeared to be affected by the cs for 16 parameters table 6 interestingly values were always the same for at least two cs and the cs that had a different parameter value was not always the same other sediment parameters i e parameters 18 19 and 47 are important because they affect the transport of nutrients and chemicals adsorbed to soil particles however in the absence of sediment related data these parameters could not be calibrated and we fixed their value to values that worked well for an adjacent field that did have sediment data i e p18 1 5 p19 0 014 and p47 1 0 unpublished data it is difficult to justify different parameter values for different cs on plots that are adjacent to each other and for which topography and soil properties differences are minimal modelers certainly make the assumption that there are no differences when they use crop growth or water quality simulation models to investigate the effects of management on crop yields water movement and water quality finding different parameters for different cs has been encountered before bhandari et al 2017 but it remains an impediment to greater confidence in computer simulation models when simulating management alternatives to a baseline scenario thus we conducted a second round of optimization that included the 14 parameters for which optimal values differed for one cs after the first round after analysis of the calibration and validation results revealed that two events of the ntcsw calibration dataset were particularly suspicious june 1998 and july 2001 as discussed earlier a third round of optimization was conducted for ntcsw without these two events results were consistent with the second round and allowed a more definite determination of parameter values for ntcsw table 7 for seven parameters i e p4 p8 p16 p17 p29 p31 p70 model performance was clearly superior with one specific value for at least one cs and was included in the range of values that was satisfactory for the other two in these cases we selected the single value as the value for the three cs values for three parameters p28 p46 and p84 could not be further restricted by comparison of the water quality data with simulated results so the same range of values was used this could be caused by uncertainties in the data or the inability of these data to describe processes that are affected by these parameters the remaining four parameters p14 p20 p24 and p34 had different values for different cs for p34 we concluded that we could not identify one optimal value and included the range of values as is for p20 and p24 the calibration data constrained the parameter value to a narrow range which we retained for p14 which is the nitrogen leaching ratio i e the ratio of no3 n concentration in surface runoff relative to that in percolate a value of 0 8 was clearly superior for mtcs while 0 2 did not work at all and the reverse was true for the two no till systems this was consistent with n fertilizer placement during the monitoring period broadcast application and incorporation in mtcs left more fertilizer on and near the surface than when injected as in ntcs and ntcsw 3 7 cropping system long term effects on water quality table 8 presents the long term 1996 2009 average annual estimates of runoff and atrazine and nutrient loss along with the mean values we show their uncertainty which is derived from the uncertainty of the eight parameters for which no single value was determined and the simulated change in mean value between each of the no till systems and mtcs for runoff the changes in long term average annual runoff were within a few percent from what was obtained for mtcs which was smaller than the modeling uncertainty thus we conclude that runoff from these plots was not affected by the cs which is consistent with the measured data baffaut et al 2015 in term of water quality ntcs atrazine losses increased compared to mtcs three times the modeling uncertainty ntcsw losses were comparable to those from mtcs as the change was less than the modeling uncertainty ntcs results confirm other studies that the lack of incorporation of atrazine increases losses of these inputs on clay soils for which runoff is not reduced by no till practices lerch et al 2013 verbree et al 2010 zeimen et al 2006 these results reflect previous field studies that documented the trade off between the erosion control benefits of no till and the water quality benefits of atrazine incorporation for restrictive layer soils ghidey et al 2005 2010 lerch et al 2013 the bulk of atrazine loss occurred in june fig 5 when the largest storms occurred within the 60 day window after application atrazine was typically applied before seeding corn either in may or june exceptions included a few late april or very early july applications consequently atrazine losses in june were 100 and 40 greater for ntcs and ntcsw respectively than for mtcs we attribute the lower losses for ntcsw than for ntcs to two factors 1 atrazine was applied only once every three years in ntcsw instead of every other year in ntcs and 2 as a split application that depended on weed pressure in ntcsw simulated values and measured data from events that directly followed atrazine application indicated comparable losses from ntcsw and ntcs when atrazine was applied at the same time and the same rate but many years the second application did not happen thus decreasing the total amount applied over the long term and assessed for the whole cs and not for single events or for one crop these two factors appeared to mitigate the effect of no till on atrazine losses simulated results for no3 n showed lower surface runoff losses for ntcs and ntcsw both decreases were greater than the modeling uncertainty n management in the no till systems differed from that in mtcs in the three key ways that affected transport 1 lower n fertilizer rates 150 versus 190 kg ha 1 2 differences in n fertilizer placement injected versus broadcast and incorporated and 3 timing of n fertilizer applications more temporally varied for ntcsw than for mtcs with less being applied in may and june and some in july for corn and fall and early spring for wheat these differences explain the reductions in simulated n losses by surface runoff other n pathways increased of those simulated leaching denitrification and volatilization were the most affected by the differences in n fertilizer management simulated percolation of n tripled from mtcs to ntcs because of the increase of percolation caused by greater ksat values the injection of n fertilizer rather than incorporation by tillage and the difference in nitrogen leaching ratio the increase of ksat resulted in more simulated percolation in ntcs and ntcsw than in mtcs 8 and 10 of precipitation respectively vs 3 however the presence of cover crops seemed to mitigate increased simulated losses of n via leaching possibly because of residual n uptake by the cover crops simulated denitrification and volatilization were also significant pathways for n loss accounting for 20 25 of applied n given that apex was not calibrated for leaching volatilization or denitrification we should be cautious with these results yet no3 n does find a way to leach through the soil in spite of very low hydraulic conductivities while kitchen et al 1998 showed 10 15 of applied n leaching over 2 years at the summit position of the plots they also showed high variability between the plots which was linked to intrinsic soil properties that control water movement al qudah et al 2016 showed that groundwater under claypan soils was unexpectedly susceptible to no3 n contamination and demonstrated that preferential flow and sub soil hydraulic conductivity controlled that leaching however whether apex simulated these processes correctly was beyond the scope of this study in addition the lack of measured sediment data impaired our ability to calibrate the model for organic n adsorbed to transported soil particles and thus we do not report the corresponding results nevertheless no till should have reduced the transport of organic n associated with sediment loss while simulated average annual po4 p losses for ntcs were greater than for mtcs and double for the month of june alone po4 p losses from ntcsw were very similar to those of mtcs with expected changes well below the modeling uncertainties for each month of the year average annual p fertilizer amounts were very similar for all the cs 48 kg ha 1 for mtcs and ntcs and 41 kg ha 1 for ntcsw however only 2 3 of the average annual p was applied during the high rainfall months march through june as a result of corn being grown only once every three years and p being applied at a rate that supplied the required amount for the corn and soybean crops the balance was applied when wheat was seeded in october a month with typically low rainfall as for n no till should have reduced sediment loss and associated p adsorbed to soil particles but we do not report the corresponding results because of the lack of data to calibrate sediment transport processes 4 conclusions long term apex simulation of three cropping systems on replicated large plots in the context of claypan soils showed that in spite of satisfactory model performance for corn yields and acceptable percent bias for soybean yields the model was not capable of simulating the effects of management or landscape position on crop yields the spatial and temporal variability of corn and soybean yields were also under estimated we suspected that the cause may be the interaction between soil bulk density and root growth stress in the different layers of a soil with a claypan layer as a result the model indicated that no till yields would be smaller than those from a minimum tillage system when measured yields showed no such difference this research highlights the need for further research in this area as inconsistent crop yield results undermine the usefulness of the model for making recommendations about management in spite of this limitation with yields model performance was very good for runoff when parameterized using data from the corn phase of each cropping system the research showed that simulation of water quality constituents still remains difficult model calibration and validation was mostly satisfactory for atrazine no3 n and po4 p but was poor for some combinations of constituent and calibration or validation data sets long term simulation of these three cropping systems along with uncertainty analysis indicated that the 3 year csw rotation and associated fertilizer management provides the most benefits to water quality by reducing nutrient transport in runoff although losses of atrazine were similar for the corn phase of the no till systems and greater than mtcs the ntcsw system does not increase overall atrazine losses since it is applied only once every three years thus ntcsw appeared to be able to mitigate the negative effects of no till on the surface transport of non incorporated dissolved chemicals a key benefit of the 3 year rotation was improved n and p fertilizer management in terms of slight rate reductions improved n fertilizer placement and changes in application timing to less vulnerable periods of the year another benefit included the presence of cover crops to promote et and residual n uptake to reduce nitrate leaching compared to the 2 year no till system overall the long term simulations support the concept of stacking practices such as lower chemical inputs improved fertilizer management longer crop rotations and use of cover crops to achieve desired environmental and production goals 
11159,evaluation of the sustainability of grain production systems requires knowledge of long term crop yields and edge of field runoff volumes and water quality when measured data are limited computer simulation models calibrated and validated with the available data are well suited for this type of inquiry in this study the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model was used to investigate how management affects crop yields runoff volume and water quality on claypan soils specific objectives were to determine the ability of apex to simulate the variability of corn and soybean yields on claypan soils and the transport of dissolved phase atrazine and nutrients via surface runoff and how management affects long term runoff and associated loss of these constituents in spite of satisfactory model performance for corn yields and acceptable relative differences for soybean yields the model was not capable of simulating the effects of management or landscape position on crop yields model performance was very good for runoff and mostly satisfactory for dissolved constituents long term simulation along with uncertainty analysis indicated that a no till 3 year corn soybean wheat rotation with cover crops provides the most benefits to water quality by reducing nutrient transport in runoff this system appeared to mitigate the negative effects of no till on the surface transport of non incorporated dissolved chemicals because of improved fertilizer management in terms of rate placement and timing of application cover crops appeared to reduce nitrate leaching compared to a 2 year no till system this research highlights the need for further research in crop growth modeling as inconsistent crop yield results undermine the usefulness of the model for making recommendations about management overall the long term simulations support the concept of multiple practices addressing tillage fertilizer management longer crop rotations and use of cover crops to achieve desired environmental and production goals keywords model simulation apex cover crops no till claypan 1 introduction long term sustainability of agricultural systems includes goals of productivity to meet the food fuel and fiber demand but also of economic environmental and social integrity robertson et al 2008 to that end the usda initiated the long term agro ecosystem research ltar network with the goal of ensuring sustainability of agricultural systems at multiple spatial and temporal scales in the face of trends such as land use change and climate variability walbridge and shafer 2011 one component of ltar is the common experiment a long term contrast of innovative agricultural systems that optimize productivity ecosystem services and adaptability to climate variability with the regional conventional systems the common experiment relies in part on replicated plot experiments that compare productivity and eco system services of various agricultural systems the goals of the common experiment are to develop and evaluate sustainable agricultural systems that balance productivity and environmental impacts steiner et al 2016 the central mississippi river basin cmrb site of the ltar network is located in north central missouri claypan soils give the region unique hydrologic features that affect agricultural production and its environmental effects sadler et al 2015a document the establishment of the cmrb site provide an overview and describe available data the current ltar research infrastructure builds upon previous long term research 1991 2010 conducted on large replicated plots 0 34 ha that have been established to study and compare diverse agricultural systems including grain cropping systems cs and grass systems previous findings from this large plot long term study include 1 a strong linkage between landscape position lp and depth to the claypan 2 significant differences by lp and cs in soil properties jung et al 2007 jiang et al 2007 jung et al 2008 2010 and in soil fertility conway et al 2018 3 improved soil quality and ecosystem services in conservation cs chaudhary et al 2012 veum et al 2015 conway et al 2018 4 increased pesticide loss via surface runoff in no till systems ghidey et al 2005 mudgal et al 2010 and nitrogen loss through denitrification kitchen et al 1998 compared to tilled cs and 5 similar crop productivity but greater yield stability and reduced yield variability in conservation cs than in conventional systems on these soils yost et al 2016 while crop yield data cover the whole 1991 2010 period past water quality data are limited in duration and in scope during this period water quality monitoring was limited to 1997 2002 ghidey et al 2005 which did not include years of extreme drought 1992 2005 and rain 2008 2010 the monitoring focused on the growing season and did not include winter periods which can be a time of considerable nutrient losses additionally it was limited to the corn phase of the rotation because the focus was on atrazine which is applied primarily to corn in this region in summary the data are not suited for the analysis of the long term effects of these cs as a whole on water quantity and quality however we can extend the usefulness of these data by estimating the effects of these cs using other means computer simulation models calibrated and validated with the available data are well suited for this type of inquiry the agricultural policy environmental extender apex wang et al 2012 simulates hydrologic and agronomic processes water movement biomass and crop growth and pollutant transport in fields farms and small to medium watersheds the model offers flexibility in terms of spatial discretization of the study area based on characteristics relevant to the modeling objectives i e soil properties topography and management for a field or subwatersheds for a larger watershed gassman et al 2010 it is also flexible in terms of agricultural management specifications examples of apex used at plot and small field scale 5 ha are numerous wang et al 2005 williams et al 2006 wang et al 2007 yin et al 2009 mudgal et al 2010 kumar et al 2011 plotkin et al 2013 senaviratne et al 2014 2018 francesconi et al 2015 bhandari et al 2017 ford et al 2017 and demonstrate the versatility of the model in terms of landscape representation and management practices specification originally developed to simulate hydrologic processes that were not represented in either field scale models such as the environmental policy impact climate epic model williams et al 1984 or watershed models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 apex is particularly well suited to represent the cmrb research plots and account for the detailed management practices that have been recorded apex model calibration often relies on relatively short term datasets 6 years wang et al 2007 yin et al 2009 mudgal et al 2010 francesconi et al 2015 bhandari et al 2017 as few long term datasets exist it is understandable that only few studies can take advantage of longer calibration and validation datasets wang et al 2005 kumar et al 2011 plotkin et al 2013 senaviratne et al 2014 2018 nelson et al 2017b the 1991 2010 cmrb crop yield dataset and the measurement of crop yields by lp provide an opportunity to evaluate whether apex captures the spatial and temporal variability of crop yields on these plots the runoff and water quality dataset provides data needed to calibrate and validate the model for these outputs and then estimate the long term effects of these cs on water quality in this study the apex model was used to investigate how cs affect crop yields runoff and water quality on claypan soils specific objectives were to determine 1 the ability of apex to simulate the variability of corn and soybean yields on claypan soils 2 the ability of apex to simulate the transport of dissolved phase atrazine nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate phosphosrus po4 p on claypan soils via surface runoff and 3 how cs affect long term runoff and associated loss of atrazine no3 n and po4 p 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the field site consists of replicated plots with several cs treatments located just north of centralia missouri 39 13 48 n 92 07 14 w at the southwestern edge of goodwater creek experimental watershed fig 1 it lies in the central claypan region major land resource area 113 usda nrcs 2006 and based on detailed characterization by missouri cooperative soil survey personnel soils at the site were designated as typical upland claypan soils belonging to the adco mexico putnam association kitchen et al 1998 in 1991 30 large plots 189 m 18 m 0 34 ha were established to study long term effects of tillage rotation and other management decisions on productivity using the soil survey information and topographic maps the plots were established to encompass a catena sequence consisting of summit backslope and footslope positions soil series found at the site are adco silt loam fine smectitic mesic vertic albaqualfs with 0 to 1 slope at the summit position mexico silty clay loam fine smectitic mesic aeric vertic epiaqualfs with 1 to 3 slope at the backslope position and mexico silty clay loam or silt loam at the footslope position these claypan soils have an abrupt increase in clay content at depths that range from 5 cm at the backslope to 40 cm at the footslope on these plots among the management systems established in 1991 were three cs a minimum tilled corn soybean mtcs rotation a no till corn soybean ntcs rotation and a minimum till corn soybean wheat rotation with winter and summer cover crops in 1996 the latter one became a no till system no till corn soybean wheat rotation with winter and summer cover crops ntcsw in mtcs all inputs were broadcast applied and incorporated with a tillage operation immediately following the application in the no till systems phosphorus fertilizer and herbicides were broadcast applied but not incorporated nitrogen management was not entirely consistent throughout the period n fertilizer applied to corn was done by injection from 1996 to 2002 i e throughout the monitoring period afterwards it was broadcast without being incorporated fertilizer applied to wheat and cover crops was broadcast throughout the study the experimental design was a randomized complete block with three blocks i e replications where all rotation phases of each cs were present each year thus each 2 year rotation was implemented on six plots and the 3 year rotation was implemented on nine plots the three selected cs represented systems used during that period 1992 2010 to manage different kinds of risk in the claypan context the minimum tilled system represented the dominant copping system in the region and was expected to produce the highest grain yields the 2 year no till system was expected to decrease environmental and long term agronomic risk by decreasing erosion and sediment loss thus limiting soil degradation and improving water quality of downstream waters the 3 year no till system with cover crops was expected to further decrease environmental risks by ensuring ground cover throughout the year crediting potential n fixation from cover crops and relying on low rate pre emergence herbicides or post emergence herbicides based on weed pressure daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were derived from data collected at the weather station directly adjacent and east of the plots these variables were measured at sub hourly frequency and aggregated to a daily time step sadler et al 2015b described the monitoring equipment and data quality process surface runoff monitoring quantified flow and dissolved pollutant transport herbicides and nutrients from 1997 to 2002 runoff monitoring occurred only in the corn phase of each rotation and for only two of the three replicates this monitoring took place during the growing season equipment was installed as soon as possible after planting and removed immediately before harvest baffaut et al 2015 and lerch et al 2015a b described the monitoring infrastructure the chemical analysis methods the methods used to calculate daily loads and the discharge and water quality database grain yields were measured at harvest for each of the grain crops on all replicates cover crop yields or biomass in the ntcsw were not measured from 1991 1999 grain yields were measured separately for each lp using a weigh bin equipped combine yost et al 2016 afterwards the harvest combine was equipped with yield monitoring ability to collect continuous yield data processing of yield data produced mean yields for each lp 2 2 model representation of soils and agronomic management the plots under study were long 189 m and captured a catena of soils along a claypan soil landscape they were therefore not homogeneous in slope soil profile and soil properties within each plot mudgal et al 2012 showed that the claypan index depth to clay i e the distance between the soil surface and the first bt horizon divided by topographic slope was useful to identify sub plot areas that were most vulnerable to runoff sediment transport and atrazine transport original definition of the plots lps kitchen et al 1998 jung et al 2010 was based on topography and on site evaluation for this study a revised definition was developed based on the claypan index calculated at each of 30 points along each plot profile with 6 m separation the 50 m segment with the lowest mean claypan index was designated as the most critical area up to three additional segments were defined above and below this critical segment by finding the greatest difference of mean claypan index between each segment for each segment the depth to clay was set to the mean value for that segment soil properties had been measured during initial soil characterization in 1991 by lp for nine randomly selected plots three in each block before any cs was implemented on these plots jung et al 2008 2010 average soil properties were calculated for each horizon and each lp across the nine plots sampled one summary profile was developed for each lp based on horizonation and soil physical properties horizons that were identified only occasionally once or twice were not included in this summary profile the following parameters were specified into apex soil files by layer layer bottom depth texture clay sand and silt content ph carbon content and cec final soil profiles for each plot and lp were determined using the summary profiles obtained for each lp and the longitudinal profiles that give depth to clay for each lp of each plot the point of reference was the bt1 horizon which was set at the average depth to clay for each lp in each plot other horizons were shifted up or down while maintaining the depth of each soil layer for example if the summary profile indicated that the ae horizon started 137 mm above the bt1 horizon the top depth of the ae horizon was determined by subtracting 137 mm from the depth to clay identified at that plot for this lp if there was not enough soil to accommodate the summary profile the layers were thinned from the surface down in 2005 jiang et al 2007 measured hydraulic conductivity and bulk density of the soils by lp for three 10 cm samples 0 10 10 20 and 20 30 for the summit and backslope positions with a fourth depth 30 40 on the footslope position for 2 cs mtcs and ntcsw the 2005 analyses showed some significant alteration of hydraulic properties by cs jiang et al 2007 since dynamic evolution of bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity is not feasible in apex we used the 2005 values from the onset for the experiment from these data and the depth to clay at each lp of each plot we determined bulk density and hydraulic conductivity ksat above and in the claypan for each lp of mtcs and ntcsw since ntcs and ntcsw were both no till systems we assigned ntcsw hydraulic properties to the ntcs plots as well field capacity and wilting point water contents were not experimentally determined we utilized the apex option to dynamically i e for each simulation year estimate these values using the rawls method steglich and williams 2013 since we did not have any data for hydraulic properties of layers below the claypan we used those from the mexicosle ssurgo data soil survey staff usda nrcs 2018 management of the plots followed a protocol established in 1991 and modified in 1996 field notes were taken during all operations and recorded electronically afterwards in 2014 a thorough review of the management records highlighted missing ones which were then recreated using the best possible information all seeding tillage harvest and cover crop termination operations as well as pesticide and fertilizer applications were specified into apex management input files covering the 1996 2009 period with few exceptions when reseeding occurred because of poor germination only the latter one was included and applications of chemicals that we did not monitor e g glyphosate s metolachlor potassium were excluded lime applications were not included as we selected automatic lime applications as needed specification of tillage implements was based on the tillage depth and purpose specified for each tillage operation tillage efficiency fraction of soil and residues that are mixed was not recorded and we relied on the implement named in the plot management database e g disk cultivator soil finisher and the tillage purpose e g prepare seed bed break up clods incorporate herbicide to select a tillage implement from the apex tillage database commercial crops included corn and soybean on all the cs plus wheat on ntcsw or oats when wheat could not be planted the growing season length for the variety planted was sometimes but not always recorded and we used an average of the recorded values to estimate the potential heat units of these crops for the whole simulation period cover crops were usually a mixture of different grasses and legumes only the species that were included in the apex crop database were specified and simulated fertilizer specific n and p formulation was entered additives that affected compound release into the soil were not specified because their effect cannot be simulated with apex for ease of entering the information all n was entered as elemental n or ammonium n no organic fertilizer was applied to any cs during the study of all the chemicals applied for insect disease and weed control we focused on the fate and transport of only atrazine because of its lasting interest to stakeholders state and federal agencies chemical companies atrazine applications were therefore specified in the management files but we did not attempt to simulate weed or pest pressure as herbicides were applied at allowed rates or as needed to avoid possibilities of lower crop yields because of pests or weeds cover crops were always terminated before seeding the following crop with a burndown herbicide application a kill operation was entered three weeks after the herbicide application to give time for the chemical to act 2 3 apex modeling wang et al 2012 gave general recommendations for the calibration and validation of apex in an apex parameterization study baffaut et al 2017 and nelson et al 2017a applied apex to 12 missouri and kansas sites all characterized by soils with an argillic rich restrictive layer baffaut et al 2017 concluded that calibration against measured data was necessary to ensure good model performance for edge of field water quality however nelson et al 2017a defined a set of options and global input parameters that led to good model performance for edge of field runoff quantification which we used as our starting point this parameterization included the revised soil moisture index as the method to adjust the daily value of the retention parameter of the curve number the adjustment is a function of soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration and has been recommended for shallow soils that have low water storage capacity such as claypan soils williams et al 2012 santhi et al 2001 however early runs showed that against all expectations the method resulted in higher runoff for soils with higher ksat than with lower ksat values this was an important consideration since soil property measurements showed that claypan ksat for the no till systems was one order of magnitude greater than for the tilled system jiang et al 2007 thus we selected the method that adjusts the retention parameter based on soil moisture alone which resulted in runoff volumes consistent with ksat values other process equations were selected as recommended by nelson et al 2017a we then calibrated and validated the global model parameters against runoff and water quality data available from 1997 to 2002 the same land use number which controls the curve number was adopted for all cs row crops in straight rows and poor conditions previous studies in missouri and kansas have shown no significant differences in runoff volume between tilled and no till cs on restrictive layer soils at plot baffaut et al 2015 buckley et al 2010 ghidey et al 2005 or field scales ghidey et al 2010 2 4 model calibration and performance evaluation 2 4 1 calibration process for yields sensitivity analysis was conducted for corn and soybean yields separately using plots 19 and 13 fig 1 as representative of mtcs and ntcs to identify the most sensitive global parameters for crop yield during 1996 2009 although the simulation started in 1991 the management protocol was stable only from 1996 on and we selected 1991 1995 as model warmup years the one parameter at a time sensitivity analysis was automated with an in house program and crop yield sensitive parameters were then adjusted by trial and error based on percent differences in average corn and soybean yields for plots 13 for ntcs and 19 for mtcs from 1996 to 2009 after calibration model performance was assessed for crop yields across all the plots and lp based on average annual crop yields standard deviations of annual yields and differences between lp results were compared with the previously reported results of the measured crop yield statistical analysis yost et al 2016 2 4 2 calibration and validation process for flow and water quality discharge and water quality data for each cs were available at the two replicate plots that were in the corn phase of the rotation from 1997 to 2002 because apex is a daily time step model we combined daily runoff and pollutant transport of successive days when those belonged to the same event based on hydrograph dynamics these data were examined prior to calibration to evaluate obvious errors based on runoff amounts across all the plots size of the water sample relative to volume of runoff and differences between replicate plots large differences 100 between total event runoff or any of the constituent load for the two replicates were removed from the calibration and initial validation data sets for each cs one plot was selected for calibrating the model model validation used data from the replicate plot with the same rotation phase same events different plot and from the plots in the same cs with a different rotation phase different events different plots the measured data and simulated results for the plots in a different rotation phase were averaged before being used for model performance evaluation thus the validation dataset had both temporal and spatial elements after initial model performance evaluation to exclude gross errors in parameter values automated sensitivity analysis was conducted for runoff atrazine and dissolved nutrient loads using the same program as for crop yields selection of calibration parameters was based on the sensitivity of the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the regression slope and the mean square error to changes of global input parameters within a range of values that was consistent for the site calibration was conducted for each cs using paropt senaviratne et al 2013 a step wise multi objective multi variable automated method for the parameters selected after sensitivity analysis this parameter optimization process was customized to this study by including five successive steps for parameters that primarily affected 1 runoff 2 atrazine fate and transport 3 biological processes e g biological degradation 4 n fate and transport and 5 p fate and transport for each step the objective function combined nse r2 and regression slopes between the measured and simulated runoff event variables for discharge and unit area loads of atrazine no3 n and po4 p in runoff eq 1 senaviratne et al 2013 thus the objective function included information about the four variables at each step of the process 1 o b j θ i o 1 2 m e a n θ i o r v 2 x s l o p e v m e a n θ i o n s e v v 1 2 3 4 where obj the multi objective function for the i th iteration corresponds to i th set of parameters θ i and o corresponds to the observation vector of runoff atrazine no3 n and po4 p the objective function averaged r2 x slope and nse values over the four variables and calculated the mean between these two quantities senaviratne et al 2013 after each step the optimal values of the parameters considered in that step were used for the following step the above process resulted in an optimal parameter set for each cs these were analyzed for similarities and differences if a parameter value was common to all cs confidence in that value increased and we selected it as the final value parameters that had different values for at least one cs were included in a final automatic optimization with paropt for each cs all parameters were considered together no step wise process and results were analyzed manually to identify optimal values for each parameter and each cs given all the possible combinations of the other parameters considered parameters that had different values between the 3 cs were included in the uncertainty analysis for long term cs evaluation 2 4 3 model performance evaluation for runoff and water quality edge of field monitoring of runoff and water quality is difficult and many potential sources of error exist ranging from equipment accuracy equipment malfunction errors introduced during sample transport and analysis or changes in constituent concentration while the samples are in the field waiting to be collected while the monitoring and laboratory protocols were designed to reduce these errors baffaut et al 2015 lerch et al 2015a b the monitoring data still held some uncertainty performance for each calibration and validation dataset used qualitative scatter graphs of simulated results versus measured data and quantitative nse and percent bias pbias methods in order to take into account the uncertainty of the data and the random errors introduced by the replication threshold values of indicators for acceptable model performance were set as a function of pbias and nse values obtained for pairs of replicate plots since the replicate plot can be considered as the best physical model for that plot nearing 2000 nse and pbias values were calculated for measured data from each pair of replicate plots these values provided an upper benchmark against which to evaluate apex model performance as follows for each variable pbias and nse values were determined for each pair of replicates and average pbias and nse were calculated for each cs if up to 3 points caused these indicators to have very high for pbias or low for nse values pbias and nse values were re calculated without these points criteria for acceptable and good model performance were that pbias was twice the maximum average value the average value among the 3 cs rounded to the nearest multiple of five and nse was half the minimum average value the average value rounded to the nearest 0 05 2 5 cropping system long term evaluation in order to assess the long term effects of these tillage systems 1991 2009 simulations were run for each of the replicates at a monthly time step the 1991 1995 years were then excluded from result analysis to let unknown state variables at the beginning of the simulation reach meaningful values thus simulated results covered 14 years from 1996 to 2009 parameters that could not be restricted to one optimal value represented uncertainty about model parameterization which needed to be accounted for during cs evaluation the model was run for each combination of these parameter values for each replicate outputs runoff atrazine no3 n and po4 p were then averaged across all the replicates of the same cs for each month of the simulation and each model run in order to compare the effects of the cs as a whole 6 replicates for mtcs and ntcs 9 replicates for ntcsw averages obtained for each month of the simulation were then averaged across the 14 years to obtain average annual monthly outputs for each model run average annual values were also calculated common statistics summarized the distributions of these average annual monthly outputs across all the model runs minimum maximum mean and standard deviations for each month a confidence interval of the mean one standard deviation quantified uncertainties of the averages caused by the inability to constrain all the parameters to a single value differences between output variables for each cs were evaluated in light of these modeling uncertainties at the annual and monthly time step only when the expected change in average annual and average annual monthly output was greater than the uncertainty of these variables did we conclude that the cs had an effect on that variable 3 results and discussion 3 1 plot discretization and soil properties fig 2 shows the discretization outcome for plot 20 in most cases the toposequence of each plot included a summit shoulder backslope the critical area and a footslope however for plots 4 7 11 and 22 the backslope came in second position with a transition zone between it and the footslope for plots 12 and 25 only 3 positions were defined summit backslope and footslope with no transition between them at the top of the last four plots 27 30 slopes were either flat or sloped toward the east instead of westward thus the simulated areas were shorter than on the other plots and started at the beginning of the westward slope table 1 shows the values of soil hydraulic properties in the top soil and the claypan layers measured bulk densities in the no till systems were greater than or equal to those in mtcs jiang et al 2007 myers et al 2007 and were greater in the top soil than in the claypan layer except on the backslope of the no till systems table 1 similar observations have been found at adjacent as well as more distant sites with claypan soils seobi et al 2005 mudgal et al 2010 saturated hydraulic conductivities were also greater in the no till systems than in the minimum till system in both layers values in the claypan layer were all 1 mm h 1 except for the summit lp of the no till systems 3 2 crop yields for both crops average annual simulated mtcs yields were greater than measured table 2 negative bias while for the no till systems they were either smaller positive bias or very similar pbias 10 simulated corn and soybean yields were less affected by precipitation and temperature than measured ones fig 3 the 1999 and 2005 near or total mtcs corn failures caused by warm temperatures and very little precipitation were not simulated by apex which led to the overall strong negative bias without those two years mtcs corn yield bias was reduced to 15 corn crop pbias for ntcs and ntcsw and coefficients of determination between measured and simulated yields for all cs were within the range of acceptability wang et al 2012 and comparable to previously published crop yield simulation results mudgal et al 2012 senaviratne et al 2013 bhandari et al 2017 however soybean pbias and the coefficient of determination between measured and simulated annual yields indicated unsatisfactory results while simulated yields responded to environmental conditions temperature and precipitation in the same direction as measured yields fig 3 the temporal standard deviations of simulated yields were generally smaller than for measured yields table 2 spatial standard deviations of simulated yields across the three replicated plots were similar to those of the measured yields for mtcs and for the corn crop of ntcsw for ntcs and the soybean crop of ntcsw simulated spatial standard deviation was about half of the measured value thus apex did simulate some but not all of the observed plot to plot crop yield variability unaccounted spatial variability could be caused by differences in soil properties not accounted for in the model by crop yield random measurement errors or by misrepresented processes in the model when this experiment started in 1991 n management protocols called for lower n fertilizer application rates in the two no till systems 150 kg n ha 1 than in mtcs 190 kg n ha 1 in anticipation of slightly lower corn yields and or higher n fertilizer use efficiency for corn yields the statistical analysis performed by yost et al 2016 did not support a difference between measured corn yields from mtcs ntcs or ntcsw fig 4 thus no till systems proved to have an agronomic advantage as measured yields were similar or greater than in the minimum till system in spite of lower n inputs model results however showed that simulated corn and soybean yields were typically 30 and 20 lower for the two nt systems than for mtcs fig 4 the problem seemed to be over estimated mtcs yields and correct or under estimated no till yields as a result simulated mtcs yields were greater than ntcs ones the impact of lp also differed between measured and simulated yields for all cs footslope simulated yields were lower than on the summit and the backslope not shown something that was not found by yost et al 2016 on the other hand yost et al showed lower corn yields on the backslope for mtcs but apex results did not show any difference on the backslope compared to the summit not shown on ntcs lp did not affect measured yields yost et al 2016 but simulated results showed an effect of lp with greater simulated corn and soybean yields on the summit followed by the backslope and the footslope not shown in summary average corn yields over lp appeared to be well simulated for all cs table 2 while in comparison simulation of soybean yields was inferior greater bias and low r2 however if apex results were considered accurate they would lead to conclusions contrary to those obtained with measured yields with respect to the effect of cs and lp measured mtcs yields appeared to be strongly affected by water availability as the very low 1999 and 2005 corn yields and lower corn and soybean yields on the backslope demonstrate yost et al 2016 yet apex outputs showed that even in 1999 and 2005 the model considered that corn plant roots should have been able to capture moisture from practically the whole soil profile in spite of the claypan measured yields also showed that the no till systems provided an agronomic advantage with overall similar yields for mtcs and the no till systems and less spatial variability with no till the simulated results did not match the measurements plant growth in apex follows an algorithm in which potential growth is a function of heat units and crop parameters potential growth is then reduced to account for different stress factors factors that lowered simulated productivity in ntcs and ntcsw included increased water stress 30 more than for mtcs and soil strength stress 15 more there was also more temperature stress for corn but not for soybean in spite of lower n application rates in the no till systems fertilization was sufficient to avoid any n stress averaging less than 1 day per year on average for any of the cs no other stress p aluminum toxicity excess moisture and salinity had any impact thus we conclude that water availability soil strength and temperature caused lower simulated yields in the no till systems for crop yield calibration we adjusted the p2 parameter following recommendations by wang et al 2012 the p2 parameter is a global parameter that controls the effect of bulk density on soil strength which limits root weight growth potential for each cs and lp soil properties that affect water stress were either assigned measured values bulk density ksat or they were calculated by apex field capacity and wilting point it could be possible that apex calculation of field capacity and wilting point was not accurately reflecting the effect of tillage on these properties leading to the difference in simulated yields alternatively the interaction of the p2 parameter with measured bulk densities may also have caused this difference as indicated earlier measured bulk densities in the no till systems were greater than or equal to those in mtcs and were greater in the top soil than in the claypan layer except on the backslope of the no till systems table 1 these measured bulk density values and the adjusted value of p2 1 0 led to more simulated bulk density stress on root growth in the top soil layer than in the claypan which is contradictory to measured root growth by myers et al 2007 namely that root density of mature plants is normal in the top soil layer very small in the claypan and resumes below the claypan similarly with a higher bulk density in the top soil layer at the footslope there was more simulated soil strength stress and lower simulated crop yields there than on the backslope and summit finally greater bulk density for the no till systems resulted in additional simulated stress and lower yields for these systems adjustment of the p2 parameter was necessary to obtain acceptable average plot yields but created inconsistencies in the yield variations with lp and cs additional research is needed to better understand the processes that cause spatial variability of crop yields in claypan soils and the determination of the p2 parameter in spite of this limitation the effects of these cs on water quantity and quality were analyzed runoff and pollutant transport processes were calibrated using data collected during the corn phase of the rotation the only available runoff and water quality data for which crop yield model performance was better and acceptable according to published standards wang et al 2012 for modeling studies data from one single cs are often the only available data used to calibrate the model which is then used to estimate the effect of other cs 3 3 number of events used for flow and water quality calibration and validation the number of events used for model calibration and initial evaluation ranged from 9 calibration of mtcs and ntcsw models to 16 validation of mtcs model table 3 these numbers are rather small for model calibration and validation however we calibrated the model simultaneously for runoff atrazine no3 n and po4 p and used information from the 3 cs to further constrain the parameter space thus what was not available in number of events was compensated by the variety of the processes involved in the fate and transport of multiple constituents under different cs 3 4 performance evaluation criteria for runoff and water quality there were significant event runoff and constituent load differences between the replicates ranging from 3 to 28 for runoff 5 49 for atrazine 12 68 for no3 n and 8 82 for po4 p these differences are within the range of typical uncertainties 6 29 for runoff 8 69 for no3 n and 11 104 for po4 p according to harmel et al 2006 corresponding nse values hovered around 0 9 for runoff for all cs but were lower and inconsistent for atrazine and nutrients ranging from 0 44 to 0 67 for atrazine 0 39 to 0 78 for no3 n and from 0 41 to 0 88 for po4 p table 4 runoff measured from the different replicates was similar with the largest differences 18 being obtained for ntcs however differences increased for water quality constituents up to 35 for atrazine 34 for no3 n and 51 for po4 p the resulting performance evaluation criteria for acceptable and good model performance for runoff were slightly lower but close to values proposed by others asabe 2017 for nutrients these resulting performance criteria suggest a lower standard than proposed by others however these reflect the reality of monitoring water quality under field conditions and the limitations of how well discrete flow based sample collection of runoff represents the temporal dynamics in dissolved constituent concentrations differences between replicates also occurred because of variations in the timing of runoff initiation and therefore subsequent water collection further water suction into the sample container can vary during runoff events due to the effect of turbulent conditions in the intake line bends in the line crop residue and or sediment blockage in the flume and bubbles in the system if the suction was not successful the sampler was programmed to purge the line and try again the resulting differences in sampling timing can amount to several minutes and given the highly dynamic nature of some of these events likely affected the amount of constituent collected these differences between replicates runoff and contaminant loadings emphasize the uncertainty of the measured amounts in this dataset and force us to use less stringent performance standards 3 5 runoff and water quality calibration table 5 presents the final values of all performance indicators obtained for each of the four output variables and each of the three cs after calibration and validation of the apex model apex performed well for runoff across the 3 cs with r2 and nse exceeding 0 7 and a maximum pbias of 29 the performance was acceptable for all cs and exceeded our performance criteria on the validation datasets for water quality constituents performance was usually acceptable except for po4 p on mtcs atrazine on ntcs and no3 n on ntcsw uncertainty of the measured data was a factor in poor performance even though the calibration and validation data sets included only events for which measured runoff and loads differed by less than 100 between replicated plots differences in measured amounts are likely to have affected the calibration and the model performance average differences of total measured amounts between replicated plots of each cs reached 7 25 for runoff 5 80 for atrazine 14 46 for no3 n and 16 48 for po4 p in contrast average differences of simulated amounts were much smaller 2 3 for runoff 2 14 for atrazine 1 14 for no3 n and 1 20 for po4 p the differences in simulated amounts for replicated plots reflect what we knew about the physical characteristics of these plots longitudinal slope profile and depth to clay along the hillslope differences in measured amounts reflect these differences as well however they also reflect measurement errors as well as anything that we did not know differed between the replicated plots estimates of po4 p were too high compared to the measured loads in the mtcs calibration dataset plot 19 in spite of a good correlation between simulated and measured loads r2 0 82 results were satisfactory for the validation dataset and for all the ntcs and ntcsw datasets while all the cumulative simulated amounts for the mtcs datasets were in the range of 380 440 g ha 1 only two of the plots had measured p transport in that range plots 22 and 11 both of which were part of the validation datasets the two other plots had measured cumulative p transport of 260 270 g ha 1 plot 19 which was used for calibration and plot 23 which was used for validation it is not clear what would explain such behavior it cannot be attributed to one event as event loads from replicate plots were well correlated r2 0 75 the difference was systematic but the cause was unclear estimates of no3 n did meet performance criteria for mtcs and ntcs but not for ntcsw however two events were suspicious a july 2001 event for which measured no3 n load estimates were high despite the absence of a record for nitrogen application prior to that time and a june 1998 event for which there was an unexpectedly low number of samples given the event size when we removed these two events performance values improved r2 0 34 nse 0 07 pbias 21 performance values for the corresponding validation dataset did not meet the performance criteria because of the nse value being right under the threshold performance for atrazine was good across all cs except for the ntcs validation dataset we do not have explanations for this other than the fact that estimates of measured atrazine loads from the ntcs calibration plot plot 18 were 55 greater than those from the replicate plot this may have affected the adjustment of atrazine related parameters and produced the poor performance with the validation dataset the bias on validation results was 53 which is of the same magnitude as the difference between the two replicate plots however atrazine simulation was acceptable for all the other cs 3 6 final parameters parameters selected after sensitivity analysis for optimization are shown in table 6 the same parameters were investigated with the same range of possible values for all cs for many parameters final values were the same for the three cs indicating that their value was not affected by the cs however values appeared to be affected by the cs for 16 parameters table 6 interestingly values were always the same for at least two cs and the cs that had a different parameter value was not always the same other sediment parameters i e parameters 18 19 and 47 are important because they affect the transport of nutrients and chemicals adsorbed to soil particles however in the absence of sediment related data these parameters could not be calibrated and we fixed their value to values that worked well for an adjacent field that did have sediment data i e p18 1 5 p19 0 014 and p47 1 0 unpublished data it is difficult to justify different parameter values for different cs on plots that are adjacent to each other and for which topography and soil properties differences are minimal modelers certainly make the assumption that there are no differences when they use crop growth or water quality simulation models to investigate the effects of management on crop yields water movement and water quality finding different parameters for different cs has been encountered before bhandari et al 2017 but it remains an impediment to greater confidence in computer simulation models when simulating management alternatives to a baseline scenario thus we conducted a second round of optimization that included the 14 parameters for which optimal values differed for one cs after the first round after analysis of the calibration and validation results revealed that two events of the ntcsw calibration dataset were particularly suspicious june 1998 and july 2001 as discussed earlier a third round of optimization was conducted for ntcsw without these two events results were consistent with the second round and allowed a more definite determination of parameter values for ntcsw table 7 for seven parameters i e p4 p8 p16 p17 p29 p31 p70 model performance was clearly superior with one specific value for at least one cs and was included in the range of values that was satisfactory for the other two in these cases we selected the single value as the value for the three cs values for three parameters p28 p46 and p84 could not be further restricted by comparison of the water quality data with simulated results so the same range of values was used this could be caused by uncertainties in the data or the inability of these data to describe processes that are affected by these parameters the remaining four parameters p14 p20 p24 and p34 had different values for different cs for p34 we concluded that we could not identify one optimal value and included the range of values as is for p20 and p24 the calibration data constrained the parameter value to a narrow range which we retained for p14 which is the nitrogen leaching ratio i e the ratio of no3 n concentration in surface runoff relative to that in percolate a value of 0 8 was clearly superior for mtcs while 0 2 did not work at all and the reverse was true for the two no till systems this was consistent with n fertilizer placement during the monitoring period broadcast application and incorporation in mtcs left more fertilizer on and near the surface than when injected as in ntcs and ntcsw 3 7 cropping system long term effects on water quality table 8 presents the long term 1996 2009 average annual estimates of runoff and atrazine and nutrient loss along with the mean values we show their uncertainty which is derived from the uncertainty of the eight parameters for which no single value was determined and the simulated change in mean value between each of the no till systems and mtcs for runoff the changes in long term average annual runoff were within a few percent from what was obtained for mtcs which was smaller than the modeling uncertainty thus we conclude that runoff from these plots was not affected by the cs which is consistent with the measured data baffaut et al 2015 in term of water quality ntcs atrazine losses increased compared to mtcs three times the modeling uncertainty ntcsw losses were comparable to those from mtcs as the change was less than the modeling uncertainty ntcs results confirm other studies that the lack of incorporation of atrazine increases losses of these inputs on clay soils for which runoff is not reduced by no till practices lerch et al 2013 verbree et al 2010 zeimen et al 2006 these results reflect previous field studies that documented the trade off between the erosion control benefits of no till and the water quality benefits of atrazine incorporation for restrictive layer soils ghidey et al 2005 2010 lerch et al 2013 the bulk of atrazine loss occurred in june fig 5 when the largest storms occurred within the 60 day window after application atrazine was typically applied before seeding corn either in may or june exceptions included a few late april or very early july applications consequently atrazine losses in june were 100 and 40 greater for ntcs and ntcsw respectively than for mtcs we attribute the lower losses for ntcsw than for ntcs to two factors 1 atrazine was applied only once every three years in ntcsw instead of every other year in ntcs and 2 as a split application that depended on weed pressure in ntcsw simulated values and measured data from events that directly followed atrazine application indicated comparable losses from ntcsw and ntcs when atrazine was applied at the same time and the same rate but many years the second application did not happen thus decreasing the total amount applied over the long term and assessed for the whole cs and not for single events or for one crop these two factors appeared to mitigate the effect of no till on atrazine losses simulated results for no3 n showed lower surface runoff losses for ntcs and ntcsw both decreases were greater than the modeling uncertainty n management in the no till systems differed from that in mtcs in the three key ways that affected transport 1 lower n fertilizer rates 150 versus 190 kg ha 1 2 differences in n fertilizer placement injected versus broadcast and incorporated and 3 timing of n fertilizer applications more temporally varied for ntcsw than for mtcs with less being applied in may and june and some in july for corn and fall and early spring for wheat these differences explain the reductions in simulated n losses by surface runoff other n pathways increased of those simulated leaching denitrification and volatilization were the most affected by the differences in n fertilizer management simulated percolation of n tripled from mtcs to ntcs because of the increase of percolation caused by greater ksat values the injection of n fertilizer rather than incorporation by tillage and the difference in nitrogen leaching ratio the increase of ksat resulted in more simulated percolation in ntcs and ntcsw than in mtcs 8 and 10 of precipitation respectively vs 3 however the presence of cover crops seemed to mitigate increased simulated losses of n via leaching possibly because of residual n uptake by the cover crops simulated denitrification and volatilization were also significant pathways for n loss accounting for 20 25 of applied n given that apex was not calibrated for leaching volatilization or denitrification we should be cautious with these results yet no3 n does find a way to leach through the soil in spite of very low hydraulic conductivities while kitchen et al 1998 showed 10 15 of applied n leaching over 2 years at the summit position of the plots they also showed high variability between the plots which was linked to intrinsic soil properties that control water movement al qudah et al 2016 showed that groundwater under claypan soils was unexpectedly susceptible to no3 n contamination and demonstrated that preferential flow and sub soil hydraulic conductivity controlled that leaching however whether apex simulated these processes correctly was beyond the scope of this study in addition the lack of measured sediment data impaired our ability to calibrate the model for organic n adsorbed to transported soil particles and thus we do not report the corresponding results nevertheless no till should have reduced the transport of organic n associated with sediment loss while simulated average annual po4 p losses for ntcs were greater than for mtcs and double for the month of june alone po4 p losses from ntcsw were very similar to those of mtcs with expected changes well below the modeling uncertainties for each month of the year average annual p fertilizer amounts were very similar for all the cs 48 kg ha 1 for mtcs and ntcs and 41 kg ha 1 for ntcsw however only 2 3 of the average annual p was applied during the high rainfall months march through june as a result of corn being grown only once every three years and p being applied at a rate that supplied the required amount for the corn and soybean crops the balance was applied when wheat was seeded in october a month with typically low rainfall as for n no till should have reduced sediment loss and associated p adsorbed to soil particles but we do not report the corresponding results because of the lack of data to calibrate sediment transport processes 4 conclusions long term apex simulation of three cropping systems on replicated large plots in the context of claypan soils showed that in spite of satisfactory model performance for corn yields and acceptable percent bias for soybean yields the model was not capable of simulating the effects of management or landscape position on crop yields the spatial and temporal variability of corn and soybean yields were also under estimated we suspected that the cause may be the interaction between soil bulk density and root growth stress in the different layers of a soil with a claypan layer as a result the model indicated that no till yields would be smaller than those from a minimum tillage system when measured yields showed no such difference this research highlights the need for further research in this area as inconsistent crop yield results undermine the usefulness of the model for making recommendations about management in spite of this limitation with yields model performance was very good for runoff when parameterized using data from the corn phase of each cropping system the research showed that simulation of water quality constituents still remains difficult model calibration and validation was mostly satisfactory for atrazine no3 n and po4 p but was poor for some combinations of constituent and calibration or validation data sets long term simulation of these three cropping systems along with uncertainty analysis indicated that the 3 year csw rotation and associated fertilizer management provides the most benefits to water quality by reducing nutrient transport in runoff although losses of atrazine were similar for the corn phase of the no till systems and greater than mtcs the ntcsw system does not increase overall atrazine losses since it is applied only once every three years thus ntcsw appeared to be able to mitigate the negative effects of no till on the surface transport of non incorporated dissolved chemicals a key benefit of the 3 year rotation was improved n and p fertilizer management in terms of slight rate reductions improved n fertilizer placement and changes in application timing to less vulnerable periods of the year another benefit included the presence of cover crops to promote et and residual n uptake to reduce nitrate leaching compared to the 2 year no till system overall the long term simulations support the concept of stacking practices such as lower chemical inputs improved fertilizer management longer crop rotations and use of cover crops to achieve desired environmental and production goals
