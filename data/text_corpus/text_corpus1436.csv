7180,previous studies on the impact of sea level rise slr on seawater intrusion swi are mostly based on the assumption of a homogeneous coastal aquifer in this study we extend those studies by investigating slr induced swi in a layered coastal aquifer using the analytical method developed by strack and ausk 2015 we provide analytical solutions for steady state swi in confined and unconfined coastal aquifers where both constant head and constant flux inland boundary conditions are considered the analysis based on a three layer aquifer indicates that in general aquifer stratification affects either or both the initial location and response distance of the interface toe specifically for flux controlled unconfined coastal systems the toe response distance driven by slr is a linear function of the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer and independent of hydraulic conductivities of lower layers using an equivalent homogeneous hydraulic conductivity derived based on the initial interface toe location before slr would result in overestimation or underestimation of the toe response distance depending on the hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the layers for flux controlled confined layered coastal systems by contrast slr can not cause variation of the steady state interface toe location which is consistent with previous findings for homogeneous coastal aquifers the interface toe location in head controlled layered coastal systems is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers moreover the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location and response distance in the head controlled system exhibits a more complicated pattern than in the flux controlled coastal system as changing the layer thickness changes both the overall aquifer transmissivity and inland freshwater flux the results obtained enhance the understanding of the impact of slr on swi which could provide a first order assessment tool for relevant practitioners keywords seawater intrusion sea level rise layered aquifer analytical method 1 introduction seawater intrusion swi is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers and it is generally believed that the overexploitation of coastal aquifers extended drought period and sea level rise slr are the main causes werner et al 2013 the problem of swi has been regarded as one of the most important issues in managing coastal zones as it can significantly degrade the coastal hydrogeological and ecological systems darwish et al 2005 qi and qiu 2011 and impede coastal economic and social development thus the management of swi is an important imperative for sustainable development of coastal regions swi has been studied for over one century using analytical numerical and experimental methods werner et al 2013 in terms of causing factors the impact of slr on swi has interested researchers in the recent decade ketabchi et al 2016 because of the obvious tendency of slr reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 2013 the study of the impact of slr on swi can be generally categorized into two types in terms of the state of the problem the first type of research considers only the steady state condition and neglects transience of the process e g werner and simmons 2009 ferguson and gleeson 2012 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 lu et al 2015 based on this assumption together with the sharp interface approximation analytical solutions of the interface toe location and saltwater volume can be developed based on the potential theory providing a convenient tool for the first order assessment of swi werner et al 2012 the second type of research by contrast explores various quantitative indicators e g seawater isochlors total salt mass and wedge center of mass during the transient swi process e g watson et al 2010 chang et al 2011 webb and howard 2011 mehdizadeh et al 2017 the selection of the research method depends mainly on the purpose of the study and the availability of data werner and simmons 2009 conducted a precursory theoretical study on the impact of slr on swi using the simple analytical method based on the potential theory the authors assumed conceptual models with two different types of inland boundary conditions i e fixed head and fixed flux and found that slr in the coastal system with a fixed head inland boundary condition would incur large interface toe migration highlighting the importance of the inland boundary condition in assessing the impact of slr on swi this study was later extended by lu et al 2015 by considering an additional general head inland boundary condition with two special parameters i e hydraulic conductance and reference head the general head inland boundary condition represents an intermediate inland boundary in predicting the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to slr lu et al 2013b also pointed out the importance of the inland boundary condition in evaluating the relative vulnerability of coastal aquifers to groundwater pumping and slr ferguson and gleeson 2012 in addition to the inland boundary condition the impact of land surface inundation on aquifer salinization caused by slr has been investigated using the analytical method ataie ashtiani et al 2013 it was shown that the effect of land surface inundation would be a dominant factor on the steady state interface position in unconfined coastal aquifers with a small beach slope moreover analytical solutions have been developed to explore the influence of the sloping confining bed of an unconfined aquifer on swi under slr koussis et al 2012 mazi et al 2013 the results showed high nonlinearity in the responses of swi to slr and indicated the existence of important thresholds or tipping points beyond which the shift of the interface toe becomes abrupt transient swi processes in response to slr is often investigated through the numerical method on the basis of the variable density flow and solute transport model e g webb and howard 2011 for example watson et al 2010 explored transience of swi in response to slr using a variety of quantitative indicators and observed the temporal asymmetry between swi responses to slr and sea level drop moreover some simulations in their study exhibit temporary overshoot of the steady state interface this overshoot phenomenon has been reproduced in a laboratory scale sand tank experiment morgan et al 2015 other important studies about slr induced transient swi can be found in the recent review paper of ketabchi et al 2016 most of previous studies assume a homogeneous aquifer and therefore neglect various patterns of geologic heterogeneity which is considered as an important factor controlling the extent of swi e g dagan and zeitoun 1998 lu et al 2013a coastal aquifers are often comprised of layers of different geologic strata e g oki et al 1998 nakagawa et al 2000 however limited research on swi subject to slr in layered coastal aquifers is available ketabchi et al 2014 investigated analytically fresh groundwater lenses in two layer small islands subject to the combined impact of slr and land surface inundation recently mehdizadeh et al 2017 numerically explored the slr effect on transient swi in a coastal aquifer in which a horizontal aquitard layer is located between two horizontal permeable layers however the general impact of slr on swi for a layered coastal aquifer is still unknown to fill this scientific gap we explore slr induced swi in both confined and unconfined layered coastal aquifers given the importance of the type of the inland boundary both fixed head and fixed flux inland boundary conditions are considered our study relies an analytical solution for the interface toe location in a three layer coastal aquifer with different combinations of the aquifer type inland boundary condition and stratification the analytical method employed follows that developed by strack and ausk 2015 using a comprehensive discharge potential in which the gradient of the comprehensive potential results in the vertically integrated discharge throughout the aquifer the comprehensive potential along the coastal boundary is derived precisely based on the geometry of the aquifer the interface elevations piezometric heads and the vertical distribution of flow can be determined by adopting the dupuit forchheimer approximation dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 and the ghyben herzberg equation badon ghyben and drabbe 1888 herzberg 1901 although the method used to derive the analytical solution of seawater intrusion in a layered coastal aquifer has been proposed by strack and ausk 2015 the impact of slr on seawater intrusion in a layered coastal system has not been evaluated therefore the current investigation extends most previous studies e g werner and simmons 2009 ferguson and gleeson 2012 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 lu et al 2015 by considering a multi layer coastal system rather than a simplified homogeneous coastal system in which slr is occurring for the sake of simplicity a three layer coastal aquifer is adopted to assess the slr impact on swi though analytical solutions for coastal aquifers with n layers will first be given 2 conceptual model we first considered idealized confined and unconfined coastal aquifers with n layers as shown in fig 1 the following assumptions are made 1 the flow systems are under steady state 2 the density of groundwater and the resting saline water are separated by a sharp interface i e the two fluids are assumed immiscible 3 the coastal boundary is vertical such that land surface inundation is not considered and 4 the flow in the vertical direction is neglected i e the dupuit forchheimer approximation is adopted these assumptions are frequently employed in previous analytical studies of swi e g strack 1976 kacimov and sherif 2006 strack and ausk 2015 as shown the strata are sequentially denoted as j 1 2 n from the bottom up we use bj l to represent the base elevation of each layer b1 0 m n and Î¼ represent the layer that contains the saltwater interface water table and sea level respectively hj l and kj l t represent the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of each layer we place the origin of coordinate system at the intersection of the vertical coastline and the horizontally impermeable base furthermore the z axis is vertically upward and the x axis is pointing horizontally landward the level of the horizontal base i e x y plane is used as the datum for the aquifer system Ï l is the height of the water table above the sea level hs l is the vertical distance between the sea level and the interface hf l is the elevation of the phreatic surface and hs l is the elevation of the sea level hl l is the hydraulic head at the distance l l from the coastline q f l2 t is a constant freshwater discharge from inland per unit length of coastline by applying one of the two inland boundary conditions i e either q f or hl the flux controlled or head controlled coastal system is considered for the head controlled coastal system we set the freshwater flux after slr as q f parameters introduced above are listed in table 1 3 analytical solutions of swi in three layer coastal aquifers in the appendix we provide derivation processes of four analytical solutions with different combinations of the aquifer type and inland boundary condition for coastal aquifers with n layers following the method introduced in strack and ausk 2015 then analytical solutions of swi in the three layer coastal aquifer can be obtained directly and given below 3 1 flux controlled three layer unconfined coastal aquifer we obtain the expression for the boundary value of the comprehensive potential along the coast from eq a12 where Î¼ 3 and n 4 for the case with three layers note that k 4 k 3 1 Ï 0 1 2 Î± t 1 h 1 k 3 h 1 2 k 3 h 2 2 2 k 3 h 1 h 2 t 2 h 2 2 t 2 h 1 1 Î± t 1 h s k 3 h 1 h s k 3 h

h hl 2 Î± h l 1 Î± 1 h s 1 2 Î± h the solution is in accordance with that developed by lu et al 2015 under a special condition where the top layer and the bottom layer are symmetrical with respect to the middle layer i e k 1 k 3 and h 1 h 3 one can prove easily that the interface toe location in a layered coastal aquifer is exactly the same as that in a homogeneous aquifer 4 experimental verification strack et al 2016 has validated the solutions strack and ausk 2015 through the laboratory experiments with a two layer setting and with a constant head inland boundary condition since a three layer coastal aquifer is assumed this study the analytical solutions are compared with the experimental results developed in the previous study lu et al 2013a the experiment is performed in a quasi two dimensional flow tank of 1 8 m long 0 6 m high and 0 1 m wide the freshwater and saltwater heads were 440 m and 428 mm respectively and maintained constant through two constant head flow cells two different particle sizes of sands are used and the values of hydraulic conductivity are 1 52 and 0 297 mm s for the coarse and fine sands respectively each layer is about 15 cm thick fig 2 shows the comparison between analytical and experimental results of swi in a three layer coastal aquifer where the upmost and bottom layers are packed with coarse sands and the medium layer is packed with fine sands as shown the sharp interface calculated by the analytical solution matches well with the experimental result though the mixing zone in the middle is widen significantly due to flow refraction lu et al 2013a therefore the confidence of using the analytical solution is further improved 5 sensitivity analysis 5 1 parameter values the analysis on the impact of aquifer stratificaton on slr induced swi is carried out through a three layer coastal aquifer as mentioned above the parameters values for the base case model are assumed as follows the sea level hs is 30 m the aquifer thickness is 30 m confined aquifer the inland freshwater flux q f is 0 48 m2 d flux controlled aquifer cases the inland head hl at x 2000 m is 32 m head controlled aquifer cases and the densities of seawater and freshwater are 1000 and 1025 kg m3 respectively we assume that the sea level after slr is equal to h s 31 m unless otherwise specified the parameter values adopted in this study are similar to those assumed in lu et al 2013a and 2015 the values of hydraulic conductivities and layer thicknesses are varied to examine their sensitivities to slr induced swi 5 2 flux controlled layered coastal aquifer it is obvious that the interface toe location depends on k values and thicknesses of all three layers in the flux controlled unconfined layered coastal systems as shown in eq 4 however eq 5 indicates that the movement distance of the interface toe is a linear function of the k value of the top layer i e the layer containing the sea level and independent of the k values and thickness of other layers in the flux controlled unconfined layered coastal systems this result provides an alternative theoretical basis for supporting the effectiveness of the swi reduction scheme introduced by strack et al 2016 where the hydraulic conductivity in the upper part of the aquifer is artificially reduced fig 3 shows the sensitivity of Î´ x t to k 3 in the flux controlled unconfined three layer coastal systems where hs 30 5 31 and 31 5 m and k 3 is varied between 0 and 1000 m d when k 3 is equal to 1000 m d the increases of 0 5 1 and 1 5 m of the sea level lead to Î´ x t 808 1628 and 2462 m respectively on the other hand it can be seen that the toe response distance approaches zero as the value of k 3 is close to zero theoretically k 3 0 represents that the aquifer is fully confined eq 15 shows that the interface toe location is independent of the sea level in the flux controlled confined coastal system therefore these results are consistent with each other fig 4 shows the sensitivity of Î´ x t and Î´ x t h to hydraulic conductivities of three layers of the flux controlled unconfined aquifer in which the differences between the two parameters are also given in fig 4 a1 a3 k 1 10 m d and k 2 and k 3 are varied between 1 and 1000 m d it is shown that Î´ x t is independent of k 2 and a linear function of k 3 as mentioned above Î´ x t h however depends on both k 2 and k 3 and increases with the increase of two parameters fig 4 a3 shows that a large k 2 and a small k 3 lead to the condition of Î´ x t h Î´ x t 0 indicating that using the homogenous aquifer assumption would overestimate swi induced by slr by contrast a smaller k 2 and a large k 3 results in Î´ x t h Î´ x t 0 i e the application of the homogeneous aquifer assumption would underestimate slr driven swi in fig 4 b1 b3 k 2 10 m d and k 1 and k 3 are varied between 1 and 1000 m d results obtained by changing k 1 and k 3 are similar to those obtained by changing k 2 and k 3 Î´ x t is independent of k 1 and a linear function of k 3 and Î´ x t h increases with the increase of k 1 and k 3 comparing with k 1 a same value of k 2 leads to a higher value of Î´ x t h as can be found by comparing fig 4 a2 and b2 unlike in fig 4 a3 the most values of Î´ x t h Î´ x t in fig 4 b3 are smaller than zero suggesting that an underestimate of slr induced swi occurs by adopting the assumption of a homogeneous aquifer in fig 4 c1 c3 k 3 10 m d and k 1 and k 2 are varied between 1 and 1000 m d a single value of Î´ x t is obtained and Î´ x t h increases with the increase of k 1 and k 2 as expected as k 1 k 3 and k 2 k 3 Î´ x t h Î´ x t indicating that using the homogenous assumption would overestimate swi caused by slr fig 5 shows the sensitivity of Î´ x t and Î´ x t h to the layer thickness of the flux controlled unconfined aquifer in which the differences between the two parameters are also given we assume that k 1 k 2 10 m d so that the coastal aquifer has actually two layers for the sake of simplicity the thickness of h 1 h 2 is varied between 0 and 30 m k 3 1 and 100 m d are selected respectively in fig 5 a1 a3 and fig 5 b1 b3 respectively as shown when k 3 is one order of magnitude less than the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer both Î´ x t h and Î´ x t h Î´ x t increase with increasing thickness of h 1 h 2 resulting in an increasing extent of the overestimate of slr induced swi see fig 5 a3 when k 3 is one order of magnitude larger than the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer by contrast both Î´ x t h and Î´ x t h Î´ x t decrease with increasing thickness of h 1 h 2 leading to an increasing extent of the underestimate of slr induced swi see fig 5 b3 furthermore it can be seen that the degree of the overestimate or underestimate is linearly dependent on the magnitude of k 3 as shown for h 1 h 2 varied from 0 to 30 m the variation of Î´ x t h is about 14 m and 140 m for k 3 1 and 100 m d respectively 5 3 head controlled layered coastal aquifer eqs 38 and 43 indicate that an equivalent homogeneous k can not be derived for the head controlled coastal systems since the two equations are independent of k it can be proved from the analytical solutions that the interface toe location in the head controlled coastal system is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers i e k 1 k 3 and k 2 k 3 as also pointed out by lu et al 2013a fig 6 shows the sensitivity of inland freshwater flux before and after slr to log k 1 k 3 and log k 2 k 3 for the head controlled unconfined three layer coastal aquifer where h 1 h 2 10 m h l 32 m is fixed at l 2000 m and log k 1 k 3 and log k 2 k 3 are varied between 2 and 2 as indicated a larger k 1 k 3 and k 2 k 3 correspond to a larger freshwater flux slr leads to a reduction in the freshwater flux and the reduced freshwater flux causes intrusion of seawater fig 7 shows that the sensitivity of the interface toe locations before and after x t slr and the interface movement distance to log k 1 k 3 and log k 2 k 3 for the head controlled three layer unconfined coastal aquifer where the colored planes indicate the values obtained for the corresponding homogeneous aquifer the values below the colored face indicate that using the homogeneous aquifer assumption would overestimate the corresponding parameter an examination of these figures shows that a larger k 1 k 3 and a smaller k 2 k 3 result in a smaller x t x t and Î´xt in particular when k 1 k 3 100 and k 2 k 3 0 01 Î´ x t derived by the layered and homogenous models are 546 and 809 m respectively representing an overestimate of 48 by using the homogeneous model to predict the interface movement distance on the other hand a smaller k 1 k 3 and k 2 k 3 give a higher value of x t x t and Î´ x t which may lead to the underestimate of these three parameters under the homogeneous aquifer assumption to study the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe movement for the head controlled coastal system we assume a simple two layer coastal aquifer i e k 1 k 2 10 m d similar to the assumption adopted for the above flux controlled coastal system fig 8 shows the sensitivity of the inland freshwater flux before and after slr to the layer thickness of the head controlled unconfined aquifer in which k 1 k 2 10 m d and k 3 1 bottom and 100 top are chosen respectively and h 1 h 2 is varied from 0 to 30 m with a step of 1 m in the appendix we have provided the expression of the freshwater flux under the assumption of k 1 k 2 it can be proved analytically that with increasing h 1 h 2 the magnitude of the freshwater flux decreases when k 1 k 3 and increases when k 1 k 3 physically the magnitude of the inland freshwater flux increases with increasing proportion of the more permeable layer and decreases with increasing proportion of the less permeable layer as shown in fig 8 the magnitudes of q f and q f decreases and increases monotonically with increasing h 1 h 2 for the cases of k 1 k 3 0 1 and 10 respectively specifically when k 1 k 3 0 1 q f decreases from 2 62 to 0 41 m2 d and q f decreases from 0 96 to 0 17 m2 d for h 1 h 2 increasing from 1 to 30 m respectively by contrast when k 1 k 3 10 q f decreases from 0 03 to 0 24 m2 d and q f decreases from 0 01 to 0 09 m2 d for the same variation of h 1 h 2 respectively fig 9 shows the sensitivity of x t x t and Î´ x t to the layer thickness of the head controlled unconfined aquifer in which k 1 k 3 0 1 top and 10 bottom are chosen respectively the analytical solution of the interface toe location in a two layer unconfined coastal aquifer with a constant flux boundary condition has been derived based on eq 4 18 x t 1 1 Î± k 3 h s 2 k 1 k 3 h 1 h 2 2 2 Î± q f when considering a constant head inland boundary condition q f varies with the variation of h 1 h 2 as shown in fig 8 therefore with decreasing h 1 h 2 the monotonicity of the numerator is the same as the denominator in eq 18 for both cases of k 1 k 3 and k 1 k 3 the same monotonicity of the numerator and denominator in eq 18 leads to the difficulty in understanding the monotonicity of xt with respect to h 1 h 2 when k 1 k 3 0 1 i e the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer is one order or magnitude less than that of the lower layer x t and x t are a non monotonic function of h 1 h 2 both parameters increase first and then decrease as h 1 h 2 is varied from 0 to 30 m with a step of 1 m however Î´ x t increases monotonically with increasing h 1 h 2 when k 1 k 3 10 by contrast x t x t and Î´ x t are a non monotonic function of h 1 h 2 and they all decrease first and then increase with increasing h 1 h 2 it is obvious that the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location in the head controlled unconfined coastal system is more complicated than in the flux controlled unconfined coastal system as changing the layer thickness would change not only the overall transmissivity but also the inland freshwater flux the sensitivities of the layer hydraulic conductivity and thickness on the interface toe position toe response distance and inland freshwater flux for the head controlled confined aquifer are similar to those for the head controlled unconfined aquifer in terms of both trend and magnitude for the sake of conciseness these results are not shown here 6 conclusion we have studied the impact of the srl on swi in a layered coastal aquifer using the analytical method developed by strack and ausk 2015 in particular we give the specific analytical solutions for swi in three layer confined and unconfined coastal aquifer with consideration of both constant flux and constant head inland boundary conditions the analytical solution is in well agreement with the previous laboratory experimental result of a three layer aquifer with a constant head inland boundary condition the main conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis are as follows 1 in general the impact of aquifer stratification on swi caused by slr is twofold it affects either or both the initial location and response distance of the interface toe as such the stratification property of a coastal aquifer should be considered when assessing swi in response of slr 2 for flux controlled unconfined layered coastal systems the toe response distance caused by slr is a linear function of the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer and independent of hydraulic conductivities of lower layers though the interface toe location is determined by hydraulic conductivities of all layers the sensitivity analysis based on a three layer coastal aquifer indicates that using an equivalent homogeneous hydraulic conductivity obtained by assuming the same initial interface toe location as that in the layered coastal aquifer would overestimate or underestimate the toe response distance depending on the hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the layers 3 for flux controlled confined layered coastal systems slr can not lead to the variation of the steady state interface toe location which is consistent with the previous finding for the homogeneous coastal aquifer strack 1976 chang et al 2011 however aquifer stratification would affect the interface toe location 4 the interface toe location in head controlled layered coastal systems is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers which is consistent with the previous finding obtained by numerical simulations lu et al 2013a and 5 the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location and response distance in the head controlled system exhibits a more complicated pattern than in the flux controlled coastal system since changing the layer thickness would change both the overall aquifer transmissivity and inland freshwater flux our analysis and results have deepened the understanding of slr on swi in coastal aquifer through the consideration of aquifer stratification while the analytical solutions and findings are based on various assumptions e g steady state horizontal layer and sharp interface they could provide a first order tool to assess slr induced swi and a preliminary guide to manage groundwater resources in a layered coastal aquifer future work is required to investigate swi induced by slr in a layered coastal aquifer under

7180,previous studies on the impact of sea level rise slr on seawater intrusion swi are mostly based on the assumption of a homogeneous coastal aquifer in this study we extend those studies by investigating slr induced swi in a layered coastal aquifer using the analytical method developed by strack and ausk 2015 we provide analytical solutions for steady state swi in confined and unconfined coastal aquifers where both constant head and constant flux inland boundary conditions are considered the analysis based on a three layer aquifer indicates that in general aquifer stratification affects either or both the initial location and response distance of the interface toe specifically for flux controlled unconfined coastal systems the toe response distance driven by slr is a linear function of the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer and independent of hydraulic conductivities of lower layers using an equivalent homogeneous hydraulic conductivity derived based on the initial interface toe location before slr would result in overestimation or underestimation of the toe response distance depending on the hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the layers for flux controlled confined layered coastal systems by contrast slr can not cause variation of the steady state interface toe location which is consistent with previous findings for homogeneous coastal aquifers the interface toe location in head controlled layered coastal systems is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers moreover the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location and response distance in the head controlled system exhibits a more complicated pattern than in the flux controlled coastal system as changing the layer thickness changes both the overall aquifer transmissivity and inland freshwater flux the results obtained enhance the understanding of the impact of slr on swi which could provide a first order assessment tool for relevant practitioners keywords seawater intrusion sea level rise layered aquifer analytical method 1 introduction seawater intrusion swi is the movement of saline water into freshwater aquifers and it is generally believed that the overexploitation of coastal aquifers extended drought period and sea level rise slr are the main causes werner et al 2013 the problem of swi has been regarded as one of the most important issues in managing coastal zones as it can significantly degrade the coastal hydrogeological and ecological systems darwish et al 2005 qi and qiu 2011 and impede coastal economic and social development thus the management of swi is an important imperative for sustainable development of coastal regions swi has been studied for over one century using analytical numerical and experimental methods werner et al 2013 in terms of causing factors the impact of slr on swi has interested researchers in the recent decade ketabchi et al 2016 because of the obvious tendency of slr reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 2013 the study of the impact of slr on swi can be generally categorized into two types in terms of the state of the problem the first type of research considers only the steady state condition and neglects transience of the process e g werner and simmons 2009 ferguson and gleeson 2012 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 lu et al 2015 based on this assumption together with the sharp interface approximation analytical solutions of the interface toe location and saltwater volume can be developed based on the potential theory providing a convenient tool for the first order assessment of swi werner et al 2012 the second type of research by contrast explores various quantitative indicators e g seawater isochlors total salt mass and wedge center of mass during the transient swi process e g watson et al 2010 chang et al 2011 webb and howard 2011 mehdizadeh et al 2017 the selection of the research method depends mainly on the purpose of the study and the availability of data werner and simmons 2009 conducted a precursory theoretical study on the impact of slr on swi using the simple analytical method based on the potential theory the authors assumed conceptual models with two different types of inland boundary conditions i e fixed head and fixed flux and found that slr in the coastal system with a fixed head inland boundary condition would incur large interface toe migration highlighting the importance of the inland boundary condition in assessing the impact of slr on swi this study was later extended by lu et al 2015 by considering an additional general head inland boundary condition with two special parameters i e hydraulic conductance and reference head the general head inland boundary condition represents an intermediate inland boundary in predicting the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to slr lu et al 2013b also pointed out the importance of the inland boundary condition in evaluating the relative vulnerability of coastal aquifers to groundwater pumping and slr ferguson and gleeson 2012 in addition to the inland boundary condition the impact of land surface inundation on aquifer salinization caused by slr has been investigated using the analytical method ataie ashtiani et al 2013 it was shown that the effect of land surface inundation would be a dominant factor on the steady state interface position in unconfined coastal aquifers with a small beach slope moreover analytical solutions have been developed to explore the influence of the sloping confining bed of an unconfined aquifer on swi under slr koussis et al 2012 mazi et al 2013 the results showed high nonlinearity in the responses of swi to slr and indicated the existence of important thresholds or tipping points beyond which the shift of the interface toe becomes abrupt transient swi processes in response to slr is often investigated through the numerical method on the basis of the variable density flow and solute transport model e g webb and howard 2011 for example watson et al 2010 explored transience of swi in response to slr using a variety of quantitative indicators and observed the temporal asymmetry between swi responses to slr and sea level drop moreover some simulations in their study exhibit temporary overshoot of the steady state interface this overshoot phenomenon has been reproduced in a laboratory scale sand tank experiment morgan et al 2015 other important studies about slr induced transient swi can be found in the recent review paper of ketabchi et al 2016 most of previous studies assume a homogeneous aquifer and therefore neglect various patterns of geologic heterogeneity which is considered as an important factor controlling the extent of swi e g dagan and zeitoun 1998 lu et al 2013a coastal aquifers are often comprised of layers of different geologic strata e g oki et al 1998 nakagawa et al 2000 however limited research on swi subject to slr in layered coastal aquifers is available ketabchi et al 2014 investigated analytically fresh groundwater lenses in two layer small islands subject to the combined impact of slr and land surface inundation recently mehdizadeh et al 2017 numerically explored the slr effect on transient swi in a coastal aquifer in which a horizontal aquitard layer is located between two horizontal permeable layers however the general impact of slr on swi for a layered coastal aquifer is still unknown to fill this scientific gap we explore slr induced swi in both confined and unconfined layered coastal aquifers given the importance of the type of the inland boundary both fixed head and fixed flux inland boundary conditions are considered our study relies an analytical solution for the interface toe location in a three layer coastal aquifer with different combinations of the aquifer type inland boundary condition and stratification the analytical method employed follows that developed by strack and ausk 2015 using a comprehensive discharge potential in which the gradient of the comprehensive potential results in the vertically integrated discharge throughout the aquifer the comprehensive potential along the coastal boundary is derived precisely based on the geometry of the aquifer the interface elevations piezometric heads and the vertical distribution of flow can be determined by adopting the dupuit forchheimer approximation dupuit 1863 forchheimer 1886 and the ghyben herzberg equation badon ghyben and drabbe 1888 herzberg 1901 although the method used to derive the analytical solution of seawater intrusion in a layered coastal aquifer has been proposed by strack and ausk 2015 the impact of slr on seawater intrusion in a layered coastal system has not been evaluated therefore the current investigation extends most previous studies e g werner and simmons 2009 ferguson and gleeson 2012 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 lu et al 2015 by considering a multi layer coastal system rather than a simplified homogeneous coastal system in which slr is occurring for the sake of simplicity a three layer coastal aquifer is adopted to assess the slr impact on swi though analytical solutions for coastal aquifers with n layers will first be given 2 conceptual model we first considered idealized confined and unconfined coastal aquifers with n layers as shown in fig 1 the following assumptions are made 1 the flow systems are under steady state 2 the density of groundwater and the resting saline water are separated by a sharp interface i e the two fluids are assumed immiscible 3 the coastal boundary is vertical such that land surface inundation is not considered and 4 the flow in the vertical direction is neglected i e the dupuit forchheimer approximation is adopted these assumptions are frequently employed in previous analytical studies of swi e g strack 1976 kacimov and sherif 2006 strack and ausk 2015 as shown the strata are sequentially denoted as j 1 2 n from the bottom up we use bj l to represent the base elevation of each layer b1 0 m n and Î¼ represent the layer that contains the saltwater interface water table and sea level respectively hj l and kj l t represent the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of each layer we place the origin of coordinate system at the intersection of the vertical coastline and the horizontally impermeable base furthermore the z axis is vertically upward and the x axis is pointing horizontally landward the level of the horizontal base i e x y plane is used as the datum for the aquifer system Ï l is the height of the water table above the sea level hs l is the vertical distance between the sea level and the interface hf l is the elevation of the phreatic surface and hs l is the elevation of the sea level hl l is the hydraulic head at the distance l l from the coastline q f l2 t is a constant freshwater discharge from inland per unit length of coastline by applying one of the two inland boundary conditions i e either q f or hl the flux controlled or head controlled coastal system is considered for the head controlled coastal system we set the freshwater flux after slr as q f parameters introduced above are listed in table 1 3 analytical solutions of swi in three layer coastal aquifers in the appendix we provide derivation processes of four analytical solutions with different combinations of the aquifer type and inland boundary condition for coastal aquifers with n layers following the method introduced in strack and ausk 2015 then analytical solutions of swi in the three layer coastal aquifer can be obtained directly and given below 3 1 flux controlled three layer unconfined coastal aquifer we obtain the expression for the boundary value of the comprehensive potential

verification strack et al 2016 has validated the solutions strack and ausk 2015 through the laboratory experiments with a two layer setting and with a constant head inland boundary condition since a three layer coastal aquifer is assumed this study the analytical solutions are compared with the experimental results developed in the previous study lu et al 2013a the experiment is performed in a quasi two dimensional flow tank of 1 8 m long 0 6 m high and 0 1 m wide the freshwater and saltwater heads were 440 m and 428 mm respectively and maintained constant through two constant head flow cells two different particle sizes of sands are used and the values of hydraulic conductivity are 1 52 and 0 297 mm s for the coarse and fine sands respectively each layer is about 15 cm thick fig 2 shows the comparison between analytical and experimental results of swi in a three layer coastal aquifer where the upmost and bottom layers are packed with coarse sands and the medium layer is packed with fine sands as shown the sharp interface calculated by the analytical solution matches well with the experimental result though the mixing zone in the middle is widen significantly due to flow refraction lu et al 2013a therefore the confidence of using the analytical solution is further improved 5 sensitivity analysis 5 1 parameter values the analysis on the impact of aquifer stratificaton on slr induced swi is carried out through a three layer coastal aquifer as mentioned above the parameters values for the base case model are assumed as follows the sea level hs is 30 m the aquifer thickness is 30 m confined aquifer the inland freshwater flux q f is 0 48 m2 d flux controlled aquifer cases the inland head hl at x 2000 m is 32 m head controlled aquifer cases and the densities of seawater and freshwater are 1000 and 1025 kg m3 respectively we assume that the sea level after slr is equal to h s 31 m unless otherwise specified the parameter values adopted in this study are similar to those assumed in lu et al 2013a and 2015 the values of hydraulic conductivities and layer thicknesses are varied to examine their sensitivities to slr induced swi 5 2 flux controlled layered coastal aquifer it is obvious that the interface toe location depends on k values and thicknesses of all three layers in the flux controlled unconfined layered coastal systems as shown in eq 4 however eq 5 indicates that the movement distance of the interface toe is a linear function of the k value of the top layer i e the layer containing the sea level and independent of the k values and thickness of other layers in the flux controlled unconfined layered coastal systems this result provides an alternative theoretical basis for supporting the effectiveness of the swi reduction scheme introduced by strack et al 2016 where the hydraulic conductivity in the upper part of the aquifer is artificially reduced fig 3 shows the sensitivity of Î´ x t to k 3 in the flux controlled unconfined three layer coastal systems where hs 30 5 31 and 31 5 m and k 3 is varied between 0 and 1000 m d when k 3 is equal to 1000 m d the increases of 0 5 1 and 1 5 m of the sea level lead to Î´ x t 808 1628 and 2462 m respectively on the other hand it can be seen that the toe response distance approaches zero as the value of k 3 is close to zero theoretically k 3 0 represents that the aquifer is fully confined eq 15 shows that the interface toe location is independent of the sea level in the flux controlled confined coastal system therefore these results are consistent with each other fig 4 shows the sensitivity of Î´ x t and Î´ x t h to hydraulic conductivities of three layers of the flux controlled unconfined aquifer in which the differences between the two parameters are also given in fig 4 a1 a3 k 1 10 m d and k 2 and k 3 are varied between 1 and 1000 m d it is shown that Î´ x t is independent of k 2 and a linear function of k 3 as mentioned above Î´ x t h however depends on both k 2 and k 3 and increases with the increase of two parameters fig 4 a3 shows that a large k 2 and a small k 3 lead to the condition of Î´ x t h Î´ x t 0 indicating that using the homogenous aquifer assumption would overestimate swi induced by slr by contrast a smaller k 2 and a large k 3 results in Î´ x t h Î´ x t 0 i e the application of the homogeneous aquifer assumption would underestimate slr driven swi in fig 4 b1 b3 k 2 10 m d and k 1 and k 3 are varied between 1 and 1000 m d results obtained by changing k 1 and k 3 are similar to those obtained by changing k 2 and k 3 Î´ x t is independent of k 1 and a linear function of k 3 and Î´ x t h increases with the increase of k 1 and k 3 comparing with k 1 a same value of k 2 leads to a higher value of Î´ x t h as can be found by comparing fig 4 a2 and b2 unlike in fig 4 a3 the most values of Î´ x t h Î´ x t in fig 4 b3 are smaller than zero suggesting that an underestimate of slr induced swi occurs by adopting the assumption of a homogeneous aquifer in fig 4 c1 c3 k 3 10 m d and k 1 and k 2 are varied between 1 and 1000 m d a single value of Î´ x t is obtained and Î´ x t h increases with the increase of k 1 and k 2 as expected as k 1 k 3 and k 2 k 3 Î´ x t h Î´ x t indicating that using the homogenous assumption would overestimate swi caused by slr fig 5 shows the sensitivity of Î´ x t and Î´ x t h to the layer thickness of the flux controlled unconfined aquifer in which the differences between the two parameters are also given we assume that k 1 k 2 10 m d so that the coastal aquifer has actually two layers for the sake of simplicity the thickness of h 1 h 2 is varied between 0 and 30 m k 3 1 and 100 m d are selected respectively in fig 5 a1 a3 and fig 5 b1 b3 respectively as shown when k 3 is one order of magnitude less than the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer both Î´ x t h and Î´ x t h Î´ x t increase with increasing thickness of h 1 h 2 resulting in an increasing extent of the overestimate of slr induced swi see fig 5 a3 when k 3 is one order of magnitude larger than the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer by contrast both Î´ x t h and Î´ x t h Î´ x t decrease with increasing thickness of h 1 h 2 leading to an increasing extent of the underestimate of slr induced swi see fig 5 b3 furthermore it can be seen that the degree of the overestimate or underestimate is linearly dependent on the magnitude of k 3 as shown for h 1 h 2 varied from 0 to 30 m the variation of Î´ x t h is about 14 m and 140 m for k 3 1 and 100 m d respectively 5 3 head controlled layered coastal aquifer eqs 38 and 43 indicate that an equivalent homogeneous k can not be derived for the head controlled coastal systems since the two equations are independent of k it can be proved from the analytical solutions that the interface toe location in the head controlled coastal system is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers i e k 1 k 3 and k 2 k 3 as also pointed out by lu et al 2013a fig 6 shows the sensitivity of inland freshwater flux before and after slr to log k 1 k 3 and log k 2 k 3 for the head controlled unconfined three layer coastal aquifer where h 1 h 2 10 m h l 32 m is fixed at l 2000 m and log k 1 k 3 and log k 2 k 3 are varied between 2 and 2 as indicated a larger k 1 k 3 and k 2 k 3 correspond to a larger freshwater flux slr leads to a reduction in the freshwater flux and the reduced freshwater flux causes intrusion of seawater fig 7 shows that the sensitivity of the interface toe locations before and after x t slr and the interface movement distance to log k 1 k 3 and log k 2 k 3 for the head controlled three layer unconfined coastal aquifer where the colored planes indicate the values obtained for the corresponding homogeneous aquifer the values below the colored face indicate that using the homogeneous aquifer assumption would overestimate the corresponding parameter an examination of these figures shows that a larger k 1 k 3 and a smaller k 2 k 3 result in a smaller x t x t and Î´xt in particular when k 1 k 3 100 and k 2 k 3 0 01 Î´ x t derived by the layered and homogenous models are 546 and 809 m respectively representing an overestimate of 48 by using the homogeneous model to predict the interface movement distance on the other hand a smaller k 1 k 3 and k 2 k 3 give a higher value of x t x t and Î´ x t which may lead to the underestimate of these three parameters under the homogeneous aquifer assumption to study the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe movement for the head controlled coastal system we assume a simple two layer coastal aquifer i e k 1 k 2 10 m d similar to the assumption adopted for the above flux controlled coastal system fig 8 shows the sensitivity of the inland freshwater flux before and after slr to the layer thickness of the head controlled unconfined aquifer in which k 1 k 2 10 m d and k 3 1 bottom and 100 top are chosen respectively and h 1 h 2 is varied from 0 to 30 m with a step of 1 m in the appendix we have provided the expression of the freshwater flux under the assumption of k 1 k 2 it can be proved analytically that with increasing h 1 h 2 the magnitude of the freshwater flux decreases when k 1 k 3 and increases when k 1 k 3 physically the magnitude of the inland freshwater flux increases with increasing proportion of the more permeable layer and decreases with increasing proportion of the less permeable layer as shown in fig 8 the magnitudes of q f and q f decreases and increases monotonically with increasing h 1 h 2 for the cases of k 1 k 3 0 1 and 10 respectively specifically when k 1 k 3 0 1 q f decreases from 2 62 to 0 41 m2 d and q f decreases from 0 96 to 0 17 m2 d for h 1 h 2 increasing from 1 to 30 m respectively by contrast when k 1 k 3 10 q f decreases from 0 03 to 0 24 m2 d and q f decreases from 0 01 to 0 09 m2 d for the same variation of h 1 h 2 respectively fig 9 shows the sensitivity of x t x t and Î´ x t to the layer thickness of the head controlled unconfined aquifer in which k 1 k 3 0 1 top and 10 bottom are chosen respectively the analytical solution of the interface toe location in a two layer unconfined coastal aquifer with a constant flux boundary condition has been derived based on eq 4 18 x t 1 1 Î± k 3 h s 2 k 1 k 3 h 1 h 2 2 2 Î± q f when considering a constant head inland boundary condition q f varies with the variation of h 1 h 2 as shown in fig 8 therefore with decreasing h 1 h 2 the monotonicity of the numerator is the same as the denominator in eq 18 for both cases of k 1 k 3 and k 1 k 3 the same monotonicity of the numerator and denominator in eq 18 leads to the difficulty in understanding the monotonicity of xt with respect to h 1 h 2 when k 1 k 3 0 1 i e the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer is one order or magnitude less than that of the lower layer x t and x t are a non monotonic function of h 1 h 2 both parameters increase first and then decrease as h 1 h 2 is varied from 0 to 30 m with a step of 1 m however Î´ x t increases monotonically with increasing h 1 h 2 when k 1 k 3 10 by contrast x t x t and Î´ x t are a non monotonic function of h 1 h 2 and they all decrease first and then increase with increasing h 1 h 2 it is obvious that the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location in the head controlled unconfined coastal system is more complicated than in the flux controlled unconfined coastal system as changing the layer thickness would change not only the overall transmissivity but also the inland freshwater flux the sensitivities of the layer hydraulic conductivity and thickness on the interface toe position toe response distance and inland freshwater flux for the head controlled confined aquifer are similar to those for the head controlled unconfined aquifer in terms of both trend and magnitude for the sake of conciseness these results are not shown here 6 conclusion we have studied the impact of the srl on swi in a layered coastal aquifer using the analytical method developed by strack and ausk 2015 in particular we give the specific analytical solutions for swi in three layer confined and unconfined coastal aquifer with consideration of both constant flux and constant head inland boundary conditions the analytical solution is in well agreement with the previous laboratory experimental result of a three layer aquifer with a constant head inland boundary condition the main conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis are as follows 1 in general the impact of aquifer stratification on swi caused by slr is twofold it affects either or both the initial location and response distance of the interface toe as such the stratification property of a coastal aquifer should be considered when assessing swi in response of slr 2 for flux controlled unconfined layered coastal systems the toe response distance caused by slr is a linear function of the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer and independent of hydraulic conductivities of lower layers though the interface toe location is determined by hydraulic conductivities of all layers the sensitivity analysis based on a three layer coastal aquifer indicates that using an equivalent homogeneous hydraulic conductivity obtained by assuming the same initial interface toe location as that in the layered coastal aquifer would overestimate or underestimate the toe response distance depending on the hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the layers 3 for flux controlled confined layered coastal systems slr can not lead to the variation of the steady state interface toe location which is consistent with the previous finding for the homogeneous coastal aquifer strack 1976 chang et al 2011 however aquifer stratification would affect the interface toe location 4 the interface toe location in head controlled layered coastal systems is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers which is consistent with the previous finding obtained by numerical simulations lu et al 2013a and 5 the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location and response distance in the head controlled system exhibits a more complicated pattern than in the flux controlled coastal system since changing the layer thickness would change both the overall aquifer transmissivity and inland freshwater flux our analysis and results have deepened the understanding of slr on swi in coastal aquifer through the consideration of aquifer stratification while the analytical solutions and findings are based on various assumptions e g steady state horizontal layer and sharp interface they could provide a first order tool to assess slr induced swi and a preliminary guide to manage groundwater resources in a layered coastal aquifer future work is required to investigate swi induced by slr in a layered coastal aquifer under

7181,a typical engineered flood protection for a community exposed to fluvial flooding is constructions of flood defense dedicated for public wide protection over the past few years there have been efforts to mainstreaming individual precautionary measures as to reduce risk of flooding consideration of individual protection measures alongside public protection measures is mainly to increase resistance of local communities to flood impacts whilst deliberating the spatial constraints of public protection measures and optimizing cost of adaptation however quantification of vulnerability and risk reduction of combined public and individual protection measures has not received much attention far less a risk based economic analysis in assisting flood risk management decision making a systematic approach to quantify vulnerability and flood risk of conditions with the combined protection measures is deemed crucial this study proposes a methodology to assess vulnerability and flood risk of flooding considering combined public and individual protection measures aiming for relevant applications in economic appraisal of local protection options the applicability of the methodology is demonstrated using a case study of a residential area of teddington near the greater london a range of different possible levels of protection was also included to exemplify the usefulness of the methodology in search for an optimal protection level the results show that the combined public and individual protection can reduce flood risk significantly the study highlights that the methodology can serve as a tool for a practical and manageable vulnerability and flood risk assessment keywords vulnerability curve flood risk micro scale flood damage assessment public and individual protection measures 1 introduction floods are one of the costliest natural disasters although the risk of flooding cannot be entirely avoided it can be reduced with effective flood risk management strategies developed through proper evaluation of different alternative measures through economic evaluations of alternative options flood risk can be reduced cost effectively cammerer et al 2013 of the important pillars that economic evaluation lies are the investigations and comparison of vulnerability and flood risk of status quo and with of different options of flood protection measures xian et al 2017 vulnerability assessment considers potential flood consequences whilst risk is by integrating a range of probability weighted consequences the former typically involves physical modelling of a flood prone area of interest and the extent of inundation due to high water level the latter requires analysis of probability of flood events which then be integrated with a representative function of vulnerability in practice probability of flood events and vulnerability are assessed separately before they are integrated for the flood risk estimation olesen et al 2017 vulnerability and flood risk assessment pertaining local protection measures requires inputs of appropriate detail spatial characteristics of the area under study in effort to have a near representation of the real case chinh et al 2017 detail spatial characteristics of the study area such as the elevation distance of a river to the vulnerable area or the location of a flood defense relative to the protected community are important to quantitatively discern the effects of with and without protection measures one widely used approach to extract spatial details is by using high resolution topography data collected details from the data can be processed through a micro scale approach i e building level to investigate the discerning effects of with and without protection measures jongman et al 2012 or of different flood magnitudes in the final risk estimates garrote et al 2016 studies on vulnerability or flood damage using the micro scale approach has gained interest over the last decades kreibich et al 2011 koks et al 2015 de moel et al 2015 the micro scale approach is suitable for economic appraisals involving local engineering protection measures such as protection to single buildings e g arrighi et al 2013 garrote et al 2016 a few studies have attempted to quantify flood risk considering with or without engineering protection measures on a local community area using the micro scale approach however none have yet to establish a systematic approach for repetitive computations involving a range of possible flood inundation level and or a range of possible combined flood protection levels this may be due to the additional complexity of handling multiple models e g hydraulic models damage model in the process of risk estimation or difficulty on handling uncertainties from large amount of hydrologic and spatial data the absence of a systematic and tractable methodology that can conveniently be used for vulnerability and flood risk assessment may hinder the effort to mainstream risk based appraisals of local engineering flood protection measures local engineering flood protection measures can broadly be classified into two groups the first is public protection measures ppm that are aimed to provide protection to the community without focusing specifically on individual buildings these are structural measures such as defenses placed adjacent to the river the second is individual protection measures ipm that are aimed to provide protection specifically on single buildings but can also be targeted to a large number of buildings on the community area ipm can help to reduce the impact of flooding with installations of water barriers on buildings or water resistance materials in buildings that prevent or reduce water intrusion into the properties de moel and aerts 2011 existence of ppm helps to increase resistance capability of the community from flood risk indirectly existence of ppm influences the willingness of people to settle in the protected area it is found that selling price of properties in a floodplain with levee protection is higher as compared to properties without the protection fell and kousky 2015 however a defense structure existence is restricted by several factors such as unavailability of space geotechnical limitation and aesthetic reasons ward et al 2017 these limitations may be a hindrance to reach an optimal level of protection that lead to other measures being considered studies have found that ipm have the potential of tackling projected increase in flood risk aerts et al 2014 great britain 2014a emerging acceptance of ipm as an effective local flood protection can be found in government documents of developed countries e g great britain 2016 fema 2012 where most research related to ipm have been undertaken so far kreibich et al 2015 jongman et al 2012 adoptions of ipm for local flood protection could be a positive addition to the ppm to reduce flood risk more cost effectively from a macroeconomic point of view although this is generally true there is still no available methodology for the estimation of flood risk of a combined ppm and ipm considering a range of flood events and impacts vulnerability and flood risk estimations associated with existence of ppm ipm or the combination of them ippm will be beneficial to inform the vulnerable community and the policy makers on the degree of exposure and the potential losses with and without flood protection of various options the findings would promote uptakes of ipm to the community at risk osberghaus 2015 shao et al 2017 and serve as recommendations to policy makers to improve investment policies and strategies involving local flood protection these emphasize that such findings can significantly help to assist voluntary behavior and policy making this study aims to develop a user friendly methodology for vulnerability and flood risk assessment that suits to local flood protection conditions specifically considering ppm ipm and ippm as flood protection options the methodology will be designed for recursive computations considering a range of possible flood events and different protection levels of ipm ppm and ippm the degree of vulnerability is captured in terms of discharge damage function the discharge damage function is governed by a set of spatially dependence functions flood loadings and protection levels because of the recursive computations required and spatially dependence functions entail the local assessment a systematic and stepwise approach is explicitly erected within the methodology the target is to minimize computational expenses whilst allowing preliminary outputs to be easily extracted and analyzed when needed the following contents start with the proposed methodology in section 2 followed by the application and result of vulnerability and flood risk assessment in section 3 the conclusions and discussions of the main findings are presented in section 4 2 methodology in this study vulnerability to flooding is represented by economic damages resulting from extreme flow discharges i e a discharge damage curve the extreme flow discharges represent the exogenous variable of the vulnerability curve a maximum inundation level caused by the extreme discharge is considered to cause direct economic damages to the vulnerable community the methodology focuses on fluvial flooding and four flood risk adaptation options 1 without ipm or ppm i e a status quo condition 2 with ppm 3 with ipm and 4 with ippm for the condition of with ppm a flood defense existence adjacent to a river is considered with the protection threshold represented by its crest level resulting maximum inundation level on the protected vicinity for the case of with ppm is considered to be governed by an exceedance volume of extreme river discharge that flows over the crest the overflow volume can be linked to both the consequential damage linked by the maximum inundation level and the discharge the former produces a volume damage relationship and the former a discharge volume relationship these two relationships can further be interpolated to establish the final vulnerability curve of discharge damage relationship the condition of with ipm has been presented in rehan 2018 and is not repeated here the present study proposes a methodology that serves as a tool for vulnerability and flood risk assessments involving ppm and ippm adoptions see fig 1 for vulnerability assessment input data required for the vulnerability assessment tool are spatial information flood hydrographs depth damage relationship and levels of protection of ppm and ipm first row of fig 1 the input data are processed through a set of pre processing activities second row of fig 1 to established desired main sub functions the first sub function relates overflow volume with the causal extreme flows refer section 2 1 the second sub function relates water level and volume refer section 2 1 and the third sub function is level damage relationship refer section 2 2 the first two aim to establish a link between the source of hazard i e extreme discharges and the flood indicator i e water level the latter is to link between the flood indicator and the possible flood impact which indicates the exposure of the community to flood impact in this study water level and water stage refer to the same meaning and are used interchangeably all three sub functions obtained from the pre processing activities are further interpolated to establish discharge volume and volume damage relationships third row of fig 1 the discharge volume and volume damage relationships are finally interpolated to obtain a discharge damage relationship i e the vulnerability curve section 2 3 vulnerability curve associated with the option considered is then brought forward for the flood risk estimation section 2 4 2 1 flood overflow volume flood overflow volume represents the amount of water into the protected vicinity once the extreme discharge exceeds a ppm design protection the overflow volume v can be estimated by integrating the overflow discharge eq 2 the overflow discharge q in can be expressed using the broad crested weir equation eq 1 e g de kok and grossmann 2010 hence the volume is a function of flood defense length l overflow head h ds and the time of exceedance event with t r as time when the crest level is first exceeded and t l as time when water completely recedes from overflowing event eq 3 the length of the defense is a direct input whilst the time of exceedance event can be obtained from historical flood hydrographs the overflow head can be determined based on information of exceeded water level and flood defense crest level linking the overflow volume and their causal peak discharges would provide the discharge volume relationship which is one of the input of the assessment tool see third column of fig 1 note that the peak discharges are not the same as the overflow discharges a stage discharge relationship is taken as a transfer function to relate the overflow discharge and the peak discharge of which the overflow head is the linking variable see eq 1 this will be explained more in the subsequent paragraph a stage discharge relationship generally relates flow discharges not necessary peak discharges and water levels it is commonly used in hydrology or hydraulic analysis where it can be formed based on an established rating curve or by hydraulic modelling di baldassarre 2012 this study takes the advantage of applying a readily available software of hydraulic models called conveyance and afflux estimation system software developed by hr wallingford ltd 2001 for the stage discharge relationship 1 q in 1 705 l h ds 3 2 2 v t l t r q in dt 3 v 1 705 l t l t r h ds 3 2 dt the overflow head of the weir equation can be illustrated as a one dimensional case it is computed based on the difference between a resulting water level of a peak discharge and the flood defense crest level using a stage discharge relationship of a constrained river because of a flood defense existence one can determine the water level of the peak discharge and the crest level of a design protection this means that the peak discharge and a design discharge corresponding to the crest level are required inputs to determine the overflow head the detail process on how stage discharge relationship can be established using the conveyance and afflux estimation system software is provided in rehan 2018 another input required to solve eq 3 is the start and end time of the flood exceedance event this information tells the period of water level exceeds the crest level the methodology uses flood hydrographs to extract the information with a design discharge of flood defense and a peak discharge assigned to delineate the start and end time of the flood event to fit into a numerical estimation framework a standardized hydrograph is proposed to be used a standardized hydrograph is built based on calculated ratio between discretized instantaneous discharges and a peak discharge of a historical flood hydrograph variation from different historical flood events is to be captured and used in the numerical computations by constructing a median standardized hydrograph from a group of historical flood hydrographs of similar flood generating mechanisms such as localized precipitation events e g sherwood 1993 dunsmore 1997 the methodology for the discharge volume relationship aims for a recursive computation that can minimize computational time the target is to repeatedly estimate the overflow volume in an automated manner given a range of peak discharge and a number of ppm design discharge fig 2 input of an ascending range of peak discharges is first assigned accordingly it is best that the range is selected cautiously with reference to historical flood magnitudes and the established median standardized hydrograph natural numbers indexed as j is assigned to the ascending peak discharges the range of peak discharge is assigned with a specific ppm design discharge for each computation cycle for each peak discharge at j and the specific ppm design discharge a flood generating sequence between the two magnitudes will be produced each vector of the sequence are assigned with natural numbers indexed as k for subsequent numerical computations the time and overflow head associated with each vector at index k is determined using the stage discharge relationship and the standardized hydrograph respectively this allows an incremental overflow head over time to be established and integrated to estimate the overflow volume repeating the computation for each peak discharge at j with the specific ppm design discharge allows a range of overflow volume to be estimated for the whole range of peak discharge pairing the estimated overflow volume and the associated peak discharge will form a discharge volume relationship to look at results from different possible ppm design discharge the workflow can be repeated for a different ppm design discharge this approach assumes that a ppm structure is fully capable to withstand hydrostatic forces of flood loading backwater effects are not considered in the methodology assuming that the length of the embankment is far greater than the overflow head hamill 2011 studies that have included the backwater effect consider critical depths on the crest level for the effects to take place e g dutta et al 2013 arrighi et al 2013 to simulate a resulting inundation level in the protected vicinity caused by the overflow volume the methodology further adopts the so called semi dynamic approach rather than assuming a maximum inundation level from the source of hazard alone i e a static inundation approach the semi dynamic approach includes the computation of flood volume over the crest level this means that the overflow volume is conceptually spread over the protected vicinity area which determines the corresponding maximum inundation level the semi dynamic approach is found to perform better as compared to a static modelling approach breilh et al 2013 especially when flood defense is considered to link between the overflow volume and the maximum inundation level on the protected vicinity spatial information of the protected area and gis tools can be used the spatial information such as ground elevations need to be of high resolution to capture the discrete maximum inundation levels of different flood magnitudes to suit for local assessment this is especially important when the topography area is relatively flat to discern the variation of the ground elevation which is expected to be small e g rehan 2018 using reverse engineering the relationship between overflow volumes and maximum inundation levels is established by introducing an inundation layer that acts as the maximum inundation level to a dtm intersections between the layer the dtm contour and the location of proposed flood defense of the same elevation form a confined space by transforming the terrain elevation within the confined space into triangular irregular networks tin chinh et al 2017 the corresponding volume can be estimated the volume of the confined space indicates the volume that can be filled by the overflow water up to the level of the layer introduced by repeating the process for a number of inundation layers a stage volume relationship can be formed the stage volume relationship is one of the modelling components for the vulnerability assessment see fig 1 2 2 exposure to flood impact assessment of vulnerability to flooding requires one to characterize what elements of on the community area that would be at risk schanze 2006 the characterization of elements at risk would be governed by the type of damage considered for example indirect damage or direct damage may lead to different characterizations of the elements at risk although worldview would suggest that as many types of flood impact should be considered in such assessment this is expensive and can only possible with abundant of available resources and capacity typically types of damage to be considered depends on resources availability historical evidences and stakeholders preferences this study focuses on direct and tangible damage to residential buildings on the virtue that this type of damage are generally less challenging to monetized as compared to indirect and intangible damage one important component for the estimation of direct tangible damage is the depth damage curve depth damage curve is widely used to indicate the exposure of an element at risk for example a residential building the exposure is expressed in economic terms and is indicated by flood depth hence the depth damage curve e g de moel and aerts 2011 in many countries depth damage curves are established from years of studies and have been widely used for urban flood damage assessment schrÃ¶ter et al 2014 estimation of flood losses for case studies in the same geographical regions may take the advantage of the available depth damage curves but these curves should be used with caution if they are to be adopted elsewhere cammerer et al 2013 if a derivation of a new depth damage curve tailored to a specific country is sought empirical data or synthetic data can be used to indicate possible monetary losses for a given range of flood depth penning rowsell and green 2000 the methodology proposed here incorporate the use of a depth damage curve into the micro scale approach where damage is assessed on individual buildings this means that a maximum inundation level would result in different flood depths for different ground elevation levels of buildings the resulting total damage caused by a range of maximum inundation levels to individual buildings of diverse ground elevations is termed level damage relationship second row of fig 1 for the level damage relationship the methodology adopts the algorithm proposed in rehan 2018 readers can refer directly to the paper for further explanation on the algorithm considering individual protection measures adoption i e the ipm the total damage is estimated based on inputs from the depth damage curve the ground floor elevation levels of buildings and the ipm extent the extent of protection refers to the highest buildings on the study area that is being protected with ipm for conditions with flood defense i e the ppm or ippm the methodology considers no direct influence of the embankment crest level to the level damage relationship however the defense crest level influences the degree to which the potential damage area can be inundated this is captured using the level volume relationship where peak discharge is considered to cause flooding at the protected vicinity only when the crest level is overtopped in the case where a peak discharge result in a maximum inundation level greater than the crest level overflow volume is no longer considered and the level damage relationship is directly used for the vulnerability assessment this is further elaborated in the subsequent section 2 3 vulnerability in this study a discharge damage relationship represents the degree of vulnerability of the community to flooding the generic forms of the vulnerability following the proposed methodology is shown in eqs 4 and 5 these equations are governed by two distinct conditions a condition when the maximum inundation level is lower than the defense crest level leads to eq 4 and a condition when the maximum inundation level fully overtopped the defense level leads to eq 5 note that the governing conditions are associated with ppm however eq 5 is also used for the case of the status quo and of ipm 4 vulnerability curve h v q 5 vulnerability curve d h q q is the discharge v is the overflow volume h is the inundation level on the floodplain and d is the total damage the vulnerability curves of eqs 4 and 5 are formed by numerical integration of a set of outputs from pre processing activities considering a condition when flood event is not causing a crest level to be fully overtopped 4 a discharge volume relationship i e v q is established following the methodology in section 2 1 a volume damage relationship i e d v is obtained by interpolation of a level volume relationship i e h v and a level damage relationship i e d h methodologies for the level volume relationship is presented in section 2 1 and for the level damage relationship is given in section 2 2 for cases where the flood event ultimately causes the crest level to be fully overtopped or when there is no defense considered a d h and a stage discharge relationship i e h q are directly interpolated to establish the discharge damage relationship this is by considering minimal influence of the defense existence when the maximum inundation level is fully overtopped the crest level fig 3 shows the workflow that combines the output from the pre processing activities to estimate the total monetary losses for the case of ippm adoption and special cases for ppm or ipm alone the workflow encapsulates how the possible different combination of ppm levels and ipm extents influence the estimation of the total monetary losses of ippm the numerical computation within the workflow is governed by two assigned indicators the first indicator represents a discharge threshold of no damage as a result of the ipm extent q p lim the magnitude of q p lim is associated with a maximum inundation level that causes no damage to determine the magnitude of q p lim the maximum inundation level that corresponds to the ipm extent in height above datum is first assigned the maximum inundation level is then converted into flood volume using the level volume relationship finally the flood volume is used to search for the corresponding discharge i e q p lim from the discharge volume relationship the second indicator represents a discharge threshold before the crest level is fully overtopped q lim the magnitude of q lim is determined by first identify the flood defense design level from the design discharge through interpolation of the stage discharge relationship of a confined channel flood volume that causes the inundation surface to be on the same level with the flood defense crest is then determined from an interpolation of the level volume relationship the magnitude of q lim can then be found by interpolation of the discharge volume relationship the structure of the numerical computation is distinguished into three linked sections see fig 3 the first and the second sections focus on identifying the q p lim and the q lim and to compare them with the input peak discharge q p respectively the third section is the subsequent computation of total monetary losses a greater peak discharge than the q p lim q p q p lim indicates that the inundation level exceeds the ipm extent and would incur damage otherwise the inundation level is below the ipm extent and buildings are free from direct flood impacts for the former case the peak discharge is subsequently compared with the q lim if the peak discharge is greater than q lim the calculation for total losses follows that of eq 5 based on the assumption that the inundation level fully overtops the embankment crest level otherwise 4 is used for the calculation of total losses the computation is repeated for a range of peak discharges and different pairs of ppm design discharges and ipm extents the results are tabulated to form discharge damage relationships i e the vulnerability curves of the various possible protection designs and extents 2 4 residual risk risk can generally be defined as the product of hazard and vulnerability zhou et al 2012 in this study the flood hazard is represented by a probability function of the extreme flows the probability of extreme flows is estimated based on yearly maxima data of flow discharges and under the stationary assumption given the stationary assumption of the probability distribution the estimated risk is expected to be constant throughout the appraisal years hence hold the definition of risk as expected annual damage fema 2012 the risk as the integration of the probability function and the vulnerability function can be denoted as eq 6 where f q is the probability distribution function d q is the vulnerability curve and q max and q min is the upper and lower limit of integration respectively 6 risk q min q max f q d q dq the lower integration limit is the minimum damaging peak discharge of a status quo case which can be determined using the stage discharge relationship of without the ppm or ipm the case of ippm uses a minimum magnitude peak discharge associated with the ipm extent following the notations in section 2 3 the minimum peak discharge associated with the case of ipm adoption refers to the q p lim meanwhile the upper limit of integration can be represented by a suitable maximum magnitude of discharge that reflects a significantly small probability of occurrence e g rehan 2018 3 application and results example application of the methodology is illustrated using historical river flows i e for the probability distribution function and hydrograph and spatial input i e topography cross section for hydraulic modelling and density of residential buildings over incremental ground elevations of a local area in teddington london the residential areas located in the case study area represents the elements at risk and the status quo condition is considered without ppm nor ipm details on the historical floods of the area can be found in rehan 2018 the determination of the probability distribution function has been undertaken in rehan and hall 2016 whilst the processing of the topography elevation levels for the stage discharge relationship and the used of the density of buildings for the level damage relationship can be found in rehan 2018 in rehan 2018 vulnerability curve and flood risk of the area with ipm of various protection extents have been established the present study further used the developed probability distribution function the stage discharge relationship and the stage damage relationship for vulnerability and flood risk assessment involving ppm and ippm the following sections present estimations of flood volume estimations of flood exposure vulnerability curve formation and estimations of flood risk overall four ppm design discharges nine ipm extents and 36 different combinations of protection for ippm were considered for the vulnerability and flood risk estimations 3 1 estimation of overflow volume estimation of flood volumes following the methodology laid out in section 2 1 are for the generation of discharge volume relationship and level volume relationship the discharge volume relationship should be constructed based on an appropriate range of possible damaging extreme flows to capture the sufficient range of damaging flows a lower boundary and an upper boundary of the flood risk system were defined the lower boundary represents a protection design discharge whilst the upper boundary represents a peak flow that is amongst the possible highest these boundaries have been determined in rehan 2018 for the study area based on historical evidences historical flow records stage discharge curves and locations of buildings the stage discharge curve of the status quo case was adjusted to impose higher degree of exposure for which the vulnerability curve for different cases can be discerned detail explanations on the reason for adjustments is provided in rehan 2018 for the case of ppm adoption the adjusted status quo cross section was further modified to impose a wall between the river and the community area the height of the wall was set to be high enough for which a sufficient range of the stage discharge curve can be captured 19 peak flows of damaging flood events were extracted after the screening of historical annual maxima flows the largest magnitude of peak flow recorded was 800 m3 s and this was selected as the maximum peak discharge for the assessment of vulnerability and risk hydrographs associated with the peak flows were extracted out from the records to construct a standardized hydrograph and later a median standardized hydrograph see fig 4 upon examining the median standardized hydrograph it was found that the smallest ratio of design discharge to peak discharge from the historical events is approximately 0 45 since the largest magnitude of peak discharge of the historical records is 800 m3 s this study considered flood defense protection design of 400 m3 s as the minimum possible protection design discharge this is to avoid extrapolation and absurd estimates four ppm design discharges are considered 400 450 500 and 550 m3 s these four protection design discharges are equivalent to flood defense crest heights of 0 44 0 61 0 77 0 93 m from their ground elevation the conversions of the design discharges to the crest elevation levels were made by interpolating the values from the stage discharge relationship of the constrained main channel the length of the flood defense is taken as 800 m table 1 shows an example output of the volume estimation for 500 m3 s embankment design discharge with 50 m3 s intervals of peak flow magnitudes estimated volume correspond to each peak discharge is shown in the final column estimated volume for all four protection design discharges against peak discharges can be distinguished by plotting the results on a same scale see fig 5 by default the flood volume into the protected area is directly proportional to the extreme flows for a constant design discharge it is also obvious that the overflow volume is reduced when a higher design discharge is considered for cases with a constant extreme discharge see fig 5 3 2 estimation of storage volume floodplain storage volumes that represent possible inundation levels for the area was estimated using gis tools and adjusted dem of the study area the dem of 1 cm resolution obtained from the environment agency uk great britain 2014b was adjusted to find the relationship between the storage volume and the inundation height the latter represents a maximum crest level before the crest is assumed to be fully submerged volumes of floodplain storage associated with the range of maximum inundation levels were estimated using the triangular irregular network tin processing in the gis software fig 6 shows the range of storage volume associated with maximum inundation depths the maximum inundation depths were calculated based on the difference in height of lowest ground elevations within enclosed areas and imaginary horizontal planes that represent maximum inundation elevations 3 3 flood exposure this study adopts the depth damage relationship of residential sector average values from the multi colored manual penning rowsell et al 2010 the economic values have been estimated based on the uk 2005 price and are based on a minimum 12 h flood inundation scenario the stage damage relationships associated with the considered ipm extent estimated in rehan 2018 were used in the present study it was assumed that the ipm is of the dry proofing type measures kreibich et al 2015 that can hold water up to 0 6 m above the ground level sufficient early warning lead time is considered to provide ample time for the dry proofing measures to be installed prior to flood occurrences and it is assumed to be fully functional 3 4 vulnerability and risk assessment this section presents the establishment of vulnerability curves and flood risk estimates of the condition with ppm and the condition with ippm of the study area following the methodology proposed in sections 2 3 and 2 4 the vulnerability curves of the condition with ppm shows that flood damage is reduced significantly for relatively frequent peak discharge fig 7 the same result is found for the example case of ippm with ppm design discharge of 400 m3 s and ppm of various protection extent fig 8 however the result shows that the combined protection i e the ippm generally reduces expected damages more dramatically as compared to the ppm adoptions the curves of conditions with ppm ipm and ippm can be seen to reunite with the vulnerability curve of the status quo case at some points along the extreme discharge axis respectively this is due to the switch of the methodology for the damage estimation within the numerical computation set up see fig 3 a higher protection level implies a larger portion of flood volume that can be accumulated behind the embankment hence a greater magnitude indicator before the change of methodology numerical estimates of risk are governed by the vulnerability curves and the pdf of the extreme flows of thames at kingston annual and present value risks for each possible combination of ippm following the numerical estimation of eq 6 section 2 4 are tabulated in a matrix table table 2 special cases of the status quo case where neither ipm nor ppm adopted were also documented the present value pv risks were calculated considering flood risk as average annual damages using 20 years as the appraisal period and a discount rate of 3 5 the appraisal period of 20 years considers possible ipm average lifespan great britain 2016 whilst 3 5 follows that from great britain 2011 it is assumed that the protection measures are well maintained or replaced over the period to remain a constant protection threshold in the appraisal all values were rounded up to the nearest thousand the pv risk can be seen declining for adoptions of higher protection level of ippm reduction of the pv risk by the highest level of ppm considered i e crest level of 0 93 m above ground is 97 5 whereas reduction of the pv risk by the farthest extent of individual protection measures considered i e 127 buildings protected as compared to the status quo is 91 9 furthermore the highest protection level considered for ippm adoption is estimated to reduce flood risks approximately 99 these findings indicate that all adaptation options considered in this study are able to reduce flood risk by more than 90 to further examine the benefit of these options a specific target of protection for each option is considered 1 ipm extent that provides protection to 32 buildings located the nearest to the river 2 ppm with embankment crest elevation height of 0 77 m located near to the river and 3 ippm with protection to 32 individual buildings and embankment crest elevation height of 0 77 m the calculated pv benefits of the protection targets are documented in a table together with the pv risks of the status quo and the considered protection targets for comparison table 3 all options lead to significant risk reduction benefits of which the highest comes from the condition with ippm followed by the condition with ipm the condition with ppm poses the least economic benefits having the flood defense in addition to the individual buildings protection provides about 19 extra protection as compared to adopting only the ipm whilst having the individual protection measures in addition to the ppm offers 3 extra benefit as compared to adopting only the ppm 4 discussion and conclusions the study provides a methodology to assess vulnerability and flood risk when public protection measures individual protection measures and the combined protection of both are considered the methodology encompasses pre processing activities to establish a discharge damage curve that represents the degree of vulnerability of a community at risk the discharge damage curve and a probability function of extreme discharge were integrated for risk estimations the feasibility of the methodology was successfully tested using an exemplary case study of a residential area in thames at kingston london vulnerability residual risks and risk reduction benefits of different protection levels were quantified and presented in a matrix table a set of target protection levels of the public and individual protection measures were selected to compare the economic benefits of risk reduction the type of measures that provides the highest reduction in flood risk compared to the status quo condition is the combined protection of 0 8 meter height flood defense and 32 buildings individually protected it can be analyzed further from the results that the protection of 0 8 meter height flood defense alone or of 32 individually protected buildings alone can also significantly reduce flood risk although by a small margin as compared to the combined measures the difference of risk reduction benefit between the 0 8 meter height flood defense and the combined measures is 3 whilst between the 32 individually protected buildings and the combined measures is 15 the results are consistent with a logical reasoning that a combined protection level would provide greater resistance to flood risk as compared to either the public or individual protection measures alone however preference on the combined measures would need to be justified along with other non economic reasonings a flood defense alone may not achieve an economically optimal protection for example loss of amenities tourism and livelihood activities when a flood defense is built too high in such cases individual protection measures can increase the protection up to an optimal level on the other hand individual protection measures may not be a suitable stand alone protection since the installation time of demountable equipment and humans anxiety might jeopardize the workability of the equipment humans anxiety or lack of awareness on the installation work might reduce the effectiveness of such measures despite the many shortcomings of individual protection measures technologies have evolved in the past few years that increase their reliability and promotes uptakes of these measures alongside the incumbent public protection measures the methodology proposed from this study provides a novel systematic approach to assess vulnerability of the combined individual and public protection measures it shows that the economic assessment of vulnerability and flood risk can be implemented transparently findings from the application of the methodology would be useful to inform stakeholders on the relative benefits of risk reduction of many alternative protection levels in the perspective of decision making accounting the cost of implementation along with the economic benefits would be more meaningful greater protection will incur more costs and balancing the cost and benefit will reach to an optimal protection level this can be a basis to evaluate the alternative protection levels in the context of long term investment strategy through the cost benefit analysis an optimal protection level can be evaluated and identified using economic indicators such as total present value cost net present value and benefit cost ratio tung 2005 jonkman et al 2009 kind 2010 the present methodology encapsulates many assumptions and modelling simplifications it aims towards ease and manageable application of flood risk assessment in the real world there is however a myriad of uncertainties that underlies the many assumptions the methodology considers deterministic functions and unchanging probability of extreme flows for the vulnerability and flood risk estimates whereas flood risk itself is a result of uncertain world phenomenon for example extreme flows entail inherent variability that may change over time and hydraulic properties is certainly change over land surfaces and conditions the study also limits the feasibility testing of the proposed methodology to residential buildings whilst there are probably other elements at risk that contribute significantly to the overall flood damage further studies can be undertaken to explicitly address these uncertainties and or improve modelling errors 1 the probability function of the hazard can be assigned with relevant covariates such as time to allow for a changing probability over time 2 different types of elements at risk that may contribute significantly to the estimated damage may be considered for example by inclusion of environmental impacts e g yu et al 2016 and or 3 protection measures lifespan and discount rate overall the methodology opens to a wider discussion on economic benefits associated with public and individual protection measures the information from the assessment can also promotes a wider uptake of individual protections measures moreover the consideration of the combined public and individual protection measures in the quantitative assessment of vulnerability and flood risk provides valuable information for policy makers decisions can be made more cost effectively whilst accounting the non economic factors such assessment further encourages national adaptation strategies development that accounts local circumstances

7181,a typical engineered flood protection for a community exposed to fluvial flooding is constructions of flood defense dedicated for public wide protection over the past few years there have been efforts to mainstreaming individual precautionary measures as to reduce risk of flooding consideration of individual protection measures alongside public protection measures is mainly to increase resistance of local communities to flood impacts whilst deliberating the spatial constraints of public protection measures and optimizing cost of adaptation however quantification of vulnerability and risk reduction of combined public and individual protection measures has not received much attention far less a risk based economic analysis in assisting flood risk management decision making a systematic approach to quantify vulnerability and flood risk of conditions with the combined protection measures is deemed crucial this study proposes a methodology to assess vulnerability and flood risk of flooding considering combined public and individual protection measures aiming for relevant applications in economic appraisal of local protection options the applicability of the methodology is demonstrated using a case study of a residential area of teddington near the greater london a range of different possible levels of protection was also included to exemplify the usefulness of the methodology in search for an optimal protection level the results show that the combined public and individual protection can reduce flood risk significantly the study highlights that the methodology can serve as a tool for a practical and manageable vulnerability and flood risk assessment keywords vulnerability curve flood risk micro scale flood damage assessment public and individual protection measures 1 introduction floods are one of the costliest natural disasters although the risk of flooding cannot be entirely avoided it can be reduced with effective flood risk management strategies developed through proper evaluation of different alternative measures through economic evaluations of alternative options flood risk can be reduced cost effectively cammerer et al 2013 of the important pillars that economic evaluation lies are the investigations and comparison of vulnerability and flood risk of status quo and with of different options of flood protection measures xian et al 2017 vulnerability assessment considers potential flood consequences whilst risk is by integrating a range of probability weighted consequences the former typically involves physical modelling of a flood prone area of interest and the extent of inundation due to high water level the latter requires analysis of probability of flood events which then be integrated with a representative function of vulnerability in practice probability of flood events and vulnerability are assessed separately before they are integrated for the flood risk estimation olesen et al 2017 vulnerability and flood risk assessment pertaining local protection measures requires inputs of appropriate detail spatial characteristics of the area under study in effort to have a near representation of the real case chinh et al 2017 detail spatial characteristics of the study area such as the elevation distance of a river to the vulnerable area or the location of a flood defense relative to the protected community are important to quantitatively discern the effects of with and without protection measures one widely used approach to extract spatial details is by using high resolution topography data collected details from the data can be processed through a micro scale approach i e building level to investigate the discerning effects of with and without protection measures jongman et al 2012 or of different flood magnitudes in the final risk estimates garrote et al 2016 studies on vulnerability or flood damage using the micro scale approach has gained interest over the last decades kreibich et al 2011 koks et al 2015 de moel et al 2015 the micro scale approach is suitable for economic appraisals involving local engineering protection measures such as protection to single buildings e g arrighi et al 2013 garrote et al 2016 a few studies have attempted to quantify flood risk considering with or without engineering protection measures on a local community area using the micro scale approach however none have yet to establish a systematic approach for repetitive computations involving a range of possible flood inundation level and or a range of possible combined flood protection levels this may be due to the additional complexity of handling multiple models e g hydraulic models damage model in the process of risk estimation or difficulty on handling uncertainties from large amount of hydrologic and spatial data the absence of a systematic and tractable methodology that can conveniently be used for vulnerability and flood risk assessment may hinder the effort to mainstream risk based appraisals of local engineering flood protection measures local engineering flood protection measures can broadly be classified into two groups the first is public protection measures ppm that are aimed to provide protection to the community without focusing specifically on individual buildings these are structural measures such as defenses placed adjacent to the river the second is individual protection measures ipm that are aimed to provide protection specifically on single buildings but can also be targeted to a large number of buildings on the community area ipm can help to reduce the impact of flooding with installations of water barriers on buildings or water resistance materials in buildings that prevent or reduce water intrusion into the properties de moel and aerts 2011 existence of ppm helps to increase resistance capability of the community from flood risk indirectly existence of ppm influences the willingness of people to settle in the protected area it is found that selling price of properties in a floodplain with levee protection is higher as compared to properties without the protection fell and kousky 2015 however a defense structure existence is restricted by several factors such as unavailability of space geotechnical limitation and aesthetic reasons ward et al 2017 these limitations may be a hindrance to reach an optimal level of protection that lead to other measures being considered studies have found that ipm have the potential of tackling projected increase in flood risk aerts et al 2014 great britain 2014a emerging acceptance of ipm as an effective local flood protection can be found in government documents of developed countries e g great britain 2016 fema 2012 where most research related to ipm have been undertaken so far kreibich et al 2015 jongman et al 2012 adoptions of ipm for local flood protection could be a positive addition to the ppm to reduce flood risk more cost effectively from a macroeconomic point of view although this is generally true there is still no available methodology for the estimation of flood risk of a combined ppm and ipm considering a range of flood events and impacts vulnerability and flood risk estimations associated with existence of ppm ipm or the combination of them ippm will be beneficial to inform the vulnerable community and the policy makers on the degree of exposure and the potential losses with and without flood protection of various options the findings would promote uptakes of ipm to the community at risk osberghaus 2015 shao et al 2017 and serve as recommendations to policy makers to improve investment policies and strategies involving local flood protection these emphasize that such findings can significantly help to assist voluntary behavior and policy making this study aims to develop a user friendly methodology for vulnerability and flood risk assessment that suits to local flood protection conditions specifically considering ppm ipm and ippm as flood protection options the methodology will be designed for recursive computations considering a range of possible flood events and different protection levels of ipm ppm and ippm the degree of vulnerability is captured in terms of discharge damage function the discharge damage function is governed by a set of spatially dependence functions flood loadings and protection levels because of the recursive computations required and spatially dependence functions entail the local assessment a systematic and stepwise approach is explicitly erected within the methodology the target is to minimize computational expenses whilst allowing preliminary outputs to be easily extracted and analyzed when needed the following contents start with the proposed methodology in section 2 followed by the application and result of vulnerability and flood risk assessment in section 3 the conclusions and discussions of the main findings are presented in section 4 2 methodology in this study vulnerability to flooding is represented by economic damages resulting from extreme flow discharges i e a discharge damage curve the extreme flow discharges represent the exogenous variable of the vulnerability curve a maximum inundation level caused by the extreme discharge is considered to cause direct economic damages to the vulnerable community the methodology focuses on fluvial flooding and four flood risk adaptation options 1 without ipm or ppm i e a status quo condition 2 with ppm 3 with ipm and 4 with ippm for the condition of with ppm a flood defense existence adjacent to a river is considered with the protection threshold represented by its crest level resulting maximum inundation level on the protected vicinity for the case of with ppm is considered to be governed by an exceedance volume of extreme river discharge that flows over the crest the overflow volume can be linked to both the consequential damage linked by the maximum inundation level and the discharge the former produces a volume damage relationship and the former a discharge volume relationship these two relationships can further be interpolated to establish the final vulnerability curve of discharge damage relationship the condition of with ipm has been presented in rehan 2018 and is not repeated here the present study proposes a methodology that serves as a tool for vulnerability and flood risk assessments involving ppm and ippm adoptions see fig 1 for vulnerability assessment input data required for the vulnerability assessment tool are spatial information flood hydrographs depth damage relationship and levels of protection of ppm and ipm first row of fig 1 the input data are processed through a set of pre processing activities second row of fig 1 to established desired main sub functions the first sub function relates overflow volume with the causal extreme flows refer section 2 1 the second sub function relates water level and volume refer section 2 1 and the third sub function is level damage relationship refer section 2 2 the first two aim to establish a link between the source of hazard i e extreme discharges and the flood indicator i e water level the latter is to link between the flood indicator and the possible flood impact which indicates the exposure of the community to flood impact in this study water level and water stage refer to the same meaning and are used interchangeably all three sub functions obtained from the pre processing activities are further interpolated to establish discharge volume and volume damage relationships third row of fig 1 the discharge volume and volume damage relationships are finally interpolated to obtain a discharge damage relationship i e the vulnerability curve section 2 3 vulnerability curve associated with the option considered is then brought forward for the flood risk estimation section 2 4 2 1 flood overflow volume flood overflow volume represents the amount of water into the protected vicinity once the extreme discharge exceeds a ppm design protection the overflow volume v can be estimated by integrating the overflow discharge eq 2 the overflow discharge q in can be expressed using the broad crested weir equation eq 1 e g de kok and grossmann 2010 hence the volume is a function of flood defense length l overflow head h ds and the time of exceedance event with t r as time when the crest level is first exceeded and t l as time when water completely recedes from overflowing event eq 3 the length of the defense is a direct input whilst the time of exceedance event can be obtained from historical flood hydrographs the overflow head can be determined based on information of exceeded water level and flood defense crest level linking the overflow volume and their causal peak discharges would provide the discharge volume relationship which is one of the input of the assessment tool see third column of fig 1 note that the peak discharges are not the same as the overflow discharges a stage discharge relationship is taken as a transfer function to relate the overflow discharge and the peak discharge of which the overflow head is the linking variable see eq 1 this will be explained more in the subsequent paragraph a stage discharge relationship generally relates flow discharges not necessary peak discharges and water levels it is commonly used in hydrology or hydraulic analysis where it can be formed based on an established rating curve or by hydraulic modelling di baldassarre 2012 this study takes the advantage of applying a readily available software of hydraulic models called conveyance and afflux estimation system software developed by hr wallingford ltd 2001 for the stage discharge relationship 1 q in 1 705 l h ds 3 2 2 v t l t r q in dt 3 v 1 705 l t l t r h ds 3 2 dt the overflow head of the weir equation can be illustrated as a one dimensional case it is computed based on the difference between a resulting water level of a peak discharge and the flood defense crest level using a stage discharge relationship of a constrained river because of a flood defense existence one can determine the water level of the peak discharge and the crest level of a design protection this means that the peak discharge and a design discharge corresponding to the crest level are required inputs to determine the overflow head the detail process on how stage discharge relationship can be established using the conveyance and afflux estimation system software is provided in rehan 2018 another input required to solve eq 3 is the start and end time of the flood exceedance event this information tells the period of water level exceeds the crest level the methodology uses flood hydrographs to extract the information with a design discharge of flood defense and a peak discharge assigned to delineate the start and end time of the flood event to fit into a numerical estimation framework a standardized hydrograph is proposed to be used a standardized hydrograph is built based on calculated ratio between discretized instantaneous discharges and a peak discharge of a historical flood hydrograph variation from different historical flood events is to be captured and used in the numerical computations by constructing a median standardized hydrograph from a group of historical flood hydrographs of similar flood generating mechanisms such as localized precipitation events e g sherwood 1993 dunsmore 1997 the methodology for the discharge volume relationship aims for a recursive computation that can minimize computational time the target is to repeatedly estimate the overflow volume in an automated manner given a range of peak discharge and a number of ppm design discharge fig 2 input of an ascending range of peak discharges is first assigned accordingly it is best that the range is selected cautiously with reference to historical flood magnitudes and the established median standardized hydrograph natural numbers indexed as j is assigned to the ascending peak discharges the range of peak discharge is assigned with a specific ppm design discharge for each computation cycle for each peak discharge at j and the specific ppm design discharge a flood generating sequence between the two magnitudes will be produced each vector of the sequence are assigned with natural numbers indexed as k for subsequent numerical computations the time and overflow head associated with each vector at index k is determined using the stage discharge relationship and the standardized hydrograph respectively this allows an incremental overflow head over time to be established and integrated to estimate the overflow volume repeating the computation for each peak discharge at j with the specific ppm design discharge allows a range of overflow volume to be estimated for the whole range of peak discharge pairing the estimated overflow volume and the associated peak discharge will form a discharge volume relationship to look at results from different possible ppm design discharge the workflow can be repeated for a different ppm design discharge this approach assumes that a ppm structure is fully capable to withstand hydrostatic forces of flood loading backwater effects are not considered in the methodology assuming that the length of the embankment is far greater than the overflow head hamill 2011 studies that have included the backwater effect consider critical depths on the crest level for the effects to take place e g dutta et al 2013 arrighi et al 2013 to simulate a resulting inundation level in the protected vicinity caused by the overflow volume the methodology further adopts the so called semi dynamic approach rather than assuming a maximum inundation level from the source of hazard alone i e a static inundation approach the semi dynamic approach includes the computation of flood volume over the crest level this means that the overflow volume is conceptually spread over the protected vicinity area which determines the corresponding maximum inundation level the semi dynamic approach is found to perform better as compared to a static modelling approach breilh et al 2013 especially when flood defense is considered to link between the overflow volume and the maximum inundation level on the protected vicinity spatial information of the protected area and gis tools can be used the spatial information such as ground elevations need to be of high resolution to capture the discrete maximum inundation levels of different flood magnitudes to suit for local assessment this is especially important when the topography area is relatively flat to discern the variation of the ground elevation which is expected to be small e g rehan 2018 using reverse engineering the relationship between overflow volumes and maximum inundation levels is established by introducing an inundation layer that acts as the maximum inundation level to a dtm intersections between the layer the dtm contour and the location of proposed flood defense of the same elevation form a confined space by transforming the terrain elevation within the confined space into triangular irregular networks tin chinh et al 2017 the corresponding volume can be estimated the volume of the confined space indicates the volume that can be filled by the overflow water up to the level of the layer introduced by repeating the process for a number of inundation layers a stage volume relationship can be formed the stage volume relationship is one of the modelling components for the vulnerability assessment see fig 1 2 2 exposure to flood impact assessment of vulnerability to flooding requires one to characterize what elements of on the community area that would be at risk schanze 2006 the characterization of elements at risk would be governed by the type of damage considered for example indirect damage or direct damage may lead to different characterizations of the elements at risk although worldview would suggest that as many types of flood impact should be considered in such assessment this is expensive and can only possible with abundant of available resources and capacity typically types of damage to be considered depends on resources availability historical evidences and stakeholders preferences this study focuses on direct and tangible damage to residential buildings on the virtue that this type of damage are generally less challenging to monetized as compared to indirect and intangible damage one important component for the estimation of direct tangible damage is the depth damage curve depth damage curve is widely used to indicate the exposure of an element at risk for example a residential building the exposure is expressed in economic terms and is indicated by flood depth hence the depth damage curve e g de moel and aerts 2011 in many countries depth damage curves are established from years of studies and have been widely used for urban flood damage assessment schrÃ¶ter et al 2014 estimation of flood losses for case studies in the same geographical regions may take the advantage of the available depth damage curves but these curves should be used with caution if they are to be adopted elsewhere cammerer et al 2013 if a derivation of a new depth damage curve tailored to a specific country is sought empirical data or synthetic data can be used to indicate possible monetary losses for a given range of flood depth penning rowsell and green 2000 the methodology proposed here incorporate the use of a depth damage curve into the micro scale approach where damage is assessed on individual buildings this means that a maximum inundation level would result in different flood depths for different ground elevation levels of buildings the resulting total damage caused by a range of maximum inundation levels to individual buildings of diverse ground elevations is termed level damage relationship second row of fig 1 for the level damage relationship the methodology adopts the algorithm proposed in rehan 2018 readers can refer directly to the paper for further explanation on the algorithm considering individual protection measures adoption i e the ipm the total damage is estimated based on inputs from the depth damage curve the ground floor elevation levels of buildings and the ipm extent the extent of protection refers to the highest buildings on the study area that is being protected with ipm for conditions with flood defense i e the ppm or ippm the methodology considers no direct influence of the embankment crest level to the level damage relationship however the defense crest level influences the degree to which the potential damage area can be inundated this is captured using the level volume relationship where peak discharge is considered to cause flooding at the protected vicinity only when the crest level is overtopped in the case where a peak discharge result in a maximum inundation level greater than the crest level overflow volume is no longer considered and the level damage relationship is directly used for the vulnerability assessment this is further elaborated in the subsequent section 2 3 vulnerability in this study a discharge damage relationship represents the degree of vulnerability of the community to flooding the generic forms of the vulnerability following the proposed methodology is shown in eqs 4 and 5 these equations are governed by two distinct conditions a condition when the maximum inundation level is lower than the defense crest level leads to eq 4 and a condition when the maximum inundation level fully overtopped the defense level leads to eq 5 note that the governing conditions are associated with ppm however eq 5 is also used for the case of the status quo and of ipm 4 vulnerability curve h v q 5 vulnerability curve d h q q is the discharge v is the overflow volume h is the inundation level on the floodplain and d is the total damage the vulnerability curves of eqs 4 and 5 are formed by numerical integration of a set of outputs from pre processing activities considering a condition when flood event is not causing a crest level to be fully overtopped 4 a discharge volume relationship i e v q is established following the methodology in section 2 1 a volume damage relationship i e d v is obtained by interpolation of a level volume relationship i e h v and a level damage relationship i e d h methodologies for the level volume relationship is presented in section 2 1 and for the level damage relationship is given in section 2 2 for cases where the flood event ultimately causes the crest level to be fully overtopped or when there is no defense considered a d h and a stage discharge relationship i e h q are directly interpolated to establish the discharge damage relationship this is by considering minimal influence of the defense existence when the maximum inundation level is fully overtopped the crest level fig 3 shows the workflow that combines the output from the pre processing activities to estimate the total monetary losses for the case of ippm adoption and special cases for ppm or ipm alone the workflow encapsulates how the possible different combination of ppm levels and ipm extents influence the estimation of the total monetary losses of ippm the numerical computation within the workflow is governed by two assigned indicators the first indicator represents a discharge threshold of no damage as a result of the ipm extent q p lim the magnitude of q p lim is associated with a maximum inundation level that causes no damage to determine the magnitude of q p lim the maximum inundation level that corresponds to the ipm extent in height above datum is first assigned the maximum inundation level is then converted into flood volume using the level volume relationship finally the flood volume is used to search for the corresponding discharge i e q p lim from the discharge volume relationship the second indicator represents a discharge threshold before the crest level is fully overtopped q lim the magnitude of q lim is determined by first identify the flood defense design level from the design discharge through interpolation of the stage discharge relationship of a confined channel flood volume that causes the inundation surface to be on the same level with the flood defense crest is then determined from an interpolation of the level volume relationship the magnitude of q lim can then be found by interpolation of the discharge volume relationship the structure of the numerical computation is distinguished into three linked sections see fig 3 the first and the second sections focus on identifying the q p lim and the q lim and to compare them with the input peak discharge q p respectively the third section is the subsequent computation of total monetary losses a greater peak discharge than the q p lim q p q p lim indicates that the inundation level exceeds the ipm extent and would incur damage otherwise the inundation level is below the ipm extent and buildings are free from direct flood impacts for the former case the peak discharge is subsequently compared with the q lim if the peak discharge is greater than q lim the calculation for total losses follows that of eq 5 based on the assumption that the inundation level fully overtops the embankment crest level otherwise 4 is used for the calculation of total losses the computation is repeated for a range of peak discharges and different pairs of ppm design discharges and ipm extents the results are tabulated to form discharge damage relationships i e the vulnerability curves of the various possible protection designs and extents 2 4 residual risk risk can generally be defined as the product of hazard and vulnerability zhou et al 2012 in this study the flood hazard is represented by a probability function of the extreme flows the probability of extreme flows is estimated based on yearly maxima data of flow discharges and under the stationary assumption given the stationary assumption of the probability distribution the estimated risk is expected to be constant throughout the appraisal years hence hold the definition of risk as expected annual damage fema 2012 the risk as the integration of the probability function and the vulnerability function can be denoted as eq 6 where f q is the probability distribution function d q is the vulnerability curve and q max and q min is the upper and lower limit of integration respectively 6 risk q min q max f q d q dq the lower integration limit is the minimum damaging peak discharge of a status quo case which can be determined using the stage discharge relationship of without the ppm or ipm the case of ippm uses a minimum magnitude peak discharge associated with the ipm extent following the notations in section 2 3 the minimum peak discharge associated with the case of ipm adoption refers to the q p lim meanwhile the upper limit of integration can be represented by a suitable maximum magnitude of discharge that reflects a significantly small probability of occurrence e g rehan 2018 3 application and results example application of the methodology is illustrated using historical river flows i e for the probability distribution function and hydrograph and spatial input i e topography cross section for hydraulic modelling and density of residential buildings over incremental ground elevations of a local area in teddington london the residential areas located in the case study area represents the elements at risk and the status quo condition is considered without ppm nor ipm details on the historical floods of the area can be found in rehan 2018 the determination of the probability distribution function has been undertaken in rehan and hall 2016 whilst the processing of the topography elevation levels for the stage discharge relationship and the used of the density of buildings for the level damage relationship can be found in rehan 2018 in rehan 2018 vulnerability curve and flood risk of the area with ipm of various protection extents have been established the present study further used the developed probability distribution function the stage discharge relationship and the stage damage relationship for vulnerability and flood risk assessment involving ppm and ippm the following sections present estimations of flood volume estimations of flood exposure vulnerability curve formation and estimations of flood risk overall four ppm design discharges nine ipm extents and 36 different combinations of protection for ippm were considered for the vulnerability and flood risk estimations 3 1 estimation of overflow volume estimation of flood volumes following the methodology laid out in section 2 1 are for the generation of discharge volume relationship and level volume relationship the discharge volume relationship should be constructed based on an appropriate range of possible damaging extreme flows to capture the sufficient range of damaging flows a lower boundary and an upper boundary of the flood risk system were defined the lower boundary represents a protection design discharge whilst the upper boundary represents a peak flow that is amongst the possible highest these boundaries have been determined in rehan 2018 for the study area based on historical evidences historical flow records stage discharge curves and locations of buildings the stage discharge curve of the status quo case was adjusted to impose higher degree of exposure for which the vulnerability curve for different cases can be discerned detail explanations on the reason for adjustments is provided in rehan 2018 for the case of ppm adoption the adjusted status quo cross section was further modified to impose a wall between the river and the community area the height of the wall was set to be high enough for which a sufficient range of the stage discharge curve can be captured 19 peak flows of damaging flood events were extracted after the screening of historical annual maxima flows the largest magnitude of peak flow recorded was 800 m3 s and this was selected as the maximum peak discharge for the assessment of vulnerability and risk hydrographs associated with the peak flows were extracted out from the records to construct a standardized hydrograph and later a median standardized hydrograph see fig 4 upon examining the median standardized hydrograph it was found that the smallest ratio of design discharge to peak discharge from the historical events is approximately 0 45 since the largest magnitude of peak discharge of the historical records is 800 m3 s this study considered flood defense protection design of 400 m3 s as the minimum possible protection design discharge this is to avoid extrapolation and absurd estimates four ppm design discharges are considered 400 450 500 and 550 m3 s these four protection design discharges are equivalent to flood defense crest heights of 0 44 0 61 0 77 0 93 m from their ground elevation the conversions of the design discharges to the crest elevation levels were made by interpolating the values from the stage discharge relationship of the constrained main channel the length of the flood defense is taken as 800 m table 1 shows an example output of the volume estimation for 500 m3 s embankment design discharge with 50 m3 s intervals of peak flow magnitudes estimated volume correspond to each peak discharge is shown in the final column estimated volume for all four protection design discharges against peak discharges can be distinguished by plotting the results on a same scale see fig 5 by default the flood volume into the protected area is directly proportional to the extreme flows for a constant design discharge it is also obvious that the overflow volume is reduced when a higher design discharge is considered for cases with a constant extreme discharge see fig 5 3 2 estimation of storage volume floodplain storage volumes that represent possible inundation levels for the area was estimated using gis tools and adjusted dem of the study area the dem of 1 cm resolution obtained from the environment agency uk great britain 2014b was adjusted to find the relationship between the storage volume and the inundation height the latter represents a maximum crest level before the crest is assumed to be fully submerged volumes of floodplain storage associated with the range of maximum inundation levels were estimated using the triangular irregular network tin processing in the gis software fig 6 shows the range of storage volume associated with maximum inundation depths the maximum inundation depths were calculated based on the difference in height of lowest ground elevations within enclosed areas and imaginary horizontal planes that represent maximum inundation elevations 3 3 flood exposure this study adopts the depth damage relationship of residential sector average values from the multi colored manual penning rowsell et al 2010 the economic values have been estimated based on the uk 2005 price and are based on a minimum 12 h flood inundation scenario the stage damage relationships associated with the considered ipm extent estimated in rehan 2018 were used in the present study it was assumed that the ipm is of the dry proofing type measures kreibich et al 2015 that can hold water up to 0 6 m above the ground level sufficient early warning lead time is considered to provide ample time for the dry proofing measures to be installed prior to flood occurrences and it is assumed to be fully functional 3 4 vulnerability and risk assessment this section presents the establishment of vulnerability curves and flood risk estimates of the condition with ppm and the condition with ippm of the study area following the methodology proposed in sections 2 3 and 2 4 the vulnerability curves of the condition with ppm shows that flood damage is reduced significantly for relatively frequent peak discharge fig 7 the same result is found for the example case of ippm with ppm design discharge of 400 m3 s and ppm of various protection extent fig 8 however the result shows that the combined protection i e the ippm generally reduces expected damages more dramatically as compared to the ppm adoptions the curves of conditions with ppm ipm and ippm can be seen to reunite with the vulnerability curve of the status quo case at some points along the extreme discharge axis respectively this is due to the switch of the methodology for the damage estimation within the numerical computation set up see fig 3 a higher protection level implies a larger portion of flood volume that can be accumulated behind the embankment hence a greater magnitude indicator before the change of methodology numerical estimates of risk are governed by the vulnerability curves and the pdf of the extreme flows of thames at kingston annual and present value risks for each possible combination of ippm following the numerical estimation of eq 6 section 2 4 are tabulated in a matrix table table 2 special cases of the status quo case where neither ipm nor ppm adopted were also documented the present value pv risks were calculated considering flood risk as average annual damages using 20 years as the appraisal period and a discount rate of 3 5 the appraisal period of 20 years considers possible ipm average lifespan great britain 2016 whilst 3 5 follows that from great britain 2011 it is assumed that the protection measures are well maintained or replaced over the period to remain a constant protection threshold in the appraisal all values were rounded up to the nearest thousand the pv risk can be seen declining for adoptions of higher protection level of ippm reduction of the pv risk by the highest level of ppm considered i e crest level of 0 93 m above ground is 97 5 whereas reduction of the pv risk by the farthest extent of individual protection measures considered i e 127 buildings protected as compared to the status quo is 91 9 furthermore the highest protection level considered for ippm adoption is estimated to reduce flood risks approximately 99 these findings indicate that all adaptation options considered in this study are able to reduce flood risk by more than 90 to further examine the benefit of these options a specific target of protection for each option is considered 1 ipm extent that provides protection to 32 buildings located the nearest to the river 2 ppm with embankment crest elevation height of 0 77 m located near to the river and 3 ippm with protection to 32 individual buildings and embankment crest elevation height of 0 77 m the calculated pv benefits of the protection targets are documented in a table together with the pv risks of the status quo and the considered protection targets for comparison table 3 all options lead to significant risk reduction benefits of which the highest comes from the condition with ippm followed by the condition with ipm the condition with ppm poses the least economic benefits having the flood defense in addition to the individual buildings protection provides about 19 extra protection as compared to adopting only the ipm whilst having the individual protection measures in addition to the ppm offers 3 extra benefit as compared to adopting only the ppm 4 discussion and conclusions the study provides a methodology to assess vulnerability and flood risk when public protection measures individual protection measures and the combined protection of both are considered the methodology encompasses pre processing activities to establish a discharge damage curve that represents the degree of vulnerability of a community at risk the discharge damage curve and a probability function of extreme discharge were integrated for risk estimations the feasibility of the methodology was successfully tested using an exemplary case study of a residential area in thames at kingston london vulnerability residual risks and risk reduction benefits of different protection levels were quantified and presented in a matrix table a set of target protection levels of the public and individual protection measures were selected to compare the economic benefits of risk reduction the type of measures that provides the highest reduction in flood risk compared to the status quo condition is the combined protection of 0 8 meter height flood defense and 32 buildings individually protected it can be analyzed further from the results that the protection of 0 8 meter height flood defense alone or of 32 individually protected buildings alone can also significantly reduce flood risk although by a small margin as compared to the combined measures the difference of risk reduction benefit between the 0 8 meter height flood defense and the combined measures is 3 whilst between the 32 individually protected buildings and the combined measures is 15 the results are consistent with a logical reasoning that a combined protection level would provide greater resistance to flood risk as compared to either the public or individual protection measures alone however preference on the combined measures would need to be justified along with other non economic reasonings a flood defense alone may not achieve an economically optimal protection for example loss of amenities tourism and livelihood activities when a flood defense is built too high in such cases individual protection measures can increase the protection up to an optimal level on the other hand individual protection measures may not be a suitable stand alone protection since the installation time of demountable equipment and humans anxiety might jeopardize the workability of the equipment humans anxiety or lack of awareness on the installation work might reduce the effectiveness of such measures despite the many shortcomings of individual protection measures technologies have evolved in the past few years that increase their reliability and promotes uptakes of these measures alongside the incumbent public protection measures the methodology proposed from this study provides a novel systematic approach to assess vulnerability of the combined individual and public protection measures it shows that the economic assessment of vulnerability and flood risk can be implemented transparently findings from the application of the methodology would be useful to inform stakeholders on the relative benefits of risk reduction of many alternative protection levels in the perspective of decision making accounting the cost of implementation along with the economic benefits would be more meaningful greater protection will incur more costs and balancing the cost and benefit will reach to an optimal protection level this can be a basis to evaluate the alternative protection levels in the context of long term investment strategy through the cost benefit analysis an optimal protection level can be evaluated and identified using economic indicators such as total present value cost net present value and benefit cost ratio tung 2005 jonkman et al 2009 kind 2010 the present methodology encapsulates many assumptions and modelling simplifications it aims towards ease and manageable application of flood risk assessment in the real world there is however a myriad of uncertainties that underlies the many assumptions the methodology considers deterministic functions and unchanging probability of extreme flows for the vulnerability and flood risk estimates whereas flood risk itself is a result of uncertain world phenomenon for example extreme flows entail inherent variability that may change over time and hydraulic properties is certainly change over land surfaces and conditions the study also limits the feasibility testing of the proposed methodology to residential buildings whilst there are probably other elements at risk that contribute significantly to the overall flood damage further studies can be undertaken to explicitly address these uncertainties and or improve modelling errors 1 the probability function of the hazard can be assigned with relevant covariates such as time to allow for a changing probability over time 2 different types of elements at risk that may contribute significantly to the estimated damage may be considered for example by inclusion of environmental impacts e g yu et al 2016 and or 3 protection measures lifespan and discount rate overall the methodology opens to a wider discussion on economic benefits associated with public and individual protection measures the information from the assessment can also promotes a wider uptake of individual protections measures moreover the consideration of the combined public and individual protection measures in the quantitative assessment of vulnerability and flood risk provides valuable information for policy makers decisions can be made more cost effectively whilst accounting the non economic factors such assessment further encourages national adaptation strategies development that accounts local circumstances

7182,the objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of static and dynamic land use input conditions on the performance of non point source nps model and find out whether dynamic land use input can improve the model accuracy soil and water assessment tool swat model was selected as the evaluation model and seven different land use input conditions were set by setting the land use update file in swat the results showed that the land use pattern in the study area changed from 2000 to 2015 due to climate change and human activities leading to inconsistencies between different land use patterns the calibrated results indicated that dynamic land use input conditions could apparently improve the simulation accuracy of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp ce5y condition had the best calibrated result with r 2 and nse larger than 0 7 and 0 6 respectively however for flow simulation the land use input conditions had no apparent effect on the model calibration and validation results the deviation analysis of the model outputs indicated that monthly outputs were more affected by the land use input conditions than annual outputs and that deviations in wet seasons were larger than those in normal and dry seasons the highest mad occurred in june and august with a value of 82 87 t and 1 56 t for tn and tp respectively this study revealed the importance to consider the land use change when simulating the nps pollution and could provide support for land use input settings of nps pollution models keywords nonpoint source pollution swat model climate change and human activity static and dynamic land use input uncertainty analysis 1 introduction non point source nps pollution has been widely studied in recent years because it contains many uncertainties and is harder to control than point source pollution shen et al 2015 chen et al 2017 many studies have shown that nps pollution has become the primary source of water contamination rather than point source pollution wang et al 2004 mi et al 2015 the simulation of nps pollution should be carried out to provide information for its management the mechanism models have been widely used to simulate nps pollution with the development of computer science and the better understanding of the migration and transformation mechanism of pollutants in the real world moges et al 2017 yang et al 2017a the soil and water assessment tool swat the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf models have been used for the majority of nps pollution simulations ahn and kim 2016 karki et al 2017 teshager et al 2017 compared to the previously used export coefficient method and empirical models the mechanism models have a higher simulation accuracy and universality liu et al 2017b to appropriately control nps pollution the spatial and temporal characteristics of nps pollution first need to be analyzed using models the processes of nps pollution generation and discharge are affected by many factors such as land use type topography soil characteristics and meteorological conditions yang et al 2017c lin et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 these factors are also the basic input data for most nps pollution models thus the simulation results will be significantly affected by the spatial distribution and temporal changes in these input data bajracharya et al 2018 goyal et al 2018 the spatial distribution data of these factors were used in most of the nps models considering the impacts of spatial variation of input data on the nps pollution simulation du et al 2016 ouyang et al 2016 in addition the impacts of the spatial resolution of these input data on model outputs have also been analyzed by many studies kumar et al 2017 sun et al 2017 however for the temporal variations in nps only the time series of meteorological conditions were considered in most nps models while the other input data such as land use type topography and soil characteristics were set as invariable during the simulation periods chen et al 2013 liu et al 2013 2014 analyzing the temporal characteristics of nps pollution is conducive to the management of nps contamination thus the simulation periods of nps pollution were usually long from several years to several decades and simulation periods longer than 10 years were the most common ouyang et al 2014 zhai et al 2014 liu et al 2017b the temporal change of nps pollution represents its response to changes in input data meteorological conditions experience the most change and have the greatest effects on the nps pollution discharge within one year but land use patterns will also change when the simulation periods are longer than several years many studies have found that land use will change significantly in 5 years sewnet and abebe 2017 gashaw et al 2018 minta et al 2018 when the time scale is large in addition to meteorological conditions the influence of land use change on the simulation of nps pollution cannot be ignored the impacts of land use change on nps pollution generation and discharge have received much focus in recent years chu et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 in these studies land use in different periods were used as input data to analyze the variations in model outputs resulting from land use change however land use in different periods was only set as different scenarios in these studies in each simulation process just one period of land use was used worku et al 2017 these studies mainly focused on the influence of the spatial variations in land use patterns in different periods on nps pollution without taking temporal changes in land use into consideration more recently wagner considered the land use dynamic change during swat simulation periods and found that different land use input scenarios during the period of simulation had great impacts on the swat model outputs wagner et al 2017 this discovery embodied the temporal characteristics of land use change but the analysis was only based on the predicted land use the impacts of land use in different period on the temporal characteristics of nps pollution need to be analyzed further in this study the impacts of different land use input conditions on the model simulations were studied based on the swat model in xiangxi river watershed the main goals of this study were to 1 study the impacts of different land use input conditions on the model performance based on the calibration and validation results 2 discuss whether dynamic land use input conditions can improve model performance and 3 analyze the impacts of the land use input conditions on model outputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiangxi river is approximately 94 km long and is located between 110 47 to 111 13 e and 30 96 to 31 67 n in the three gorges reservoir it flows through three counties and its drainage area covers approximately 3099 km2 fig 1 the altitude in the area

july and august represent the wet season april may september and october were the normal season and january february march november and december represent the dry season forest area dominates the total area of the watershed with a proportion more than 80 however due to excessive fertilizer application and livestock breeding the watershed still faces serious nps pollution liu et al 2016 2 2 swat model and calibration swat is a basin scale continuous time model that was developed by the united states department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars arnold et al 1998 the swat model is designed to simulate the impact of management on the hydrological processes and water quality kang et al 2006 the swat model has been developed over 30 years it is a descendant of the simulator for water resources in rural basins swrrb model arnold and williams 1987 to overcome the limitation that swrrb can only simulate 10 subbasins at a time the routing outputs to outlet roto model was merged with swrrb into the swat model arnold et al 1995 the swat model simulates the hydrological process based on the water balance equation eq 1 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final moisture content of soil sw 0 is the initial moisture content of soil on day i r day is the amount of rainfall on day i q surf is the surface runoff on day i e a is the evapotranspiration amount on day i w seep is the water transferred from the soil profile into the gas zone on day i and q gw is the return flow on day i the watershed will be divided into several subbasins in the swat model using the hydrological analysis function in arcgis software based on dem digital elevation model data winchell et al 2013 in each subbasin hydrological response units hrus were defined based on a unique combination of land use soil and slope data different inputs for these data will produce different definition of hrus soil and slope will not change greatly over a long time period while land use may change frequently the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup a program developed for the sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of the swat model abbaspour 2014 was used to calibrate the parameters in the swat model in this study the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup was selected as the calibration algorithm due to its good performance in large watersheds rostamian et al 2008 the coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to evaluate the performance

file in swat model which was used by swat to consider the land use change during the simulation period the spatial analysis and statistics function in arcgis was used to write the dynamic land use changes into the lup dat file seven independent models were set up based on these seven different land use input conditions the calibration and validation processes were carried out independently for each of the seven models i e each model would have its own unique combination of parameters after calibrated 2 4 uncertainty analysis methods the inconsistency index ic was used as the indicator to represent the degree of deviation between two land use patterns the value was calculated based on the kappa coefficient kappa coefficient is a method used to perform the consistency check and it can be used to evaluate the differences between different land use maps yang et al 2017b the value of the kappa coefficient ranges from 1 to 1 the higher the value is the more consistent the land use maps are the definition of the inconsistency index is eq 4 4 ic 1 k 100 k p 0 p e 1 p e p 0 s 1 s 2 s c n p e s 1 r 1 s 2 r 2 s c r c n n where k is the kappa coefficient p 0 is the total classification accuracy p e is the classification accuracy based on the confusion matrix s 1 s 2 s c are the simulated raster counts of each land use category r 1 r 2 r c are the actual raster counts of each land use category and n is the total raster counts of all land use categories the total inconsistency index tic was used to quantify the deviation between the land use data used in the model and that in the real situation for the entire simulation period in this study the ce5y condition was regarded as the real land use situation because the land use would not change too much in every five years and due to the data limitation this was the finest data we could obtain the total inconsistency index was defined as follows eq 5 5 tic i 1 n ic i where ic i is the inconsistency index at the i th node i is the land use change node at which the land use change occurs and n is the total count of the land use change nodes the uncertainty of the swat model outputs resulting from the different settings of land use input data was evaluated and quantified using several indicators relative difference rd mean absolute difference mad and root mean square deviation rmsd rd represented error percentage compared to the real data the reliability of the predicted data could be evaluated by rd easily mad could represent the real condition of the error better with a quantitative value rmsd could reflect the error between observed values and predicted values more obviously compared to mad because the square was used to magnify the deviation however mad and rmsd could be affected by the outliers easily particularly for rmsd while rd would not the definition of the three indicators was listed as follows eqs 6 8 6 rd p i s i s i 7 mad 1 n i 1 n p i s i 8 rmsd 1 n i 1 n p i s i 2 0 5 where p i is the predicted model output from the low changing frequency land use scenarios s i is the predicted model output from the ce5y which was used as a baseline for comparison with the outputs under other land use input scenarios and n is the number of sample pairs 3 results 3 1 land use change analysis the forest area exhibited a downtrend from 2000 to 2010 with decreasing areas of approximately 31 ha and 205 ha from 2000 to 2005 and 2005 to 2010 respectively fig 2 a the decreasing forest area was primarily converted into cultivated land different from 2000 to 2010 the forest area showed an uptrend from 2010 to 2015 and cultivated area decreased the forest area increased by up to 1 9 and the cultivated land area decreased by approximately 28 1 pasture water and urban areas exhibited continuous increases from 2000 to 2015 spatially there were no apparent differences between the land use patterns in 2000 and 2005 fig 2b in 2010 the increase in cultivated land area mainly occurred in the southern region of the watershed the water area stretched to the northern area due to the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir and the expansion of urban areas occurred along the river in 2015 the southwestern region of the watershed witnessed a decrease in cultivated land area particularly in the drylands the water area stretched further to the north of the watershed and a large area of urban land appeared in the middle of the watershed the results of ic for each of the two land use patterns showed that the land use patterns in 2000 and 2005 had the highest consistency with an ic of 1 08 and the land use patterns in 2000 and 2015 had the lowest consistency with an ic of 14 17 table 1 for different land use input conditions the tic values for the ce5y ce10y ce15y jy2000 jy2005 jy2010 and jy2015 conditions were 0 13 93 5 95 20 12 16 41 19 32 and 40 15 respectively the tic was relatively lower under dynamic land use input conditions than it was under static land use input conditions 3 2 calibration and validation under static land use input conditions for flow the calibration and validation results showed no apparent differences under different land use input conditions fig 3 a the r 2 and nse coefficient were above 0 71 and 0 68 respectively during the calibration periods in addition in the validation periods the r 2 and nse coefficient were even better than those in the calibration periods for tn the situation was quite different fig 3b the r 2 and nse coefficient under the jy2005 and jy2010 conditions were better than those under the jy2000 and jy2015 conditions during the calibration periods the nse coefficient under the jy2015 condition even dropped below 0 50 attention should be paid to the nse coefficients during the validation periods because the nse coefficients under all the conditions were quite low with values only reaching approximately 0 35 for tp the r 2 and nse coefficient were similar under different conditions and were above 0 60 and 0 50 respectively in the calibration periods fig 3c however in the validation periods the nse coefficients were quite low with values under 0 30 comparing the nse to the tic calculated previously it could be found that the calibration and validation of flow had no evident relationship with the land use input condition fig 4 however for tn the higher the tic of the land use input was the worse the calibration and validation results were similar to flow the tp calibration was influenced little by the land use input conditions while the nse coefficient dropped dramatically to values below 0 3 when the tic increased during the validation period 3 3 calibration and validation under dynamic land use input conditions for flow the r 2 and nse coefficients were both above 0 70 during the entire calibration and validation periods fig 5 a the calibration and validation results had no apparent relationship with tic for tn the calibrated results changed with changes in land use input conditions fig 5b the relationship between the tic and the nse coefficients was evident fig 4 the higher the tic was the worse the nse coefficient was for both calibration and validation periods in the ce10y scenario with the highest tic of the three dynamic conditions the nse coefficient was lower than 0 50 in the validation period for tp the r 2 and nse coefficient reached the requirement of the swat model accuracy with values of higher than 0 5 in the calibration period under all three dynamic conditions fig 5c however during the validation period the calibrated results could satisfy the model s accuracy requirement only under the ce5y condition compared to the static conditions the calibrated results for flow were similar to the r 2 and nse coefficient which were all approximately 0 7 during the calibration period and 0 8 during the validation period figs 4a and 5a however for tn it was better to use the dynamic land use input than the static land use input the nse coefficient increased from values of approximately 0 5 to 0 7 and from 0 3 to 0 5 during the calibration and validation periods respectively figs 4b and 5b for tp although the calibrated results reached the requirement of model accuracy under both the static and dynamic land use input conditions during the calibration period the nse coefficients under dynamic land use input conditions were better than those under static land use input conditions during the validation period figs 4c and 5c among all seven land use input conditions the results under the ce5y condition showed the best performance particularly for the tn and tp simulations the nse coefficient was 0 3 higher under the ce5y condition than those under other land use input conditions during the validation period for tn for tp during the validation period only the nse coefficient under the ce5y condition could reach the model s accuracy requirement while the nse coefficients under the other six land use input conditions were not higher than 0 3 3 4 uncertainty analysis of the swat model outputs all of the model outputs under different land use input conditions were compared with those under the ce5y condition to perform the uncertainty analysis for annual outputs the results showed that the uncertainties of the flow and tp outputs were relatively low and the tn outputs had the highest uncertainty fig 6 for flow the rds under different conditions were smaller than 10 except under the jy2000 and jy2015 conditions which had the highest tic table 2 the jy2015 condition had the highest mad and rmsd values while the ce15y condition had the lowest for tn the rd was only 1 under the ce15y condition with a tic of approximately 6 however with increasing tic the rds increased to more than 10 for tp the rds remained at approximately 3 under all conditions and the mad and rmsd values were also relatively low however it could be found that in the validation period 2016 a large difference existed for the tp outputs under different land use input conditions for the monthly outputs the deviations were more obvious than those for annual outputs fig 7 for flow a sudden increase of the rds occurred when the tic reached 20 table 3 the jy2015 condition had the highest mad and rmsd values of 238 80 and 270 70 respectively for tn under the static land use input conditions jy2000 jy2005 jy2010 and jy2015 the rds exceeded 20 and the jy2015 condition had a dramatic 76 rd for tp the rds under all land use input conditions reached 15 except under the ce15y condition the annual average monthly output and the monthly average deviation results were also analyzed and the results indicated that deviation in outputs mainly occurred in the wet season particularly for the tn and tp outputs fig 8 for tn the mad values were 154 94 t 64 76 t and 24 74 t in the wet normal and dry seasons respectively fig 8b the highest mad occurred in june with a value of 82 87 t the tn loads were apparently overestimated in the wet season under all land use input conditions except under the jy2015 condition for tp the mad values were 2 64 t 0 62 t and 1 18 t in the wet normal and dry seasons respectively fig 8c the highest mad occurred in august with a value of 1 56 t comparing tn with tp the simulation of tp load under land use change conditions was less affected by changes in hydrological conditions caused by climate change than that of tn the mad value in the wet season was six times that in the dry season for tn and twice that for tp 4 discussion the calibrated results of flow indicated that both the static and dynamic land use inputs could be used to obtain an acceptable calibration and validation results the results had no apparent relationship with the tic fig 4 this may be explained by the fact that land use is not the only decisive factor affecting runoff processes runoff processes are mainly driven by precipitation processes zhang et al 2018 and are affected by several factors such as soil moisture content groundwater characteristics and channel properties ruggenthaler et al 2015 house et al 2016 lu et al 2016 thus when carrying out a simulation of the flow generation in a watershed both the dynamic and static land use input approaches can be used however for tn the calibration and validation results from the dynamic land use input conditions were clearly better than those from the static land use input conditions when the tic was below 10 the nse coefficient reached values above 0 60 and 0 50 during calibration and validation periods respectively which represented a good calibrated result abbaspour 2014 in addition when the tic index was less than 20 the nse coefficient could reach values above 0 50 during the calibration period representing an acceptable calibrated result the results indicated that land use input conditions had a significant effect on the nps nitrogen simulation this was reasonable because nps nitrogen pollutants were mainly derived from cultivated land ouyang et al 2013 which changed with the conversion of land use patterns it should be noted that under the static conditions although the r 2 and nse coefficients were above 0 50 during the calibration period they were all below 0 50 during the validation periods thus if a simulation which has a time period longer than calibration period was required a land use input with a low tic was needed i e dynamic land use inputs were better for tp the similar calibrated results under different land use input conditions during the calibration periods indicated that the calibration process of tp was more affected by non unique parameters several parameter sets with different values may provide equally suitable model responses beven 1996 and due to the large amount of parameters participating in the tp calibration process this phenomenon is more significant mehdi et al 2017 however only when the tic was less than 5 could the nse coefficient reach 0 60 moreover during the validation periods the nse coefficients could reach 0 50 only under the ce5y condition thus land use patterns clearly have important effects on the simulation of phosphorus load wang et al 2015 through the perspective of calibration and validation results it could be found that different land use input conditions did have great importance on the model accuracy and dynamic land use inputs could effectively improve the model performance particularly for the nitrogen and phosphorus simulation the uncertainty analysis of the swat model outputs indicated that monthly outputs had greater uncertainty than annual outputs the deviations were offset when calculating annual outputs thus annual simulations required lower land use input accuracy than monthly simulations for flow although the influence of land use input conditions on the simulation results was not evident monthly outputs would fluctuate when the land use change reached a relatively large level for tn under the jy2015 condition which had the highest tic the rd value of annual outputs was relatively lower than those under other static land use input scenarios however it had the worst simulation performance with the lowest nse coefficient and monthly rd mad and rmsd values this may be caused by its average annual output values which offset the deviation on the whole fig 6b thus when evaluating the uncertainty of the outputs multiple indicators were required wechsler 2006 the deviation in tp outputs mainly occurred in 2016 i e during the validation periods which again shows that land use input conditions have significant impacts on the simulation of tp load although the calibrated results were excellent the higher deviation of the tn and tp outputs in the wet seasons may have been caused by high intensity rainfall during these months high intensity rainfall will lead to high surface runoff and will enhance water and soil erosion sadeghi et al 2016 in addition the nps pollution discharge will simultaneously increase leading to an increase in deviation ning et al 2006 land use data were an important input for most of the hydrological and water quality models which have a significant impact on the model outputs liu et al 2017a the land use pattern changed with time due to the impacts of climate change and human activities shi and shiwenjiao 2015 the precipitation and temperature change construction of the three gorges dam and the regulation put forward by the government to return farmland to forestland for ecological protection have greatly changed the land use pattern in the three gorges reservoir area yao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the impacts of climate change and human activities on land use changes have attracted extensive attention worldwide li et al 2014 gong et al 2017 however in most of the related studies only one year of land use input data were used in the models without considering the variations in land use throughout the entire simulation period awotwi et al 2015 samad et al 2016 as land use patterns changed over different time periods considering land use changes during the nps simulation periods is of great importance 5 conclusions land use patterns changed significantly from 2000 to 2015 in the xiangxi river watershed these changes mainly occurred between forest and cultivated areas forest area was continuously converted to cultivated area from 2000 to 2010 while approximately 28 of cultivated areas was converted to forest from 2010 to 2015 these changes were mainly caused by climate change and human activities to reveal the impacts of land use input conditions on the model performance calibration and validation were carried out under seven different land use input conditions including static and dynamic land use input approaches the results indicated that on the whole dynamic land use inputs could provide a better model performance than static land use inputs thus if sufficient land use data are available using the dynamic land use input is the best choice the impacts of land use input conditions on the different simulated elements were different for annual outputs land use input data had relatively low impacts on the flow simulation thus when simulating the flow or water yield in a watershed the land use in any year during the simulation period can be selected as the input for tn the simulation accuracy decreased when the tic increased for tp it is suggested that land use input data with a lower tic should be used this is because although the calibration effects were satisfactory during the calibration periods only the land use input data with low tic reached the requirements of the model s accuracy during the validation period moreover if monthly outputs are required from the model a dynamic land use input with low tic is necessary because land use conditions have a greater impact on model monthly outputs than on annual outputs particularly in the wet seasons in this study the impacts of land use change on the model performance was studied based on the calibrated results and uncertainty analysis of the model outputs the significance of using dynamic land use input instead of static land use input when simulating nps contamination in a watershed within a long time series using models was revealed this study could provide support for setting the land use input condition when using other nps models in other areas acknowledgments this study was funded by the national key research and development program of china 2017yfa0605001 the

7182,the objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of static and dynamic land use input conditions on the performance of non point source nps model and find out whether dynamic land use input can improve the model accuracy soil and water assessment tool swat model was selected as the evaluation model and seven different land use input conditions were set by setting the land use update file in swat the results showed that the land use pattern in the study area changed from 2000 to 2015 due to climate change and human activities leading to inconsistencies between different land use patterns the calibrated results indicated that dynamic land use input conditions could apparently improve the simulation accuracy of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp ce5y condition had the best calibrated result with r 2 and nse larger than 0 7 and 0 6 respectively however for flow simulation the land use input conditions had no apparent effect on the model calibration and validation results the deviation analysis of the model outputs indicated that monthly outputs were more affected by the land use input conditions than annual outputs and that deviations in wet seasons were larger than those in normal and dry seasons the highest mad occurred in june and august with a value of 82 87 t and 1 56 t for tn and tp respectively this study revealed the importance to consider the land use change when simulating the nps pollution and could provide support for land use input settings of nps pollution models keywords nonpoint source pollution swat model climate change and human activity static and dynamic land use input uncertainty analysis 1 introduction non point source nps pollution has been widely studied in recent years because it contains many uncertainties and is harder to control than point source pollution shen et al 2015 chen et al 2017 many studies have shown that nps pollution has become the primary source of water contamination rather than point source pollution wang et al 2004 mi et al 2015 the simulation of nps pollution should be carried out to provide information for its management the mechanism models have been widely used to simulate nps pollution with the development of computer science and the better understanding of the migration and transformation mechanism of pollutants in the real world moges et al 2017 yang et al 2017a the soil and water assessment tool swat the annualized agricultural non point source annagnps and the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf models have been used for the majority of nps pollution simulations ahn and kim 2016 karki et al 2017 teshager et al 2017 compared to the previously used export coefficient method and empirical models the mechanism models have a higher simulation accuracy and universality liu et al 2017b to appropriately control nps pollution the spatial and temporal characteristics of nps pollution first need to be analyzed using models the processes of nps pollution generation and discharge are affected by many factors such as land use type topography soil characteristics and meteorological conditions yang et al 2017c lin et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 these factors are also the basic input data for most nps pollution models thus the simulation results will be significantly affected by the spatial distribution and temporal changes in these input data bajracharya et al 2018 goyal et al 2018 the spatial distribution data of these factors were used in most of the nps models considering the impacts of spatial variation of input data on the nps pollution simulation du et al 2016 ouyang et al 2016 in addition the impacts of the spatial resolution of these input data on model outputs have also been analyzed by many studies kumar et al 2017 sun et al 2017 however for the temporal variations in nps only the time series of meteorological conditions were considered in most nps models while the other input data such as land use type topography and soil characteristics were set as invariable during the simulation periods chen et al 2013 liu et al 2013 2014 analyzing the temporal characteristics of nps pollution is conducive to the management of nps contamination thus the simulation periods of nps pollution were usually long from several years to several decades and simulation periods longer than 10 years were the most common ouyang et al 2014 zhai et al 2014 liu et al 2017b the temporal change of nps pollution represents its response to changes in input data meteorological conditions experience the most change and have the greatest effects on the nps pollution discharge within one year but land use patterns will also change when the simulation periods are longer than several years many studies have found that land use will change significantly in 5 years sewnet and abebe 2017 gashaw et al 2018 minta et al 2018 when the time scale is large in addition to meteorological conditions the influence of land use change on the simulation of nps pollution cannot be ignored the impacts of land use change on nps pollution generation and discharge have received much focus in recent years chu et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 in these studies land use in different periods were used as input data to analyze the variations in model outputs resulting from land use change however land use in different periods was only set as different scenarios in these studies in each simulation process just one period of land use was used worku et al 2017 these studies mainly focused on the influence of the spatial variations in land use patterns in different periods on nps pollution without taking temporal changes in land use into consideration more recently wagner considered the land use dynamic change during swat simulation periods and found that different land use input scenarios during the period of simulation had great impacts on the swat model outputs wagner et al 2017 this discovery embodied the temporal characteristics of land use change but the analysis was only based on the predicted land use the impacts of land use in different period on the temporal characteristics of nps pollution need to be analyzed further in this study the impacts of different land use input conditions on the model simulations were studied based on the swat model in xiangxi river watershed the main goals of this study were to 1 study the impacts of different land use input conditions on the model performance based on the calibration and validation results 2 discuss whether dynamic land use input conditions can improve model performance and 3 analyze the impacts of the land use input conditions on model outputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the xiangxi river is approximately 94 km long and is located between 110 47 to 111 13 e and 30 96 to 31 67 n in the three gorges reservoir it flows through three counties and its drainage area covers approximately 3099 km2 fig 1 the altitude in the area ranges from 110 m to 3088 m a humid subtropical monsoon climate is the main climate in the watershed the annual average precipitation is 1213 3 mm and the average annual temperature is 17 8 c june july and august represent the wet season april may september and october were the normal season and january february march november and december represent the dry season forest area dominates the total area of the watershed with a proportion more than 80 however due to excessive fertilizer application and livestock breeding the watershed still faces serious nps pollution liu et al 2016 2 2 swat model and calibration swat is a basin scale continuous time model that was developed by the united states department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars arnold et al 1998 the swat model is designed to simulate the impact of management on the hydrological processes and water quality kang et al 2006 the swat model has been developed over 30 years it is a descendant of the simulator for water resources in rural basins swrrb model arnold and williams 1987 to overcome the limitation that swrrb can only simulate 10 subbasins at a time the routing outputs to outlet roto model was merged with swrrb into the swat model arnold et al 1995 the swat model simulates the hydrological process based on the water balance equation eq 1 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t is the final moisture content of soil sw 0 is the initial moisture content of soil on day i r day is the amount of rainfall on day i q surf is the surface runoff on day i e a is the evapotranspiration amount on day i w seep is the water transferred from the soil profile into the gas zone on day i and q gw is the return flow on day i the watershed will be divided into several subbasins in the swat model using the hydrological analysis function in arcgis software based on dem digital elevation model data winchell et al 2013 in each subbasin hydrological response units hrus were defined based on a unique combination of land use soil and slope data different inputs for these data will produce different definition of hrus soil and slope will not change greatly over a long time period while land use may change frequently the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup a program developed for the sensitivity analysis calibration validation and uncertainty analysis of the swat model abbaspour 2014 was used to calibrate the parameters in the swat model in this study the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup was selected as the calibration algorithm due to its good performance in large watersheds rostamian et al 2008 the coefficient of determination r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to evaluate the performance of the swat model eqs 2 and 3 2 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 3 nse i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 o i o 2 where o is the mean value of the observed values o i is the i th

and 2015 were interpreted from the landsat5 tm dataset with a resolution of 30 m the dem input was obtained from the second version of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model dataset http www gscloud cn the soil input data were obtained from the institute of geography chinese academy of sciences with a resolution of 30 m the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil in the study area were obtained from the chinese soil database and field survey weather input data from 2000 to 2016 including precipitation temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind data were collected from the 9 weather stations in the watershed the monitoring data of daily stream flow total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp from 2004 to 2016 were obtained from the yichang hydrographic office hubei province china in our research the years 2000 and 2001 were used as the model warm up period and those of 2002 to 2016 were used to analyze the impacts of land use inputs on the swat model seven land use input conditions were established including four static conditions just the land use in 2000 jy2000 2005 jy2005 2010 jy2010 and 2015 jy2015 and three dynamic conditions those changing every 5 years ce5y 10 years ce10y and 15 years ce15y the dynamic land use conditions were established by editing the lup dat file in swat model which was used by swat to consider the land use change during the simulation period the spatial analysis and statistics function in arcgis was used to write the dynamic land use changes into the lup dat file seven independent models were set up based on these seven different land use input conditions the calibration and validation processes were carried out independently for each of the seven models i e each model would have its own unique combination of parameters after calibrated 2 4 uncertainty analysis methods the inconsistency index ic was used as the indicator to represent the degree of deviation between two land use patterns the value was calculated based on the kappa coefficient kappa coefficient is a method used to perform the consistency check and it can be used to evaluate the differences between different land use maps yang et al 2017b the value of the kappa coefficient ranges from 1 to 1 the higher the value is the more consistent the land use maps are the definition of the inconsistency index is eq 4 4 ic 1 k 100 k p 0 p e 1 p e p 0 s 1 s 2 s c n p e s 1 r 1 s 2 r 2 s c r c n n where k is the kappa coefficient p 0 is the total classification accuracy p e is the classification accuracy based on the confusion matrix s 1 s 2 s c are the simulated raster counts of each land use category r 1 r 2 r c are the actual raster counts of each land use category and n is the total raster counts of all land use categories the total inconsistency index tic was used to quantify the deviation between the land use data used in the model and that in the real situation for the entire simulation period in this study the ce5y condition was regarded as the real land use situation because the land use would not change too much in every five years and due to the data limitation this was the finest data we could obtain the total inconsistency index was defined as follows eq 5 5 tic i 1 n ic i where ic i is the inconsistency index at the i th node i is the land use change node at which the land use change occurs and n is the total count of the land use change nodes the uncertainty of the swat model outputs resulting from the different settings of land use input data was evaluated and quantified using several indicators relative difference rd mean absolute difference mad and root mean square deviation rmsd rd represented error percentage compared to the real data the reliability of the predicted data could be evaluated by rd easily mad could represent the real condition of the error better with a quantitative value rmsd could reflect the error between observed values and predicted values more obviously compared to mad because the square was used to magnify the deviation however mad and rmsd could be affected by the outliers easily particularly for rmsd while rd would not the definition of the three indicators was listed as follows eqs 6 8 6 rd p i s i s i 7 mad 1 n i 1 n p i s i 8 rmsd 1 n i 1 n p i s i 2 0 5 where p i is the predicted model output from the low changing frequency land use scenarios s i is the predicted model output from the ce5y which was used as a baseline for comparison with the outputs under other land use input scenarios and n is the number of sample pairs 3 results 3 1 land use change analysis the forest area exhibited a downtrend from 2000 to 2010 with decreasing areas of approximately 31 ha and 205 ha from 2000 to 2005 and 2005 to 2010 respectively fig 2 a the decreasing forest area was primarily converted into cultivated land different from 2000 to 2010 the forest area showed an uptrend from 2010 to 2015 and cultivated area decreased the forest area increased by up to 1 9 and the cultivated land area decreased by approximately 28 1 pasture water and urban areas exhibited continuous increases from 2000 to 2015 spatially there were no apparent differences between the land use patterns in 2000 and 2005 fig 2b in 2010 the increase in cultivated land area mainly occurred in the southern region of the watershed the water area stretched to the northern area due to the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir and the expansion of urban areas occurred along the river in 2015 the southwestern region of the watershed witnessed a decrease in cultivated land area particularly in the drylands the water area stretched further to the north of the watershed and a large area of urban land appeared in the middle of the watershed the results of ic for each of the two land use patterns showed that the land use patterns in 2000 and 2005 had the highest consistency with an ic of 1 08 and the land use patterns in 2000 and 2015 had the lowest consistency with an ic of 14 17 table 1 for different land use input conditions the tic values for the ce5y ce10y ce15y jy2000 jy2005 jy2010 and jy2015 conditions were 0 13 93 5 95 20 12 16 41 19 32 and 40 15 respectively the tic was relatively lower under dynamic land use input conditions than it was under static land use input conditions 3 2 calibration and validation under static land use input conditions for flow the calibration and validation results showed no apparent differences under different land use input conditions fig 3 a the r 2 and nse coefficient were above 0 71 and 0 68 respectively during the calibration periods in addition in the validation periods the r 2 and nse coefficient were even better than those in the calibration periods for tn the situation was quite different fig 3b the r 2 and nse coefficient under the jy2005 and jy2010 conditions were better than those under the jy2000 and jy2015 conditions during the calibration periods the nse coefficient under the jy2015 condition even dropped below 0 50 attention should be paid to the nse coefficients during the validation periods because the nse coefficients under all the conditions were quite low with values only reaching approximately 0 35 for tp the r 2 and nse coefficient were similar under different conditions and were above 0 60 and 0 50 respectively in the calibration periods fig 3c however in the validation periods the nse coefficients were quite low with values under 0 30 comparing the nse to the tic calculated previously it could be found that the calibration and validation of flow had no evident relationship with the land use input condition fig 4 however for tn the higher the tic of the land use input was the worse the calibration and validation results were similar to flow the tp calibration was influenced little by the land use input conditions while the nse coefficient dropped dramatically to values below 0 3 when the tic increased during the validation period 3 3 calibration and validation under dynamic land use input conditions for flow the r 2 and nse coefficients were both above 0 70 during the entire calibration and validation periods fig 5 a the calibration and validation results had no apparent relationship with tic for tn the calibrated results changed with changes in land use input conditions fig 5b the relationship between the tic and the nse coefficients was evident fig 4 the higher the tic was the worse the nse coefficient was for both calibration and validation periods in the ce10y scenario with the highest tic of the three dynamic conditions the nse coefficient was lower than 0 50 in the validation period for tp the r 2 and nse coefficient reached the requirement of the swat model accuracy with values of higher than 0 5 in the calibration period under all three dynamic conditions fig 5c however during the validation period the calibrated results could satisfy the model s accuracy requirement only under the ce5y condition compared to the static conditions the calibrated results for flow were similar to the r 2 and nse coefficient which were all approximately 0 7 during the calibration period and 0 8 during the validation period figs 4a and 5a however for tn it was better to use the dynamic land use input than the static land use input the nse coefficient increased from values of approximately 0 5 to 0 7 and from 0 3 to 0 5 during the calibration and validation periods respectively figs 4b and 5b for tp although the calibrated results reached the requirement of model accuracy under both the static and dynamic land use input conditions during the calibration period the nse coefficients under dynamic land use input conditions were better than those under static land use input conditions during the validation period figs 4c and 5c among all seven land use input conditions the results under the ce5y condition showed the best performance particularly for the tn and tp simulations the nse coefficient was 0 3 higher under the ce5y condition than those under other land use input conditions during the validation period for tn for tp during the validation period only the nse coefficient under the ce5y condition could reach the model s accuracy requirement while the nse coefficients under the other six land use input conditions were not higher than 0 3 3 4 uncertainty analysis of the swat model outputs all of the model outputs under different land use input conditions were compared with those under the ce5y condition to perform the uncertainty analysis for annual outputs the results showed that the uncertainties of the flow and tp outputs were relatively low and the tn outputs had the highest uncertainty fig 6 for flow the rds under different conditions were smaller than 10 except under the jy2000 and jy2015 conditions which had the highest tic table 2 the jy2015 condition had the highest mad and rmsd values while the ce15y condition had the lowest for tn the rd was only 1 under the ce15y condition with a tic of approximately 6 however with increasing tic the rds increased to more than 10 for tp the rds remained at approximately 3 under all conditions and the mad and rmsd values were also relatively low however it could be found that in the validation period 2016 a large difference existed for the tp outputs under different land use input conditions for the monthly outputs the deviations were more obvious than those for annual outputs fig 7 for flow a sudden increase of the rds occurred when the tic reached 20 table 3 the jy2015 condition had the highest mad and rmsd values of 238 80 and 270 70 respectively for tn under the static land use input conditions jy2000 jy2005 jy2010 and jy2015 the rds exceeded 20 and the jy2015 condition had a dramatic 76 rd for tp the rds under all land use input conditions reached 15 except under the ce15y condition the annual average monthly output and the monthly average deviation results were also analyzed and the results indicated that deviation in outputs mainly occurred in the wet season particularly for the tn and tp outputs fig 8 for tn the mad values were 154 94 t 64 76 t and 24 74 t in the wet normal and dry seasons respectively fig 8b the highest mad occurred in june with a value of 82 87 t the tn loads were apparently overestimated in the wet season under all land use input conditions except under the jy2015 condition for tp the mad values were 2 64 t 0 62 t and 1 18 t in the wet normal and dry seasons respectively fig 8c the highest mad occurred in august with a value of 1 56 t comparing tn with tp the simulation of tp load under land use change conditions was less affected by changes in hydrological conditions caused by climate change than that of tn the mad value in the wet season was six times that in the dry season for tn and twice that for tp 4 discussion the calibrated results of flow indicated that both the static and dynamic land use inputs could be used to obtain an acceptable calibration and validation results the results had no apparent relationship with the tic fig 4 this may be explained by the fact that land use is not the only decisive factor affecting runoff processes runoff processes are mainly driven by precipitation processes zhang et al 2018 and are affected by several factors such as soil moisture content groundwater characteristics and channel properties ruggenthaler et al 2015 house et al 2016 lu et al 2016 thus when carrying out a simulation of the flow generation in a watershed both the dynamic and static land use input approaches can be used however for tn the calibration and validation results from the dynamic land use input conditions were clearly better than those from the static land use input conditions when the tic was below 10 the nse coefficient reached values above 0 60 and 0 50 during calibration and validation periods respectively which represented a good calibrated result abbaspour 2014 in addition when the tic index was less than 20 the nse coefficient could reach values above 0 50 during the calibration period representing an acceptable calibrated result the results indicated that land use input conditions had a significant effect on the nps nitrogen simulation this was reasonable because nps nitrogen pollutants were mainly derived from cultivated land ouyang et al 2013 which changed with the conversion of land use patterns it should be noted that under the static conditions although the r 2 and nse coefficients were above 0 50 during the calibration period they were all below 0 50 during the validation periods thus if a simulation which has a time period longer than calibration period was required a land use input with a low tic was needed i e dynamic land use inputs were better for tp the similar calibrated results under different land use input conditions during the calibration periods indicated that the calibration process of tp was more affected by non unique parameters several parameter sets with different values may provide equally suitable model responses beven 1996 and due to the large amount of parameters participating in the tp calibration process this phenomenon is more significant mehdi et al 2017 however only when the tic was less than 5 could the nse coefficient reach 0 60 moreover during the validation periods the nse coefficients could reach 0 50 only under the ce5y condition thus land use patterns clearly have important effects on the simulation of phosphorus load wang et al 2015 through the perspective of calibration and validation results it could be found that different land use input conditions did have great importance on the model accuracy and dynamic land use inputs could effectively improve the model performance particularly for the nitrogen and phosphorus simulation the uncertainty analysis of the swat model outputs indicated that monthly outputs had greater uncertainty than annual outputs the deviations were offset when calculating annual outputs thus annual simulations required lower land use input accuracy than monthly simulations for flow although the influence of land use input conditions on the simulation results was not evident monthly outputs would fluctuate when the land use change reached a relatively large level for tn under the jy2015 condition which had the highest tic the rd value of annual outputs was relatively lower than those under other static land use input scenarios however it had the worst simulation performance with the lowest nse coefficient and monthly rd mad and rmsd values this may be caused by its average annual output values which offset the deviation on the whole fig 6b thus when evaluating the uncertainty of the outputs multiple indicators were required wechsler 2006 the deviation in tp outputs mainly occurred in 2016 i e during the validation periods which again shows that land use input conditions have significant impacts on the simulation of tp load although the calibrated results were excellent the higher deviation of the tn and tp outputs in the wet seasons may have been caused by high intensity rainfall during these months high intensity rainfall will lead to high surface runoff and will enhance water and soil erosion sadeghi et al 2016 in addition the nps pollution discharge will simultaneously increase leading to an increase in deviation ning et al 2006 land use data were an important input for most of the hydrological and water quality models which have a significant impact on the model outputs liu et al 2017a the land use pattern changed with time due to the impacts of climate change and human activities shi and shiwenjiao 2015 the precipitation and temperature change construction of the three gorges dam and the regulation put forward by the government to return farmland to forestland for ecological protection have greatly changed the land use pattern in the three gorges reservoir area yao et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the impacts of climate change and human activities on land use changes have attracted extensive attention worldwide li et al 2014 gong et al 2017 however in most of the related studies only one year of land use input data were used in the models without considering the variations in land use throughout the entire simulation period awotwi et al 2015 samad et al 2016 as land use patterns changed over different time periods considering land use changes during the nps simulation periods is of great importance 5 conclusions land use patterns changed significantly from 2000 to 2015 in the xiangxi river watershed these changes mainly occurred between forest and cultivated areas forest area was continuously converted to cultivated area from 2000 to 2010 while approximately 28 of cultivated areas was converted to forest from 2010 to 2015 these changes were mainly caused by climate change and human activities to reveal the impacts of land use input conditions on the model performance calibration and validation were carried out under seven different land use input conditions including static and dynamic land use input approaches the results indicated that on the whole dynamic land use inputs could provide a better model performance than static land use inputs thus if sufficient land use data are available using the dynamic land use input is the best choice the impacts of land use input conditions on the different simulated elements were different for annual outputs land use input data had relatively low impacts on the flow simulation thus when simulating the flow or water yield in a watershed the land use in any year during the simulation period can be selected as the input for tn the simulation accuracy decreased when the tic increased for tp it is suggested that land use input data with a lower tic should be used this is because although the calibration effects were satisfactory during the calibration periods only the land use input data with low tic reached the requirements of the model s accuracy during the validation period moreover if monthly outputs are required from the model a dynamic land use input with low tic is necessary because land use conditions have a greater impact on model monthly outputs than on annual outputs particularly in the wet seasons in this study the impacts of land use change on the model performance was studied based on the calibrated results and uncertainty analysis of the model outputs the significance of using dynamic land use input instead of static land use input when simulating nps contamination in a watershed within a long time series using models was revealed this study could provide support for setting the land use input condition when using other nps models in other areas acknowledgments this study was funded by the national key research and development program of china 2017yfa0605001 the

7183,statistical calibration of flow and transport models in unsaturated porous media is often carried out with markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods however the practicality of these methods is limited by their computational requirement particularly when large prior intervals are assigned to the model parameters in this work a new operational strategy is investigated to alleviate the computational burden of mcmc samplers using results from a preliminary calibration performed with the first order approximation foa method with the new strategy the posterior distribution is approximated using a high order polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate model constructed over reduced parameter ranges the latter are obtained from the 99 9 foa confidence intervals two challenging test cases are investigated to assess efficiency and accuracy of the new strategy the first test case considers estimation of flow and pesticide transport parameters from a synthetic infiltration experiment the second test case deals with the assessment of unsaturated hydraulic soil parameters from a real word laboratory drainage experiment the results of the proposed strategy are compared to those of foa of the standard mcmc method and of an improved mcmc method in which the sampler is preconditioned with draws from the foa posterior distribution for both test cases the new strategy provides accurate mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty regions and is much more efficient than the other mcmc methods it is up to 50 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method keywords unsaturated flow pesticide transport bayesian inference confidence intervals polynomial chaos expansion dream zs software 1 introduction statistical calibration of hydrogeological models is an essential task to increase their reliability although these models are by definition an approximation of reality their calibration aims to demonstrate their ability to satisfactorily mimic the real world model calibration is achieved by facing the model responses to the observations stemming from laboratory or in situ experiments in statistical inverse problems the unknown model parameters are investigated in a statistical framework that provides the parameter posterior joint probability distribution function jpdf from the latter it is then straightforward to infer the posterior 95 confidence interval ci to quantify uncertainty on the estimated parameters the assessment of posterior cis is far from being straightforward if the observed model outputs are highly nonlinear functions of parameters christensen and cooley 1999 for this reason the markov chain monte carlo mcmc samplers has received much attention due to its ability to tackle well posed nonlinear problems e g metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 vrugt et al 2013 craiu and rosenthal 2014 van ravenzwaaij et al 2016 during the last two decades mcmc sampling has been largely used for the assessment of the posterior jpdf of hydrogeological model parameters e g rajabi et al 2015 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2016 wang et al 2017 hayek et al 2017 linde et al 2017 laloy et al 2017 younes et al 2017 shi et al 2012 showed that mcmc methods are more appealing than nonlinear regression methods for uncertainty quantification in the vadose zone in the last decades the mcmc method received many improvements in order to accelerate its convergence e g haario et al 2006 ter braak and vrugt 2008 dostert et al 2009 cui et al 2011 laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt et al 2013 rajabi et al 2015 among others in particular vrugt et al 2009 improved the efficiency of mcmc by developing the dream sampler laloy and vrugt 2012 developed dream zs a sampler that runs multiple chains in parallel for an efficient exploration of the parameter space despite these improvements the first order approximation foa approach that relies on local search algorithms such as the levenberg marquardt algorithm remains largely used in practical applications hayek et al 2008 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2011 fahs et al 2014 seki et al 2015 hassane and ackerer 2017 hassane maina et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 the foa assumes that the posterior jpdf is gaussian centered on the optimum parameter set under this assumption the cis are estimated using a linearization of the model near the optimum carrera and neuman 1986 kool and parker 1988 this linearization assumes that the jacobian estimated at the global optimum is constant within the cis donaldson and schnabel 1987 stated that this approximation remains reasonably accurate in a nonlinear least squares approach however recent studies have shown that model nonlinearities can violate this assumption see for instance vrugt and bouten 2002 shi et al 2012 lu et al 2012 in the context of soil hydrologic models several authors have compared cis obtained with foa and mcmc samplers vrugt and bouten 2002 showed that the cis of foa are accurate for water retention parameters in the case of a sandy soil but are larger than the mcmc cis in the case of a clayey soil vurgin et al 2007 compared confidence region estimation obtained with foa and the shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem algorithm which is based on the mcmc sampling technique two nonlinear test problems have been investigated to identify hydraulic parameters in groundwater flow problems based on experimental well tests the authors showed that the linear approximation method overestimates the posterior cis for the first nonlinear test problem but produced reasonable cis for the second nonlinear test problem gallagher and doherty 2007 undertook parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis of a watershed model for both synthetic and real word cases their results demonstrated that the foa method overestimates the parameter cis compared to the ones obtained with mcmc mertens et al 2009 investigated inverse modeling of pesticide leaching in lysimeters they showed that foa correctly locates the global minimum but overestimates the parameter uncertainties compared to scem results kahl et al 2015 compared local and global inverse modelling strategies to estimate pesticide transport parameters from lysimeter studies they suggested running the local search algorithm several times with different starting points in order to avoid local minima the selection of the starting points is done in a way that the risk of getting stuck in the same local optimum is minimized the authors showed that the nonlinear cis obtained via mcmc are smaller than their linear counterparts obtained using the foa method this short review on the comparison between the mcmc and foa techniques confirms a general conclusion that mcmc provides accurate estimation of the posterior cis of model parameters but is highly computational consuming on the contrary foa is computationally efficient to evaluate the set of optimal parameter gallagher and doherty 2007 thought the algorithm can be trapped in local minima which can be avoided if the initialization is performed with different starting points however foa may fail to provide accurate posterior cis gallagher and doherty 2007 hence the main objective of this work is to alleviate the computational burden of mcmc samplers by using i a two step procedure where results from a first calibration performed with the foa approach are used to enhance the efficiency of the mcmc sampler and ii an accurate surrogate model that runs faster than the original model to compute the posterior parameter distributions in the literature several two step procedures have been proposed to improve the efficiency of mcmc methods for instance vrugt and bouten 2002 used the shuffled complex evolution sce global optimization algorithm duan et al 1992 to locate the most likely parameter set of the multivariate posterior target distribution then at each mode the foa is used to generate the proposal distribution which serves to initialize the mcmc sampler laloy et al 2013 developed two strategies to accelerate bayesian inference of a high parametrized and cpu demanding groundwater flow model in the first strategy a linear polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate model is constructed and samples from the surrogate posterior distribution are used to initialize dreamzs this strategy is similar in spirit to the one developed by zeng et al 2012 the second strategy is a two stage mcmc scheme dostert et al 2009 cui et al 2011 in this strategy each time a proposal is generated using mcmc simulations a linear pce surrogate model is first evaluated and only accepted proposals are evaluated by the original model ma et al 2008 showed that this scheme has higher acceptance rates than standard mcmc methods this strategy has been often employed with generalized polynomial chaos surrogate models e g liu 2001 christen and fox 2005 efendiev et al 2005 mondal et al 2010 cui et al 2011 elsheikh et al 2014 another two step procedure has been proposed by oladyshkin et al 2013a in a first step the original model is projected onto a mathematically optimal response surface via the arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion then in a second step the reduced model is matched to observation data via bootstrap filtering the direct combination of mcmc with an inexpensive surrogate pce instead of the original forward model has been initially proposed by marzouk et al 2007 marzouk and xiu 2009 and marzouk and najm 2009 to accelerate bayesian inference the strategy has been employed by nagel and sudret 2015 for the inversion of heat conduction problems and by wu and kozlowski 2017 for a nuclear reactor simulation problem laloy et al 2013 oladyshkin et al 2013a and oladyshkin et al 2013b stated that the surrogate posterior distribution might not be valid if the pce surrogate model is not sufficiently accurate note that laloy et al 2013 used a pce of order 1 since they found that high order approximations were computationally intractable the limitation of pce in the bayesian solution of inverse problems has been investigated by lu et al 2015 they noted that a sufficiently accurate pce requires a high order which may renders pce sampling expensive bazargan et al 2015 suggested the use of a sparse pce where only the most relevant terms of the pce decomposition are retained glaser et al 2016 analyzed the feasibility of the pce as a surrogate model using different orders and showed that the pc expansion can replace the forward model in the bayesian inference which allows a significant reduction of the computational cost compared to a pure mcmc approach in this work a new operational strategy named mcmc pce red is developed in which the posterior distribution is approximated using an accurate surrogate model based on i high order pces and ii reduced intervals corresponding to the foa 99 9 cis instead of the initial prior parameter intervals to allow construction of accurate and efficient surrogate models indeed by proceeding this way sufficiently accurate pces can be constructed to fit the forward model on the reduced intervals without requiring very high orders which may render pce sampling very expensive two test cases dealing with synthetic and real word problems are investigated to assess efficiency and accuracy of the new strategy the first test case considers estimation of flow and pesticide transport parameters from a synthetic infiltration experiment the second test case deals with the assessment of unsaturated hydraulic soil parameters from a laboratory drainage experiment for both test cases the results are compared against those of foa the standard mcmc method and the strategy proposed by vrugt and bouten 2002 referenced hereafter as mcmc precond in which the convergence is enhanced by preconditioning the mcmc sampler with draws from the foa posterior distribution the plan of the paper is the following section 2 describes the mathematical model of flow and pesticide transport through unsaturated soils the mcmc sampler used in dream zs the pce surrogate model and the new strategy developed to improve the efficiency of the mcmc sampler section 3 discusses the results in terms of estimated parameter values and corresponding uncertainties for the two investigated test cases finally the conclusions are given in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 unsaturated flow and pesticide transport forward models both synthetic and laboratory test cases are investigated the first test case deals with flow and pesticide transport parameter assessment

test case parameter estimation is performed using synthetic scenarios in which data from numerical simulations are corrupted before using them as observations we assume that the parameters k s and Î¸ s have been initially measured from a saturated flow experiment as recommended by van dam et al 1994 however instead of fixing their values as in nÃ¼tzmann et al 1998 we assign them narrow gaussian distributions this allows to take into account uncertainties associated to k s and Î¸ s and their effect on the estimation of the other flow and transport parameters hence a gaussian distribution is associated to k s with a mean value of 50 cm day and a standard deviation of 1 cm day which corresponds to the 95 ci 48 52 cm day similarly for Î¸ s we associate a gaussian distribution with a mean value of 0 43 cm3 cm 3 and a standard deviation of 0 01 cm3 cm 3 which corresponds to the 95 ci 0 41 0 45 cm3 cm 3 the remainders parameters are presumed uniformly distributed over the intervals

table 1 is shown in figs 1 and 2 in the fig 1 the cumulative outflow starts increasing at approximately 1000 min after the beginning of the injection it has an almost linear behavior until 5500 min then it slowly increases with an asymptotic behavior due to the gravity drainage because of the nonlinear sorption the breakthrough concentration curve fig 2 shows a front starting at approximately 5000 min it increases slowly and reaches its maximum value at around 12000 min then it decreases due to the degradation process the data used as conditioning information for model calibration are also shown in the figs 1 and 2 two scenarios corresponding to different number of measurements used for parameter calibration are investigated these scenarios are explored here to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the different calibration strategies in the case of small and large posterior uncertainty regions the scenarios are the following qc 200 in this case 200 non intrusive temporal measurements of cumulative outflow and output concentration data collected every 100 min during a period of 20000 min are used for the calibration qc 20 the number of measurements for the calibration is strongly reduced only 20 non intrusive measurements of cumulative outflow and output concentration are considered 2 3 laboratory drainage experiment the second case study deals with a real word laboratory experiment indeed a drainage experiment was performed using a vertical column of l 1 m height and a diameter of 10 cm the column was filled with a homogeneous quartz sand of a uniform index d 60 d 10 1 6 placed over a 6 mm thick porous ceramic plate of conductivity k sp 0 003 c m h the column was initially fully saturated with a ponding of 4 7 cm four depression steps corresponding to 40 70 100 and 130 cm at respectively t0 0 t1 74 5 h t2 162 1 h and t3 259 2 h were applied to the lower boundary of the column the volumetric water content was measured at 10 cm from the sand surface and a digital balance with an accuracy of 1 g measured the cumulative outflow fig 3 shows the measured water content and cumulative outflow this figure shows that the porous medium remains under saturated conditions during the falling head phase which corresponds to the first 22 h during this phase the water content is constant at saturation and the cumulative outflow exhibits an exponential behavior the vector of observed data is formed by 40 measurements of water content and 40 measurements of the cumulative outflow for a total duration of the experiment of 360 h additional details regarding the set up of the experiment and the measuring techniques can be found in younes et al 2013 the vector of unknowns is formed by all unsaturated soil parameters Î¾ k s Î¸ s Î¸ r Î± n these parameters are presumed uniformly distributed over the ranges reported in table 2 simulations are performed with a commercial numerical code based on the conforming finite element method in conjunction with the newton raphson linearization scheme the water content is expanded using a first order taylor series with respect to the piezometric head celia et al 1990 farthing and ogden 2017 both porous medium and porous plate are descritized using a fine mesh formed by elements of size 0 2 cm the time step management during the simulation is of heuristic type the size of the new time step is adjusted according to the convergence behavior of the linearization scheme the jacobian is evaluated analytically for both newton raphson linearization and levenberg marquardt optimization 2 4 bayesian parameter

adequately fit the model onto observations these sets are then used to assess the optimal parameter values and the cis the posterior distribution is considered stationary if the chains are not autocorrelated and the convergence criterion of gelman and ruban 1992 rstat is less than 1 2 in this work 3 parallel chains are used with the dream zs mcmc sampler 2 5 the pce surrogate model the polynomial chaos theory was originally introduced by wiener 1938 and has been extensively used in various domains of research and engineering since then e g ghanem and spanos 1991 tatang et al 1997 xiu and karniadakis 2002 le maÃ®tre et al 2002 acharjee and zabaras 2007 li and zhang 2007 fajraoui et al 2011 younes et al 2013 pces have been largely used to perform variance based sensitivity analysis of computer models see for instance sudret 2008 blatman and sudret 2010 fajraoui et al 2012 younes et al 2016 shao et al 2017 mara et al 2017 but can also serve as a surrogate model of the original one this feature is exploited here in conjunction with the mcmc sampler pce casts the model response of interest f Î¾ onto a set of orthonormal multivariate polynomials up to a polynomial degree p 11 f Î¾ Î± p s Î± Ï Î± Î¾ where Î± Î± 1 Î± m n d is a d th dimensional index d corresponds to the number of parameters and Î¾ is the input vector of parameters formed by d independently and identically distributed random variables the s Î± s are the polynomial coefficients and Ï Î± s are the generalized polynomial chaos of degree Î± i 1 d Î± i such as legendre hermite or jacobi polynomials in the sequel we employ legendre polynomials since uniform prior distributions are considered for the parameters a pce is constructed for each measurement i e for each observed output at each observable time for this purpose we generate n realizations of the parameter values within their prior uncertainty ranges and evaluate the original model response for each draw then the pc coefficients are estimated by ordinary least square regression given the parameter sample and the associated model responses a pce of degree p 4 similar results are obtained with p 5 is used for the expansion of the outputs hence the number of polynomial coefficients is n p d p d p 715 for the synthetic flow and pesticide transport test case and n p 126 for the laboratory drainage test case there are several sampling techniques proposed in the literature to generate parameter sample the optimal design of size n n p proposed in sudret 2008 selects the collocation points closest to the origin of the sampling space in this work we use a random sampling of 1000 parameter sets for the first test case and of 200 parameter sets for the second test case the fig 4 shows that the pce of fourth order reproduces well the original flow pesticide transport model an average rmse of 0 0062 is found between simulated concentrations obtained from the original and pces surrogate models for 100 different parameter combinations randomly drown from the prior distribution and not used for the construction of the pces in this figure 40 pces obtained at different simulation times were employed for the comparison note that the optimal experimental design suggested by sudret 2008 yielded less accurate pces since the corresponding rmse is 0 017 because the laboratory drainage experiment involves only 5 unknown parameters compared to the synthetic flow and pesticide transport test case which involves 9 parameters the pce of order 4 yields a better fitting to the original model fig 5 an average rmse of 0 0026 is found between water contents obtained from the original and the pces surrogate models constructed at 40 different simulation times the pces were constructed over reduced parameter ranges instead of the prior parameter ranges which can be very large to increase the chances that the chosen reduced intervals encompass the target solution the reduced intervals correspond to the 99 9 foa cis which are around 70 larger than the 95 cis furthermore to make sure that the bounds of the 99 9 confidence intervals obtained from foa are not underestimated one can check that the bound values limits of the ci of each parameter are not probable compared to the optimum parameter set to do so we employ a strategy based on the maximal conditional probability distribution approach proposed in mara et al 2015 the idea is the following given the optimal parameter set Î¾ map and its assigned score w map namely 13 Î¾ map arg max p Î¾ y mes w map p Î¾ map y mes and denoting Î¾ i low Î¾ i up the 99 9 foa confidence interval of the parameter Î¾ i one has to evaluate the maximal score assigned to each bound of each parameter that is 14 w i p Î¾ i y mes Î¾ i where the superscript is either low or up then the ratio 15 ratio w i w map 0 1 indicates whether the bound value Î¾ i of the parameter Î¾ i is probable or not a small value 0 01 of the ratio at the limit bounds for all parameters indicates that it is likely that the foa 99 9 cis encompass the basin of convergence of the mcmc sampler note that one can also analyse the posterior parameter distributions to check that the 99 9 foa cis encompasses entirely the target solution if not one needs to repeat the inversion using wider intervals for the parameters in question 2 6 the calibration strategies four calibration strategies are used to evaluate the optimal parameter sets and cis for the two case studies foa based on the levenberg marquardt search algorithm mcmc the mcmc sampler with the original model and initial prior parameter intervals mcmc precond the mcmc sampler initialized with draws from the foa posterior distribution as proposed by vrugt and bouten 2002 mcmc pce red the new strategy based on the mcmc sampler with the high order pce surrogate model and reduced support corresponding to the foa 99 9 cis 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthetic flow and pesticide infiltration experiment 3 1 1 qc 200 scenario in this scenario a large number of 200 measurements of cumulative outflow and output concentrations are used for the calibration of the synthetic flow and pesticide infiltration experiment as an illustration of the bayesian inversion results we show in fig 6 the results obtained with the standard mcmc method the on diagonal plots show the posterior parameter distributions the off diagonal plots show correlations between parameters in the mcmc sample fig 6 shows almost bell shaped posterior distributions for all parameters strong correlations are observed between Î¸ s and Ï kd r 0 99 and a l and nf r 0 91 from the mcmc sample it is straightforward to estimate the posterior 95 confidence intervals of each parameter the latter as well as the estimated mean values obtained with the different approaches are reported in table 3 this table shows that all parameters are well estimated from the non intrusive measurements of cumulative outflow and outlet concentrations since i identified mean values are very close to the reference solution ii all confidence intervals include the reference solution and iii the confidence intervals are rather narrow the parameter n is the best estimate of all parameters with a ci around 2 of its mean estimated value the parameters k s Î¸ s Î± nf Ï kd and Î» are fairly estimated with cis around 10 the parameters Î¸ r and a l are less well estimated with cis around 50 the results of table 3 show that the four calibration methods yield the same quality of results in term of mean estimated values and cis concerning the efficiency of the different calibration methods for this scenario the most efficient method is foa since it requires only 217 s of cpu time the standard mcmc method was terminated after 50 000 model runs which required 183392s the convergence was reached at around 40 000 model runs the last 25 mcmc draws were used to estimate the statistical measures of the posterior distribution mcmc precond was terminated after 15 000 model runs which required 35081s the convergence was reached in less than 10 000 model runs hence for the studied scenario mcmc precond is 5 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method note that this efficiency is not only due to the reduction of the number of model runs required to reach the convergence but also to the reduction of the average cpu time per simulation run indeed even if the total number of model runs was fixed to 50 000 for both methods the mcmc precond required around 50 less cpu time than the standard mcmc method this is due to the fact that with the standard mcmc method some runs were performed with parameter combinations which were far from the solution for these combinations the convergence of the nonlinear flow transport model was more difficult to reach and required more cpu time for instance we observed that for certain parameter sets far from the solution the cpu time required by the flow transport model could be 20 times larger than for parameter sets close to the solution this highlights the benefit of using reduced intervals with mcmc for such situations to demonstrate this assertion we perform a bayesian inversion using the mcmc sampler with the forward nonlinear flow and pesticide transport model using reduced intervals corresponding to the 99 9 foa confidence intervals the convergence is reached at around 20 000 model runs and required only 32596s hence for this test case the mcmc with reduced intervals required until 6 times less cpu time than with the standard intervals the mcmc pce red method required around 1127s for the construction of the pce and 4581s for the bayesian inversion with the surrogate model this weak cpu time can be explained by the following reasons i the mcmc method converges quickly less than 20 000 model runs were required because of the strong reduction of prior parameter ranges for instance the prior interval for the parameter n is 1 2 7 whereas its reduced 99 9 foa ci is 1 35 1 43 ii the pce runs much faster than the nonlinear unsaturated flow pesticide transport model and iii the same pce structure is utilized for all time steps hence the evaluation of the pce coefficients is expensive only for the first time step for the following time steps the assessment of the pce coefficients is optimized and required only a matrix vector product hence the results of the current scenario can be summarized as follows although the studied problem is highly nonlinear the foa approach based on the lm calibration method provided accurate estimations of both mean parameter values and cis furthermore the foa is by far the most efficient method for this scenario mcmc precond is 5 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method while providing identical results mcmc pce red provided accurate mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty ranges and is up to 30 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method 3 1 2 qc 20 scenario in this scenario the number of measurements used for the calibration of the synthetic flow and pesticide infiltration problem is strongly reduced only one in ten of the previous cumulative outflow and output concentration data are taken into account for the calibration the results of mcmc are plotted in the fig 7 all parameters show bell shaped posterior distributions except Î¸ r a l and nf indeed the histogram of the parameter Î¸ r shows multimodality which reflects nonuniqueness problems the posterior distribution of a l and nf deviate remarkably from the normal distribution the distribution of nf reaches the lower bound of its allowed interval of variation and this has a repercussion on the upper bound of a l because of the correlation between the two parameters indeed strong correlations occur between Î¸ s and Ï kd r 0 95 and a l and nf r 0 96 compared to the previous scenario the results depicted in table 4 show larger uncertainty regions which makes sense since the number of measurements used in the calibration is significantly reduced compared to the results of qc 200 scenario the cis of k s and Î¸ s remain unchanged due to their narrow prior gaussian distributions furthermore the parameter Ï kd remains as well estimated as in the first scenario probably because of its high sensitivity for the rest of the parameters the mcmc cis have increased with different proportion indeed the cis of Î¸ r a l n and nf have been multiplied by 2 those of Î± and Î» by 3 the estimated mean values obtained with the different calibration methods are almost similar and are in very good agreement with the reference solution concerning uncertainty regions the cis obtained with the three mcmc approaches are very close the comparison between foa and mcmc results shows that the foa method overestimates the cis for some parameters indeed the foa overestimates the cis of the parameters a l and nf by around 100 furthermore the uncertainty region for the dispersivity parameter includes unphysical negative values this confirms the results of gallagher and doherty 2007 mertens et al 2009 and kahl et al 2015 which assert that foa can fail to provide realistic parameter uncertainties and may yield larger cis than with the mcmc sampler indeed with foa the jacobian is assumed to remain constant across the uncertainty regions for the first scenario this assumption was quite fulfilled because of the small uncertainty regions insured by the large number of measurements however for the current scenario the assumption is not fulfilled because of the large uncertainty regions induced by the low number of measurements interestingly the two parameters a l and nf for which we observe a strong overestimation of the ci by foa are those which do not have a bell shaped posterior distribution it is an intrinsic assumption with foa in the fig 7 concerning efficiency of the different calibration methods the standard mcmc method was terminated after 90 000 model runs which required 254112s of cpu time the convergence was reached at around 70 000 model runs and the last 20 000 runs were used for the statistical measures of the posterior distribution mcmc precond was terminated after 25 000 model runs which required 45236s as previously mcmc precond is 5 to 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method mcmc pce red required around 1186s for the construction of the pce and 2058s for the bayesian inversion with the surrogate model less than 20 000 model runs were required to reach the convergence in summary the results of the studied scenario show that the reduction of the number of measurements in the calibration yields large uncertainty regions for some parameters for these parameters the foa method gave accurate estimated mean values but inaccurate and even unphysical cis foa mcmc precond and mcmc pce red yield similar results in term of estimated mean parameter values uncertainty ranges provided by mcmc precond and mcmc pce red are in very good agreements with the results of the standard mcmc method as previously mcmc precond is about 5 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method mcmc pce red based on surrogate modeling and reduction of prior parameter intervals is up to 50 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method 3 2 laboratory drainage experiment the mcmc calibration results of the laboratory drainage experiment using 40 measurements of cumulative outflow and water content inside the column are plotted in the fig 8 in this figure only Î¸ s and n exhibit bell shaped posterior distributions the parameters Î¸ r and Î± present non symmetrical distributions with a left tail for Î¸ r and a right tail for Î± the posterior distributions show that k s cannot be well identified the lack of identifiability of k s is probably due to its low sensitivity since the flow is essentially controlled by the conductivity of the porous plate which is around 500 times less permeable than the porous medium table 5 depicts the estimated mean parameter values as well as the corresponding cis obtained with the different approaches the four calibration approaches yield close mean estimated parameter values the cis of the three mcmc approaches are in very good agreement an overestimation of the cis up to 100 is observed for almost all parameters with foa furthermore foa yields unphysical negative bound for the ci of the parameter k s concerning the efficiency of the different approaches foa required 764 s of cpu time the mcmc precond and the standard mcmc methods have similar efficiency indeed both are used with 15 000 model runs the convergence is reached at around 10 000 model runs and required around 150000s of cpu time mcmc pce red required 1378s for the construction of the pce and around 400s for the mcmc estimation note that this huge gain in cpu time is caused by the small number of model runs 2 0 0 required for the construction of the pce since the model contains only 5 parameters as reported in the fig 9 the rstat of all parameters show that the overall chains have converged after 5000 runs note that the gain in cpu cost of mcmc pce red is expected to be less pronounced for problems with a large number of parameters indeed for such situations building an accurate high order pce necessitates a large experimental design which can be expansive in terms of cpu time in summary the results of the laboratory drainage experiment show that all mcmc methods yield similar mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty regions foa yields mean estimated parameter values in agreement with mcmc results but overestimates parameters cis contrarily to the previous synthetic test cases mcmc precond do not allow any gain in term of efficiency compared to the standard mcmc method mcmc pce red based on surrogate modeling and reduction of parameter intervals is more than 70 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method 4 conclusions in this work a new operational strategy has been investigated to reduce the computational burden of the mcmc samplers by tacking advantages of the fast foa method the new strategy named mcmc pce red approximates the posterior distribution by a surrogate one using a pce surrogate model that runs faster than the original one accurate surrogate pces are employed using i high order pces and ii reduced intervals which correspond to the foa 99 9 cis instead of the initial prior parameter intervals efficiency and accuracy of the new strategy have been investigated for two challenging test cases the first test case considers estimation of flow and pesticide transport parameters for a synthetic infiltration experiment whereas the second test case deals with the assessment of unsaturated hydraulic parameters from a real word laboratory drainage experiment two scenarios with different number of measurements were considered for the first test case in the first scenario a large number of non intrusive measurements of cumulative outflow and outlet concentration have been taken into account whereas in the second scenario the number of non intrusive measurements was reduced by ten in order to investigate cases with large uncertainty regions the results of the new strategy have been compared to those of foa of the standard mcmc method and of the strategy named mcmc precond where the mcmc sampler is preconditioned with draws from the foa posterior distribution all calibration methods yield accurate estimation of the optimal parameter values for both scenario of the synthetic test case the first scenario shows that although the studied problem is highly nonlinear the foa method provided accurate mean estimated values and uncertainty bounds and is the most efficient calibration method for the second scenario with a reduced number of measurements the inversion yielded parameters with larger uncertainty regions foa overestimates the cis of some parameters by a factor of 100 and can yield cis with unphysical negative values furthermore for both scenarios uncertainty ranges provided by mcmc precond and mcmc pce red are in very good agreements with the results of the standard mcmc method mcmc precond was 5 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method whereas mcmc pce red based on surrogate modeling and reduction of prior parameter intervals is up to 50 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method the results for the second test case dealing with soil parameter estimation from a laboratory drainage experiment showed that foa yielded accurate mean parameter estimated values but inaccurate cis mcmc precond and mcmc pce red yielded accurate mean estimated values and cis further contrarily to the synthetic test case mcmc precond do not allow any gain in term of efficiency compared to the standard mcmc method mcmc pce red is highly efficient and can be up to 50 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method the proposed strategy is not limited to the test cases discussed in this work it can be applied to other interesting hydrogeological models and a wide range of applications efficiency of this strategy for mutli physical models is

7183,statistical calibration of flow and transport models in unsaturated porous media is often carried out with markov chain monte carlo mcmc methods however the practicality of these methods is limited by their computational requirement particularly when large prior intervals are assigned to the model parameters in this work a new operational strategy is investigated to alleviate the computational burden of mcmc samplers using results from a preliminary calibration performed with the first order approximation foa method with the new strategy the posterior distribution is approximated using a high order polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate model constructed over reduced parameter ranges the latter are obtained from the 99 9 foa confidence intervals two challenging test cases are investigated to assess efficiency and accuracy of the new strategy the first test case considers estimation of flow and pesticide transport parameters from a synthetic infiltration experiment the second test case deals with the assessment of unsaturated hydraulic soil parameters from a real word laboratory drainage experiment the results of the proposed strategy are compared to those of foa of the standard mcmc method and of an improved mcmc method in which the sampler is preconditioned with draws from the foa posterior distribution for both test cases the new strategy provides accurate mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty regions and is much more efficient than the other mcmc methods it is up to 50 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method keywords unsaturated flow pesticide transport bayesian inference confidence intervals polynomial chaos expansion dream zs software 1 introduction statistical calibration of hydrogeological models is an essential task to increase their reliability although these models are by definition an approximation of reality their calibration aims to demonstrate their ability to satisfactorily mimic the real world model calibration is achieved by facing the model responses to the observations stemming from laboratory or in situ experiments in statistical inverse problems the unknown model parameters are investigated in a statistical framework that provides the parameter posterior joint probability distribution function jpdf from the latter it is then straightforward to infer the posterior 95 confidence interval ci to quantify uncertainty on the estimated parameters the assessment of posterior cis is far from being straightforward if the observed model outputs are highly nonlinear functions of parameters christensen and cooley 1999 for this reason the markov chain monte carlo mcmc samplers has received much attention due to its ability to tackle well posed nonlinear problems e g metropolis et al 1953 hastings 1970 vrugt et al 2013 craiu and rosenthal 2014 van ravenzwaaij et al 2016 during the last two decades mcmc sampling has been largely used for the assessment of the posterior jpdf of hydrogeological model parameters e g rajabi et al 2015 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2016 wang et al 2017 hayek et al 2017 linde et al 2017 laloy et al 2017 younes et al 2017 shi et al 2012 showed that mcmc methods are more appealing than nonlinear regression methods for uncertainty quantification in the vadose zone in the last decades the mcmc method received many improvements in order to accelerate its convergence e g haario et al 2006 ter braak and vrugt 2008 dostert et al 2009 cui et al 2011 laloy and vrugt 2012 vrugt et al 2013 rajabi et al 2015 among others in particular vrugt et al 2009 improved the efficiency of mcmc by developing the dream sampler laloy and vrugt 2012 developed dream zs a sampler that runs multiple chains in parallel for an efficient exploration of the parameter space despite these improvements the first order approximation foa approach that relies on local search algorithms such as the levenberg marquardt algorithm remains largely used in practical applications hayek et al 2008 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2011 fahs et al 2014 seki et al 2015 hassane and ackerer 2017 hassane maina et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 the foa assumes that the posterior jpdf is gaussian centered on the optimum parameter set under this assumption the cis are estimated using a linearization of the model near the optimum carrera and neuman 1986 kool and parker 1988 this linearization assumes that the jacobian estimated at the global optimum is constant within the cis donaldson and schnabel 1987 stated that this approximation remains reasonably accurate in a nonlinear least squares approach however recent studies have shown that model nonlinearities can violate this assumption see for instance vrugt and bouten 2002 shi et al 2012 lu et al 2012 in the context of soil hydrologic models several authors have compared cis obtained with foa and mcmc samplers vrugt and bouten 2002 showed that the cis of foa are accurate for water retention parameters in the case of a sandy soil but are larger than the mcmc cis in the case of a clayey soil vurgin et al 2007 compared confidence region estimation obtained with foa and the shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem algorithm which is based on the mcmc sampling technique two nonlinear test problems have been investigated to identify hydraulic parameters in groundwater flow problems based on experimental well tests the authors showed that the linear approximation method overestimates the posterior cis for the first nonlinear test problem but produced reasonable cis for the second nonlinear test problem gallagher and doherty 2007 undertook parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis of a watershed model for both synthetic and real word cases their results demonstrated that the foa method overestimates the parameter cis compared to the ones obtained with mcmc mertens et al 2009 investigated inverse modeling of pesticide leaching in lysimeters they showed that foa correctly locates the global minimum but overestimates the parameter uncertainties compared to scem results kahl et al 2015 compared local and global inverse modelling strategies to estimate pesticide transport parameters from lysimeter studies they suggested running the local search algorithm several times with different starting points in order to avoid local minima the selection of the starting points is done in a way that the risk of getting stuck in the same local optimum is minimized the authors showed that the nonlinear cis obtained via mcmc are smaller than their linear counterparts obtained using the foa method this short review on the comparison between the mcmc and foa techniques confirms a general conclusion that mcmc provides accurate estimation of the posterior cis of model parameters but is highly computational consuming on the contrary foa is computationally efficient to evaluate the set of optimal parameter gallagher and doherty 2007 thought the algorithm can be trapped in local minima which can be avoided if the initialization is performed with different starting points however foa may fail to provide accurate posterior cis gallagher and doherty 2007 hence the main objective of this work is to alleviate the computational burden of mcmc samplers by using i a two step procedure where results from a first calibration performed with the foa approach are used to enhance the efficiency of the mcmc sampler and ii an accurate surrogate model that runs faster than the original model to compute the posterior parameter distributions in the literature several two step procedures have been proposed to improve the efficiency of mcmc methods for instance vrugt and bouten 2002 used the shuffled complex evolution sce global optimization algorithm duan et al 1992 to locate the most likely parameter set of the multivariate posterior target distribution then at each mode the foa is used to generate the proposal distribution which serves to initialize the mcmc sampler laloy et al 2013 developed two strategies to accelerate bayesian inference of a high parametrized and cpu demanding groundwater flow model in the first strategy a linear polynomial chaos expansion pce surrogate model is constructed and samples from the surrogate posterior distribution are used to initialize dreamzs this strategy is similar in spirit to the one developed by zeng et al 2012 the second strategy is a two stage mcmc scheme dostert et al 2009 cui et al 2011 in this strategy each time a proposal is generated using mcmc simulations a linear pce surrogate model is first evaluated and only accepted proposals are evaluated by the original model ma et al 2008 showed that this scheme has higher acceptance rates than standard mcmc methods this strategy has been often employed with generalized polynomial chaos surrogate models e g liu 2001 christen and fox 2005 efendiev et al 2005 mondal et al 2010 cui et al 2011 elsheikh et al 2014 another two step procedure has been proposed by oladyshkin et al 2013a in a first step the original model is projected onto a mathematically optimal response surface via the arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion then in a second step the reduced model is matched to observation data via bootstrap filtering the direct combination of mcmc with an inexpensive surrogate pce instead of the original forward model has been initially proposed by marzouk et al 2007 marzouk and xiu 2009 and marzouk and najm 2009 to accelerate bayesian inference the strategy has been employed by nagel and sudret 2015 for the inversion of heat conduction problems and by wu and kozlowski 2017 for a nuclear reactor simulation problem laloy et al 2013 oladyshkin et al 2013a and oladyshkin et al 2013b stated that the surrogate posterior distribution might not be valid if the pce surrogate model is not sufficiently accurate note that laloy et al 2013 used a pce of order 1 since they found that high order approximations were computationally intractable the limitation of pce in the bayesian solution of inverse problems has been investigated by lu et al 2015 they noted that a sufficiently accurate pce requires a high order which may renders pce sampling expensive bazargan et al 2015 suggested the use of a sparse pce where only the most relevant terms of the pce decomposition are retained glaser et al 2016 analyzed the feasibility of the pce as a surrogate model using different orders and showed that the pc expansion can replace the forward model in the bayesian inference which allows a significant reduction of the computational cost compared to a pure mcmc approach in this work a new operational strategy named mcmc pce red is developed in which the posterior distribution is approximated using an accurate surrogate model based on i high order pces and ii reduced intervals corresponding to the foa 99 9 cis instead of the initial prior parameter intervals to allow construction of accurate and efficient surrogate models indeed by proceeding this way sufficiently accurate pces can be constructed to fit the forward model on the reduced intervals without requiring very high orders which may render pce sampling very expensive two test cases dealing with synthetic and real word problems are investigated to assess efficiency and accuracy of the new strategy the first test case considers estimation of flow and pesticide transport parameters from a synthetic infiltration experiment the second test case deals with the assessment of unsaturated hydraulic soil parameters from a laboratory drainage experiment for both test cases the results are compared against those of foa the standard mcmc method and the strategy proposed by vrugt and bouten 2002 referenced hereafter as mcmc precond in which the convergence is enhanced by preconditioning the mcmc sampler with draws from the foa posterior distribution the plan of the paper is the following section 2 describes the mathematical model of flow and pesticide transport through unsaturated soils the mcmc sampler used in dream zs the pce surrogate model and the new strategy developed to improve the efficiency of the mcmc sampler section 3

test case parameter estimation is performed using synthetic scenarios in which data from numerical simulations are corrupted before using them as observations we assume that the parameters k s and Î¸ s have been initially measured from a saturated flow experiment as recommended by van dam et al 1994 however instead of fixing their values as in nÃ¼tzmann et al 1998 we assign them narrow gaussian distributions this allows to take into account uncertainties associated to k s and Î¸ s and their effect on the estimation of the other flow and transport parameters hence a gaussian distribution is associated to k s with a mean value of 50 cm day and a standard deviation of 1 cm day which corresponds to the 95 ci 48 52 cm day similarly for Î¸ s we associate a gaussian distribution with a mean value of 0 43 cm3 cm 3 and a standard deviation of 0 01 cm3 cm 3 which corresponds to the 95 ci 0 41 0 45 cm3 cm 3 the remainders parameters are presumed uniformly distributed over the intervals reported in table 1 these ranges are chosen as bounds enclosing the reference values which are also depicted in table 1 the intervals are chosen large enough to reflect the usual difficulty associated with modeling exercises hampered by a poor prior knowledge of model parameter values the vector of unknown parameters for the flow transport model is Î¾ k s Î¸ s Î¸ r Î± n a l n f Ï kd Î» a reference

table 1 is shown in figs 1 and 2 in the fig 1 the cumulative outflow starts increasing at approximately 1000 min after the beginning of the injection it has an almost linear behavior until 5500 min then it slowly increases with an asymptotic behavior due to the gravity drainage because of the nonlinear sorption the breakthrough concentration curve fig 2 shows a front starting at approximately 5000 min it increases slowly and reaches its maximum value at around 12000 min then it decreases due to the degradation process the data used as conditioning information for model calibration are also shown in the figs 1 and 2 two scenarios corresponding to different number of measurements used for parameter calibration are investigated these scenarios are explored here to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the different calibration strategies in the case of small and large posterior uncertainty regions the scenarios are the following qc 200 in this case 200 non intrusive temporal measurements of cumulative outflow and output concentration data collected every 100 min during a period of 20000 min are used for the calibration qc 20 the number of measurements for the calibration is strongly reduced only 20 non intrusive measurements of cumulative outflow and output concentration are considered 2 3 laboratory drainage experiment the second case study deals with a real word laboratory experiment indeed a drainage experiment was performed using a vertical column of l 1 m height and a diameter of 10 cm the column was filled with a homogeneous quartz sand of a uniform index d 60 d 10 1 6 placed over a 6 mm thick porous ceramic plate of conductivity k sp 0 003 c m h the column was initially fully saturated with a ponding of 4 7 cm four depression steps corresponding to 40 70 100 and 130 cm at respectively t0 0 t1 74 5 h t2 162 1 h and t3 259 2 h were applied to the lower boundary of the column the volumetric water content was measured at 10 cm from the sand surface and a digital balance with an accuracy of 1 g measured the cumulative outflow fig 3 shows the measured water content and cumulative outflow this figure shows that the porous medium remains under saturated conditions during the falling head phase which corresponds to the first 22 h during this phase the water content is constant at saturation and the cumulative outflow exhibits an exponential behavior the vector of observed data is formed by 40 measurements of water content and 40 measurements of the cumulative outflow for a total duration of the experiment of 360 h additional details regarding the set up of the experiment and the measuring techniques can be found in younes et al 2013 the vector of unknowns is formed by all unsaturated soil parameters Î¾ k s Î¸ s Î¸ r Î± n these parameters are presumed uniformly distributed over the ranges reported in table 2 simulations are performed with a commercial numerical code based on the conforming finite element method in conjunction with the newton raphson linearization scheme the water content is expanded using a first order taylor series with respect to the piezometric head celia et al 1990 farthing and ogden 2017 both porous medium and porous plate are descritized using a fine mesh formed by elements of size 0 2 cm the time step management during the simulation is of heuristic type the size of the new time step is adjusted according to the convergence behavior of the linearization scheme the jacobian is evaluated analytically for both newton raphson linearization and levenberg marquardt optimization 2 4 bayesian parameter estimation the bayesian parameter estimation approach is used to assess the parameter joint posterior distribution vrugt et al 2008 via the dream zs mcmc sampler laloy and vrugt 2012 dream zs generates sequences of parameter sets that in principle asymptotically converge toward the target joint posterior distribution gelman et al 2013 let s consider the first studied case dealing with synthetic flow and pesticide transport experiment the joint posterior distribution matches the likelihood function that is 9 p Î¾ y mes Ï q n q Ï c n c exp s s q Î¾ 2 Ï q 2 s s c Î¾ 2 Ï c 2 where s s q Î¾ and s s c Î¾ are the sums of the squared differences between the modeled and observed data of the cumulative outflow and output concentration respectively for instance s s q Î¾ k 1 n q q mes k q mod k Î¾ 2 resp s s c which includes the observed q mes k resp c mes k and predicted q mod k resp c mod k cumulative outflow resp output concentration at time t k for the number of cumulative outflow resp concentration observations n q resp n c in the current study the mcmc algorithm relies on the metropolis hasting inference in the latter a new candidate Î¾ i is generated at the ith iteration from a proposal distribution q Î¾ i Î¾ i 1 which only depends on the previous accepted candidate acceptance or rejection of a new candidate is based on the associated hasting ratio defined as 10 Î± min 1 p Î¾ i y mes q Î¾ i Î¾ i 1 p Î¾ i 1 y mes q Î¾ i 1 Î¾ i taking the last 25 of individuals of the mcmc when the chains have converged yields multiple sets of parameters Î¾ that adequately fit the model onto observations these sets are then used to assess the optimal parameter values and the cis the posterior distribution is considered stationary if the chains are not autocorrelated and the convergence criterion of gelman and ruban 1992 rstat is less than 1 2 in this work 3 parallel chains are used with the dream zs mcmc sampler 2 5 the pce surrogate model the polynomial chaos theory was originally introduced by wiener 1938 and has been extensively used in various domains of research and engineering since then e g ghanem and spanos 1991 tatang et al 1997 xiu and karniadakis 2002 le maÃ®tre et al 2002 acharjee and zabaras 2007 li and zhang 2007 fajraoui et al 2011 younes et al 2013 pces have been largely used to perform variance based sensitivity analysis of computer models see for instance sudret 2008 blatman and sudret 2010 fajraoui et al 2012 younes et al 2016 shao et al 2017 mara et al 2017 but can also serve as a surrogate model of the original one this feature is exploited here in conjunction with the mcmc sampler pce casts the model response of interest f Î¾ onto a set of orthonormal multivariate polynomials up to a polynomial degree p 11 f Î¾ Î± p s Î± Ï Î± Î¾ where Î± Î± 1 Î± m n d is a d th dimensional index d corresponds to the number of parameters and Î¾ is the input vector of parameters formed by d independently and identically distributed random variables the s Î± s are the polynomial coefficients and Ï Î± s are the generalized polynomial chaos of degree Î± i 1 d Î± i such as legendre hermite or jacobi polynomials in the sequel we employ legendre polynomials since uniform prior distributions are considered for the parameters a pce is constructed for each measurement i e for each observed output at each observable time for this purpose we generate n realizations of the parameter values within their prior uncertainty ranges and evaluate the original model response for each draw then the pc coefficients are estimated by ordinary least square regression given the parameter sample and the associated model responses a pce of degree p 4 similar results are obtained with p 5 is used for the expansion of the outputs hence the number of polynomial coefficients is n p d p d p 715 for the synthetic flow and pesticide transport test case and n p 126 for the laboratory drainage test case there are several sampling techniques proposed in the literature to generate parameter sample the optimal design of size n n p proposed in sudret 2008 selects the collocation points closest to the origin of the sampling space in this work we use a random sampling of 1000 parameter sets for the first test case and of 200 parameter sets for the second test case the fig 4 shows that the pce of fourth order reproduces well the original flow pesticide transport model an average rmse of 0 0062 is found between simulated concentrations obtained from the original and pces surrogate models for 100 different parameter combinations randomly drown from the prior distribution and not used for the construction of the pces in this figure 40 pces obtained at different simulation times were employed for the comparison note that the optimal experimental design suggested by sudret 2008 yielded less accurate pces since the corresponding rmse is 0 017 because the laboratory drainage experiment involves only 5 unknown parameters compared to the synthetic flow and pesticide transport test case which involves 9 parameters the pce of order 4 yields a better fitting to the original model fig 5 an average rmse of 0 0026 is found between water contents obtained from the original and the pces surrogate models constructed at 40 different simulation times the pces were constructed over reduced parameter ranges instead of the prior parameter ranges which can be very large to increase the chances that the chosen reduced intervals encompass the target solution the reduced intervals correspond to the 99 9 foa cis which are around 70 larger than the 95 cis furthermore to make sure that the bounds of the 99 9 confidence intervals obtained from foa are not underestimated one can check that the bound values limits of the ci of each parameter are not probable compared to the optimum parameter set to do so we employ a strategy based on the maximal conditional probability distribution approach proposed in mara et al 2015 the idea is the following given the optimal parameter set Î¾ map and its assigned score w map namely 13 Î¾ map arg max p Î¾ y mes w map p Î¾ map y mes and denoting Î¾ i low Î¾ i up the 99 9 foa confidence interval of the parameter Î¾ i one has to evaluate the maximal score assigned to each bound of each parameter that is 14 w i p Î¾ i y mes Î¾ i where the superscript is either low or up then the ratio 15 ratio w i w map 0 1 indicates whether the bound value Î¾ i of the parameter Î¾ i is probable or not a small value 0 01 of the ratio at the limit bounds for all parameters indicates that it is likely that the foa 99 9 cis encompass the basin of convergence of the mcmc sampler note that one can also analyse the posterior parameter distributions to check that the 99 9 foa cis encompasses entirely the target solution if not one needs to repeat the inversion using wider intervals for the parameters in question 2 6 the calibration strategies four calibration strategies are used to evaluate the optimal parameter sets and cis for the two case studies foa based on the levenberg marquardt search algorithm mcmc the mcmc sampler with the original model and initial prior parameter intervals mcmc precond the mcmc sampler initialized with draws from the foa posterior distribution as proposed by vrugt and bouten 2002 mcmc pce red the new strategy based on the mcmc sampler with the high order pce surrogate model and reduced support corresponding to the foa 99 9 cis 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthetic flow and pesticide infiltration experiment 3 1 1 qc 200 scenario in this scenario a large number of 200 measurements of cumulative outflow and output concentrations are used for the calibration of the synthetic flow and pesticide infiltration experiment as an illustration of the bayesian inversion results we show in fig 6 the results obtained with the standard mcmc method the on diagonal plots show the posterior parameter distributions the off diagonal plots show correlations between parameters in the mcmc sample fig 6 shows almost bell shaped posterior distributions for all parameters strong correlations are observed between Î¸ s and Ï kd r 0 99 and a l and nf r 0 91 from the mcmc sample it is straightforward to estimate the posterior 95 confidence intervals of each parameter the latter as well as the estimated mean values obtained with the different approaches are reported in table 3 this table shows that all parameters are well estimated from the non intrusive measurements of cumulative outflow and outlet concentrations since i identified mean values are very close to the reference solution ii all confidence intervals include the reference solution and iii the confidence intervals are rather narrow the parameter n is the best estimate of all parameters with a ci around 2 of its mean estimated value the parameters k s Î¸ s Î± nf Ï kd and Î» are fairly estimated with cis around 10 the parameters Î¸ r and a l are less well estimated with cis around 50 the results of table 3 show that the four calibration methods yield the same quality of results in term of mean estimated values and cis concerning the efficiency of the different calibration methods for this scenario the most efficient method is foa since it requires only 217 s of cpu time the standard mcmc method was terminated after 50 000 model runs which required 183392s the convergence was reached at around 40 000 model runs the last 25 mcmc draws were used to estimate the statistical measures of the posterior distribution mcmc precond was terminated after 15 000 model runs which required 35081s the convergence was reached in less than 10 000 model runs hence for the studied scenario mcmc precond is 5 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method note that this efficiency is not only due to the reduction of the number of model runs required to reach the convergence but also to the reduction of the average cpu time per simulation run indeed even if the total number of model runs was fixed to 50 000 for both methods the mcmc precond required around 50 less cpu time than the standard mcmc method this is due to the fact that with the standard mcmc method some runs were performed with parameter combinations which were far from the solution for these combinations the convergence of the nonlinear flow transport model was more difficult to reach and required more cpu time for instance we observed that for certain parameter sets far from the solution the cpu time required by the flow transport model could be 20 times larger than for parameter sets close to the solution this highlights the benefit of using reduced intervals with mcmc for such situations to demonstrate this assertion we perform a bayesian inversion using the mcmc sampler with the forward nonlinear flow and pesticide transport model using reduced intervals corresponding to the 99 9 foa confidence intervals the convergence is reached at around 20 000 model runs and required only 32596s hence for this test case the mcmc with reduced intervals required until 6 times less cpu time than with the standard intervals the mcmc pce red method required around 1127s for the construction of the pce and 4581s for the bayesian inversion with the surrogate model this weak cpu time can be explained by the following reasons i the mcmc method converges quickly less than 20 000 model runs were required because of the strong reduction of prior parameter ranges for instance the prior interval for the parameter n is 1 2 7 whereas its reduced 99 9 foa ci is 1 35 1 43 ii the pce runs much faster than the nonlinear unsaturated flow pesticide transport model and iii the same pce structure is utilized for all time steps hence the evaluation of the pce coefficients is expensive only for the first time step for the following time steps the assessment of the pce coefficients is optimized and required only a matrix vector product hence the results of the current scenario can be summarized as follows although the studied problem is highly nonlinear the foa approach based on the lm calibration method provided accurate estimations of both mean parameter values and cis furthermore the foa is by far the most efficient method for this scenario mcmc precond is 5 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method while providing identical results mcmc pce red provided accurate mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty ranges and is up to 30 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method 3 1 2 qc 20 scenario in this scenario the number of measurements used for the calibration of the synthetic flow and pesticide infiltration problem is strongly reduced only one in ten of the previous cumulative outflow and output concentration data are taken into account for the calibration the results of mcmc are plotted in the fig 7 all parameters show bell shaped posterior distributions except Î¸ r a l and nf indeed the histogram of the parameter Î¸ r shows multimodality which reflects nonuniqueness problems the posterior distribution of a l and nf deviate remarkably from the normal distribution the distribution of nf reaches the lower bound of its allowed interval of variation and this has a repercussion on the upper bound of a l because of the correlation between the two parameters indeed strong correlations occur between Î¸ s and Ï kd r 0 95 and a l and nf r 0 96 compared to the previous scenario the results depicted in table 4 show larger uncertainty regions which makes sense since the number of measurements used in the calibration is significantly reduced compared to the results of qc 200 scenario the cis of k s and Î¸ s remain unchanged due to their narrow prior gaussian distributions furthermore the parameter Ï kd remains as well estimated as in the first scenario probably because of its high sensitivity for the rest of the parameters the mcmc cis have increased with different proportion indeed the cis of Î¸ r a l n and nf have been multiplied by 2 those of Î± and Î» by 3 the estimated mean values obtained with the different calibration methods are almost similar and are in very good agreement with the reference solution concerning uncertainty regions the cis obtained with the three mcmc approaches are very close the comparison between foa and mcmc results shows that the foa method overestimates the cis for some parameters indeed the foa overestimates the cis of the parameters a l and nf by around 100 furthermore the uncertainty region for the dispersivity parameter includes unphysical negative values this confirms the results of gallagher and doherty 2007 mertens et al 2009 and kahl et al 2015 which assert that foa can fail to provide realistic parameter uncertainties and may yield larger cis than with the mcmc sampler indeed with foa the jacobian is assumed to remain constant across the uncertainty regions for the first scenario this assumption was quite fulfilled because of the small uncertainty regions insured by the large number of measurements however for the current scenario the assumption is not fulfilled because of the large uncertainty regions induced by the low number of measurements interestingly the two parameters a l and nf for which we observe a strong overestimation of the ci by foa are those which do not have a bell shaped posterior distribution it is an intrinsic assumption with foa in the fig 7 concerning efficiency of the different calibration methods the standard mcmc method was terminated after 90 000 model runs which required 254112s of cpu time the convergence was reached at around 70 000 model runs and the last 20 000 runs were used for the statistical measures of the posterior distribution mcmc precond was terminated after 25 000 model runs which required 45236s as previously mcmc precond is 5 to 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method mcmc pce red required around 1186s for the construction of the pce and 2058s for the bayesian inversion with the surrogate model less than 20 000 model runs were required to reach the convergence in summary the results of the studied scenario show that the reduction of the number of measurements in the calibration yields large uncertainty regions for some parameters for these parameters the foa method gave accurate estimated mean values but inaccurate and even unphysical cis foa mcmc precond and mcmc pce red yield similar results in term of estimated mean parameter values uncertainty ranges provided by mcmc precond and mcmc pce red are in very good agreements with the results of the standard mcmc method as previously mcmc precond is about 5 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method mcmc pce red based on surrogate modeling and reduction of prior parameter intervals is up to 50 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method 3 2 laboratory drainage experiment the mcmc calibration results of the laboratory drainage experiment using 40 measurements of cumulative outflow and water content inside the column are plotted in the fig 8 in this figure only Î¸ s and n exhibit bell shaped posterior distributions the parameters Î¸ r and Î± present non symmetrical distributions with a left tail for Î¸ r and a right tail for Î± the posterior distributions show that k s cannot be well identified the lack of identifiability of k s is probably due to its low sensitivity since the flow is essentially controlled by the conductivity of the porous plate which is around 500 times less permeable than the porous medium table 5 depicts the estimated mean parameter values as well as the corresponding cis obtained with the different approaches the four calibration approaches yield close mean estimated parameter values the cis of the three mcmc approaches are in very good agreement an overestimation of the cis up to 100 is observed for almost all parameters with foa furthermore foa yields unphysical negative bound for the ci of the parameter k s concerning the efficiency of the different approaches foa required 764 s of cpu time the mcmc precond and the standard mcmc methods have similar efficiency indeed both are used with 15 000 model runs the convergence is reached at around 10 000 model runs and required around 150000s of cpu time mcmc pce red required 1378s for the construction of the pce and around 400s for the mcmc estimation note that this huge gain in cpu time is caused by the small number of model runs 2 0 0 required for the construction of the pce since the model contains only 5 parameters as reported in the fig 9 the rstat of all parameters show that the overall chains have converged after 5000 runs note that the gain in cpu cost of mcmc pce red is expected to be less pronounced for problems with a large number of parameters indeed for such situations building an accurate high order pce necessitates a large experimental design which can be expansive in terms of cpu time in summary the results of the laboratory drainage experiment show that all mcmc methods yield similar mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty regions foa yields mean estimated parameter values in agreement with mcmc results but overestimates parameters cis contrarily to the previous synthetic test cases mcmc precond do not allow any gain in term of efficiency compared to the standard mcmc method mcmc pce red based on surrogate modeling and reduction of parameter intervals is more than 70 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method 4 conclusions in this work a new operational strategy has been investigated to reduce the computational burden of the mcmc samplers by tacking advantages of the fast foa method the new strategy named mcmc pce red approximates the posterior distribution by a surrogate one using a pce surrogate model that runs faster than the original one accurate surrogate pces are employed using i high order pces and ii reduced intervals which correspond to the foa 99 9 cis instead of the initial prior parameter intervals efficiency and accuracy of the new strategy have been investigated for two challenging test cases the first test case considers estimation of flow and pesticide transport parameters for a synthetic infiltration experiment whereas the second test case deals with the assessment of unsaturated hydraulic parameters from a real word laboratory drainage experiment two scenarios with different number of measurements were considered for the first test case in the first scenario a large number of non intrusive measurements of cumulative outflow and outlet concentration have been taken into account whereas in the second scenario the number of non intrusive measurements was reduced by ten in order to investigate cases with large uncertainty regions the results of the new strategy have been compared to those of foa of the standard mcmc method and of the strategy named mcmc precond where the mcmc sampler is preconditioned with draws from the foa posterior distribution all calibration methods yield accurate estimation of the optimal parameter values for both scenario of the synthetic test case the first scenario shows that although the studied problem is highly nonlinear the foa method provided accurate mean estimated values and uncertainty bounds and is the most efficient calibration method for the second scenario with a reduced number of measurements the inversion yielded parameters with larger uncertainty regions foa overestimates the cis of some parameters by a factor of 100 and can yield cis with unphysical negative values furthermore for both scenarios uncertainty ranges provided by mcmc precond and mcmc pce red are in very good agreements with the results of the standard mcmc method mcmc precond was 5 6 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method whereas mcmc pce red based on surrogate modeling and reduction of prior parameter intervals is up to 50 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method the results for the second test case dealing with soil parameter estimation from a laboratory drainage experiment showed that foa yielded accurate mean parameter estimated values but inaccurate cis mcmc precond and mcmc pce red yielded accurate mean estimated values and cis further contrarily to the synthetic test case mcmc precond do not allow any gain in term of efficiency compared to the standard mcmc method mcmc pce red is highly efficient and can be up to 50 times more efficient than the standard mcmc method the proposed strategy is not limited to the test cases discussed in this work it can be applied to other interesting hydrogeological models and a wide range of applications efficiency of this strategy for mutli physical models is

7184,the heihe river basin is one of the important bases for commercial grain production in china the climate change impacts on crop yield and crop water productivity cwp need to be examined for sustainable development of regional agriculture especially under the pressure of population growth and regional water scarcity a distributed hydrological model was constructed for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin on the basis of the soil and water assessment model swat the sensitivity ranks of hydrological parameters were evaluated for the runoff and evapotranspiration processes and then independently calibrated with the observations of three gauging stations qilian zhamashike and yingluoxia stations and the evapotranspiration data derived by remote sensing the study first simulated crop yield and cwp for four typical crop types namely corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish for the period of 1966 2014 using the swat model calibrated with the crop yield data during the period of 2005 2014 from zhangye statistics yearbook the spatial temporal features of crop yield and cwp were analyzed a fluctuating growth was found for the 49 year trend of corn spring wheat and spring canola polish the spring barley shows a slightly decreasing trend the high yield area moved from the west part suzhou and gaotai counties to the east part linze ganzhou and shandan counties of the basin for the past 49 years and the area of high cwp concentrated in the gaotai and linze counties the responses of cwp to climatic forcing were further studied using wavelet coherence method it is found that maximum temperature dominated the cwp evolutions especially at the long term scales the corn showed the largest elastic responses to the climatic factors which may be favorable to improve regional cwp by expanding planting area in addition the strategies of regional cwp improvement were discussed based on the results keywords swat model crop yield crop water productivity climatic variation wavelet coherence northwest china 1 introduction china s food production is one of fundamental issues of china sustainability development and the food security is the most important concern in national agricultural development jiang 2014 wang et al 2017 with the population growth the sustainable agriculture development is further challenged by water scarcity saeigs and van berkel 1995 heilig et al 2000 wallace et al 2002 meanwhile the climate change has exerted its effects on natural and human systems wang et al 2009 nguyen et al 2010 sivakumar 2011 correspondingly the crop growth has been affected even some decrease of crop production is observed ipcc 2014 therefore under the challenging environment of both climate and water shortage whether we can keep the level of crop production whether we can reduce the agricultural water requirement under the current production level and whether we can increase crop yield under current water consumption level are the critical issues of the sustainable agricultural water management and food security in china the heihe river basin in northwest china see fig 1 is one the major commercial grain bases and relies on agriculture economy the water usage for irrigated agricultural is about 80 of the total water consumption zhang et al 2006 and the percentage is still increasing this intensified the conflicts between the agricultural water use in the middle reaches and the ecological water use in the lower reaches to guarantee the regional food security and relieve the contradiction it is essential to improve the regional crop water productivity cwp which is defined as the crop yield over the water use by actual evapotranspiration kajine et al 2003 the cwp reflects the returned benefits by the consumed water which is of great importance in agricultural production bouman 2007 the factors affecting cwp are mainly divided into two categories climate factors and management factors the management includes both crop and agricultural management a better understanding of the factors and their contributions to historical yield and cwp increase is significant to predict the future trend sacks and kucharik 2011 employed the agro ibis agroecosystem model with the 25 year observations to investigate the effects of crop management changing planting dates and crop growing degree day requirements on crop yields the major component of cwp among it agricultural management includes fertilization and irrigation activities irrigation affects cwp mainly through the crop yield and evapotranspiration siebert and doll 2010 there are already many studies for optimizing irrigation schedules to improve reginal cwp zhang and oweis 1999 liu et al 2004 xue and ren 2017 however the responses of cwp to regional climate variations are seldom studied and reported the underlying mechanism is that the warming climate may alter the crop water requirement through affecting the photosynthesis and respiration processes and then influences crop yield and evapotranspiration zhao et al 2010 feng 2014 zhang et al 2015 resulting in regional cwp evolutions meanwhile agrometeorological hazards and primary cropping patterns which are affected by climatic changes also lead to variations in crop yield and cwp zhou 2012 wen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the intensified climate evolutions with increased temperature and changing precipitation amount for the heihe river basin has been reported in the study of wang and zhang 2010 and cao et al 2003 for recent 50 years the effects of climate changes on cwp cannot be ignored especially for the water shortage area of northwest china the historical changes are need to be assessed to identify the spatial temporal features of cwp and its trend to find the regional water saving potentials and to form reasonable water allocation schemes singh et al 2006 liu et al 2007 faramarzi et al 2010 the regulation and improvement of cwp is an inevitable way to relieve water shortage problem to improve national food security for a sustainable development of agriculture in china the long term crop yield data for a large scale basin is usually limited soil and water assessment tool swat model has been proven to be useful tool to simulate the hydrological cycle and crop growth simultaneously arnold et al 1998 wu et al 2012 the suitability of swat simulation crop yield and spatial temporal distribution of cwp has been reported arnold and allen 1996 immerzeel et al 2008 luo et al 2008 schuol et al 2008 setegn et al 2010 sun and ren 2014 studied the effects of different irrigation scenarios on the crop yield and cwp in the haihe river basin in north china the simulations of hydrological processes in the heihe river basin in northwest china using swat model were also reported zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 for example the evapotranspiration changes in one part of heihe agricultural region were examined using remotely sensed et data and with the swat model in study of zou et al 2017 these studies all support the utilization of swat model on the simulations of the spatial temporal distributions of cwp over the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin on the basis of previous studies this study attempted to construct a distributed hydrological model for crop yield and cwp

04 e and 37 41 42 42 n which is the second largest inland river in china feng et al 2004 the upper reaches of the heihe river belongs to the qilian mountain area with the elevation between 1680 m and 5280 m and the length of main stream about 303 km the middle reaches include a large area of alluvial fans between the yingluoxia and zhengyixia stations with the elevation between 1300 m and1680 m and main stream of about 185 km main stream the lower reaches of the heihe river basin is dominated by desert and gobi the heihe river basin belongs to continental arid climate the vegetation in the upper reaches see fig 2 is covered by mountain forest shrubs and grasslands with the long term average precipitation about 350 mm and average temperature less than 2 c which is the runoff generation area the farmland concentrates in the middle reaches a flat oasis area the light and heat resources are abundant in the reaches with sunshine duration about 3000 4000 h year and average temperature of 6 8 c however as the limited precipitation about 140 mm year droughts are frequently occurred niu et al 2017 the seasonal variations show the water supply is increased during the period of april july and from december to march it is the dry season the relative humidity fluctuates within 40 60 the middle reaches of the heihe river basin include zhangye city and linze minyue qilian shandan sunan and suzhou counties the zhangye city is also named as golden zhangye which is one of the ten commercial grain bases in china about 92 75 farmland concentrates in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin consumed about 86 85 water resources in the basin the main crops are corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish the area of corn is the largest 3 method 3 1 hydrological modelling 3 1 1 swat model the swat model arnold et al 1998 was developed by the united states department of agriculture usda in 1994 it is a physical based semi distributed model that applies on a watershed scale the model can integrate the various spatial data to simulate the hydrological cycles and physical chemical processes for different watersheds the sub basins are delineated for a large scale river basin based on digital elevation model dem data and water collecting area the hydrologic response unit hru is further derived according to land use and soil types on the basis of sub basins the hru is minimum simulation unit for modelling hydrological and related processes with the meteorological forcing data and model parameters the generated runoff is routed to the basin outlet for the estimations of streamflow sediment and chemical loadings neitsch et al 2005 swat is a combination of different modules and each hydrological process corresponds to a module the runoff generation is enabled by the scs curve or green ampt infiltration module the scs curve usda scs 1972 is adopted in this study with considering soil penetrability land cover and antecedent soil water conditions the soil water flow is calculated by the dynamic tank method sloan et al 1983 with considering hydraulic conductivity slope and spatial temporal changes of soil water the river channel routing is realized by the variable coefficient model or the muskingum method the evapotranspiration in the model includes canopy interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration the penman monteith method monteith 1965 is selected in this study to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet with the meteorological data of air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the pet and soil cover index are used to compute the potential soil evaporation actual soil evaporation is a function of soil depth and an exponential function of soil water the actual plant transpiration is a function of pet soil water content and root depth the plant growth in swat model is developed based on the environmental policy integrated calculator epic crop model williams et al 1984 the daily variations of the leaf area index canopy height and root growth are simulated based on the radiation derived potential growth the biomass increase for a given day is estimated based on the photosynthetically active radiation and the plant radiation use efficiency then the crop yield is calculated based on the above ground biomass and harvest index 3 1 2 data input and model setup the digital elevation model dem data used in this study is provided by heihe plan science data center http heihedata org with the spatial resolution of 30 m from which the basin boundary and its stream network are extracted the relevant geophysical information such as slope and stream length are also calculated by the dem data the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin was finally discretized into 34 sub basins in which the upper reaches include 9 sub basins mainly in qilian and sunan counties and the middle reaches include 25 sub basins mainly distributed in gaotai linze ganzhou minyue and sandan counties other required data needed for model setup and the data sources are listed in table 1 the distributions of different soil types for the studied region are obtained from the vectorization map with the scale of 1 15000000 the soil properties are mainly described as physical and chemical parameters which were quantified based on field measurements or estimated using statistical methods the land use data is interpreted from landsat remotely sensed data with a spatial resolution of 30 m obtained from heihe plan science data center the 13 land use types are listed in table 2 the farmland area occupied about 40 8 in the middle reaches with crops of corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish meanwhile there are a small part of farmland located between zhamshke and qilian stations in the upper reaches of the basin where the crops are mainly spring barley and spring canola polish the land use soil and slope datasets were linked with the swat databases and 49 sub basins were further subdivided into 1613 hrus the meteorological data were also obtained from the heihe plan science data center the climate data at 11 stations qilian sandan mingyue sunan yeliugou linze gaotai jiuquan dingxin and tuole for the period of 1964 2014 were used in the swat model the data includes daily precipitation the maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and solar radiation the period of 1964 1966 was set as spin up period 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis model calibration and validation the sensitivity analysis parameter uncertainty analysis and calibration in this study are accomplished by sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 using the swat cup program abbaspour et al 2004 2007 in sufi 2 the parameter uncertainty considers all sources of uncertainties including uncertainty in driving variables in the conceptual model in model parameter or the observed data the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu is employed to quantify the uncertainty in the output caused by the parameter uncertainty the effectiveness of the calibration uncertainty is reflected by two indices p factor and r factor p factor is the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95ppu band while r factor is the average width of the band divided by the standard deviation of the corresponding measured variable p factor approaching to 1 and r factor approaching to 0 are the ideal situation to bracket most of the measured within the 95 ppu band in addition to the common objective functions of nash sutcliffe ns mean relative error mre relatively root mean square error rrmse relative bias index pbias two other indices representing more interpretable class of measures based on the sum of error magnitudes are used which are e1 and dr willmott et al 2011 to determine the performance of the model which are given as 1 ns 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 2 mre i 1 n q s i q o i q o i n 3 rrmse i 1 n q o i q s i 2 n q o 4 pbias i 1 n q s i q o i i 1 n q o i 5 e 1 1 mae mad 1 i 1

number of time positions in general sensitivity analysis is an indispensable step to identify parameters to be calibrated the sensitivity analysis adopted in this study is the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method van griensven et al 2006 twenty one hydrological parameters were selected in the sensitivity analysis for the simulation of the streamflow the data for period 1995 1997 were used for sensitivity analysis and calibration while the data from 1998 to 2000 were choosed for model validation in both qilian gauging station and zhamashenke gauging station in yingluoxia gauging station there were longer term series data for calibration and validation which were period 1966 1984 and period 1985 1995 respectively as the et is requisite for the cwp calculation fifteen parameters were selected for the sensitivity analysis and calibration in processing et data the et data was obtained from the data management center of the heihe research program http westdc westgis ac cn with a spatial resolution 1 km for the period of 2000 2013 the 2000 2009 and 2010 2013 are the calibration and validation period respectively the crop growth simulation is directly related to the crop yield and et process during the growing season therefore it is also critical to calibrate the relevant parameters for the growing period the long term crop yield can mainly fall into trend yield which is considered as the result of agricultural investment and technology development and climatic fluctuant yield which is considered as the contribution of climatic variations fang 2011 by employing the five point moving average method the detrending crop yield was obtained with the yield data from zhangye statistic yearbook for the period of 2005 2014 the crop yield calibration was performed after calibrating the streamflow and et for the four crop types and validated by the detrending crop yields twelve parameters were selected in the dominate processes as the model provides data based on sub basins the crop yield is aggregated to the county scale before comparing with the observations 3 2 wavelet coherence analysis wavelet transform is capable to examine the variability evolution at different timescales since wavelets display variability in both time and frequency domain kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 lau and weng 1995 the continuous wavelet transform of a time

identifying the most sensitive parameters in hydrological and crop production processes of the swat model as most of them were difficult to obtain by measurement the sensitivity results for the streamflow processes is listed in table 3 the t stat stands for the sensitivity degree the larger its absolute value the more sensitive the parameter the p value represents the significance of t value if the value is closer to 0 the less chance will have for a parameter being accidently assigned as the sensitive one the ranking of model parameters indicates that the 12 parameters are to be calibrated smtmp canmx cn2 revapmn ch n2 timp smfmn gwqmn esco gw delay and hru slp the results of sensitivity study for evapotranspiration are listed in table 4 the first ten sensitive parameters are

in three gauging stations zhamashike qilian and yingluoxia stations table 5 provides the range of each parameter and the optimal value after the calibration the comparisons between the simulated and observed streamflow showed that the calibration results are satisfactory with nash sutcliffe coefficient nse larger than 0 75 and the dr larger than 0 74 the model was also well performed in the validation period with nse larger than 0 70 and dr larger than 0 73 the results also showed that there are minor differences between the simulated streamflow and observations with e1 exceeding 0 5 and dr up to 0 7 meanwhile in the evaluation p factor is larger than 0 5 and r factor is less than 1 0 the detailed calibrated and validated results were listed in table 6 and graphical comparisons for the monthly streamflow were showed in fig 3 the first ten highly sensitive parameters to et were calibrated using sufi 2 based on the validated streamflow simulation table 7 listed the initial ranges of each parameter and the respective hydrological process involved the et calibration was performed at the 34 sub basins in the heihe river basin the results showed that the p factor for 73 i e 25 34 sub basins are large than 0 5 the r factor for all sub basins were less than 1 0 meanwhile the dr value for 22 sub basins were larger than 0 75 and nse for 19 sub basins were larger than 0 7 the calibrated model was performed well in the validation period with the p factor larger than 0 65 and the r factor less than 1 for more than 60 of the total sub basins in the validation period there were 22 sub basins with dr ranged in 0 60 0 83 20 sub basins with nse larger than 0 73 fig 4 and table 8 illustrated the comparison between the observed and simulated evapotranspiration in several typical sub basins and a further demonstration of the model performance was presented in table 8 the sub basins 7 and 12 were located in the northwestern part of the heihe river basin sub basins 18 19 and 26 in the southeastern part and the sub basin 32 was in the upper reaches meanwhile the sub basins 18 19 and 26 cover a large area of crop lands the et variations over these sub basins represented characteristics of the regional et and the simulated results were in good agreement with the observed data overall the calibrated swat model can simulate et well for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin table 9 listed the calibrated results of crop parameters for the four crop types i e corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish in the heihe river basin among it the 6 parameters frgrw 1 laimx 1 frgrw 2 laimx 2 blai and dlai controlled the evolutions of leaf area index lai for the crop growing season during the calibration process the modified step of the parameters frgrw 1 laimx 1 frgrw 2 and laimx 2 was 0 05 and for blai and dlai were 0 5 and 1 respectively the bio e hvsti and chtmx were the main control parameters for biomass crop yield and height with the modified step 1 0 05 and 0 2 respectively the results showed that the calibrations of harvest index and canopy height optimized the crop yield simulations the t base and gsi directly affected the length of growing season and et processes the final optimum values for the 12 parameters were listed in table 9 the statistical measures and graphical comparisons between the simulated crop yield and climatic fluctuant yield in fig 5 were shown in table 10 and fig 6 respectively the statistics showed that the mre values for the 6 counties were all less than 25 and the pbias values were basically close to 0 the simulations were not better for spring barely partly due to the crop is scattered in the region which increased the collection uncertainty of observed data in the statistical yearbook fig 6 demonstrated the good agreement for the simulated and observed detrending crop yield over the agricultural region in the heihe river basin as the crop yield simulations were calibrated with the data of recent ten years 2005 2014 the crop yield for the first 40 years 1966 2005 were actually based on the agricultural cultivar conditions in recent ten years therefore we stated that the responses of cwp for the studied period is mainly on climatic variations with the cultivar background of the recent ten years 4 3 spatial temporal features of crop yield and cwp et and the crop yield of corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish for the period of 1966 2014 over the upper middle heihe river basin were simulated by the calibrated swat model the mann kendall nonparametric test was applied to show the temporal trend of different variables of the whole region and the results are summarized in table 11 fig 7 a showed that et had an increase trend with fluctuations between 410 mm in 1985 and 505 mm in 2007 comparing the et evolutions with the corresponding precipitation in fig 8 the fluctuations were closely related with the correlation value 0 72 especially the minimum et matched the minimum precipitation amount in 1985 therefore the precipitation was a main meteorological driving force for the reginal et in addition the values of et peak occurred more during the period of 1989 2014 with 2 3 years a time than those in the period of 1966 1988 with 4 5 years during the whole period of 1966 2014 the total crop yield also showed a slowly increasing trend but the increasing rate was slightly higher during the period of 1990 2014 it is found that the changing trend were similar with that of maximum minimum temperature trend which indicated the dominate factors for crop production in studied region fig 7 b provided the historical trend of crop yield for the four typical crops over the total period of 1966 2014 the changing trends were different under different crop types the spring canola polish showed an increasing trend which were mainly due to that 1 the growing season was long however the required water was limited by the arid climate zhang and li 2004 and 2 regarding impacts of the temperature the canola polish was tolerant to low temperature and it was mainly planted in the minyue and shandan counties closed to the mountain area in the upper reaches the temperature here was relatively low and the changing was less obvious than in other regions the responses of the yield of corn and spring wheat to temperature were relatively obvious with the different increase rates occurred before and after 1990 the changing pattern of spring barley was different with other three crops which was similar with the rh in fig 8 c with the correlation value 0 69 the larger spring barley yield occurred in 1967 1993 and 1998 corresponding to the high rh in these years respectively the barley yield matched rh at the lower values in 1974 1981 and 1995 therefore the barley yield in the heihe region showed a significant responses to rh at the annual scale fig 9 showed the co variability between crop yield and et for the period 1966 2014 generally a relatively higher crop yield corresponds to the large amount of water consumption and the relationship is stronger during the period of 2005 2014 which can be demonstrated by the correlation coefficients between yield and et of different crop types among it the co variability on increasing trend is more obvious for the spring canola polish in the later period with the correlation coefficient up to 0 71 for corn and wheat et during 2005 2014 was increased by 4 81 and 8 66 respectively compared to et during 1966 2004 correspondingly the yield of corn and wheat was increased 41 86 and 39 55 respectively a certain temperature increase facilitates the photosystems and the increased precipitation compensated the required water increase for the photosynthesis meng et al 2017 both contributed the consistent changing variations between crop yield and et evolutions in recent years but the spring barley showed a different responses which indicated et may not be the dominate factor for the yield the cwp evolution was determined by both the changes of et and crop yield fig 7 c showed that the total cwp has an increasing trend for the period of 1966 2014 the fluctuation ranged between 0 92 kg m 3 and 1 75 kg m 3 corresponding to 3995 kg ha 1 in 1967 and 8088 kg ha 1 in 2013 respectively meanwhile fig 10 demonstrated there is a strong relationship between crop yield and cwp the r2 for corn and spring wheat reached 0 97 and 0 94 respectively this indicated crop yield controlled the cwp evolution in the heihe river basin the changing trend of cwp was different for different crop types the spring barely had the maximum with the annual average cwp of 1 45 kg m 3 meanwhile its cwp variability was also strong and the cwp reached the lowest in the latter phase in 1996 the long term average cwp of corn was about 1 30 kg m 3 as has the large proportion of corn yield i e 60 of the total crop yield the corn cwp had a larger contributions to the evolution of the total cwp in the region the wheat cwp was relatively lower with the average value about 1 00 kg m 3 the canola polish cwp had the lowest cwp with average value of 0 48 kg m 3 which belongs to high water consumption crop and was mainly planted in minyue and shandan counties therefore increasing the corn plant area is a way to improve future regional cwp for the studied region the crop planting patterns were different in different counties for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin the crop yield and cwp showed spatial differences here we selected four years i e 1967 1981 1994 and 2013 in different decades to display the spatial distributions of crop yield and cwp as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 fig 11 showed the average crop yield for the eight counties in the four years except for the yield in qilian county which is less than 2000 kg ha 1 in the other seven counties the yield was within in the range of 5000 6000 kg ha 1 the maximum yield was in ganzhou county with 5920 kg ha 1 it was observed from fig 11 at the early stage the high yield area concentrated in the gaotai and sunan counties with crop yield larger than 7000 kg ha 1 and the crop yield deceased from the western to the eastern the high yield area were moving to the eastern part along the time the crop yield in the linze and ganzhou counties increased significantly with the value larger than 8100 kg ha 1 and 9000 kg ha 1 respectively the crop yield in shandan was also larger than 7700 kg ha 1 while the increase rate of crop yield in gaotai sunan and qilian counties was relatively slow these can be attributed to the following two aspects 1 in 1960s the water resources was relatively sufficient which can meet the crop water requirement for the whole growing season and the crop yield at that time was mainly controlled by the climate the heat and light resources are abundant in gaotai and sunnan counties which resulted in high crop yield during that period with social economical development the water also need to meet the demand of other sectors and therefore the irrigation water was partly consumed ma et al 2015 the reduction of irrigation water limited the improvement of crop yield the farmland close to the yinluoxia station such as ganzhou and linze counties with sufficient irrigation water and has improved the crop yield 2 on the other aspect for the qilian and sunnan counties which were located in the upper reaches with relatively lower temperature wang et al 2009 and restricted heat and light resources the increase rate of crop yield was relatively slower zhou et al 2013 the spatial distributions of cwp for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin were shown in fig 12 the distribution changes along the time and the patterns were different for those of crop yield in fig 11 the high cwp area always concentrated in gaotai suzhou and linze counties and the cwp was growing from 1 5 kg m 3 to 2 1 kg m 3 at the early stage in these area it had relatively high crop yield although the irrigation water was restricted the irrigation measure and management had been improved the soil evaporation was reduced and the regional cwp increasing among the eight counties ganzou and linze counties had high cwp increasing rate with the improvement about 50 60 for the past four decades for minyue and shandan counties cwp increased a little of 1 65 kg m 3 the barley dominated the minyue and shandan counties with the plant area is about 82 6 of the total barely planting area in the basin in 1990s cwp decreased with the rh and this slowed down the cwp increase rate in addition the precipitation in shandan during the growing season was about 1 6 times to that of the other counties which will increase the canopy and soil evaporation liu 2012 and in turn lower down the cwp value hao 2015 therefore it is suggested that the effective collecting of precipitation in shandan county and then a rationally allocation would improve the regional cwp 4 4 multi scale responses of cwp to climatic variation to reveal the multi scale responses of cwp to the climatic variations the wavelet coherence analysis was employed to disclose the co variability features between them at different time and frequency domains fig 13 showed the local and global coherence of regional cwp over the ganzhou county in the heihe river basin with the six meteorological forcing including precipitation prep solar radiation srd minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax wind speed ws and relative humidity rh from the local wavelet coherence results left panel it was observed that there are more in phase relationships between tmin tmax and cwp at both short and relatively longer periods the global wavelet coherence right panel further showed the correlations between tmax and cwp were basically highest across different timescales especially at the long term timescales e g 8 16 years at the bands of 1 4 year and 4 8 years the common variability power basically appeared before 2000 the explanations is that the human activities and irrigation management affected more on the spatial temporal distributions of cwp in the later period resulted in a weak control by meteorological forcing overall tmax showed the most coherence with cwp which exerted the most meteorological effects on cwp in the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin for other meteorological variables prep srd ws and rh the coherence region with high variability power were mainly less than or around 4 year timescales moreover there was little significant coherence between cwp and other variables around 8 year timescales therefore the meteorological variables exerted more effects on the regional cwp at shorter time scales in addition the phase relations were also revealed by arrows in fig 13 in the significant coherence area srd tmin tmax and ws mainly showed positive coherence with cwp the anti phase relationships can be found between the significant coherence of prep rh and that of cwp which indicated the negative correlations at corresponding timescales fig 14 summarized the global wavelet coherences between meteorological forcing and cwp for the seven counties together with the average one for the studied region in terms of the shorter timescales less than 4 years prep tmin ws and rh showed stronger correlations with cwp in the relatively high frequency periods among it tmin in minyue county displayed a weak correlation with cwp partly because minyue county was close to the mountain area and its temperature was relatively lower compared to other counties in the middle reaches of the basin while the tmin in shandan and linze counties had high coherence with cwp for the relatively longer timescales than 8 years the tmax showed more dominate effects on the cwp evolutions with high global coherence values the ws in gaotai and shandan counties had higher coherence than the average for the long term timescales the elasticities of cwp to six meteorological drivers rh prep sdr tmin tmax and ws in the heihe region for three separated periods 1966 1981 1982 1998 and 1999 2014 were shown in fig 15 the elasticity was defined as Î· cwp m i Î´ c w p cwp Î´ m i m i at annual timescale where mi was the different meteorological drivers it was observed that the elasticity of corn to the climate variables was higher among the four crop types the elasticities of corn canola polish and wheat all decreased along the three separated periods during 1966 2014 among it the decrease rate of corn was the fastest one this indicated that the major control factors for cwp in the heihe river basin are changing from the single meteorological factors to the combined effects of both climate forcing and human activities e g zou et al 2017 the corn was the most important planting crop in the commercial grain base and it was distributed in many counties the continuously improved agricultural management and extended scientific technologies improved the corn yield which resulted in its highest elasticity decrease rate compared with those of other crop types in the region the elasticity of barley to srd and tmax increased in the period of 1982 1998 when compared with the results during 1966 1981 this was partly due to that the responses of cwp to them were relatively higher and fig 8 showed that the average solar radiation and temperature increased during 1982 1998 in addition the agricultural management for barley was not comparable to corn especially during the first two periods and the elasticity was more controlled by the meteorological factors 5 conclusions and discussions the distributed hydrological model of the heihe river basin in northwest china was well established using the swat model in this study both for generating runoff in mountainous area and estimating et in agricultural region with considering irrigation fertilization and planting patterns the crop yield and cwp for corn barley canola polish and spring wheat were further simulated for the 49 year period 1966 2014 the spatial temporal responses of cwp to different meteorological forcing were investigated using wavelet coherence and elasticity analysis the result will help to improve regional cwp under future changing climate the lh oat method was firstly employed to examine the sensitivity of model parameters the observed streamflow in the three gauging stations were used to rank out the first 12 sensitive parameters for the processes of snow melt surface runoff groundwater soil water and the river channel routing meanwhile the sensitive parameters of et processes were identified using the remotely sensed data the results show that sftmp snowfall temperature and canmx maximum canopy index are the most sensitive parameters in the streamflow and evapotranspiration processes respectively based on the sensitivity results those parameters were further calibrated for runoff in the mountainous area and et of the agricultural region in the upper middle of heihe river basin using sufi 2 method the simulated monthly streamflow showed a good agreement with the observations at three gauging stations with the nse above 0 72 and dr over 0 73 for both calibration and validation periods during 1966 2000 the et simulations were calibrated and validated using the remotely sensed data over 34 sub basin area for the periods of 2000 2009 and 2010 2013 respectively in the validation period there were 20 sub basins with the dr ranged 0 60 0 83 and the nse above 0 73 which indicated good et simulation in the heihe river basin moreover the model parameters on crop yield were calibrated with the observation data from zhangye statistic yearbook for the period of 2005 2014 the results showed the parameters hvsti harvest index and chtmx maximum canopy height are most sensitive parameters to the crop yield estimation the crop yield simulations agree well with the county based observations for the six counties with mre lower than 30 and pbais close to 0 overall the calibrated swat model can simulate the hydrologic components and crop growth well for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin one limitation is that we did not simulate the detailed processes on the adaptations of crops to climate changes such as possibly increased root growth in response to drought and delayed phenology in response to temperature changes which should be improved when investigated at shorter timescales the temporal variations of et crop yield and cwp were subsequently analyzed for the period 1966 2014 it was found that the et has an increasing trend with the fluctuations between 401 mm year and 505 mm year which was close to the change of precipitation in the basin the changing trend of crop yield was different for different crop types the increasing trend was found for corn and wheat while the yield of barley showed a decreasing trend the increasing trend of crop yield mainly corresponded to the change of temperature especially in the early periods and the decreasing trend of barely was more related to the decreasing changes of rh in the region cwp and crop yield are linearly related for the studied period the average cwp of corn wheat and canola polish are 1 30 kg m 3 1 00 kg m 3 and 0 48 kg m 3 respectively the average cwp of barely was the largest as 1 45 kg m 3 but showed a slightly decreasing trend therefore expanding the corn planting area will help to improve the regional cwp at current stage the spatial distribution of cwp were different due to the variations of planting patterns and climatic background in different counties the cwp in linze and ganzhou were growing all the time which are above 8100 kg ha 1 and 9000 kg ha 1 respectively the following counties in were experiencing increasing trend shandan minyue sunzhou gaotai sunan and qilian counties therefore the center of high cwp region was moved from the west to the east the barely is a dominated crop in minye county and its cwp showed a slowly increasing rate with increasing et and increasing precipitation it is suggested that effectively utilizing precipitation would improve the local cwp the responses of cwp to six climatic factors were revealed at different scales by wavelet coherence method temperature showed the highest coherence with cwp across different timescales the role of controlling meteorological drivers on cwp at relatively shorter timescales were weak in the later periods when human activities including fertilization irrigation and agricultural management became insensitive after 1990s overall the tmax was a major impact factor on the cwp evolution in the heihe agricultural region the swat model in the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin was employed to obtain the long term et and cwp time series for different counties the understanding of cwp responses to climatic factors for different crop types provided scientific basis for the sustainable agricultural development especially under the background of global climate change acknowledgements this study was supported by the chinese national natural science foundation program 51679233 91425302 and the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest 201503125 we thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive and

7184,the heihe river basin is one of the important bases for commercial grain production in china the climate change impacts on crop yield and crop water productivity cwp need to be examined for sustainable development of regional agriculture especially under the pressure of population growth and regional water scarcity a distributed hydrological model was constructed for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin on the basis of the soil and water assessment model swat the sensitivity ranks of hydrological parameters were evaluated for the runoff and evapotranspiration processes and then independently calibrated with the observations of three gauging stations qilian zhamashike and yingluoxia stations and the evapotranspiration data derived by remote sensing the study first simulated crop yield and cwp for four typical crop types namely corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish for the period of 1966 2014 using the swat model calibrated with the crop yield data during the period of 2005 2014 from zhangye statistics yearbook the spatial temporal features of crop yield and cwp were analyzed a fluctuating growth was found for the 49 year trend of corn spring wheat and spring canola polish the spring barley shows a slightly decreasing trend the high yield area moved from the west part suzhou and gaotai counties to the east part linze ganzhou and shandan counties of the basin for the past 49 years and the area of high cwp concentrated in the gaotai and linze counties the responses of cwp to climatic forcing were further studied using wavelet coherence method it is found that maximum temperature dominated the cwp evolutions especially at the long term scales the corn showed the largest elastic responses to the climatic factors which may be favorable to improve regional cwp by expanding planting area in addition the strategies of regional cwp improvement were discussed based on the results keywords swat model crop yield crop water productivity climatic variation wavelet coherence northwest china 1 introduction china s food production is one of fundamental issues of china sustainability development and the food security is the most important concern in national agricultural development jiang 2014 wang et al 2017 with the population growth the sustainable agriculture development is further challenged by water scarcity saeigs and van berkel 1995 heilig et al 2000 wallace et al 2002 meanwhile the climate change has exerted its effects on natural and human systems wang et al 2009 nguyen et al 2010 sivakumar 2011 correspondingly the crop growth has been affected even some decrease of crop production is observed ipcc 2014 therefore under the challenging environment of both climate and water shortage whether we can keep the level of crop production whether we can reduce the agricultural water requirement under the current production level and whether we can increase crop yield under current water consumption level are the critical issues of the sustainable agricultural water management and food security in china the heihe river basin in northwest china see fig 1 is one the major commercial grain bases and relies on agriculture economy the water usage for irrigated agricultural is about 80 of the total water consumption zhang et al 2006 and the percentage is still increasing this intensified the conflicts between the agricultural water use in the middle reaches and the ecological water use in the lower reaches to guarantee the regional food security and relieve the contradiction it is essential to improve the regional crop water productivity cwp which is defined as the crop yield over the water use by actual evapotranspiration kajine et al 2003 the cwp reflects the returned benefits by the consumed water which is of great importance in agricultural production bouman 2007 the factors affecting cwp are mainly divided into two categories climate factors and management factors the management includes both crop and agricultural management a better understanding of the factors and their contributions to historical yield and cwp increase is significant to predict the future trend sacks and kucharik 2011 employed the agro ibis agroecosystem model with the 25 year observations to investigate the effects of crop management changing planting dates and crop growing degree day requirements on crop yields the major component of cwp among it agricultural management includes fertilization and irrigation activities irrigation affects cwp mainly through the crop yield and evapotranspiration siebert and doll 2010 there are already many studies for optimizing irrigation schedules to improve reginal cwp zhang and oweis 1999 liu et al 2004 xue and ren 2017 however the responses of cwp to regional climate variations are seldom studied and reported the underlying mechanism is that the warming climate may alter the crop water requirement through affecting the photosynthesis and respiration processes and then influences crop yield and evapotranspiration zhao et al 2010 feng 2014 zhang et al 2015 resulting in regional cwp evolutions meanwhile agrometeorological hazards and primary cropping patterns which are affected by climatic changes also lead to variations in crop yield and cwp zhou 2012 wen et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the intensified climate evolutions with increased temperature and changing precipitation amount for the heihe river basin has been reported in the study of wang and zhang 2010 and cao et al 2003 for recent 50 years the effects of climate changes on cwp cannot be ignored especially for the water shortage area of northwest china the historical changes are need to be assessed to identify the spatial temporal features of cwp and its trend to find the regional water saving potentials and to form reasonable water allocation schemes singh et al 2006 liu et al 2007 faramarzi et al 2010 the regulation and improvement of cwp is an inevitable way to relieve water shortage problem to improve national food security for a sustainable development of agriculture in china the long term crop yield data for a large scale basin is usually limited soil and water assessment tool swat model has been proven to be useful tool to simulate the hydrological cycle and crop growth simultaneously arnold et al 1998 wu et al 2012 the suitability of swat simulation crop yield and spatial temporal distribution of cwp has been reported arnold and allen 1996 immerzeel et al 2008 luo et al 2008 schuol et al 2008 setegn et al 2010 sun and ren 2014 studied the effects of different irrigation scenarios on the crop yield and cwp in the haihe river basin in north china the simulations of hydrological processes in the heihe river basin in northwest china using swat model were also reported zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 for example the evapotranspiration changes in one part of heihe agricultural region were examined using remotely sensed et data and with the swat model in study of zou et al 2017 these studies all support the utilization of swat model on the simulations of the spatial temporal distributions of cwp over the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin on the basis of previous studies this study attempted to construct a distributed hydrological model for crop yield and cwp simulations over the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin for the period of 1966 2014 using the swat model the model is well calibrated and validated and the evapotranspiration and yields of four main crops are assessed in details in our study then the long term spatial temporal features of crop yield and cwp were discussed and evaluated overall this paper aimed at investigating the effects of different meteorological factors on cwp at the regional scale of heihe river basin this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the heihe river basin in northwest china section 3 provides the briefs of swat model model inputs parameter sensitivity calibration and validation section 4 presents the results of spatial temporal features of regional cwp and responses to climate variations section 5 concluded the study with a discussion of possible cwp improvement strategies 2 study area the heihe river see fig 1 is located in the middle of the hexi corridor between 97 42 102 04 e and 37 41 42 42 n which is the second largest inland river in china feng et al 2004 the upper reaches of the heihe river belongs to the qilian mountain area with the elevation between 1680 m and 5280 m and the length of main stream about 303 km the middle reaches include a large area of alluvial fans between the yingluoxia and zhengyixia stations with the elevation between 1300 m and1680 m and main stream of about 185 km main stream the lower reaches of the heihe river basin is dominated by desert and gobi the heihe river basin belongs to continental arid climate the vegetation in the upper reaches see fig 2 is covered by mountain forest shrubs and grasslands with the long term average precipitation about 350 mm and average temperature less than 2 c which is the runoff generation area the farmland concentrates in the middle reaches a flat oasis area the light and heat resources are abundant in the reaches with sunshine duration about 3000 4000 h year and average temperature of 6 8 c however as the limited precipitation about 140 mm year droughts are frequently occurred niu et al 2017 the seasonal variations show the water supply is increased during the period of april july and from december to march it is the dry season the relative humidity fluctuates within 40 60 the middle reaches of the heihe river basin include zhangye city and linze minyue qilian shandan sunan and suzhou counties the zhangye city is also named as golden zhangye which is one of the ten commercial grain bases in china about 92 75 farmland concentrates in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin consumed about 86 85 water resources in the basin the main crops are corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish the area of corn is the largest 3 method 3 1 hydrological modelling 3 1 1 swat model the swat model arnold et al 1998 was developed by the united states department of agriculture usda in 1994 it is a physical based semi distributed model that applies on a watershed scale the model can integrate the various spatial data to simulate the hydrological cycles and physical chemical processes for different watersheds the sub basins are delineated for a large scale river basin based on digital elevation model dem data and water collecting area the hydrologic response unit hru is further derived according to land use and soil types on the basis of sub basins the hru is minimum simulation unit for modelling hydrological and related processes with the meteorological forcing data and model parameters the generated runoff is routed to the basin outlet for the estimations of streamflow sediment and chemical loadings neitsch et al 2005 swat is a combination of different modules and each hydrological process corresponds to a module the runoff generation is enabled by the scs curve or green ampt infiltration module the scs curve usda scs 1972 is adopted in this study with considering soil penetrability land cover and antecedent soil water conditions the soil water flow is calculated by the dynamic tank method sloan et al 1983 with considering hydraulic conductivity slope and spatial temporal changes of soil water the river channel routing is realized by the variable coefficient model or the muskingum method the evapotranspiration in the model includes canopy interception soil evaporation and plant transpiration the penman monteith method monteith 1965 is selected in this study to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet with the meteorological data of air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed the pet and soil cover index are used to compute the potential soil evaporation actual soil evaporation is a function of soil depth and an exponential function of soil water the actual plant transpiration is a function of pet soil water content and root depth the plant growth in swat model is developed based on the environmental policy integrated calculator epic crop model williams et al 1984 the daily variations of the leaf area index canopy height and root growth are simulated based on the radiation derived potential growth the biomass increase for a given day is estimated based on the photosynthetically active radiation and the plant radiation use efficiency then the crop yield is calculated based on the above ground biomass and harvest index 3 1 2 data input and model setup the digital elevation model dem data used in this study is provided by heihe plan science data center http heihedata org with the spatial resolution of 30 m from which the basin boundary and its stream network are extracted the relevant geophysical information such as slope and stream length are also calculated by the dem data the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin was finally discretized into 34 sub basins in which the upper reaches include 9 sub basins mainly in qilian and sunan counties and the middle reaches include 25 sub basins mainly distributed in gaotai linze ganzhou minyue and sandan counties other required data needed for model setup and the data sources are listed in table 1 the distributions of different soil types for the studied region are obtained from the vectorization map with the scale of 1 15000000 the soil properties are mainly described as physical and chemical parameters which were quantified based on field measurements or estimated using statistical methods the land use data is interpreted from landsat remotely sensed data with a spatial resolution of 30 m obtained from heihe plan science data center the 13 land use types are listed in table 2 the farmland area occupied about 40 8 in the middle reaches with crops of corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish meanwhile there are a small part of farmland located between zhamshke and qilian stations in the upper reaches of the basin where the crops are mainly spring barley and spring canola polish the land use soil and slope datasets were linked with the swat databases and 49 sub basins were further subdivided into 1613 hrus the meteorological data were also obtained from the heihe plan science data center the climate data at 11 stations qilian sandan mingyue sunan yeliugou linze gaotai jiuquan dingxin and tuole for the period of 1964 2014 were used in the swat model the data includes daily precipitation the maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and solar radiation the period of 1964 1966 was set as spin up period 3 1 3 sensitivity analysis model calibration and validation the sensitivity analysis parameter uncertainty analysis and calibration in this study are accomplished by sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 using the swat cup program abbaspour et al 2004 2007 in sufi 2 the parameter uncertainty considers all sources of uncertainties including uncertainty in driving variables in the conceptual model in model parameter or the observed data the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu is employed to quantify the uncertainty in the output caused by the parameter uncertainty the effectiveness of the calibration uncertainty is reflected by two indices p factor and r factor p factor is the percentage of measured data bracketed by the 95ppu band while r factor is the average width of the band divided by the standard deviation of the corresponding measured variable p factor approaching to 1 and r factor approaching to 0 are the ideal situation to bracket most of the measured within the 95 ppu band in addition to the common objective functions of nash sutcliffe ns mean relative error mre relatively root mean square error rrmse relative bias index pbias two other indices representing more interpretable class of measures based on the sum of error magnitudes are used which are e1 and dr willmott et al 2011 to determine the performance of the model which are given as 1 ns 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 2 mre i 1 n q s i q o i q o i n 3 rrmse i 1 n q o i q s i 2 n q o 4 pbias i 1 n q s i q o i i 1 n q o i 5 e 1 1 mae mad 1 i 1

o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o where q o i stands for the observed streamflow value q s i represents simulated value q o is the average value of observations q s is the mean value of simulation and n is the number of time positions in general sensitivity analysis is an indispensable step to identify parameters to be calibrated the sensitivity analysis adopted in this study is the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method van griensven et al 2006 twenty one hydrological parameters were selected in the sensitivity analysis for the simulation of the streamflow the data for period 1995 1997 were used for sensitivity analysis and calibration while the data from 1998 to 2000 were choosed for model validation in both qilian gauging station and zhamashenke gauging station in yingluoxia gauging station there were longer term series data for calibration and validation which were period 1966 1984 and period 1985 1995 respectively as the et is requisite for the cwp calculation fifteen parameters were selected for the sensitivity analysis and calibration in processing et data the et data was obtained from the data management center of the heihe research program http westdc westgis ac cn with a spatial resolution 1 km for the period of 2000 2013 the 2000 2009 and 2010 2013 are the calibration and validation period respectively the crop growth simulation is directly related to the crop yield and et process during the growing season therefore it is also critical to calibrate the relevant parameters for the growing period the long term crop yield can mainly fall into trend yield which is considered as the result of agricultural investment and technology development and climatic fluctuant yield which is considered as the contribution of climatic variations fang 2011 by employing the five point moving average method the detrending crop yield was obtained with the yield data from zhangye statistic yearbook for the period of 2005 2014 the crop yield calibration was performed after calibrating the streamflow and et for the four crop types and validated by the detrending crop yields twelve parameters were selected in the dominate processes as the model provides data based on sub basins the crop yield is aggregated to the county scale before comparing with the observations 3 2 wavelet coherence analysis wavelet transform is capable to examine the variability evolution at different timescales since wavelets display variability in both time and frequency domain kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 lau and weng 1995 the continuous wavelet transform of a time series xn n 0 n 1 is defined as the convolution of xn with a scaled and translated wavelet Ï 0 Î· 7 w n Î¾ Î³ 0 n 1 x Î³ Ï Î³ n Î´ t Î¾ where indicates the complex conjugate Î¾ is the wavelet scale for varying the window width as multiples of the lowest frequency 1 Î´t in which Î´t is the time interval and Î³ is the translation parameter to shift the wavelet along the time the mother wavelet i e morlet wavelet in this study Ï 0 Î· that depends on a non dimensional time parameter Î· is defined as follows torrence and compo 1998 8 Ï 0 Î· Ï 1 4 e i Ï 0 Î· e Î· 2 2 where Ï 0 is the non dimensional frequency the local wavelet power spectrum is defined as w n Î¾ Î³ 2 which gives a local measure of the variance of the analyzed time series at each scale and at each time the wavelet coherence analysis is to identify regions in time frequency domain where the two time series co vary following torrence and webster 1998 the coherence phase is defined as tan 1 imaginary part of w n xy s real part of w n xy s and the wavelet coherence of the two time series is given as follows 9 r n 2 s s s 1 w n xy s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where s is a smoothing operator given by grinsted et al 2004 10 s w s scale s time w n s where sscale is the smoothing along the wavelet scale axis and stime is the smoothing in time a suitable smoothing operator for the morlet wavelet is provided by torrence and webster 1999 as follows 11 s time w s w n s c 1 t 2 2 s 2 s 12 s s c a l e w n w n s c 2 0 6 s n where c1 and c2 are normalization constants and is the rectangle function the

identifying the most sensitive parameters in hydrological and crop production processes of the swat model as most of them were difficult to obtain by measurement the sensitivity results for the streamflow processes is listed in table 3 the t stat stands for the sensitivity degree the larger its absolute value the more sensitive the parameter the p value represents the significance of t value if the value is closer to 0 the less chance will have for a parameter being accidently assigned as the sensitive one the ranking of model parameters indicates that the 12 parameters are to be calibrated smtmp canmx cn2 revapmn ch n2 timp smfmn gwqmn esco gw delay and hru slp the results of sensitivity study for evapotranspiration are listed in table 4 the first ten sensitive parameters are

in three gauging stations zhamashike qilian and yingluoxia stations table 5 provides the range of each parameter and the optimal value after the calibration the comparisons between the simulated and observed streamflow showed that the calibration results are satisfactory with nash sutcliffe coefficient nse larger than 0 75 and the dr larger than 0 74 the model was also well performed in the validation period with nse larger than 0 70 and dr larger than 0 73 the results also showed that there are minor differences between the simulated streamflow and observations with e1 exceeding 0 5 and dr up to 0 7 meanwhile in the evaluation p factor is larger than 0 5 and r factor is less than 1 0 the detailed calibrated and validated results were listed in table 6 and graphical comparisons for the monthly streamflow were showed in fig 3 the first ten highly sensitive parameters to et were calibrated using sufi 2 based on the validated streamflow simulation table 7 listed the initial ranges of each parameter and the respective hydrological process involved the et calibration was performed at the 34 sub basins in the heihe river basin the results showed that the p factor for 73 i e 25 34 sub basins are large than 0 5 the r factor for all sub basins were less than 1 0 meanwhile the dr value for 22 sub basins were larger than 0 75 and nse for 19 sub basins were larger than 0 7 the calibrated model was performed well in the validation period with the p factor larger than 0 65 and the r factor less than 1 for more than 60 of the total sub basins in the validation period there were 22 sub basins with dr ranged in 0 60 0 83 20 sub basins with nse larger than 0 73 fig 4 and table 8 illustrated the comparison between the observed and simulated evapotranspiration in several typical sub basins and a further demonstration of the model performance was presented in table 8 the sub basins 7 and 12 were located in the northwestern part of the heihe river basin sub basins 18 19 and 26 in the southeastern part and the sub basin 32 was in the upper reaches meanwhile the sub basins 18 19 and 26 cover a large area of crop lands the et variations over these sub basins represented characteristics of the regional et and the simulated results were in good agreement with the observed data overall the calibrated swat model can simulate et well for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin table 9 listed the calibrated results of crop parameters for the four crop types i e corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish in the heihe river basin among it the 6 parameters frgrw 1 laimx 1 frgrw 2 laimx 2 blai and dlai controlled the evolutions of leaf area index lai for the crop growing season during the calibration process the modified step of the parameters frgrw 1 laimx 1 frgrw 2 and laimx 2 was 0 05 and for blai and dlai were 0 5 and 1 respectively the bio e hvsti and chtmx were the main control parameters for biomass crop yield and height with the modified step 1 0 05 and 0 2 respectively the results showed that the calibrations of harvest index and canopy height optimized the crop yield simulations the t base and gsi directly affected the length of growing season and et processes the final optimum values for the 12 parameters were listed in table 9 the statistical measures and graphical comparisons between the simulated crop yield and climatic fluctuant yield in fig 5 were shown in table 10 and fig 6 respectively the statistics showed that the mre values for the 6 counties were all less than 25 and the pbias values were basically close to 0 the simulations were not better for spring barely partly due to the crop is scattered in the region which increased the collection uncertainty of observed data in the statistical yearbook fig 6 demonstrated the good agreement for the simulated and observed detrending crop yield over the agricultural region in the heihe river basin as the crop yield simulations were calibrated with the data of recent ten years 2005 2014 the crop yield for the first 40 years 1966 2005 were actually based on the agricultural cultivar conditions in recent ten years therefore we stated that the responses of cwp for the studied period is mainly on climatic variations with the cultivar background of the recent ten years 4 3 spatial temporal features of crop yield and cwp et and the crop yield of corn spring wheat spring barley and spring canola polish for the period of 1966 2014 over the upper middle heihe river basin were simulated by the calibrated swat model the mann kendall nonparametric test was applied to show the temporal trend of different variables of the whole region and the results are summarized in table 11 fig 7 a showed that et had an increase trend with fluctuations between 410 mm in 1985 and 505 mm in 2007 comparing the et evolutions with the corresponding precipitation in fig 8 the fluctuations were closely related with the correlation value 0 72 especially the minimum et matched the minimum precipitation amount in 1985 therefore the precipitation was a main meteorological driving force for the reginal et in addition the values of et peak occurred more during the period of 1989 2014 with 2 3 years a time than those in the period of 1966 1988 with 4 5 years during the whole period of 1966 2014 the total crop yield also showed a slowly increasing trend but the increasing rate was slightly higher during the period of 1990 2014 it is found that the changing trend were similar with that of maximum minimum temperature trend which indicated the dominate factors for crop production in studied region fig 7 b provided the historical trend of crop yield for the four typical crops over the total period of 1966 2014 the changing trends were different under different crop types the spring canola polish showed an increasing trend which were mainly due to that 1 the growing season was long however the required water was limited by the arid climate zhang and li 2004 and 2 regarding impacts of the temperature the canola polish was tolerant to low temperature and it was mainly planted in the minyue and shandan counties closed to the mountain area in the upper reaches the temperature here was relatively low and the changing was less obvious than in other regions the responses of the yield of corn and spring wheat to temperature were relatively obvious with the different increase rates occurred before and after 1990 the changing pattern of spring barley was different with other three crops which was similar with the rh in fig 8 c with the correlation value 0 69 the larger spring barley yield occurred in 1967 1993 and 1998 corresponding to the high rh in these years respectively the barley yield matched rh at the lower values in 1974 1981 and 1995 therefore the barley yield in the heihe region showed a significant responses to rh at the annual scale fig 9 showed the co variability between crop yield and et for the period 1966 2014 generally a relatively higher crop yield corresponds to the large amount of water consumption and the relationship is stronger during the period of 2005 2014 which can be demonstrated by the correlation coefficients between yield and et of different crop types among it the co variability on increasing trend is more obvious for the spring canola polish in the later period with the correlation coefficient up to 0 71 for corn and wheat et during 2005 2014 was increased by 4 81 and 8 66 respectively compared to et during 1966 2004 correspondingly the yield of corn and wheat was increased 41 86 and 39 55 respectively a certain temperature increase facilitates the photosystems and the increased precipitation compensated the required water increase for the photosynthesis meng et al 2017 both contributed the consistent changing variations between crop yield and et evolutions in recent years but the spring barley showed a different responses which indicated et may not be the dominate factor for the yield the cwp evolution was determined by both the changes of et and crop yield fig 7 c showed that the total cwp has an increasing trend for the period of 1966 2014 the fluctuation ranged between 0 92 kg m 3 and 1 75 kg m 3 corresponding to 3995 kg ha 1 in 1967 and 8088 kg ha 1 in 2013 respectively meanwhile fig 10 demonstrated there is a strong relationship between crop yield and cwp the r2 for corn and spring wheat reached 0 97 and 0 94 respectively this indicated crop yield controlled the cwp evolution in the heihe river basin the changing trend of cwp was different for different crop types the spring barely had the maximum with the annual average cwp of 1 45 kg m 3 meanwhile its cwp variability was also strong and the cwp reached the lowest in the latter phase in 1996 the long term average cwp of corn was about 1 30 kg m 3 as has the large proportion of corn yield i e 60 of the total crop yield the corn cwp had a larger contributions to the evolution of the total cwp in the region the wheat cwp was relatively lower with the average value about 1 00 kg m 3 the canola polish cwp had the lowest cwp with average value of 0 48 kg m 3 which belongs to high water consumption crop and was mainly planted in minyue and shandan counties therefore increasing the corn plant area is a way to improve future regional cwp for the studied region the crop planting patterns were different in different counties for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin the crop yield and cwp showed spatial differences here we selected four years i e 1967 1981 1994 and 2013 in different decades to display the spatial distributions of crop yield and cwp as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 fig 11 showed the average crop yield for the eight counties in the four years except for the yield in qilian county which is less than 2000 kg ha 1 in the other seven counties the yield was within in the range of 5000 6000 kg ha 1 the maximum yield was in ganzhou county with 5920 kg ha 1 it was observed from fig 11 at the early stage the high yield area concentrated in the gaotai and sunan counties with crop yield larger than 7000 kg ha 1 and the crop yield deceased from the western to the eastern the high yield area were moving to the eastern part along the time the crop yield in the linze and ganzhou counties increased significantly with the value larger than 8100 kg ha 1 and 9000 kg ha 1 respectively the crop yield in shandan was also larger than 7700 kg ha 1 while the increase rate of crop yield in gaotai sunan and qilian counties was relatively slow these can be attributed to the following two aspects 1 in 1960s the water resources was relatively sufficient which can meet the crop water requirement for the whole growing season and the crop yield at that time was mainly controlled by the climate the heat and light resources are abundant in gaotai and sunnan counties which resulted in high crop yield during that period with social economical development the water also need to meet the demand of other sectors and therefore the irrigation water was partly consumed ma et al 2015 the reduction of irrigation water limited the improvement of crop yield the farmland close to the yinluoxia station such as ganzhou and linze counties with sufficient irrigation water and has improved the crop yield 2 on the other aspect for the qilian and sunnan counties which were located in the upper reaches with relatively lower temperature wang et al 2009 and restricted heat and light resources the increase rate of crop yield was relatively slower zhou et al 2013 the spatial distributions of cwp for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin were shown in fig 12 the distribution changes along the time and the patterns were different for those of crop yield in fig 11 the high cwp area always concentrated in gaotai suzhou and linze counties and the cwp was growing from 1 5 kg m 3 to 2 1 kg m 3 at the early stage in these area it had relatively high crop yield although the irrigation water was restricted the irrigation measure and management had been improved the soil evaporation was reduced and the regional cwp increasing among the eight counties ganzou and linze counties had high cwp increasing rate with the improvement about 50 60 for the past four decades for minyue and shandan counties cwp increased a little of 1 65 kg m 3 the barley dominated the minyue and shandan counties with the plant area is about 82 6 of the total barely planting area in the basin in 1990s cwp decreased with the rh and this slowed down the cwp increase rate in addition the precipitation in shandan during the growing season was about 1 6 times to that of the other counties which will increase the canopy and soil evaporation liu 2012 and in turn lower down the cwp value hao 2015 therefore it is suggested that the effective collecting of precipitation in shandan county and then a rationally allocation would improve the regional cwp 4 4 multi scale responses of cwp to climatic variation to reveal the multi scale responses of cwp to the climatic variations the wavelet coherence analysis was employed to disclose the co variability features between them at different time and frequency domains fig 13 showed the local and global coherence of regional cwp over the ganzhou county in the heihe river basin with the six meteorological forcing including precipitation prep solar radiation srd minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax wind speed ws and relative humidity rh from the local wavelet coherence results left panel it was observed that there are more in phase relationships between tmin tmax and cwp at both short and relatively longer periods the global wavelet coherence right panel further showed the correlations between tmax and cwp were basically highest across different timescales especially at the long term timescales e g 8 16 years at the bands of 1 4 year and 4 8 years the common variability power basically appeared before 2000 the explanations is that the human activities and irrigation management affected more on the spatial temporal distributions of cwp in the later period resulted in a weak control by meteorological forcing overall tmax showed the most coherence with cwp which exerted the most meteorological effects on cwp in the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin for other meteorological variables prep srd ws and rh the coherence region with high variability power were mainly less than or around 4 year timescales moreover there was little significant coherence between cwp and other variables around 8 year timescales therefore the meteorological variables exerted more effects on the regional cwp at shorter time scales in addition the phase relations were also revealed by arrows in fig 13 in the significant coherence area srd tmin tmax and ws mainly showed positive coherence with cwp the anti phase relationships can be found between the significant coherence of prep rh and that of cwp which indicated the negative correlations at corresponding timescales fig 14 summarized the global wavelet coherences between meteorological forcing and cwp for the seven counties together with the average one for the studied region in terms of the shorter timescales less than 4 years prep tmin ws and rh showed stronger correlations with cwp in the relatively high frequency periods among it tmin in minyue county displayed a weak correlation with cwp partly because minyue county was close to the mountain area and its temperature was relatively lower compared to other counties in the middle reaches of the basin while the tmin in shandan and linze counties had high coherence with cwp for the relatively longer timescales than 8 years the tmax showed more dominate effects on the cwp evolutions with high global coherence values the ws in gaotai and shandan counties had higher coherence than the average for the long term timescales the elasticities of cwp to six meteorological drivers rh prep sdr tmin tmax and ws in the heihe region for three separated periods 1966 1981 1982 1998 and 1999 2014 were shown in fig 15 the elasticity was defined as Î· cwp m i Î´ c w p cwp Î´ m i m i at annual timescale where mi was the different meteorological drivers it was observed that the elasticity of corn to the climate variables was higher among the four crop types the elasticities of corn canola polish and wheat all decreased along the three separated periods during 1966 2014 among it the decrease rate of corn was the fastest one this indicated that the major control factors for cwp in the heihe river basin are changing from the single meteorological factors to the combined effects of both climate forcing and human activities e g zou et al 2017 the corn was the most important planting crop in the commercial grain base and it was distributed in many counties the continuously improved agricultural management and extended scientific technologies improved the corn yield which resulted in its highest elasticity decrease rate compared with those of other crop types in the region the elasticity of barley to srd and tmax increased in the period of 1982 1998 when compared with the results during 1966 1981 this was partly due to that the responses of cwp to them were relatively higher and fig 8 showed that the average solar radiation and temperature increased during 1982 1998 in addition the agricultural management for barley was not comparable to corn especially during the first two periods and the elasticity was more controlled by the meteorological factors 5 conclusions and discussions the distributed hydrological model of the heihe river basin in northwest china was well established using the swat model in this study both for generating runoff in mountainous area and estimating et in agricultural region with considering irrigation fertilization and planting patterns the crop yield and cwp for corn barley canola polish and spring wheat were further simulated for the 49 year period 1966 2014 the spatial temporal responses of cwp to different meteorological forcing were investigated using wavelet coherence and elasticity analysis the result will help to improve regional cwp under future changing climate the lh oat method was firstly employed to examine the sensitivity of model parameters the observed streamflow in the three gauging stations were used to rank out the first 12 sensitive parameters for the processes of snow melt surface runoff groundwater soil water and the river channel routing meanwhile the sensitive parameters of et processes were identified using the remotely sensed data the results show that sftmp snowfall temperature and canmx maximum canopy index are the most sensitive parameters in the streamflow and evapotranspiration processes respectively based on the sensitivity results those parameters were further calibrated for runoff in the mountainous area and et of the agricultural region in the upper middle of heihe river basin using sufi 2 method the simulated monthly streamflow showed a good agreement with the observations at three gauging stations with the nse above 0 72 and dr over 0 73 for both calibration and validation periods during 1966 2000 the et simulations were calibrated and validated using the remotely sensed data over 34 sub basin area for the periods of 2000 2009 and 2010 2013 respectively in the validation period there were 20 sub basins with the dr ranged 0 60 0 83 and the nse above 0 73 which indicated good et simulation in the heihe river basin moreover the model parameters on crop yield were calibrated with the observation data from zhangye statistic yearbook for the period of 2005 2014 the results showed the parameters hvsti harvest index and chtmx maximum canopy height are most sensitive parameters to the crop yield estimation the crop yield simulations agree well with the county based observations for the six counties with mre lower than 30 and pbais close to 0 overall the calibrated swat model can simulate the hydrologic components and crop growth well for the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin one limitation is that we did not simulate the detailed processes on the adaptations of crops to climate changes such as possibly increased root growth in response to drought and delayed phenology in response to temperature changes which should be improved when investigated at shorter timescales the temporal variations of et crop yield and cwp were subsequently analyzed for the period 1966 2014 it was found that the et has an increasing trend with the fluctuations between 401 mm year and 505 mm year which was close to the change of precipitation in the basin the changing trend of crop yield was different for different crop types the increasing trend was found for corn and wheat while the yield of barley showed a decreasing trend the increasing trend of crop yield mainly corresponded to the change of temperature especially in the early periods and the decreasing trend of barely was more related to the decreasing changes of rh in the region cwp and crop yield are linearly related for the studied period the average cwp of corn wheat and canola polish are 1 30 kg m 3 1 00 kg m 3 and 0 48 kg m 3 respectively the average cwp of barely was the largest as 1 45 kg m 3 but showed a slightly decreasing trend therefore expanding the corn planting area will help to improve the regional cwp at current stage the spatial distribution of cwp were different due to the variations of planting patterns and climatic background in different counties the cwp in linze and ganzhou were growing all the time which are above 8100 kg ha 1 and 9000 kg ha 1 respectively the following counties in were experiencing increasing trend shandan minyue sunzhou gaotai sunan and qilian counties therefore the center of high cwp region was moved from the west to the east the barely is a dominated crop in minye county and its cwp showed a slowly increasing rate with increasing et and increasing precipitation it is suggested that effectively utilizing precipitation would improve the local cwp the responses of cwp to six climatic factors were revealed at different scales by wavelet coherence method temperature showed the highest coherence with cwp across different timescales the role of controlling meteorological drivers on cwp at relatively shorter timescales were weak in the later periods when human activities including fertilization irrigation and agricultural management became insensitive after 1990s overall the tmax was a major impact factor on the cwp evolution in the heihe agricultural region the swat model in the upper middle reaches of the heihe river basin was employed to obtain the long term et and cwp time series for different counties the understanding of cwp responses to climatic factors for different crop types provided scientific basis for the sustainable agricultural development especially under the background of global climate change acknowledgements this study was supported by the chinese national
