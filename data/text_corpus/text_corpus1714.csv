8570,growing agricultural water demand is dramatically affecting the implementation of and compliance with water sharing plans in regions such as the murray darling basin mdb problems can arise from water theft poor resourcing or questionable actions from stakeholders recent actions from mdb governments have resulted in improved regulation although more is required in a technical governance and cultural space to create a comprehensive and transparent management framework this is pivotal in improving overall trust in water regulators we discuss an integrated water resource management approach for improved water regulation involving the implementation of remote sensing technologies to complement metering coupled with a focus on a stronger compliance culture in a range of stakeholder groups and regulatory changes that allow quicker adoption of unbiased best practice science and technology keywords murray darling basin compliance culture remote sensing irrigation transboundary water water resource management 1 introduction competition for water is increasing globally due to population growth and associated water needs irrigated agriculture is the largest water consumer using 72 worldwide increasing to 90 in developing countries wisser et al 2008 the high demand has led to water sharing legislation which aims to impose fair sharing of water amongst all the users in a river system this can cause issues when catchment boundaries cross jurisdictional borders requiring cooperation by various governments and stakeholders zeitoun et al 2016 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 zeitoun et al 2010 the occurrence of transboundary catchments are a common occurrence globally mccracken and wolf 2019 as water demand grows there can be instances of water theft and non compliance with water sharing legislation it is estimated that between 30 and 50 of all water is stolen globally before it reaches its intended end user loch et al 2020 this is not a new phenomenon with many examples throughout global history discussed by baird and walters 2020 this can be difficult to detect which interferes with attempts at achieving the goals of sustainable water sharing in complex hydrologic systems the murray darling basin mdb australia can be considered a globally significant example of large scale water sharing grafton and horne 2014 horne 2020 the mdb s water is shared as part of a complex set of arrangements and institutions that have led to the establishment of the murray darling basin authority mdba and the murray darling basin plan mdbp the management and decision making within the mdb is complicated as the catchment crosses jurisdictional borders of the australian state governments which are responsible for parts of the water management process the mdbp specifies a reduction in extractions of 2750 gl year hart 2016 williams 2017 with the aim to support environmental flows a water market was also created which required water accounting recent investigations and reports have raised concerns about water theft compliance and enforcement abc four corners 2017 nsw ombudsman 2017 walker 2019 threatening the integrity of the water sharing plans in place the investigations have resulted in many reports with recommendations for change inspector general murray darling basin 2020 matthews 2017a matthews 2017b vertessy et al 2019 these reports and investigations have led to a government response and brought about some changes particularly related to water use and the metering of extractions business qld 2019 mdb ministerial council 2018 mdba

the state and federal governments horne 2020 the volumes of recovered water have been questioned wheeler et al 2020 williams and grafton 2019 water theft and non compliance have the potential to undermine progress in reaching the extraction reduction goal reduced water availability which could be reduced by water theft among other things has clear impacts on ecosystem functioning indigenous cultural value and the water market connell 2015 grafton et al 2015 hart 2016 nikolakis et al 2013 the environmental social and economic impacts are all interconnected the water market is used by governments to purchase and supply environmental water marshall and alexandra 2016 and by irrigators to allow water to reach the highest value user hart 2016 water theft impacts honest irrigators and communities as well as governments and taxpayers by artificially increasing the market price due to restrictions in supply it is important that a strong culture of compliance is implemented to ensure the marketisation and regulation of water is most effective grafton and wheeler 2018 papas 2018 to overcome the many challenges related to compliance water policy in the mdb must improve measurements of diversions accompanied by transparent water accounting improve compliance activities and use multiple lines of evidence for water accounting wheeler et al 2020 a key recommendation of the many reports into water management in the mdb has been the adoption of remote sensing technology for the remote monitoring of illegal actions matthews 2017a matthews 2017b vertessy et al 2019 with the vast amount of remote sensing methodologies developed for agricultural and irrigation purposes a clear path needs to be set to achieve efficient and meaningful change in a region that has long standing and practical challenges to rapidly change improved regulation and compliance will help in the execution of policy within the mdb this paper discusses an integrated water resource management approach for developing technical governance and social structures to improve compliance methods successful changes to the compliance system in complex water sharing systems cannot be done solely through technical implementation compliance culture of end users i e normative compliance within the mdb has been identified as poor in some regions grafton and wheeler 2018 mdba 2017b which requires addressing to avoid breaches occurring many authors have written about questionable behaviours from regulatory and political agents and how this may be hindering the process of compliance technology adoption and transparency downey and clune 2019 grafton et al 2020 grafton and williams 2019 horne 2020 marshall and alexandra 2016 the auditor general 2020 a transparent water management system operating based on best practice science and technology is required this paper aims to 1 examine the role technology such as remote sensing could play in a comprehensive and transparent management system 2 assess cultural issues surrounding water management from the perspective of a range of stakeholders and how this could interact with and benefit from remote sensing and finally 3 provide a suggestion of enablers that move the current system towards a trusted water management framework that may be useful for complex water systems globally this paper will firstly provide a brief background of the mbd including a discussion about the current water management activities developed remote sensing methodologies are described and how they may fit into a complex management system such as the mdb it then discusses the current political and community cultural problems that have established themselves within the mdb how these may subvert water plans and the role remote sensing may play in improving transparency to help improve cultural attitudes throughout this paper recommendations for change from the authors will be provided to address identified problems 2 background 2 1 the murray darling basin the mdb river system covers over 1 million square kilometres of eastern australia this accounts for approximately 14 of australian land overlapping four states new south wales nsw queensland qld victoria vic and south australia sa and including the australian capital territory act fig 1 it supports a population of approximately 2 6 million people predominately the mdb is classified as a semi arid to arid region while also being responsible for large quantities of agricultural exports from australia irrigation represents 90 of water take in the mdb mdba 2017b with cotton being the dominant industry in the north and rice horticulture and dairy being dominant in the south with a recent surge in nut plantations 2 2 water management background the progression of water policy in australia has been divided into stages nwc 2011 the first stage was exploratory prior to 1900 when water was considered an easily accessible and freely available resource the next stage saw active water exploitation and expansion 1900 to 1980 which involved the construction of infrastructure such as dams and irrigation schemes in the third stage during 1980s and 1990s water development reached maturity with close to maximum regulation of streamflow dramatically increasing costs of further development and spreading of water resources as well as rehabilitation of older infrastructure and acknowledgment of environmental concerns bell and park 2006 this stage is associated with the cap on diversions in 1995 williams 2017 the fourth and current stage starting in 2007 saw the beginning of a transition to environmental sustainability which includes water markets as part of the mdbp nwc 2011 3 current water management compliance state governments have the responsibility to manage water sharing plans and the associated licences although they manage the water sharing in their respective states legally they are to comply with the mdbp carmody and calford 2021 a 2017 review of compliance measures within the mdb has summarised activities from each state and territory influencing the functioning of the mdb mdba 2017b the mdba 2017b found that each basin jurisdiction is different in its water use monitoring a summary of the 2017 compliance data across the mdb is presented in table 1 of note from this data is the large number of licences and extractions from nsw compared to other states and the disproportionately low number of compliance officers employed this lack of resources for compliance was identified by the nsw ombudsman 2017 which found funding was inadequate compared to recommendations from the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal of nsw ipart vic and sa are both well metered with both states having comprehensive networks table 1 mdba 2017b vic delwp 2019a vic delwp 2019b the mdba 2017b found that despite the early adoption of meters by sa it now faces an aging meter fleet which will be costly to maintain the act is also highly metered act cmtedd 2018 mdba 2017b although the small geographical area reduces associated costs nsw and qld are behind the other states in metering infrastructure perhaps due to large geographic extents these states also are responsible for monitoring floodplain harvesting which is notoriously difficult to measure although methods have been developed using remote sensing for monitoring storage volume slattery johnson 2021 see further discussion in section 4 2 1 the on the ground compliance for all of the states ranges from site visits based on a risk based approaches to desktop audits remote monitoring and notification from third parties business qld 2019 nsw dpi 2015 sa dew 2015 nsw charge for illegally extracted water based on the water trading market at the time of extraction nsw doi 2019a the system used by nsw is the most advanced penalty system with sa only issuing fines at a fixed rate per kilolitre sa dew 2017 in 2019 vic introduced tougher penalties for non compliance in the hope to strengthen their regulation although it is not calculated on a per volume basis vic delwp 2019b the variable penalty implemented by nsw means non compliance fines are more severe during drought which uses the marketisation of water to give incentive to comply with water resource plans compliance culture within the mdb refers to the ingrained culture of a particular region to abide by the rules set out by the governing body this is achieved through normative compliance measures zeitoun et al 2016 the culture of both sa and vic is considered good which aids in their compliance and enforcement process grafton and wheeler 2018 mdba 2017b productivity commission 2018 these compliance cultures are also backed up by a strong fleet of meters table 1 qld has only had a cap on diversions since 2010 and hence has had very little time to develop a compliance culture whereas parts of nsw are said to be lacking this culture of compliance grafton and wheeler 2018 mdba 2017b qld and nsw have both encouraged the development of a stronger compliance cultures walker 2019 little information is available on the compliance culture within the act although it encourages a strong culture of compliance mdb ministerial council 2018 the mdba 2017b states that the southern basin generally has a higher level of regulation where there is also a stronger compliance culture any changes to regulator approaches requires maintaining a strong culture of compliance papas 2018 the many reports on water management across the mdb matthews 2017a matthews 2017b nsw ombudsman 2017 walker 2019 have led to changes in the compliance process approaches have become more reliable and transparent in recent years attempting to increase trust in government regulators the trust in regulators has been previously described as lacking alexandra 2019 colloff et al 2021 colloff and pittock 2019 changes are particularly evident with the separation of powers in nsw with the creation of the natural resource access regulator nrar via the natural resource access regulator act 2017 carmody 2018 nsw doi 2018 compliance activities in nsw are now handled by the nrar and there have been a number of successful prosecutions reported in the media henderson 2019 mcnally 2018 despite the many changes the mdba 2017b states that it can be difficult to enforce identified breaches due to the high levels of evidence required for low level breaches 4 suggested monitoring technology methods the independent reviews commissioned after the abc four corners 2017 investigation matthews 2017b recommended that the nsw government more assertively adopt and implement new monitoring and compliance techniques and technologies such as remote sensing meter telemetry and targeted covert operations although these recommendations were aimed at nsw the mdba and the other basin states have also adjusted their future compliance and enforcement plans as part of these recommended changes the mdba has several plans for improved water take monitoring and compliance activities these recommendations are found in the mdba s compliance and enforcement priorities for 2018 19 and policies for 2018 21 as well as the sustainable diversion limit reporting and compliance framework mdba 2018b mdba 2018c mdba 2018e the mdb ministerial council 2018 has also agreed to implement these technologies although exact details are not provided 4 1 metering technology future work agreements by the federal government in combination with the mdb states has included many actions including installation of meters consistent with the national framework for non urban water metering 2009 while also recommending telemetry be used to read meters remotely and in real time mdb ministerial council 2018 these recommendations are largely similar to previous proposed actions in the mdba 2017b compliance review that also recommends the adoption of meters that are more reliable and tamper proof similar recommendations are presented in many previous publications holley and sinclair 2013 matthews 2017a matthews 2017b mdba 2017b mdba 2018e vertessy et al 2019 importantly recommendations also suggest improved measurements of floodplain harvesting mdb ministerial council 2018 mdba 2018c which has been reviewed by weber and claydon 2019 improvements in monitoring floodplain harvesting seem to be underway in nsw nsw dpie 2020 although the legality of floodplain harvesting in nsw is still uncertain claughton and condon 2021 as these changes occur new policy may be required to ensure compliance is actively and adequately managed these changes are highly desirable as there are multiple publications that criticise the accuracy of the older metering fleet due to equipment being susceptible to tampering and failure as well as a reliance on self reporting bretreger et al 2019 grafton 2019 grafton and wheeler 2018 holley and sinclair 2012 matthews 2017b mdba 2017b vertessy et al 2019 the most common breach in nsw arises from exceeding water allocations holley and sinclair 2012 water users were found to be in favour of metering in a survey across three regions of nsw conducted by holley and sinclair 2013 the survey results show a positive attitude towards metering and acknowledged its importance in managing water resources respondents also showed interest in using metering infrastructure to manage on property operations the results presented by holley and sinclair 2013 suggest that changes that support more reliable and comprehensive metering proposed by governments will likely be accepted by users and aid in compliance activities enabler 1 continued support of metering the metering network is growing due to recent changes and agreements from governments the new meters are typically telemetry enabled to avoid self reporting and designed to be tamperproof these actions require continued financial and policy support 4 2 remote sensing in water management the use of remote sensing which includes satellite and aerial based sensing platforms has been a key recommendation to supplement metering equipment bretreger et al 2019 matthews 2017b nsw dpie 2019b the idea of using remote sensing technology for environmental regulation is not unique to the mdb system with many publications discussing its potential uses de leeuw et al 2010 lein 2009 lein 2011 macauley and brennan 1998 purdy 2006 purdy 2009 purdy 2010 rose et al 2015 prior to the matthews report matthews 2017a matthews 2017b the only mention of remote sensing being used operationally for water compliance in the mdb use was from nsw dpi 2015 there are government reports detailing the potential uses of remote sensing in the mdb that are over a decade old terranean 2010 wealands et al 2008 the use of operational remote sensing in compliance has minimal evidence publicly available the nsw dpi document mentions using satellite imagery and aerial photography to detect potentially illegal use or storage of water additionally the use of this data was advocated to support other compliance activities such as on site inspection and provide evidence for enforcement action including prosecutions recent documents show a growing emphasis on the use of remote sensing technologies to target on the ground compliance activities nsw doi 2019b nsw dpie 2019b nsw dpie 2020 qld dnrme 2020 additionally qld dnrme 2019 mention the use of using lidar technology to assess storage volumes and unlawful increases to their size this section aims to discuss previously developed remote sensing methodologies that calculate irrigation water use and or related aspects of the anthropogenic water cycle this is followed by an in depth description of the methods developed and tested in the mdb finally there is a discussion of requirements of a remote sensing compliance method including technical considerations and potential policy and ethical issues 4 2 1 developed remote sensing methods there are many remote sensing technologies and methods that focus on different aspects of quantifying irrigation or extractions bretreger et al 2022 bretreger et al 2020 bretreger et al 2019 brocca et al 2018 garrido rubio et al 2020 jalilvand et al 2019 krause and reinfelds 2020 martı n de santa olalla et al 2003 mdba 2017a mdba 2018a mdba 2019a olivera guerra et al 2020 romaguera et al 2014 saadi et al 2015 senay et al 2016 senay et al 2017 serra et al 2016 slattery johnson 2021 zohaib and choi 2020 each of the referenced methods has its positive and negative aspects ranging from accuracy data requirements temporal re visit time spatial resolution or difficulty of use and implementation a summary of these agricultural and irrigation remote sensing methods is provided by bretreger et al 2020 and karthikeyan et al 2020 with techniques ranging from multispectral sensors including thermal to soil moisture satellite observations being assimilated into global land surface models many of these methods rely on satellite observations that inherently have coarse spatial resolution such as radiometric soil moisture satellites e g smap or smos at several tens of km e g 25 36 km meaning sub pixel variability can reduce meaningful insights in some instances meaning these satellites are impractical for individual user water accounting this contrasts with the moderate spatial resolutions of multispectral observations ranging from 10 to 100 m e g the sentinel 2 or landsat series of sensors the multispectral images with lower resolutions i e 100 m found in the landsat thermals bands can still have potential spatial limitations if monitoring is required over small land holders properties there is typically a trade off between temporal revisit time and spatial resolution of remote sensing observations satellites with coarse spatial resolutions tend to have higher temporal revisit times of once every few days this is compared to higher spatial resolution sensors that have revisit times of between five days or weeks apart additionally some methods are highly parameterised with in situ data saadi et al 2015 which may mean reduced applicability for compliance purposes if detailed knowledge of the site is not known recent studies have shown digital soil maps may be accurate enough to replace the highly parameterised data from in situ sources making this kind of modelling more accessible bretreger et al 2022 some of the methods that are developed have been tested in the mdb and directly relate to discussions in this paper while all related to compliance they follow different techniques and focus on different parts of remote sensing compliance the mdba conducted a pilot study using remote sensing data from digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 to identify water use and storage volume changes mdba 2017a the study successfully demonstrated how using these remote sensing technologies irrigation extent and timing could be discovered the technology could identify locations and timing of when pumping occurred as channels could be observed as full since the initial pilot study the mdba 2018a have performed a similar case study tracking an environmental watering event through the mdb the motivation for this case study was to prove that this technology might be used for compliance in the future since these publications evidence of remote sensing use was seen in the river murray weekly report at the start of september 2019 mdba 2019b the remote sensing images were used to identify environmental watering of the koondrook perricoota forest near echuca on the nsw vic border in late october 2019 the mdba published a report that used satellite images to track first flush flows in the namoi macquarie and warrego rivers mdba 2019a the report showed signs of potential extraction of water from these rivers during a pumping embargo this evidence was sent to the nsw nrar nsw nrar have been using satellite datasets from dea such as the water observations from space wofs product mueller et al 2016 called waterbodies the waterbodies tool has been repurposed for compliance actions by the nsw nrar with input from geoscience australia krause and reinfelds 2020 nsw dpie 2020 the methodology identifies surface water in storages and creates a time series of surface area changes the wofs dataset was created using the landsat collection of historical images although sentinel 2 images have also been used krause and reinfelds 2020 allowing greater spatial and temporal resolution locations that are tagged as a high priority can then be subject to further desktop assessment the nsw nrar further processes this data using lidar datasets to create surface area to volume curves to assess volume changes in these storages this process allows a change in storage volume over time to be calculated allowing regulators to see if more water is appearing in storage than is allowed under licensing a similar approach has been taken by slattery johnson 2021 to assess floodplain water harvesting in the northern mdb on a global scale a similar product to wofs is available via the global surface water explorer pekel et al 2016 which may be repurposed in a similar way to wofs has been in australia bretreger et al 2019 has used dea remote sensing products and gridded climate data to estimate the quantity of irrigation water used on farm scale sites in australia this method has also been altered to work at catchment scales in the mdb bretreger et al 2020 the method used the calculated actual evaporation and precipitation to identify water balance gaps filled by irrigation water application the use of climate data in combination with multispectral remote sensing imagery allows high resolution i e 10 30 m quantification of irrigation water application depth the work relies on a range of government datasets as input and will likely improve as these are incrementally improved over time the accurate simulation of irrigation water use can be assessed against typical or assumed water use for regulators to evaluate the need for further investigation alternatively these values may be translated into a river extraction with further analysis a prospective water extraction and use quantification method requires careful evaluation the methods discussed above cover a range of compliance activities from individual irrigator water use catchment irrigation water use tracking environmental flows or monitoring water storage volume changes there are many more methods which are not tested in australia which provides government regulators with a choice to select a methodology that suits their needs alternative satellite information may provide important future research applications in water management and compliance techniques using different or new satellites may be applicable to transboundary water management if spatial and temporal resolutions are adequate it is important to note that any estimation of water use or capture needs to be assessed against the allocations of a proposed property or compared against annual water returns as suggested by alexandra and martin 2017 remote sensing is in a position to supplement metered data in a compliance framework the release of freely available high quality remote sensing data in australia via dea or globally through a range of other services sudmann et al 2019 allows cloud processing of data and is a great opportunity for water regulators the potential for regulators to use these data is limited only by staff time and know how as equipment and data costs will be extremely low as new satellites are launched with updated technology the usefulness of remote sensing will likely improve these technologies give additional advantages over metering equipment as spatial patterns of water use can also be assessed 4 2 2 challenges for implementation satellite remote sensing for environmental management is already used in australia for quantifying land clearing purdy 2010 the use of these methods in agriculture is in part due to the large areas requiring monitoring as traditional on site monitoring was extremely difficult if not impossible a qld government official calculated that it would take inspectors the same time to look at 2 5 million hectares using satellites images as it would take to survey 20 ha purdy 2010 satellite images are consistently taking observations creating historical evidence and synoptic view purdy 2009 purdy 2010 discusses the use of satellite images in australian courts and mentions that they have been successful when dealing with land clearing it is likely any compliance enforcement activities using remote sensing in water resources would be scrutinised in similar ways by australian courts while the technical ability of remote sensing to observe land clearing will be different compared to water monitoring the underlying legal process would likely be similar this ability would be further improved with the implementation of an annual water statement for comparison as suggested by alexandra and martin 2017 the accuracy of the methods that are eventually used are extremely important under or over estimations of irrigation water use can lead to economic implications for water users or environmental degradation when quantities are overestimated there is likely going to be economic loss for farmers while underestimating could lead to overexploitation of shared resources foster et al 2020 this leads to the idea of using remote sensing methods as a secondary compliance tool for targeting field activities to avoid unintended consequences bretreger et al 2019 matthews 2017b nsw dpie 2019b this was also suggested by foster et al 2020 in a global setting the use of satellites or aircraft including unmanned aerial vehicles uav for management activities has potential to raise privacy concerns purdy 2006 discusses that the current resolution of satellite images is too coarse to distinguish individuals and personal information although as technology improves and resolutions increase privacy may become a more pressing issue slonecker et al 1998 discussed that as spatial resolution improves and images that are at or below 1 m are used privacy may become a concern the initial version of the mdba 2019a report identifying potential non compliance in nsw showed locations of alleged theft before these claims were verified the report was quickly updated to remove locations after media attention beech 2019 although the prior inclusions and criticism show the importance of protecting privacy when using satellite data this is a common theme in the discussion around big data and the agricultural sector bronson and knezevic 2016 a survey by purdy 2010 showed the majority of farmers are either in favour or neutral to the idea of using satellite images for water management the respondents from qld were generally less accepting of this idea with sa respondents being more in favour with nsw between the two this may be due to the high percentage of users who are currently extracting water using unmetered technology in the northern basin mdba 2017b matthews 2017a specifically mentions northern nsw as a priority area for improved water metering and monitoring the northern nsw and qld regions acquire water through large amounts of floodplain harvesting developments in wetland flood inundation mapping within the mdb may provide an option for compliance methods hall et al 2019 teng et al 2015 despite the limitation of remote sensing methods purdy 2010 showed that some farmers believe that satellite imagery is more capable than it is in reality further aiding user forced compliance because of perceived observation capability and increased probability of detection there is an unequivocal case for the use of remote sensing technology in water management there are a range of developed methodologies that can complement information taken from metering previously conducted surveys suggest satellite observations used in water management may be accepted by sections of the farming community further research may be required to better understand why sections of the community may not accept these new technologies and how their concerns can be addressed the users being monitored should be consulted during development and implementation to ensure they are part of the solution which is likely to increase long term sustainability as discussed by carolan 2017 the exact method to be used is at the discretion of regulators although as more data becomes freely available the options will only grow some methods have already been tested in australia bretreger et al 2020 bretreger et al 2019 krause and reinfelds 2020 mdba 2017a mdba 2018a mdba 2019a slattery johnson 2021 with many more globally as discussed previously furthermore the provision of remote sensing images to farmers may improve on farm water efficiencies this is an example of knowledge construction in users to aid in compliance zeitoun et al 2016 this is an important consideration as typically technology improvements in digital agriculture have favoured corporations and larger entities rather than support individual farmers and their decisions rotz et al 2019 when farmers can achieve tangible benefits they are more likely to adopt new technologies zuo et al 2021 enabler 2 remote sensing technology adopt and further develop remote sensing methodologies to complement on ground water metering currently developed methods provide a technical starting point for compliance actions there may be a social context to this action that should be investigated to limit the chance of unintended outcomes and the acceptance of the technology from rural communities 5 cultural institutional improvements 5 1 end users infringing on the rules set out in the existing water sharing plans and the markets that make them up occurs when institutional and social settings enable and permit such behaviour grafton et al 2015 the institutional and social settings define the compliance culture of the region changing this culture in non compliance hot spots that is regions where breaches occur more often can be pursued in one of two ways using a bottom up approach through encouraging voluntary community changes or top down regulation the bottom up approach is considered a normative compliance producing mechanism zeitoun et al 2016 where compliance is achieved whether fear of punishment is present or not the altering of social norms i e through a compliance culture has been found to show positive environmental outcomes globally farrow et al 2017 the mdba 2017b has shown that in jurisdictions with better compliance culture there are generally fewer instances of breaches a survey of water users in nsw by holley and sinclair 2015 showed that the motivation for compliance from respondents commonly included fairness social reputation peer reputation and morals far fewer respondents stated that penalties and criminal prosecution were a strong driver of compliance the goulburn murray water organisation located in vic has been singled out as having a strong culture of compliance mdba 2017b likely due to illegal extractions directly affecting neighbours and damaging the social reputation of perpetrators these normative measures are typically described as being pivotal to long term collaboration between regulators and users mitchell et al 2012 the research performed by castilla rho et al 2017 shows there is a social tipping point with compliance meaning that as a certain percentage of the community becomes compliant this becomes a cultural value the value required for the tipping point will change depending on many factors including the number of neighbouring farmers and how close these social networks are this supports the findings of the mdba 2017b that areas like goulburn murray water would have a better compliance culture compared to regions with larger farms with less neighbour interactions it is likely in settings when users are less swayed by social normative measures this may hold less influence farrow et al 2017 lade et al 2013 zeitoun et al 2016 in these situations a stronger regulatory focus may improve compliance through punitive measures and bring about compliance culture the work by hovi et al 2007 discusses the role of punitive consequences to restore compliance with the kyoto protocol this work found that many punitive measures require unexpectedly harsh consequences to enable change they also suggest that external pressures may be more effective than punitive consequences nonetheless there exists a relationship between punitive consequences through regulatory action and the encouragement of normative compliance culture to achieve widespread compliance with water sharing plans a transparent regulatory institution using openly available remote sensing techniques may enhance a cultural of compliance as irrigators may be able to see water use of neighbours via satellite images the accuracy of any proposed transparent method is paramount as apart from potential economic impacts to farmers foster et al 2020 as discussed in section 4 2 2 there is a chance of social ostracism lade et al 2013 the fostering of a culture of compliance is pivotal in the creation of a regulatory framework that successfully achieves sustainable water sharing regulation through technology can be used to reinforce the culture of compliance created through other means enabler 3 bottom up compliance culture continue encouraging an end user compliance culture in regions where it already exists and implement strategies for improvement in other regions this requires identifying how compliance culture may differ across the various sections of the mdb and how these differences can be facilitated the implementation of technology may aid in creating this culture by increasing transparency 5 2 political and regulatory culture 5 2 1 regulatory culture questionable regulator decision making in water management within the mdb has been explored and discussed in detail by several authors downey and clune 2019 grafton 2019 grafton and williams 2019 matthews 2017b the discussions from these authors have raised issues including short term decision making that ignores robust evidence grafton 2019 failures to confront unethical behaviour matthews 2017b and a group culture diverging from the best traditions of australian public administration matthews 2017b these issues are universal as river basin management organisations are consistently balancing capacity ownership and politics when producing scientific output to inform decision making milman and gerlak 2020 the productivity commission 2018 suggested splitting the mdba into two institutes to separate the implementation of the plan from its compliance papas 2018 i e a separation of powers this split has been announced in the media sullivan 2020 although further details of this action has not been seen the impact of the nsw nrar an example of a separation of powers has seen increased legal proceedings in nsw carmody 2018 and increased transparency with online reporting of investigations the establishment of government bodies like nrar is not evident in other basin states but if implemented it may lead to increased proceedings and a more transparent regulator ensuring rules are enforced correctly state governments within the mdb have begun publishing breaches online the addition of remote sensing methodologies can make the water management process more transparent and allow the checking of compliance of government departments with their own plans a survey of irrigators in nsw by holley and sinclair 2015 found large percentages of users were unsure if actions breaching licencing laws will be prosecuted which stated the problem that is occurring there is a need for transparent and independent regulators as seen in the nsw nrar that allows clearly definable roles that can be audited and the rapid adoption of new technology or compliance policy the reliability and comprehensive work of regulators is pivotal to the enforcement of natural resource management law the theft of water relies to an extent on the relevant regulators allowing it to happen baird and walters 2020 discuss several instances of water theft throughout history and how they have occurred some instances occur due to insufficient infrastructure leading to the installation of unofficial access points or the lack of institutional and regulatory capacity johnson et al 2016 found that the privatisation of water in some regions led to more corruption and new forms of criminality these issues may be more present in developing and unstable countries although developed countries are not immune examples of negative environmental and social impacts from regulatory action can be vast and not necessarily tied to poor scientific or technical basin wide decision making for example in china when there was a frequent turnover of environmental protection officials there was an increase in transboundary water pollution due to the lack of regulation lu 2021 enabler 4 separation of institutional power evidence suggests the implementation of the nsw nrar as a separation of power has improved compliance and transparency in nsw it is recommended that other jurisdictions consider the implementation of a similar independent body to focus on compliance and the clear roles of governing bodies 5 2 2 political culture soft power has the potential to influence political figures resulting in policy changes that do not reflect best community interest and scientific method zeitoun et al 2010 the potential of soft power influence within the mdb and the role of political figures has been discussed in previous publications alexandra 2018 downey and clune 2019 grafton 2019 grafton and williams 2019 the use of soft power for water management influence is not isolated with examples occurring globally sayan et al 2020 a mdb example includes government funded water efficiency infrastructure projects that have been critiqued for being tailored for political outcomes grafton and williams 2019 horne 2020 while benefits to extraction reductions are disputed wheeler et al 2020 additionally previous studies have discussed the higher than necessary purchase price of low security environmental water and the movement away from transparent acquisitions grafton and williams 2019 slattery and campbell 2019 despite the potential for political influence there is evidence that positive policy changes can be made in the mdb for example legislative changes to prevent insider trading on the water market has made positive impacts on water management bonviller et al 2019 from the discussions within this paper it is evident that using technology to improve compliance monitoring is only part of the solution a more transparent and trustworthy political and regulatory culture is required to allow best practice science and technology to operate grafton et al 2020 and vice versa the same integrity is required from scientists who are acting to inform policy decisions to ensure trust is maintained colloff et al 2021 financial penalties vary greatly between states with higher fines not correlating to more complicit compliance by irrigators further suggesting the need for a strong compliance culture holley and sinclair 2015 mdba 2017b the introduction of technologies such as remote sensing may increase transparency and accountability of leaders and managers data is now commonly freely available allowing independent analysis and assessment to double check regulator actions another option to improve the regulatory and political culture is the creation of an independent organisation at the federal level that among other things monitors corruption rama and lester 2019 similar to australian state based alternatives the changes suggested to political culture are not unique to the mdb or australia the issue of corruption power imbalances and processes are seen globally in water management cosgrove and loucks 2015 specifically improvements to political transboundary management to reduced corruption has been specified in south asia biswas 2011 although examples exist globally tacconi and williams 2020 enabler 5 influencers generating a top down ethical change in the current political and regulatory culture there may be impediments to the adoption of best practice science and technology in policy implementation the role of new technology may be subdued and not deliver the expected benefits without a change in the cultural attitude 6 conclusion despite the best intentions of water sharing plans in the mdb it is still evident that further improvement is required with compliance and enforcement the various investigations into water management have put issues into the public domain which has brought about positive changes through the creation of independent regulators and a renewed vigour in making positive legislative changes although more can be done the mdb compliance and enforcement governance could be more nuanced with significant changes to water management procedures it is noted that in the case of the mdb there are long standing practical challenges that inhibit the rapid adoption of new methods the five enablers suggested in this paper are continued support of metering current metering can be susceptible to tampering and failure while relying heavily on self reporting investment from governments in tamper proof meters and telemetry is addressing this although requires continued support and policy backing remote sensing technology remote sensing methodologies should be adopted or developed for use in compliance actions there are a range of methodologies that have been published that provide a starting point for regulators remote sensing technology can support comprehensive metering target on the ground regulator activities and can be used to increase transparency of water use through interaction with the governance and cultural aspects of water sharing potential social impact requires investigation to limit the chance of unintended outcomes on rural communities and their acceptance of new technologies bottom up compliance culture there is evidence to suggest that a compliance culture offers an effective way to regulate water as some users will not want to hinder neighbouring properties and damage social reputations this is evident from regions in the southern mdb where compliance culture is considered higher and fewer breaches are observed developing a strong end user compliance culture to encourage self compliance will aid in the goals of widespread adherence to water sharing plans separation of institutional power a range of previous reviews of water management in the mdb has found questionable regulator decision making a separation of powers to avoid a single entity being responsible for the implementation and compliance functions will likely increase transparency and accountability this has been successful in nsw with the establishment of the compliance focused nsw nrar influencers generating a top down ethical change many previous publications have found a political culture that is pressured by soft power has resulted in an environment that does not allow best practice science and technology to operate in the implementation of policy a positive change in culture in leaders is critical to reduce unethical or negligent actions that may hinder an otherwise comprehensive compliance regime for mdb governance to successfully ensure water sharing plans are adhered too an integrated approach is recommended the adoption of technology alone will not be enough to achieve the goals of water management a political and governance environment that allows best available science and technology to operate and inform policy is crucial the inclusion of newer technologies such as remote sensing may help to improve compliance culture from users while increasing transparency and ethical behaviour from institutions the improvements suggested in this paper combine technical governance and social changes that work in conjunction to improve compliance with remote sensing at the heart of the solution although set in australia the

8570,growing agricultural water demand is dramatically affecting the implementation of and compliance with water sharing plans in regions such as the murray darling basin mdb problems can arise from water theft poor resourcing or questionable actions from stakeholders recent actions from mdb governments have resulted in improved regulation although more is required in a technical governance and cultural space to create a comprehensive and transparent management framework this is pivotal in improving overall trust in water regulators we discuss an integrated water resource management approach for improved water regulation involving the implementation of remote sensing technologies to complement metering coupled with a focus on a stronger compliance culture in a range of stakeholder groups and regulatory changes that allow quicker adoption of unbiased best practice science and technology keywords murray darling basin compliance culture remote sensing irrigation transboundary water water resource management 1 introduction competition for water is increasing globally due to population growth and associated water needs irrigated agriculture is the largest water consumer using 72 worldwide increasing to 90 in developing countries wisser et al 2008 the high demand has led to water sharing legislation which aims to impose fair sharing of water amongst all the users in a river system this can cause issues when catchment boundaries cross jurisdictional borders requiring cooperation by various governments and stakeholders zeitoun et al 2016 zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 zeitoun et al 2010 the occurrence of transboundary catchments are a common occurrence globally mccracken and wolf 2019 as water demand grows there can be instances of water theft and non compliance with water sharing legislation it is estimated that between 30 and 50 of all water is stolen globally before it reaches its intended end user loch et al 2020 this is not a new phenomenon with many examples throughout global history discussed by baird and walters 2020 this can be difficult to detect which interferes with attempts at achieving the goals of sustainable water sharing in complex hydrologic systems the murray darling basin mdb australia can be considered a globally significant example of large scale water sharing grafton and horne 2014 horne 2020 the mdb s water is shared as part of a complex set of arrangements and institutions that have led to the establishment of the murray darling basin authority mdba and the murray darling basin plan mdbp the management and decision making within the mdb is complicated as the catchment crosses jurisdictional borders of the australian state governments which are responsible for parts of the water management process the mdbp specifies a reduction in extractions of 2750 gl year hart 2016 williams 2017 with the aim to support environmental flows a water market was also created which required water accounting recent investigations and

communities as well as governments and taxpayers by artificially increasing the market price due to restrictions in supply it is important that a strong culture of compliance is implemented to ensure the marketisation and regulation of water is most effective grafton and wheeler 2018 papas 2018 to overcome the many challenges related to compliance water policy in the mdb must improve measurements of diversions accompanied by transparent water accounting improve compliance activities and use multiple lines of evidence for water accounting wheeler et al 2020 a key recommendation of the many reports into water management in the mdb has been the adoption of remote sensing technology for the remote monitoring of illegal actions matthews 2017a matthews 2017b vertessy et al 2019 with the vast amount of remote sensing methodologies developed for agricultural and irrigation purposes a clear path needs to be set to achieve efficient and meaningful change in a region that has long standing and practical challenges to rapidly change improved regulation and compliance will help in the execution of policy within the mdb this paper discusses an integrated water resource management approach for developing technical governance and social structures to improve compliance methods successful changes to the compliance system in complex water sharing systems cannot be done solely through technical implementation compliance culture of end users i e normative compliance within the mdb has been identified as poor in some regions grafton and wheeler 2018 mdba 2017b which requires addressing to

cultural issues surrounding water management from the perspective of a range of stakeholders and how this could interact with and benefit from remote sensing and finally 3 provide a suggestion of enablers that move the current system towards a trusted water management framework that may be useful for complex water systems globally this paper will firstly provide a brief background of the mbd including a discussion about the current water management activities developed remote sensing methodologies are described and how they may fit into a complex management system such as the mdb it then discusses the current political and community cultural problems that have established themselves within the mdb how these may subvert water plans and the role remote sensing may play in improving transparency to help improve cultural attitudes throughout this paper recommendations for change from the authors will be provided to address identified problems 2 background 2 1 the murray darling basin the mdb river system covers over 1 million square kilometres of eastern australia this accounts for approximately 14 of australian land overlapping four states new south wales nsw queensland qld victoria vic and south australia sa and including the australian capital territory act fig 1 it supports a population of approximately 2 6 million people predominately the mdb is classified as a semi arid to arid region while also being responsible for large quantities of agricultural exports from australia irrigation represents 90 of water take in the mdb mdba 2017b with cotton being the dominant industry in the north and rice horticulture and dairy being dominant in the south with a recent surge in nut plantations 2 2 water management background the progression of water policy in australia has been divided into stages nwc 2011 the first stage was exploratory prior to 1900 when water was considered an easily accessible and freely available resource the next stage saw active water exploitation and expansion 1900 to 1980 which involved the construction of infrastructure such as dams and irrigation schemes in the third stage during 1980s and 1990s water development reached maturity with close to maximum regulation of streamflow dramatically increasing costs of further development and spreading of water resources as well as rehabilitation of older infrastructure and acknowledgment of environmental concerns bell and park 2006 this stage is associated with the cap on diversions in 1995 williams 2017 the fourth and current stage starting in 2007 saw the beginning of a transition to environmental sustainability which includes water markets as part of the mdbp nwc 2011 3 current water management compliance state governments have the responsibility to manage water sharing plans and the associated licences although they manage the water sharing in their respective states legally they are to comply with the mdbp carmody and calford 2021 a 2017 review of compliance measures within the mdb has summarised activities from each state and territory influencing the functioning of the mdb mdba 2017b the mdba 2017b found that each basin jurisdiction is different in its water use monitoring a summary of the 2017 compliance data across the mdb is presented in table 1 of note from this data is the large number of licences and extractions from nsw compared to other states and the disproportionately low number of compliance officers employed this lack of resources for compliance was identified by the nsw ombudsman 2017 which found funding was inadequate compared to recommendations from the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal of nsw ipart vic and sa are both well metered with both states having comprehensive networks table 1 mdba 2017b vic delwp 2019a vic delwp 2019b the mdba 2017b found that despite the early adoption of meters by sa it now faces an aging meter fleet which will be costly to maintain the act is also highly metered act cmtedd 2018 mdba 2017b although the small geographical area reduces associated costs nsw and qld are behind the other states in metering infrastructure perhaps due to large geographic extents these states also are responsible for monitoring floodplain harvesting which is notoriously difficult to measure although methods have been developed using remote sensing for monitoring storage volume slattery johnson 2021 see further discussion in section 4 2 1 the on the ground compliance for all of the states ranges from site visits based on a risk based approaches to desktop audits remote monitoring and notification from third parties business qld 2019 nsw dpi 2015 sa dew 2015 nsw charge for illegally extracted water based on the water trading market at the time of extraction nsw doi 2019a the system used by nsw is the most advanced penalty system with sa only issuing fines at a fixed rate per kilolitre sa dew 2017 in 2019 vic introduced tougher penalties for non compliance in the hope to strengthen their regulation although it is not calculated on a per volume basis vic delwp 2019b the variable penalty implemented by nsw means non compliance fines are more severe during drought which uses the marketisation of water to give incentive to comply with water resource plans compliance culture within the mdb refers to the ingrained culture of a particular region to abide by the rules set out by the governing body this is achieved through normative compliance measures zeitoun et al 2016 the culture of both sa and vic is considered good which aids in their compliance and enforcement process grafton and wheeler 2018 mdba 2017b productivity commission 2018 these compliance cultures are also backed up by a strong fleet of meters table 1 qld has only had a cap on diversions since 2010 and hence has had very little time to develop a compliance culture whereas parts of nsw are said to be lacking this culture of compliance grafton and wheeler 2018 mdba 2017b qld and nsw have both encouraged the development of a stronger compliance cultures walker 2019 little information is available on the compliance culture within the act although it encourages a strong culture of compliance mdb ministerial council 2018 the mdba 2017b states that the southern basin generally has a higher level of regulation where there is also a stronger compliance culture any changes to regulator approaches requires maintaining a strong culture of compliance papas 2018 the many reports on water management across the mdb matthews 2017a matthews 2017b nsw ombudsman 2017 walker 2019 have led to changes in the compliance process approaches have become more reliable and transparent in recent years attempting to increase trust in government regulators the trust in regulators has been previously described as lacking alexandra 2019 colloff et al 2021 colloff and pittock 2019 changes are particularly evident with the separation of powers in nsw with the creation of the natural resource access regulator nrar via the natural resource access regulator act 2017 carmody 2018 nsw doi 2018 compliance activities in nsw are now handled by the nrar and there have been a number of successful prosecutions reported in the media henderson 2019 mcnally 2018 despite the many changes the mdba 2017b states that it can be difficult to enforce identified breaches due to the high levels of evidence required for low level breaches 4 suggested monitoring technology methods the independent reviews commissioned after the abc four corners 2017 investigation matthews 2017b recommended that the nsw government more assertively adopt and implement new monitoring and compliance techniques and technologies such as remote sensing meter telemetry and targeted covert operations although these recommendations were aimed at nsw the mdba and the other basin states have also adjusted their future compliance and enforcement plans as part of these recommended changes the mdba has several plans for improved water take monitoring and compliance activities these recommendations are found in the mdba s compliance and enforcement priorities for 2018 19 and policies for 2018 21 as well as the sustainable diversion limit reporting and compliance framework mdba 2018b mdba 2018c mdba 2018e the mdb ministerial council 2018 has also agreed to implement these technologies although exact details are not provided 4 1 metering technology future work agreements by the federal government in combination with the mdb states has included many actions including installation of meters consistent with the national framework for non urban water metering 2009 while also recommending telemetry be used to read meters remotely and in real time mdb ministerial council 2018 these recommendations are largely similar to previous proposed actions in the mdba 2017b compliance review that also recommends the adoption of meters that are more reliable and tamper proof similar recommendations are presented in many previous publications holley and sinclair 2013 matthews 2017a matthews 2017b mdba 2017b mdba 2018e vertessy et al 2019 importantly recommendations also suggest improved measurements of floodplain harvesting mdb ministerial council 2018 mdba 2018c which has been reviewed by weber and claydon 2019 improvements in monitoring floodplain harvesting seem to be underway in nsw nsw dpie 2020 although the legality of floodplain harvesting in nsw is still uncertain claughton and condon 2021 as these changes occur new policy may be required to ensure compliance is actively and adequately managed these changes are highly desirable as there are multiple publications that criticise the accuracy of the older metering fleet due to equipment being susceptible to tampering and failure as well as a reliance on self reporting bretreger et al 2019 grafton 2019 grafton and wheeler 2018 holley and sinclair 2012 matthews 2017b mdba 2017b vertessy et al 2019 the most common breach in nsw arises from exceeding water allocations holley and sinclair 2012 water users were found to be in favour of metering in a survey across three regions of nsw conducted by holley and sinclair 2013 the survey results show a positive attitude towards metering and acknowledged its importance in managing water resources respondents also showed interest in using metering infrastructure to manage on property operations the results presented by holley and sinclair 2013 suggest that changes that support more reliable and comprehensive metering proposed by governments will likely be accepted by users and aid in compliance activities enabler 1 continued support of metering the metering network is growing due to recent changes and agreements from governments the new meters are typically telemetry enabled to avoid self reporting and designed to be tamperproof these actions require continued financial and policy support 4 2 remote sensing in water management the use of remote sensing which includes satellite and aerial based sensing platforms has been a key recommendation to supplement metering equipment bretreger et al 2019 matthews 2017b nsw dpie 2019b the idea of using remote sensing technology for environmental regulation is not unique to the mdb system with many publications discussing its potential uses de leeuw et al 2010 lein 2009 lein 2011 macauley and brennan 1998 purdy 2006 purdy 2009 purdy 2010 rose et al 2015 prior to the matthews report matthews 2017a matthews 2017b the only mention of remote sensing being used operationally for water compliance in the mdb use was from nsw dpi 2015 there are government reports detailing the potential uses of remote sensing in the mdb that are over a decade old terranean 2010 wealands et al 2008 the use of operational remote sensing in compliance has minimal evidence publicly available the nsw dpi document mentions using satellite imagery and aerial photography to detect potentially illegal use or storage of water additionally the use of this data was advocated to support other compliance activities such as on site inspection and provide evidence for enforcement action including prosecutions recent documents show a growing emphasis on the use of remote sensing technologies to target on the ground compliance activities nsw doi 2019b nsw dpie 2019b nsw dpie 2020 qld dnrme 2020 additionally qld dnrme 2019 mention the use of using lidar technology to assess storage volumes and unlawful increases to their size this section aims to discuss previously developed remote sensing methodologies that calculate irrigation water use and or related aspects of the anthropogenic water cycle this is followed by an in depth description of the methods developed and tested in the mdb finally there is a discussion of requirements of a remote sensing compliance method including technical considerations and potential policy and ethical issues 4 2 1 developed remote sensing methods there are many remote sensing technologies and methods that focus on different aspects of quantifying irrigation or extractions bretreger et al 2022 bretreger et al 2020 bretreger et al 2019 brocca et al 2018 garrido rubio et al 2020 jalilvand et al 2019 krause and reinfelds 2020 martı n de santa olalla et al 2003 mdba 2017a mdba 2018a mdba 2019a olivera guerra et al 2020 romaguera et al 2014 saadi et al 2015 senay et al 2016 senay et al 2017 serra et al 2016 slattery johnson 2021 zohaib and choi 2020 each of the referenced methods has its positive and negative aspects ranging from accuracy data requirements temporal re visit time spatial resolution or difficulty of use and implementation a summary of these agricultural and irrigation remote sensing methods is provided by bretreger et al 2020 and karthikeyan et al 2020 with techniques ranging from multispectral sensors including thermal to soil moisture satellite observations being assimilated into global land surface models many of these methods rely on satellite observations that inherently have coarse spatial resolution such as radiometric soil moisture satellites e g smap or smos at several tens of km e g 25 36 km meaning sub pixel variability can reduce meaningful insights in some instances meaning these satellites are impractical for individual user water accounting this contrasts with the moderate spatial resolutions of multispectral observations ranging from 10 to 100 m e g the sentinel 2 or landsat series of sensors the multispectral images with lower resolutions i e 100 m found in the landsat thermals bands can still have potential spatial limitations if monitoring is required over small land holders properties there is typically a trade off between temporal revisit time and spatial resolution of remote sensing observations satellites with coarse spatial resolutions tend to have higher temporal revisit times of once every few days this is compared to higher spatial resolution sensors that have revisit times of between five days or weeks apart additionally some methods are highly parameterised with in situ data saadi et al 2015 which may mean reduced applicability for compliance purposes if detailed knowledge of the site is not known recent studies have shown digital soil maps may be accurate enough to replace the highly parameterised data from in situ sources making this kind of modelling more accessible bretreger et al 2022 some of the methods that are developed have been tested in the mdb and directly relate to discussions in this paper while all related to compliance they follow different techniques and focus on different parts of remote sensing compliance the mdba conducted a pilot study using remote sensing data from digital earth australia dea dhu et al 2017 to identify water use and storage volume changes mdba 2017a the study successfully demonstrated how using these remote sensing technologies irrigation extent and timing could be discovered the technology could identify locations and timing of when pumping occurred as channels could be observed as full since the initial pilot study the mdba 2018a have performed a similar case study tracking an environmental watering event through the mdb the motivation for this case study was to prove that this technology might be used for compliance in the future since these publications evidence of remote sensing use was seen in the river murray weekly report at the start of september 2019 mdba 2019b the remote sensing images were used to identify environmental watering of the koondrook perricoota forest near echuca on the nsw vic border in late october 2019 the mdba published a report that used satellite images to track first flush flows in the namoi macquarie and warrego rivers mdba 2019a the report showed signs of potential extraction of water from these rivers during a pumping embargo this evidence was sent to the nsw nrar nsw nrar have been using satellite datasets from dea such as the water observations from space wofs product mueller et al 2016 called waterbodies the waterbodies tool has been repurposed for compliance actions by the nsw nrar with input from geoscience australia krause and reinfelds 2020 nsw dpie 2020 the methodology identifies surface water in storages and creates a time series of surface area changes the wofs dataset was created using the landsat collection of historical images although sentinel 2 images have also been used krause and reinfelds 2020 allowing greater spatial and temporal resolution locations that are tagged as a high priority can then be subject to further desktop assessment the nsw nrar further processes this data using lidar datasets to create surface area to volume curves to assess volume changes in these storages this process allows a change in storage volume over time to be calculated allowing regulators to see if more water is appearing in storage than is allowed under licensing a similar approach has been taken by slattery johnson 2021 to assess floodplain water harvesting in the northern mdb on a global scale a similar product to wofs is available via the global surface water explorer pekel et al 2016 which may be repurposed in a similar way to wofs has been in australia bretreger et al 2019 has used dea remote sensing products and gridded climate data to estimate the quantity of irrigation water used on farm scale sites in australia this method has also been altered to work at catchment scales in the mdb bretreger et al 2020 the method used the calculated actual evaporation and precipitation to identify water balance gaps filled by irrigation water application the use of climate data in combination with multispectral remote sensing imagery allows high resolution i e 10 30 m quantification of irrigation water application depth the work relies on a range of government datasets as input and will likely improve as these are incrementally improved over time the accurate simulation of irrigation water use can be assessed against typical or assumed water use for regulators to evaluate the need for further investigation alternatively these values may be translated into a river extraction with further analysis a prospective water extraction and use quantification method requires careful evaluation the methods discussed above cover a range of compliance activities from individual irrigator water use catchment irrigation water use tracking environmental flows or monitoring water storage volume changes there are many more methods which are not tested in australia which provides government regulators with a choice to select a methodology that suits their needs alternative satellite information may provide important future research applications in water management and compliance techniques using different or new satellites may be applicable to transboundary water management if spatial and temporal resolutions are adequate it is important to note that any estimation of water use or capture needs to be assessed against the allocations of a proposed property or compared against annual water returns as suggested by alexandra and martin 2017 remote sensing is in a position to supplement metered data in a compliance framework the release of freely available high quality remote sensing data in australia via dea or globally through a range of other services sudmann et al 2019 allows cloud processing of data and is a great opportunity for water regulators the potential for regulators to use these data is limited only by staff time and know how as equipment and data costs will be extremely low as new satellites are launched with updated technology the usefulness of remote sensing will likely improve these technologies give additional advantages over metering equipment as spatial patterns of water use can also be assessed 4 2 2 challenges for implementation satellite remote sensing for environmental management is already used in australia for quantifying land clearing purdy 2010 the use of these methods in agriculture is in part due to the large areas requiring monitoring as traditional on site monitoring was extremely difficult if not impossible a qld government official calculated that it would take inspectors the same time to look at 2 5 million hectares using satellites images as it would take to survey 20 ha purdy 2010 satellite images are consistently taking observations creating historical evidence and synoptic view purdy 2009 purdy 2010 discusses the use of satellite images in australian courts and mentions that they have been successful when dealing with land clearing it is likely any compliance enforcement activities using remote sensing in water resources would be scrutinised in similar ways by australian courts while the technical ability of remote sensing to observe land clearing will be different compared to water monitoring the underlying legal process would likely be similar this ability would be further improved with the implementation of an annual water statement for comparison as suggested by alexandra and martin 2017 the accuracy of the methods that are eventually used are extremely important under or over estimations of irrigation water use can lead to economic implications for water users or environmental degradation when quantities are overestimated there is likely going to be economic loss for farmers while underestimating could lead to overexploitation of shared resources foster et al 2020 this leads to the idea of using remote sensing methods as a secondary compliance tool for targeting field activities to avoid unintended consequences bretreger et al 2019 matthews 2017b nsw dpie 2019b this was also suggested by foster et al 2020 in a global setting the use of satellites or aircraft including unmanned aerial vehicles uav for management activities has potential to raise privacy concerns purdy 2006 discusses that the current resolution of satellite images is too coarse to distinguish individuals and personal information although as technology improves and resolutions increase privacy may become a more pressing issue slonecker et al 1998 discussed that as spatial resolution improves and images that are at or below 1 m are used privacy may become a concern the initial version of the mdba 2019a report identifying potential non compliance in nsw showed locations of alleged theft before these claims were verified the report was quickly updated to remove locations after media attention beech 2019 although the prior inclusions and criticism show the importance of protecting privacy when using satellite data this is a common theme in the discussion around big data and the agricultural sector bronson and knezevic 2016 a survey by purdy 2010 showed the majority of farmers are either in favour or neutral to the idea of using satellite images for water management the respondents from qld were generally less accepting of this idea with sa respondents being more in favour with nsw between the two this may be due to the high percentage of users who are currently extracting water using unmetered technology in the northern basin mdba 2017b matthews 2017a specifically mentions northern nsw as a priority area for improved water metering and monitoring the northern nsw and qld regions acquire water through large amounts of floodplain harvesting developments in wetland flood inundation mapping within the mdb may provide an option for compliance methods hall et al 2019 teng et al 2015 despite the limitation of remote sensing methods purdy 2010 showed that some farmers believe that satellite imagery is more capable than it is in reality further aiding user forced compliance because of perceived observation capability and increased probability of detection there is an unequivocal case for the use of remote sensing technology in water management there are a range of developed methodologies that can complement information taken from metering previously conducted surveys suggest satellite observations used in water management may be accepted by sections of the farming community further research may be required to better understand why sections of the community may not accept these new technologies and how their concerns can be addressed the users being monitored should be consulted during development and implementation to ensure they are part of the solution which is likely to increase long term sustainability as discussed by carolan 2017 the exact method to be used is at the discretion of regulators although as more data becomes freely available the options will only grow some methods have already been tested in australia bretreger et al 2020 bretreger et al 2019 krause and reinfelds 2020 mdba 2017a mdba 2018a mdba 2019a slattery johnson 2021 with many more globally as discussed previously furthermore the provision of remote sensing images to farmers may improve on farm water efficiencies this is an example of knowledge construction in users to aid in compliance zeitoun et al 2016 this is an important consideration as typically technology improvements in digital agriculture have favoured corporations and larger entities rather than support individual farmers and their decisions rotz et al 2019 when farmers can achieve tangible benefits they are more likely to adopt new technologies zuo et al 2021 enabler 2 remote sensing technology adopt and further develop remote sensing methodologies to complement on ground water metering currently developed methods provide a technical starting point for compliance actions there may be a social context to this action that should be investigated to limit the chance of unintended outcomes and the acceptance of the technology from rural communities 5 cultural institutional improvements 5 1 end users infringing on the rules set out in the existing water sharing plans and the markets that make them up occurs when institutional and social settings enable and permit such behaviour grafton et al 2015 the institutional and social settings define the compliance culture of the region changing this culture in non compliance hot spots that is regions where breaches occur more often can be pursued in one of two ways using a bottom up approach through encouraging voluntary community changes or top down regulation the bottom up approach is considered a normative compliance producing mechanism zeitoun et al 2016 where compliance is achieved whether fear of punishment is present or not the altering of social norms i e through a compliance culture has been found to show positive environmental outcomes globally farrow et al 2017 the mdba 2017b has shown that in jurisdictions with better compliance culture there are generally fewer instances of breaches a survey of water users in nsw by holley and sinclair 2015 showed that the motivation for compliance from respondents commonly included fairness social reputation peer reputation and morals far fewer respondents stated that penalties and criminal prosecution were a strong driver of compliance the goulburn murray water organisation located in vic has been singled out as having a strong culture of compliance mdba 2017b likely due to illegal extractions directly affecting neighbours and damaging the social reputation of perpetrators these normative measures are typically described as being pivotal to long term collaboration between regulators and users mitchell et al 2012 the research performed by castilla rho et al 2017 shows there is a social tipping point with compliance meaning that as a certain percentage of the community becomes compliant this becomes a cultural value the value required for the tipping point will change depending on many factors including the number of neighbouring farmers and how close these social networks are this supports the findings of the mdba 2017b that areas like goulburn murray water would have a better compliance culture compared to regions with larger farms with less neighbour interactions it is likely in settings when users are less swayed by social normative measures this may hold less influence farrow et al 2017 lade et al 2013 zeitoun et al 2016 in these situations a stronger regulatory focus may improve compliance through punitive measures and bring about compliance culture the work by hovi et al 2007 discusses the role of punitive consequences to restore compliance with the kyoto protocol this work found that many punitive measures require unexpectedly harsh consequences to enable change they also suggest that external pressures may be more effective than punitive consequences nonetheless there exists a relationship between punitive consequences through regulatory action and the encouragement of normative compliance culture to achieve widespread compliance with water sharing plans a transparent regulatory institution using openly available remote sensing techniques may enhance a cultural of compliance as irrigators may be able to see water use of neighbours via satellite images the accuracy of any proposed transparent method is paramount as apart from potential economic impacts to farmers foster et al 2020 as discussed in section 4 2 2 there is a chance of social ostracism lade et al 2013 the fostering of a culture of compliance is pivotal in the creation of a regulatory framework that successfully achieves sustainable water sharing regulation through technology can be used to reinforce the culture of compliance created through other means enabler 3 bottom up compliance culture continue encouraging an end user compliance culture in regions where it already exists and implement strategies for improvement in other regions this requires identifying how compliance culture may differ across the various sections of the mdb and how these differences can be facilitated the implementation of technology may aid in creating this culture by increasing transparency 5 2 political and regulatory culture 5 2 1 regulatory culture questionable regulator decision making in water management within the mdb has been explored and discussed in detail by several authors downey and clune 2019 grafton 2019 grafton and williams 2019 matthews 2017b the discussions from these authors have raised issues including short term decision making that ignores robust evidence grafton 2019 failures to confront unethical behaviour matthews 2017b and a group culture diverging from the best traditions of australian public administration matthews 2017b these issues are universal as river basin management organisations are consistently balancing capacity ownership and politics when producing scientific output to inform decision making milman and gerlak 2020 the productivity commission 2018 suggested splitting the mdba into two institutes to separate the implementation of the plan from its compliance papas 2018 i e a separation of powers this split has been announced in the media sullivan 2020 although further details of this action has not been seen the impact of the nsw nrar an example of a separation of powers has seen increased legal proceedings in nsw carmody 2018 and increased transparency with online reporting of investigations the establishment of government bodies like nrar is not evident in other basin states but if implemented it may lead to increased proceedings and a more transparent regulator ensuring rules are enforced correctly state governments within the mdb have begun publishing breaches online the addition of remote sensing methodologies can make the water management process more transparent and allow the checking of compliance of government departments with their own plans a survey of irrigators in nsw by holley and sinclair 2015 found large percentages of users were unsure if actions breaching licencing laws will be prosecuted which stated the problem that is occurring there is a need for transparent and independent regulators as seen in the nsw nrar that allows clearly definable roles that can be audited and the rapid adoption of new technology or compliance policy the reliability and comprehensive work of regulators is pivotal to the enforcement of natural resource management law the theft of water relies to an extent on the relevant regulators allowing it to happen baird and walters 2020 discuss several instances of water theft throughout history and how they have occurred some instances occur due to insufficient infrastructure leading to the installation of unofficial access points or the lack of institutional and regulatory capacity johnson et al 2016 found that the privatisation of water in some regions led to more corruption and new forms of criminality these issues may be more present in developing and unstable countries although developed countries are not immune examples of negative environmental and social impacts from regulatory action can be vast and not necessarily tied to poor scientific or technical basin wide decision making for example in china when there was a frequent turnover of environmental protection officials there was an increase in transboundary water pollution due to the lack of regulation lu 2021 enabler 4 separation of institutional power evidence suggests the implementation of the nsw nrar as a separation of power has improved compliance and transparency in nsw it is recommended that other jurisdictions consider the implementation of a similar independent body to focus on compliance and the clear roles of governing bodies 5 2 2 political culture soft power has the potential to influence political figures resulting in policy changes that do not reflect best community interest and scientific method zeitoun et al 2010 the potential of soft power influence within the mdb and the role of political figures has been discussed in previous publications alexandra 2018 downey and clune 2019 grafton 2019 grafton and williams 2019 the use of soft power for water management influence is not isolated with examples occurring globally sayan et al 2020 a mdb example includes government funded water efficiency infrastructure projects that have been critiqued for being tailored for political outcomes grafton and williams 2019 horne 2020 while benefits to extraction reductions are disputed wheeler et al 2020 additionally previous studies have discussed the higher than necessary purchase price of low security environmental water and the movement away from transparent acquisitions grafton and williams 2019 slattery and campbell 2019 despite the potential for political influence there is evidence that positive policy changes can be made in the mdb for example legislative changes to prevent insider trading on the water market has made positive impacts on water management bonviller et al 2019 from the discussions within this paper it is evident that using technology to improve compliance monitoring is only part of the solution a more transparent and trustworthy political and regulatory culture is required to allow best practice science and technology to operate grafton et al 2020 and vice versa the same integrity is required from scientists who are acting to inform policy decisions to ensure trust is maintained colloff et al 2021 financial penalties vary greatly between states with higher fines not correlating to more complicit compliance by irrigators further suggesting the need for a strong compliance culture holley and sinclair 2015 mdba 2017b the introduction of technologies such as remote sensing may increase transparency and accountability of leaders and managers data is now commonly freely available allowing independent analysis and assessment to double check regulator actions another option to improve the regulatory and political culture is the creation of an independent organisation at the federal level that among other things monitors corruption rama and lester 2019 similar to australian state based alternatives the changes suggested to political culture are not unique to the mdb or australia the issue of corruption power imbalances and processes are seen globally in water management cosgrove and loucks 2015 specifically improvements to political transboundary management to reduced corruption has been specified in south asia biswas 2011 although examples exist globally tacconi and williams 2020 enabler 5 influencers generating a top down ethical change in the current political and regulatory culture there may be impediments to the adoption of best practice science and technology in policy implementation the role of new technology may be subdued and not deliver the expected benefits without a change in the cultural attitude 6 conclusion despite the best intentions of water sharing plans in the mdb it is still evident that further improvement is required with compliance and enforcement the various investigations into water management have put issues into the public domain which has brought about positive changes through the creation of independent regulators and a renewed vigour in making positive legislative changes although more can be done the mdb compliance and enforcement governance could be more nuanced with significant changes to water management procedures it is noted that in the case of the mdb there are long standing practical challenges that inhibit the rapid adoption of new methods the five enablers suggested in this paper are continued support of metering current metering can be susceptible to tampering and failure while relying heavily on self reporting investment from governments in tamper proof meters and telemetry is addressing this although requires continued support and policy backing remote sensing technology remote sensing methodologies should be adopted or developed for use in compliance actions there are a range of methodologies that have been published that provide a starting point for regulators remote sensing technology can support comprehensive metering target on the ground regulator activities and can be used to increase transparency of water use through interaction with the governance and cultural aspects of water sharing potential social impact requires investigation to limit the chance of unintended outcomes on rural communities and their acceptance of new technologies bottom up compliance culture there is evidence to suggest that a compliance culture offers an effective way to regulate water as some users will not want to hinder neighbouring properties and damage social reputations this is evident from regions in the southern mdb where compliance culture is considered higher and fewer breaches are observed developing a strong end user compliance culture to encourage self compliance will aid in the goals of widespread adherence to water sharing plans separation of institutional power a range of previous reviews of water management in the mdb has found questionable regulator decision making a separation of powers to avoid a single entity being responsible for the implementation and compliance functions will likely increase transparency and accountability this has been successful in nsw with the establishment of the compliance focused nsw nrar influencers generating a top down ethical change many previous publications have found a political culture that is pressured by soft power has resulted in an environment that does not allow best practice science and technology to operate in the implementation of policy a positive change in culture in leaders is critical to reduce unethical or negligent actions that may hinder an otherwise comprehensive compliance regime for mdb governance to successfully ensure water sharing plans are adhered too an integrated approach is recommended the adoption of technology alone will not be enough to achieve the goals of water management a political and governance environment that allows best available science and technology to operate and inform policy is crucial the inclusion of newer technologies such as remote sensing may help to improve compliance culture from users while increasing transparency and ethical behaviour from institutions the improvements suggested in this paper combine technical governance and social changes that work in conjunction to improve compliance with remote sensing at the heart of the solution although set in australia the lessons from the mdb can be applied to trans boundary catchments globally credit authorship contribution statement david bretreger conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

8571,in this comment we draw attention to parametrization errors in this recently published article when comparing an existing model for soil infiltration under shallow water conditions swingo with an alternative solution and richards benchmark solution after correcting the errors a new model comparison shows swingo ability to match the other approaches and supports the general validity of swingo s simplified approach against the more complicated solutions keywords soil infiltration shallow water table surface runoff soil water redistribution swingo hydrus 1d vfsmod routines for soil infiltration when a shallow water table is present are needed in hydrologic design and modelling to account for this significant hydrological factor during complex rainfall events chu 1997 gillham 1984 salvucci and entekhabi 1995 shirmohammadi and skaggs 1984 vachaud et al 1974 for example riparian buffers and vegetated filter strips are commonly used best management practices for reducing runoff sediment nutrient and pesticide loadings from agricultural fields to adjacent surface water bodies muñoz carpena et al 1999 reichenberger et al 2007 these vegetated strips are typically placed in lowland areas in riparian floodplains and their performance can be considerably impacted by shallow groundwater tables especially during a wet season in some regions fox et al 2018 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 wu et al 2021 recently presented a model to predict infiltration and runoff under shallow water table conditions in section 4 1 of their paper the authors compared their approach with richards equation solution from hydrus1d h1d simůnek and van genuchten 2008 and swingo muñoz carpena et al 2018 developed for the same conditions based on extensions to salvucci and entekhabi 1995 and chu 1997 see supplemental materials for free access to the program for a wide range of soils muñoz carpena et al 2018 performed a systematic comparison of swingo against richards equation chemflo nofziger and wu 2003 for surface infiltration fig c1 a and vertical soil water redistribution they also compared swingo with experimental data from vachaud et al 1974 swingo was further coupled with the overland flow and transport vfsmod model for vegetation buffer strip runoff pollution mitigation muñoz carpena et al 1999 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 and vfsmod swingo was successfully tested under controlled laboratory conditions with various water table depths fox et al 2018 in fig 6 of wu et al 2021 the authors used the soil input data for clay from table 1 in muñoz carpena et al 2018 to compare their model and swingo against richards h1d fig c1 b in that comparison swingo gives very different results to the other two approaches the authors use these results to support the need for their approach as compared to swingo section 4 1 in their paper they also attribute this mismatch to swingo s green ampt assumptions that introduces errors in the time to ponding and wetting front depth estimation this is contrary to swingo s previous results against richards and experimental data for this soil muñoz carpena et al 2018 after closely inspecting this comparison we identified several critical errors in wu et al 2021 that we address in this commentary first the swingo results used by wu et al 2021 fig c1 b were apparently digitized from muñoz carpena et al 2018 for the clay soil where the comparison with richards previously showed a good match fig c1 a importantly wu et al 2021 presented the soil water characteristics for the clay soil used for this comparison see their table 4 where the van genuchten vg model was used for their approach and h1d and brooks and corey bc model was used for swingo taken from table 1 of muñoz carpena et al 2018 for a fair model comparison both vg and bc curves for the same soil should be equivalent to test this we plotted the soil water characteristic curves against each other based on the parameters provided in table 4 of wu et al 2021 fig c2 and supp materials indeed the curves were very different such that the authors used their own parameters and mismatched those against the original results from muñoz carpena et al 2018 without rerunning swingo notice that swingo allows for a variety of soil characteristic curves vg bc and gardner to ensure consistency in the model comparison the authors should have used the same vg inputs as for their solution and h1d to run the comparison second water table depth significantly impacts infiltration and runoff but that influence is highly dependent on the position of the shallow groundwater table fox et al 2018 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 salvucci and entekhabi 1995 in table 2 of their paper wu et al 2021 stated that for the model comparison in fig c2 b they used a shallow water table position of 0 6 m below the surface where the previous results for swingo used for the comparison fig c1 a were calculated with a water table depth of 1 5 m muñoz carpena et al 2018 table 1 on both accounts mismatch in soil water characteristic curves and shallow water table position the comparison is inconsistent and erroneous it appears that the authors did not run swingo with the proper inputs for a fair comparison we run swingo with the corrected inputs vg curves and water table at 0 6 m see appendix and compared the simulation results again fig c3 as expected the results are close among the three approaches the time to ponding was predicted correctly by swingo 3 2 min close to the 3 0 min mentioned in wu et al 2021 section 4 1 the prediction of the wetting depth at the end of the simulation is also close for the three models 13 4 cm for swingo and 28 5 cm for the others far from the large error presented for swingo by wu et al 300 cm it should be noted that as discussed in muñoz carpena et al 2018 the clay soil represents the worst prediction scenario for swingo as the wetting front deviates the most from the simplified green ampt sharp wetting front assumption so the comparison would be much closer for other soil textures in all this revised comparison supports the general validity of swingo s simplified approach against the more complicated solution presented in wu et al 2021 in addition compared to wu et al 2021 proposed solution swingo s integral solution offers ther added flexibility of using different soil hydraulic functions as an additional comment although we were initially excited by a paper on this interesting problem we found that wu et al 2021 did not systematically test their infiltration and runoff approach for a wide range of soils water table depths and rainfall conditions the authors used the silt loam and sandy loam soils from fox et al 2018 experiments each with one water table depth and compared their infiltration and runoff simulation results against richards h1d solutions for the runoff results they also compared the results with the observed data from fox et al 2018 for those soils but omitted the vfsmod swingo results also presented in that paper no comparison with observed infiltration data is presented ignoring the infiltration experiment of vachaud et al 1974 with shallow water table conditions that were included in muñoz carpena et al 2018 finally it should be noted that wu et al 2021 did not include their source code input and output data or other needed information for us to reproduce the presented results reproducibility is a major issue facing science today oreskes 2019 we encourage authors to make available all the materials needed for others to independently reproduce their research transparency in research is crucial to further develop and or refine original theories and methods and for the continued advancement of science it also pays back the authors in terms of higher impact and wider use of their research 1 supplementary materials swingo model source code executable inputs and output files and

8571,in this comment we draw attention to parametrization errors in this recently published article when comparing an existing model for soil infiltration under shallow water conditions swingo with an alternative solution and richards benchmark solution after correcting the errors a new model comparison shows swingo ability to match the other approaches and supports the general validity of swingo s simplified approach against the more complicated solutions keywords soil infiltration shallow water table surface runoff soil water redistribution swingo hydrus 1d vfsmod routines for soil infiltration when a shallow water table is present are needed in hydrologic design and modelling to account for this significant hydrological factor during complex rainfall events chu 1997 gillham 1984 salvucci and entekhabi 1995 shirmohammadi and skaggs 1984 vachaud et al 1974 for example riparian buffers and vegetated filter strips are commonly used best management practices for reducing runoff sediment nutrient and pesticide loadings from agricultural fields to adjacent surface water bodies muñoz carpena et al 1999 reichenberger et al 2007 these vegetated strips are typically placed in lowland areas in riparian floodplains and their performance can be considerably impacted by shallow groundwater tables especially during a wet season in some regions fox et al 2018 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 wu et al 2021 recently presented a model to predict infiltration and runoff under shallow water table conditions in section 4 1 of their paper the authors compared their approach with richards equation solution from hydrus1d h1d simůnek and van genuchten 2008 and swingo muñoz carpena et al 2018 developed for the same conditions based on extensions to salvucci and entekhabi 1995 and chu 1997 see supplemental materials for free access to the program for a wide range of soils muñoz carpena et al 2018 performed a systematic comparison of swingo against richards equation chemflo nofziger and wu 2003 for surface infiltration fig c1 a and vertical soil water redistribution they also compared swingo with experimental data from vachaud et al 1974 swingo was further coupled with the overland flow and transport vfsmod model for vegetation buffer strip runoff pollution mitigation muñoz carpena et al 1999 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 and vfsmod swingo was successfully tested under controlled laboratory conditions with various water table depths fox et al 2018 in fig 6 of wu et al 2021 the authors used the soil input data for clay from table 1 in muñoz carpena et al 2018 to compare their model and swingo against richards h1d fig c1 b in that comparison swingo gives very different results to the other two approaches the authors use these results to support the need for their approach as compared to swingo section 4 1 in their paper they also attribute this mismatch to swingo s green ampt assumptions that introduces errors in the time to ponding and wetting front depth estimation this is contrary to swingo s previous results against richards and experimental data for this soil muñoz carpena et al 2018 after closely inspecting this comparison we identified several critical errors in wu et al 2021 that we address in this commentary first the swingo results used by wu et al 2021 fig c1 b were apparently digitized from muñoz carpena et al 2018 for the clay soil where the comparison with richards previously showed a good match fig c1 a importantly wu et al 2021 presented the soil water characteristics for the clay soil used for this comparison see their table 4 where the van genuchten vg model was used for their approach and h1d and brooks and corey bc model was used for swingo taken from table 1 of muñoz carpena et al 2018 for a fair model comparison both vg and bc curves for the same soil should be equivalent to test this we plotted the soil water characteristic curves against each other based on the parameters provided in table 4 of wu et al 2021 fig c2 and supp materials indeed the curves were very different such that the authors used their own parameters and mismatched those against the original results from muñoz carpena et al 2018 without rerunning swingo notice that swingo allows for a variety of soil characteristic curves vg bc and gardner to ensure consistency in the model comparison the authors should have used the same vg inputs as for their solution and h1d to run the comparison second water table depth significantly impacts infiltration and runoff but that influence is highly dependent on the position of the shallow groundwater table fox et al 2018 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 muñoz carpena et al 2018 salvucci and entekhabi 1995 in table 2 of their paper wu et al 2021 stated that for the model comparison in fig c2 b they used a shallow water table position of 0 6 m below the surface where the previous results for swingo used for the comparison fig c1 a were calculated with a water table depth of 1 5 m muñoz carpena et al 2018 table 1 on both accounts mismatch in soil water characteristic curves and shallow water table position the comparison is inconsistent and erroneous it appears that the authors did not run swingo with the proper inputs for a fair comparison we run swingo with the corrected inputs vg curves and water table at 0 6 m see appendix and compared the simulation results again fig c3 as expected the results are close among the three approaches the time to ponding was predicted correctly by swingo 3 2 min close to the 3 0 min mentioned in wu et al 2021 section 4 1 the prediction of the wetting depth at the end of the simulation is also close for the three models 13 4 cm for swingo and 28 5 cm for the others far from the large error presented for swingo by wu et al 300 cm it should be noted that as discussed in muñoz carpena et al 2018 the clay soil represents the worst prediction scenario for swingo as the wetting front deviates the most from the simplified green ampt sharp wetting front assumption so the comparison would be much closer for other soil textures in all this revised comparison supports the general validity of swingo s simplified approach against the more complicated solution presented in wu et al 2021 in addition compared to wu et al 2021 proposed solution swingo s integral solution offers ther added flexibility of using different soil hydraulic functions as an additional comment although we were initially excited by a paper on this interesting problem we found that wu et al 2021 did not systematically test their infiltration and runoff approach for a wide range of soils water table depths and rainfall conditions the authors used the silt loam and sandy loam soils from fox et al 2018 experiments each with one water table depth and compared their infiltration and runoff simulation results against richards h1d solutions for the runoff results they also compared the results with the observed data from fox et al 2018 for those soils but omitted the vfsmod swingo results also presented in that paper no comparison with observed infiltration data is presented ignoring the infiltration experiment of vachaud et al 1974 with shallow water table conditions that were included in muñoz carpena et al 2018 finally it should be noted that wu et al 2021 did not include their source code input and output data or other needed information for us to reproduce the presented results reproducibility is a major issue facing science today oreskes 2019 we encourage authors to make available all the materials needed for others to independently reproduce their research transparency in research is crucial to further develop and or refine original theories and methods and for the continued advancement of science it also pays back the authors in terms of higher impact and wider use of their research 1 supplementary materials swingo model source code executable inputs and output files and

8572,we appreciate the comments by muñoz carpena et al 2021 which pointed out some inconsistency between our work and their results after a thorough examination we identified an inaccurate description of the soil hydraulic property model applied in wu et al 2021 and an associated inconsistency in parameterizing the model in section 4 1 and figure 6 after correcting the parameters we found that the simulated infiltration rates of wu et al 2021 s model swingo and hydrus 1d are close under both steady and unsteady rainfalls moreover wu et al 2021 s model has been further validated using the experimental data of vachaud et al 1974 and chu 1997 and the results show satisfactory performance of wu et al 2021 s model in simulating infiltration in soils with a shallow water table wt keywords soil infiltration shallow water table soil hydraulic property model hydrus 1d swingo the soil hydraulic property model applied in wu et al 2021 is a modified brooks corey model proposed by smith et al 1993 1999 and chen et al 2013 hereafter referred to as smith model for clarity see appendix while the original brooks and corey 1964 model was used in swingo in section 4 1 and figure 6 in wu et al 2021 we applied an inaccurate treatment in the parametrization of the three models in the comparison among wu et al 2021 s model hydrus 1d and swingo this results in fairly different soil hydraulic

parameters were used for hydrus 1d bc parameters for swingo and smith soil hydraulic parameters for wu et al 2021 s model see appendix in the section 4 1 and figure 6 in wu et al 2021 the soil moisture is equal to the saturated moisture at z 0 6 m which is 0 9 m above the wt based on the parameters in table a of munõz carpena et al 2018 and the brooks corey hydraulic function an inaccurate assumption was made accordingly that the effect of shallow wt starts at z 0 6 m for wu et al 2021 s model and hydrus 1d this assumption is not valid and results in fairly different soil hydraulic characteristic curves for wu et al 2021 s model and hydrus 1d from those of swingo as shown in fig a while the two sets of soil hydraulic parameters for wu et al 2021 s model and hydrus 1d are consistent and produced similar modeling results they are inconsistent with that for swingo which led to a much different simulation result for swingo from the other two models therefore the results for wu et al 2021 s model and hydrus 1d should be modified with updated parameters although the agreement between the two models indicates the ability of wu et al 2021 s model simulating infiltration rate with the presence of a shallow wt the soil hydraulic parameters in table 4 of wu et al 2021 have been corrected as shown in table a the corresponding soil hydraulic characteristic curves for the three models are shown in fig b these curves agree fairly well especially between the smith model and the vg model which ensures the common ground of the infiltration modeling comparison fig c shows the infiltration rates computed by wu et al 2021 s model hydrus 1d and swingo respectively under two rainfall patterns studied in munõz carpena et al 2018 after correcting the model parameters we obtained similar trends of infiltration rate in modeling results of wu et al 2021 s model versus those of hydrus 1d and swingo which indicates that both wu et al 2021 s model and swingo can produce reasonably well results in simulating infiltration with the presence of a wt we found it is necessary to revise the comments to swingo that swingo overestimated ponding time but underestimated the time when the wetting front reached the wt which caused a large prediction error in the infiltration rate during the steady and unsteady rainfalls in wu et al 2021 which is not correct based on the updated simulation results the correct comment to swingo should be that as a simplified approach swingo has a general validity to predict the infiltration rate the ponding time and the time to column saturation with a shallow wt moreover compared to the results with bc parameters the results with vg and smith parameters can better reflect the infiltration rate when the wetting front approaches the wt see fig c this is likely because the smith and vg soil hydraulic property models consider the shape of wetting front instead of using a step function of bc model since the smith et al 1993 infiltration model was later extended to multilayer systems and to include moisture redistribution applying this model in simulating infiltration with a shallow wt as did in wu et al 2021 may find a wider range of application as suggested by munõz carpena et al 2021 s comments wu et al 2021 s model has been further tested using the experimental data from vachaud et al 1974 and compiled by chu 1997 the data collected in the laboratory represents infiltration under ponded conditions in a vertical column of fine sand soil with a wt at 0 925 m depth the vg parameters for hydrus 1d and swingo and smith parameters for wu et al 2021 s model are obtained from the soil hydraulic characteristics in vachaud et al 1974 and chu 1997 the model parameters and the corresponding soil hydraulic characteristic curves are shown in table b and fig d fig e shows that the simulated relative infiltration rates obtained with hydrus 1d swingo and wu et al 2021 s model matches the observed data well

wt see fig c this is likely because the smith and vg soil hydraulic property models consider the shape of wetting front instead of using a step function of bc model since the smith et al 1993 infiltration model was later extended to multilayer systems and to include moisture redistribution applying this model in simulating infiltration with a shallow wt as did in wu et al 2021 may find a wider range of application as suggested by munõz carpena et al 2021 s comments wu et al 2021 s model has been further tested using the experimental data from vachaud et al 1974 and compiled by chu 1997 the data collected in the laboratory represents infiltration under ponded conditions in a vertical column of fine sand soil with a wt at 0 925 m depth the vg parameters for hydrus 1d and swingo and smith parameters for wu et al 2021 s model are obtained from the soil hydraulic characteristics in vachaud et al 1974 and chu 1997 the model parameters and the corresponding soil hydraulic characteristic curves are shown in table b and fig d fig e shows that the simulated relative infiltration rates obtained with hydrus 1d swingo and wu et al 2021 s model matches the observed data well it can further demonstrate that wu et al 2021 s model can accurately simulate the soil infiltration process with a shallow wt declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the authors want to thank the comments by muñoz

8573,a unified framework for simulating various transport processes in the environment is presented it consists in a single set of partial differential equations the main feature of this model framework is its exchange layer which allows to treat several types of transfer between the soil and the surface water the model framework equations termed transfer equations is shown to reproduce three independently published models developed for soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport respectively by allowing the different processes to be represented within a single model framework the transfer equations are therefore unifying the representation of particles and chemical fluxes in the environment the transfer equations are implemented into the open source software fullswof 1d the code is verified against the approximation of an exact solution assuring its proper functioning a good adequacy is found between our numerical results and those published in the literature attesting the capability of the transfer equations to unify modeling of soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport hence the transfer equations can decrease the number of models to be used for simulating transfer of materials in the environment and limit the number of computer codes to be developed and maintained the transfer equations could also help in drawing parallels between different fields of hydrology keywords transfer equation modeling erosion chemical 1 introduction in hydrology for a given process many models may co exist for water infiltration at the soil surface we have the equations of green and ampt 1911 richards 1931 horton 1939 etc and for a given model different numerical implementations are possible for example several computer codes exist for solving the shallow water equations barré de saint venant 1871 hack and jakob 1992 breuer and bader 2012 delestre et al 2017 etc we emphasize the difference we make between a model i e a set of equations and a computer code a given model can be solved by different codes which can involve different numerical schemes or different mesh types because different models were developed for different processes it seems that each model has a very specific description for example numerous equations have been proposed to model the transport of a material in a water flow these various equations can represent different types of materials such as particles or dissolved chemicals and account for a wide range of processes interrill erosion rill erosion gully erosion suspended transport bedload transport etc while this gives hydrologists and environment specialists a large choice of models and computer codes this diversity may be more apparent than real soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport are typically seen as different processes hence they are usually accounted for by different models even if a few exceptions exist such as sander et al 2011 where the hairsine and rose model dedicated to soil erosion was applied to the specific case of a sand bed river however to simulate two transfer processes two models usually have to be coupled and their interaction accounted for leading to an additional complexity for example if one wants to simulate transfer processes within a watershed such as interrill and rill erosions on the hillslopes and bedload transport in the river network it currently requires distinct functions to be implemented one for each process as well as dedicated coupling functions between these processes the unifying model framework alleviates these needs a single function can deal with all the processes these processes being represented through a set of parameters this obviously solves the coupling issues finally one gets a computer code that is simpler to develop to debug and to maintain that simulates multiple processes and that has a wide range of applications in this article we describe a single model framework that can represent soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport hence this model framework unifies the description of what is usually regarded as three different processes and would typically lead to the use of three separate models the proposed transfer model framework is based on a general mass balance and has been used previously in nonlinear chromatography james et al 2000 in the present paper we consider a material located in the fluid or supplied by the original soil surface the material can be stored in an exchange layer or released from this exchange layer an exchange function is used to model the fluxes between the exchange layer and the water flow the transfer model equations express the evolution in time and space of the concentrations of the material in the fluid and in the exchange layer the model framework is not process specific various processes and materials can be considered we show that this model framework is able to represent particle or chemical transport on hillslope or in rivers moreover it can account for multiple classes of particles and their interactions the model framework is of general purpose while the equations are limited to the transport of a specific material in a specific type of water flow this justify the unifying character of the proposed model framework after describing the transfer model framework its numerical implementation is presented for a particular configuration we are able to express a nearly exact solution of the transfer model equations for each time and space point this is used to check that the software computes a good approximation of the solution and that no bug is present in the implementation this is called a verification of proper functioning then to exemplify its capabilities we show that the unifying transfer model framework and its computer code can represent 1 soil erosion by water on a hillslope as done in the model of hairsine et al 2002 this model considers erosion and deposition processes separately taking into account several sizes of particles 2 bedload transport in rivers as done in the model of lajeunesse et al 2013 this model considers the spreading of a plume of tracer particles 3 chemical transport by overland flow with rain and diffusion in the soil as done in the model of gao et al 2004 while these three models and for sure a lot of other models are apparently very different we show that they can be rewritten in the same formalism i e the unifying transfer framework presented in this paper and hence they can be run with a single computer code e g fullswof 1d or any other shallow water software through a coupling with the unifying transfer model equations note that several works are limited to the case of model equilibriums beuselinck et al 2002 sander et al 2002 in this article as an extra challenge our goal is not only to catch the equilibrium but also to get the evolution toward this equilibrium starting from given initial conditions the transitory solution towards the equilibrium is expected to be simulated 2 material and methods 2 1 the unifying transfer model framework 2 1 1 description we propose a unifying transfer model framework to compute the concentrations of materials in the environment as functions of time and space based on equations previously used in nonlinear chromatography james et al 2000 for the sake of clarity we expose the unifying transfer model framework in one space dimension its extension to two dimensions being straightforward the transfer model framework accounts for a fluid containing some materials which can be exchanged between the water column and an exchange layer fig 1a a source can supply additional materials to both the fluid and the exchange layer as an example from a physical point of view fig 1b we consider a medium such as the soil from which the materials particles chemicals are released due to the flow to the rain etc these materials enter the flow are transported and can be accreted to a layer covering part of the initial surface eventually these materials can be released again from this layer hence this layer is termed exchange layer to write the transfer model equations we consider the concentrations of the materials c stands for the concentration in the fluid and m stands for the concentration in the exchange layer fig 1a we can consider several classes of materials such as particles of different sizes we denote the class by a i subscript i 1 n all the quantities are expressed per unit width then assuming the height of the fluid is h m and its discharge is q m2 s 1 by writing the mass balance for the materials we get the following system 1 hc i t qc i x 1 ts i g i m hc i s i 1 a m i t 1 ts i g i m hc i s i 2 where c i kg m 2 is the concentration of the material class i in the fluid m represents the vector of the m i values with m i kg m 1 the concentration of the material class i in the exchange layer s i 1 and s i 2 kg s 1 m 1 are source terms representing the material from the original soil that supplies the flow and the exchange layer respectively the signs of s i 1 and s i 2 define the direction of the supply the function g i is an equilibrium function ts i s is a relaxation time and a a constant coefficient the parameters g i ts i and a are defined by the physical problem under consideration and consequently they depend on the intended application in case of null source terms s i 1 s i 2 0 summing the two equations of 1 cancels the right hand side and the overall mass balance becomes 2 hc i t a m i t qc i x 0 the transfer equations 1 are considered as a system and in this formulation we cannot impose one concentration to be at the equilibrium in one equation but not the other if the ts i are of the same magnitude some studies such as sander et al 2002 consider so called partial equilibria of the hairsine and rose model i e they cancel some terms in one equation but not in the other that can lead to states of the system that could not be attained by the complete model questioning the relevancy of such an approach the transfer equations 1 couple the evolution of the concentration of materials in the fluid and the concentration of materials in the exchange layer this draws two remarks related to the capabilities of the transfer equations 1 first if an equilibrium state is to be achieved it will be related to both the concentration in the fluid and the concentration in the exchange layer second an equilibrium will be achieved only if the prescribed conditions permit otherwise the system will not converge to an equilibrium 2 1 2 implementation fullswof for full shallow water equations for overland flow is a free open source software gpl compatible licence that solves the shallow water equations and gives the evolution of a shallow layer of water in space and time delestre et al 2017 written in c it implements the finite volume numerical method it is developed by idp ex mapmo and inrae there exists a one dimensional version for one dimensional flows where the quantities such as the water height depend only on one space dimension x and time and a two dimensional version to simulate more general flows where functions depend on the two space dimensions x and y and time currently the transfer model framework 1 is integrated in the one dimensional version of fullswof fullswof 1d version 2 00 00 with a splitting method meaning that at each time step the evolution of the water is computed first giving the water height h and the water discharge q in space and then the transfer equations 1 are solved as implemented the transfer equations 1 could also be used as a library by another flow software in fact for any other software giving the evolution of water height and discharge as functions of time one can extract the resolution of the transfer model framework and make the coupling easily for details about the implementation see appendix a in the following the calculations are done using fullswof 1d the parameters files are not fully detailed here but are available in the source code repository of fullswof 1d https sourcesup renater fr projects fullswof 1d either in the benchmarks folder for bedload transport in river or in the examples folder for the other three cases 2 1 3 verification of proper functioning before doing comparisons with other physical models we perform an academic test to check the proper functioning of the software this is possible because we were able to write a nearly exact solution at each time and at each point for a given choice of parameters a software computing the solutions of the transfer equations 1 should return a good approximation of this solution under the corresponding conditions and the results should be improved when decreasing the space step we consider two sizes of particles inside the domain distributed in the flowing layer and in the exchange layer without any source and we let the system evolve in time we choose g i m k i m i with k 1 243 and k 2 0 3 ts 1 0 087 s and ts 2 7 17 10 4 s and a 1 we solve the system 3 hc 1 t qc 1 x 1 0 087 243 m 1 hc 1 m 1 t 1 0 087 243 m 1 hc 1 hc 2 t qc 2 x 1 0 000717 0 3 m 2 hc 2 m 2 t 1 0 000717 0 3 m 2 hc 2 starting from h t 0 x 3 75 10 3 m and u t 0 x 0 3391 m s 1 to be at a steady state for the water over an inclined plane with slope 0 02 the velocity u is given by u q h and stays constant as well as the water height and 4 c 1 t 0 x x 1 for 1 x 2 1 for 2 x 3 4 x for 3 x 4 0 elsewhere c 2 t 0 x x 1 5 for 1 5 x 2 0 5 for 2 x 3 3 5 x for 3 x 3 5 0 elsewhere and m 1 t 0 x hc 1 t 0 x k 1 m 2 t 0 x hc 2 t 0 x k 2 for the particle concentrations fig 4 summing the two equations for the same class of particles i the right hand sides cancel two by two see eq 2 and we get 5 hc i m i t qc i x 0 in our configuration as the ts i are small using an asymptotic development such as in james et al 2000 and lajeunesse et al 2018 one can prove that a good approximation of the solution is given by m i t x hc i t x k i and consequently c i t x c i t 0 x q h 1 k i t these theoretical approximations are useful to validate the code and to check the propagation velocities of the particles 2 2 erosion on an hillslope the hairsine and rose model 2 2 1 description hairsine et al 2002 described a model of hillslope erosion by rainfall for a set of particle sizes the model includes erosion deposition and reentrainment the eroded particles can be deposited forming a cohesive deposition layer this deposition layer can be eroded too hence the possible reentrainment built up on hairsine and rose 1991 and hairsine and rose 1992 the model of hairsine et al 2002 takes into account spatial variations such as varying slopes it is written as fig 2 6 hc i t qc i x r i r ri e i e di d i m di t d i r ri e di the variables h and q denote the water height and the discharge of the fluid respectively the equations are written considering n different classes of particle sizes denoted by the subscript i from 1 to n the c i term stands for the particle concentration in the fluid for the i th size class and m di for the mass of particles of size class i in the deposited layer per unit area the r i term is the rate of entrainment of the original soil r ri is the rate of reentrainment of the deposited layer the term e i is the rate of rainfall detachment of the original soil and e di is the rate of rainfall detachment of the deposited layer finally the term d i is the deposition rate explicit formulas are detailed in the next section and can be found in the original article this model was evaluated and confronted to experimental results obtained with a laboratory rainfall simulator on a bare soil and published in proffitt et al 1991 2 2 2 rewriting of the model of hairsine et al 2002 the hairsine and rose equations 6 can be rewritten in the form of the unifying transfer equations 1 the deposited layer of the hairsine and rose model is easily identified to the exchange layer of the transfer equations the terms r i and e i are source terms from the original soil while r ri e di and d i are exchange terms between the fluid and the exchange layer we obtain 7 hc i t qc i x r ri e di d i r i e i 1 ts i g i m hc i s i 1 a m i t d i r ri e di 1 ts i g i m hc i s i 2 with a 1 m i m di the mass of particles of the class i per unit area of the deposited layer s i 1 r i e i and s i 2 0 the source terms and the exchange is given thanks to the relation 1 t s i g i m hc i r ri e di d i more precisely the deposition term d i expresses as d i v i c i where v i is the settling velocity of the i th class of particles such that ts i h v i where we recall that h is the water height the r ri and e di terms are functions of m i the explicit formulas are given below and the function g i reads g i m ts i r ri e di following hairsine et al 2002 and sander et al 2007 the source and exchange terms can be written as 8 r i 1 h p i f j ω ω 0 e i 1 h p i ar p r ri h f gh ρ s ρ s ρ ω ω 0 m i m t e di ha d r p m i m t where p i is the proportion of particles in the size class i of the original i e uneroded soil f is the fraction of excess stream power effective in entrainment and reentrainment j is the specific energy of entrainment m t i 1 n m i is the total mass of particles in the deposited layer h is the fractional shielding of the underlying soil provided by the deposited layer h min 1 m t m t with m t the mass of deposited particles required to shield the original soil completely a is the detachability of the original soil a d is the detachability of the deposited layer ρ s and ρ are the particle and water densities respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity ω ρ gsq is the stream power s is the slope of the domain and q the water discharge and ω 0 the critical threshold stream power r is the rain intensity and p is an exponent that was evaluated to be close to unity proffitt et al 1991 in the following we take p 1 as a consequence the source term s i 1 is given by s i 1 1 h p i f j ω ω 0 ar p and the exchange function g i writes g i m hf gv i ρ s ρ s ρ ω ω 0 m t h v i ha d r p m t m i note that because there is no direct particle flux between the soil and the exchange layer in the model of hairsine et al 2002 the source term s i 2 equals zero 2 2 3 numerical comparison hogarth et al 2004 simulated the experiments of proffitt et al 1991 and specifically temporal changes in sediment concentrations along a flume according to proffitt et al 1991 the evolution of sediment concentrations is thought to be due to the development of a coarser deposited layer that shields an increasing fraction of the original soil surface until an equilibrium is achieved to numerically reproduce the experiments of proffitt et al 1991 hogarth et al 2004 propose a numerical model for rainfall driven erosion over a slope s 0 4 considering n 10 classes of particles uniformly distributed with a constant rain of r 100 mm h 1 they fit the values of 1 the detachabilities a and a d and of 2 the mass of deposited particles required to shield the original soil m t as their numerical solution is in good agreement with the experiments we take the same parameters as the ones they use they found the value of m t to be m t 0 0767 kg m 2 m t is larger than m t so h m t m t such that g i becomes a linear function as they also get an approximation of the water height as a linear function we choose to initialize our flow solver with this expression and let it evolve in time towards the equilibrium 2 3 bedload transport in rivers the model of lajeunesse et al 2013 2 3 1 description bedload transport results from the particle entrainment near the bed by a flow a model for the spreading of a plume of tracer particles in a river by bedload transport was proposed in lajeunesse et al 2013 for the case of a steady state transport over a flat bed of uniform particles they denote by n the number of particles in motion per unit bed area v the mean particle velocity t s the characteristic settling time of a particle and α 1 the ratio of mobile to immobile particles for steady state uniform particle transport erosion and deposition are balanced the erosion and deposition rates being the same both equal to n t s lajeunesse et al 2013 are interested in the evolution in time and space of a plume of marked particles tracers in their test case the tracers are initially immobile on the upstream part of the domain as they are entrained the tracers move downstream this phenomenon is modeled by the following system 9 ϕ t v ϕ x 1 t s ψ ϕ 1 α ψ t 1 t s ψ ϕ where ϕ is the proportion of marked particles in the moving layer and ψ is the proportion of marked particles on the bed surface 2 3 2 rewriting of the model of lajeunesse et al 2013 let us explain how to write the model of lajeunesse et al 2013 as a particular case of the unifying transfer equations 1 multiplying the two equations of system 9 by m g n where m g is the mass of one particle and n the number of particles in motion per unit bed area we get 10 c t v c x 1 ts α m c m t 1 ts α m c with c m g n ϕ and m m g n α ψ the mass concentration of mobile and immobile marked particles per unit bed area respectively note that these equations can also be written in a dimensionless form with the characteristic time t t t s and the characteristic space x x t s v 11 c t c x α m c m t α m c if we identify c hc g m α m s 1 s 2 0 and a 1 the bedload transport model of lajeunesse et al 2013 can be written in the form of the transfer equations 1 this clearly shows that the proposed transfer equations are really a unifying model framework 2 3 3 numerical comparison let us consider the tracer dispersion in bedload transport proposed by lajeunesse et al 2013 at the beginning of the experiment the tracers are only immobile particles located between 0 and 20 dimensionless distance the proportion of marked particles on the bed surface ψ being equal to 1 we denote by α the ratio of the surface concentration of moving particles to the concentration of static particles following lajeunesse et al 2013 we choose α equal to 0 3 we obtain an initial concentration of tracer immobile particles of 1 1 α ψ 0 77 fig 6 black line then we solve eqs 11 in terms of the variables ϕ and ψ the proportions of marked particles in the moving layer and on the bed surface respectively see the parameters file in the benchmarks folder of the software repository 2 4 chemical transport the model of gao et al 2004 2 4 1 description the considered material can be dissolved chemicals such as tracers pollutants nutrients etc this approach is studied in gao et al 2004 with a model that takes into account both raindrop driven processes and diffusion in the soil gao et al 2004 consider three different vertically distributed horizontal layers fig 3 the upper layer of height d w is the runoff or surface water ponding zone the exchange layer of height d e from which chemicals leave the soil and enter surface runoff the lower layer of height l d e is the soil where chemicals are transported by diffusion and infiltration they proposed the following model 12 d w c w t qc w x e r c e λ c w ic w for d w z 0 α d e c e t j e r λ c w c e i c w c e for 0 z d e α c s t z d s c s z ic s for d e z l with c s z 0 for z l and c s c e for z d e where the unknowns are the chemical concentrations c w is the chemical solute concentration in the runoff c e is the chemical solute concentration in the exchange layer and c s is the dissolved chemical concentration in the soil water the total chemical concentration in the soil is α c s where α is equal to the soil moisture in case of non adsorbed chemicals or takes into account a partition coefficient in case of adsorbed chemicals the variable j is the diffusion rate of solute from the soil at z d e and is given by fick s law 13 j d s c s z z d e the parameter i is the infiltration rate in the soil p is the rainfall rate q is the volumetric runoff flux per unit width d s is the dispersivity of chemicals in the soil and e r function of p is the rate of soil water feeded into the runoff as d s is very small compared to e r the diffusion between the exchange layer and the runoff is neglected finally λ between 0 and 1 is the proportion of chemical concentration c w entering the exchange layer λ 0 if there is only rainwater without chemicals and λ 1 if the water that enters in the exchange layer is only runoff through comparisons between experiments and numerical results gao et al 2004 show that their model reproduces well the experiments and can be fitted using only measured parameters i e without calibration 2 4 2 rewriting of the model of gao et al 2004 the model 12 of gao et al 2004 can be written as a particular case of the unifying transfer equations 1 the equation on c s the third equation of 12 can be considered as a secondary equation to be solved at each time step to obtain the value of the diffusion j the water height is d w which corresponds to the variable h and the water discharge is denoted by q in both models if we denote by m d e c e to get a concentration per surface unit and c c w we get 14 hc t qc x e r d e m λ e r i d w hc α m t e r d e m λ e r i d w hc j i d e m which takes the form of the transfer equations 1 with a α s 1 0 s 2 j i d e m ts d w λ e r i and g m km d w d e e r λ e r i m 2 4 3 numerical comparison gao et al 2004 proposed a numerical scheme to solve their model in a case with no infiltration i 0 and no water flux q 0 which fits their experiments they apply the crank nicolson finite difference scheme with a spatial discretization of 0 02 cm and a time step of 1 s to get c s as a function of z at each time step c e and c w can be computed easily at each time from the values at the previous time as their numerical results are in very good agreement with their experiments we consider them as the reference solution to be compared to the results of the unifying transfer equations as computed by fullswof 1d we reproduce the first experiment of gao et al 2004 taking their values of the parameters namely a rain intensity of 7 4 cm h 1 an initial concentration of cl in the soil and in the exchange layer of 29 82 g l 1 a water height of 7 mm a height of the exchange layer of 7 6 mm a bulk density of ρ b 1 5 g cm 1 a soil moisture of θ 0 37 α a soil erodibility of a 0 40 g cm 3 a soil diffusivity coefficient of 4 2 10 6 cm2 s 1 a parameter λ 1 and a raindrop chemical transfer rate of e r 2 1 10 4 cm s 1 3 results 3 1 verification of proper functioning as explained in section 2 1 3 we have an approximation of the exact solution for the unifying transfer equations in the case of two classes of particles without any source in fig 4 we compare the values of c and m for the two classes of particles with the numerical solution obtained by fullswof 1d see the parameters file in the examples sediment deposition folder of the repository the results are given at time t 8 s the values of m 1 are multiplied by 100 in order to display them within the same graph as m 2 values the approximation of the exact solution and the numerical solution are in good agreement note that we took 1000 cells in space i e the space step is equal to 1 cm to have a good precision if the number of cells is decreased the results get less accurate and the numerical errors accumulate with time 3 2 rainfall detachment and deposition in the context of rainfall driven erosion over a slope the experiments of proffitt et al 1991 were reproduced numerically by hogarth et al 2004 and now by the unifying transfer model framework in fig 5 we plot the total concentration of particles detached by the rain and suspended in the fluid as a function of space for several times fig 5a and at the output as a function of time fig 5b the numerical concentrations obtained with fullswof 1d and by hogarth s computations are in good agreement except for the first times t 5 min this discrepancy is due to the difference in the initial condition we start from flow conditions near the equilibrium and by solving the shallow water equations coupled with the hairsine and rose equations for the particles the steady state for the water flow is attained after some time while in their calculations hogarth et al 2004 consider the steady state for the flow and only solve the equation for the particles as explained in the description of the unifying transfer model framework section 2 1 1 it is not possible to catch a partial equilibrium of the complete system where the fluid is at a steady state but not the particles the global equilibrium can be attained only if the experimental conditions allow it in this experiment the solution at the first times namely on fig 5 for t 1 min is very dependent on the initial condition taken for the water height one can see on fig 5b that the coupled shallow water unifying transfer equations catches the first experimental point t 1 min in a much better way than hogarth et al 2004 while using the same parameters we can also note at the end of the experiment near the steady state that the results of hogarth et al 2004 are quite similar to the ones of the unifying transfer equations solved by fullswof 1d for large times the same system is solved in both cases the flow is at the equilibrium and the results are the same thus our approach can simulate both equilibrium and non equilibrium conditions 3 3 bedload transport in rivers the dispersion of tracer particles by bedload transport as proposed by lajeunesse et al 2013 was simulated using the unifying transfer model framework in fig 6 we plot the concentrations of tracer particles section 2 3 3 namely 1 1 α ψ and α 1 α ϕ against distance dimensionless to better see the particles and their actual behavior in the two layers mobile and immobile particles we decided to perform the same plot as in lajeunesse et al 2013 we plot 1 1 α ψ immobile particles and the sum 1 1 α ψ α 1 α ϕ to see the concentration of mobile particles above the immobile particles for all times t 100 700 and 1400 dimensionless the unifying transfer equations solved by fullswof 1d match exactly the results obtained by lajeunesse et al 2013 3 4 chemical transport an experiment of chemical transport with rain was simulated numerically by gao et al 2004 and now with the unifying transfer model framework in fig 7 we plot the solute concentration i e cl in the exchange layer and in the runoff layer corresponding to this experiment with the numerical approximation proposed by gao et al 2004 represented as cross marks fullswof 1d solves the shallow water equations and the unifying transfer equations with the same parameters and we choose a point of the domain to plot the evolution in time in both layers the concentrations as computed by the unifying transfer equations match very well the results of gao et al 2004 4 discussion the first point we want to underline in this discussion is the correctness of the results and the comparison with exact solutions the writing of a code from a set of equations that models physical phenomena can be affected by two types of errors either a bug or an issue in the numerical scheme used to solve the equations in both cases it negatively affects the results however this may easily go unnoticed assessing that the results are faithful to the equations is not a trivial task the use of quasi analytical solutions allows to verify the proper functioning delestre et al 2013 as shown in the present paper this approach has been applied successfully to the unifying transfer equations as implemented in fullswof 1d such a verification was previously carried out to check that fullswof 1d accurately solves the shallow water equations fullswof 1d is routinely tested via a benchmarking script using ten analytical solutions of the shallow water equations taken from the library swashes delestre et al 2013 following the implementation of the unifying transfer equations the exact solution of lajeunesse et al 2013 was added to the list of benchmarks these analytical solutions representing a diversity of flow conditions enable users and developers to assess the quality of the numerical results see https sourcesup renater fr projects fullswof 1d on the one hand they allow developers to check that code changes do not decrease the simulation quality on the other hand they allow users to check that fullswof 1d and the unifying transfer equations runs faithfully with their computer and compiler we believe such an approach should be carried out as a standard procedure before any scientific results be reported since different computer codes of the same model can lead to non identical results we strongly recommend that other implementations of the transfer equations are validated using exact solutions let us come now to the unifying transfer model framework proposed in this article for soil erosion by rainfall bedload transport in rivers and chemical transport the numerical results of the unifying transfer equations coupled to the shallow water equations are in good agreement with the results reported in the literature this clearly shows that the transfer equations are able to simulate soil erosion by rainfall bedload transport in rivers and chemical transport this underlines the unifying character of this model framework up to now to simulate within a catchment both soil erosion on hillslopes and bedload transport in rivers two set of equations had to be implemented together with their boundary conditions such as the boundary condition between hillslopes and rivers with the unifying transfer model framework both processes could be simulated within the same domain by the same computer code just by changing the parameters of the unifying transfer equations depending if the grid cells are within the hillslope or the river note that the current implementation of the transfer equations of fullswof 1d allows for a unique set of parameters within the domain the implementation of the unifying transfer equations in the 2d version of fullswof namely fullswof 2d see https sourcesup renater fr projects fullswof 2d will overcome this limitation in the case of soil erosion by rainfall our results are not the same as the ones of hogarth et al 2004 because the authors simplified the equations considering that one part of the model the fluid is at the equilibrium and not the other part the particles as a consequence the transitory evolutions towards the equilibrium are different while the same equilibrium is attained our numerical results outperform the results of hogarth et al 2004 because our implementation in fullswof 1d can simulate transitory states our approach is more complete giving the evolution of the physical system in time as well as the final steady state in the environment most of the processes are transitory steady states being more of an exception than a common case thus the capability to simulate transitory states should be a requirement for most of the computer codes the unifying transfer model framework could also simulate processes not considered in the present paper as long as they can be described as an exchange between two layers following the scheme of fig 1a while we show that the unifying transfer model framework is able to simulate soil erosion by rainfall bedload transport in rivers and chemical transport this set of equations may have application for other processes in the environment or in other fields of science our approach consisting in unifying various models from different fields of application opens up interesting horizons the same code can be used for different processes alleviating the need to develop a specific code for each process as detailed before this also makes the combined simulation of different processes easier finally for each specific problem the reader can identify the layers and the fluxes between the layers as represented in fig 1a and the corresponding parameters thus the physical meaning of the parameters is not lost in all the cases considered in this paper the relaxation term was linear leading to the advection of symmetric distributions of concentration e g fig 6 indeed lajeunesse et al 2018 showed that for this system the distribution of concentration tends asymptotically i e for long time to a gaussian curve for future works it would be interesting to investigate the physical relevance of non linear terms for hydrology as it has already been done for the field of chromatography james et al 2000 that will lead to asymmetric distribution of concentrations depending on the type of non linearity the front edge or the back edge of the concentration distribution could get sharper skewing the distribution thus the unifying transfer model framework could have an even wider range of applications than presently illustrated 5 conclusions a unifying framework was proposed to model different transfers between a fluid layer and the soil it is based on a general mass balance between the fluid layer and an exchange layer implemented in fullswof 1d its proper functioning was verified by comparison with a nearly exact solution this ascertained the adequacy of the computer programming based on three examples with various parameters and physical conditions the obtained results were similar to or better than those in the literature these examples covered three environmental transfer processes soil erosion on a hillslope bedload transport in rivers and chemical transport with rain and diffusion in the soil while these examples are usually simulated using apparently different models and completely different computer codes the unifying transfer model framework and the same computer code was able to simulate them this exemplifies the unifying character of the proposed transfer model framework the unifying transfer equations relate the evolution of the concentrations of particles or chemicals in a fluid and in an exchange layer they can account for several classes of particles or chemicals they are proposed as a unifying transfer model framework for soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport the unifying transfer equations could open new prospects to understand one

the numerical scheme for the homogeneous part of the first equation of 1 the right hand side terms and the second equation of 1 are added at the end this section the scheme described here is performed for each class i of materials one class after the other denoting by v hc i and f v uv q h v qc i the homogeneous part of the first equality of the transfer equations 1 reads a 1 v t f v x 0 the velocity u is the eigenvalue of system 1 we use a finite volume method to discretize eq a 1 over a 1d grid with a space step denoted by δ x and a time step denoted by δ t 1 1 the time and space steps must be adapted to the parameters of the system in particular they must be small if the values of ts i are small fig 8 the discrete time is t 0 0 t 1 t n t n 1 t n δ t with t 0 the initial time on the colored cell t n t n 1 x k 1 2 x k 1 2 the value of v is considered as constant and is denoted by v k n integrating eq a 1 over each space time cell we get the relation a 2 v k n 1 v k n δ t δ x f k 1 2 n f k 1 2 n where f k 1 2 n and f k 1 2 n are the approximations of the fluxes at the interfaces x k 1 2 and x k 1 2 respectively they depend on the values of v k n on the left and right boundaries of the cell denoted by v l n and v r n respectively a 1 spatial scheme at order 1 to compute the values of the f k 1 2 n and f k 1 2 n fluxes we choose the hll scheme harten lax van leer detailed in harten et al 1983 that was proved to be robust and simple delestre 2010 it is one of the fluxes already implemented in fullswof 1d for the hydrodynamic part for a given interface we denote by φ v l n v r n the numerical flux that reads a 3 φ v l n v r n f v l n if 0 c l c r f v l n c l f v r n c r c l c l c r c r c l v r n v l n if c l 0 c r f v r n if c r 0 where c l and c r are propagating speeds computed by the following formulas delestre et al 2014 a 4 c l min v l n v r n min u 0 c r max v l n v r n max u 0 the values of v l n and v r n are taken equal to the values of v in the neighbor cells and consequently the fluxes are approximated by f k 1 2 n φ v k 1 n v k n and f k 1 2 n φ v k n v k 1 n which means that the scheme is at order one in space a 2 spatial scheme at order 2 to improve the numerical scheme one can linearly reconstruct the variables v l n et v r n in order to obtain a second order scheme in space we choose muscl method introduced in van leer 1979 the variables are reconstructed using a piece wise linear function depending on the slope of each cell of the grid denoted by σ k n on each side of the interface located at x k 1 2 the reconstructed values are a 5 v k 1 2 l n v k n δ x 2 σ k n v k 1 2 r n v k 1 n δ x 2 σ k 1 n which gives f k 1 2 n φ v k 1 2 l n v k 1 2 r n and f k 1 2 n φ v k 1 2 l n v k 1 2 r n to assure the stability of the scheme one can compute three slopes from the neighbor cells with a 6 α k 1 v k n v k 1 n δ x α k v k 1 n v k 1 n 2 δ x α k 1 v k 1 n v k n δ x and compute σ k n as σ k n minmod α k 1 α k α k 1 where the minmod function is defined by a 7 minmod a b c min a b c if a b c 0 max a b c if a b c 0 0 else as described in delestre 2010 and godlewski and raviart 1996 a 3 second order in time in the previous eq a 2 we perform an euler scheme of order 1 in time to improve the accuracy of the scheme and get a second order in time we choose the heun method as it is also the one already implemented in fullswof delestre et al 2014 it is a predictor corrector method that computes first some predicted values v k and v k and then performs a correction step to obtain the value at the following time n

system 1 we must deal with the right hand side of the equations that is the relaxation term and the sources this leads to the following numerical scheme a 9 v k n 1 v k n δ t f k 1 2 n f k 1 2 n δ x g

variables h and q hu are computed at time n by fullswof 1d and then are used by the transfer part to compute the concentrations c i and m i at time n 1 
8573,a unified framework for simulating various transport processes in the environment is presented it consists in a single set of partial differential equations the main feature of this model framework is its exchange layer which allows to treat several types of transfer between the soil and the surface water the model framework equations termed transfer equations is shown to reproduce three independently published models developed for soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport respectively by allowing the different processes to be represented within a single model framework the transfer equations are therefore unifying the representation of particles and chemical fluxes in the environment the transfer equations are implemented into the open source software fullswof 1d the code is verified against the approximation of an exact solution assuring its proper functioning a good adequacy is found between our numerical results and those published in the literature attesting the capability of the transfer equations to unify modeling of soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport hence the transfer equations can decrease the number of models to be used for simulating transfer of materials in the environment and limit the number of computer codes to be developed and maintained the transfer equations could also help in drawing parallels between different fields of hydrology keywords transfer equation modeling erosion chemical 1 introduction in hydrology for a given process many models may co exist for water infiltration at the soil surface we have the equations of green and ampt 1911 richards 1931 horton 1939 etc and for a given model different numerical implementations are possible for example several computer codes exist for solving the shallow water equations barré de saint venant 1871 hack and jakob 1992 breuer and bader 2012 delestre et al 2017 etc we emphasize the difference we make between a model i e a set of equations and a computer code a given model can be solved by different codes which can involve different numerical schemes or different mesh types because different models were developed for different processes it seems that each model has a very specific description for example numerous equations have been proposed to model the transport of a material in a water flow these various equations can represent different types of materials such as particles or dissolved chemicals and account for a wide range of processes interrill erosion rill erosion gully erosion suspended transport bedload transport etc while this gives hydrologists and environment specialists a large choice of models and computer codes this diversity may be more apparent than real soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport are typically seen as different processes hence they are usually accounted for by different models even if a few exceptions exist such as sander et al 2011 where the hairsine and rose model dedicated to soil erosion was applied to the specific case of a sand bed river however to simulate two transfer processes two models usually have to be coupled and their interaction accounted for leading to an additional complexity for example if one wants to simulate transfer processes within a watershed such as interrill and rill erosions on the hillslopes and bedload transport in the river network it currently requires distinct functions to be implemented one for each process as well as dedicated coupling functions between these processes the unifying model framework alleviates these needs a single function can deal with all the processes these processes being represented through a set of parameters this obviously solves the coupling issues finally one gets a computer code that is simpler to develop to debug and to maintain that simulates multiple processes and that has a wide range of applications in this article we describe a single model framework that can represent soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport hence this model framework unifies the description of what is usually regarded as three different processes and would typically lead to the use of three separate models the proposed transfer model framework is based on a general mass balance and has been used previously in nonlinear chromatography james et al 2000 in the present paper we consider a material located in the fluid or supplied by the original soil surface the material can be stored in an exchange layer or released from this exchange layer an exchange function is used to model the fluxes between the exchange layer and the water flow the transfer model equations express the evolution in time and space of the concentrations of the material in the fluid and in the exchange layer the model framework is not process specific various processes and materials can be considered we show that this model framework is able to represent particle or chemical transport on hillslope or in rivers moreover it can account for multiple classes of particles and their interactions the model framework is of general purpose while the equations are limited to the transport of a specific material in a specific type of water flow this justify the unifying character of the proposed model framework after describing the transfer model framework its numerical implementation is presented for a particular configuration we are able to express a nearly exact solution of the transfer model equations for each time and space point this is used to check that the software computes a good approximation of the solution and that no bug is present in the implementation this is called a verification of proper functioning then to exemplify its capabilities we show that the unifying transfer model framework and its computer code can represent 1 soil erosion by water on a hillslope as done in the model of hairsine et al 2002 this model considers erosion and deposition processes separately taking into account several sizes of particles 2 bedload transport in rivers as done in the model of lajeunesse et al 2013 this model considers the spreading of a plume of tracer particles 3 chemical transport by overland flow with rain and diffusion in the soil as done in the model of gao et al 2004 while these three models and for sure a lot of other models are apparently very different we show that they can be rewritten in the same formalism i e the unifying transfer framework presented in this paper and hence they can be run with a single computer code e g fullswof 1d or any other shallow water software through a coupling with the unifying transfer model equations note that several works are limited to the case of model equilibriums beuselinck et al 2002 sander et al 2002 in this article as an extra challenge our goal is not only to catch the equilibrium but also to get the evolution toward this equilibrium starting from given initial conditions the transitory solution towards the equilibrium is expected to be simulated 2 material and methods 2 1 the unifying transfer model framework 2 1 1 description we propose a unifying transfer model framework to compute the concentrations of materials in the environment as functions of time and space based on equations previously used in nonlinear chromatography james et al 2000 for the sake of clarity we expose the unifying transfer model framework in one space dimension its extension to two dimensions being straightforward the transfer model framework accounts for a fluid containing some materials which can be exchanged between the water column and an exchange layer fig 1a a source can supply additional materials to both the fluid and the exchange layer as an example from a physical point of view fig 1b we consider a medium such as the soil from which the materials particles chemicals are released due to the flow to the rain etc these materials enter the flow are transported and can be accreted to a layer covering part of the initial surface eventually these materials can be released again from this layer hence this layer is termed exchange layer to write the transfer model equations we consider the concentrations of the materials c stands for the concentration in the fluid and m stands for the concentration in the exchange layer fig 1a we can consider several classes of materials such as particles of different sizes we denote the class by a i subscript i 1 n all the quantities are expressed per unit width then assuming the height of the fluid is h m and its discharge is q m2 s 1 by writing the mass balance for the materials we get the following system 1 hc i t qc i x 1 ts i g i m hc i s i 1 a m i t 1 ts i g i m hc i s i 2 where c i kg m 2 is the concentration of the material class i in the fluid m represents the vector of the m i values with m i kg m 1 the concentration of the material class i in the exchange layer s i 1 and s i 2 kg s 1 m 1 are source terms representing the material from the original soil that supplies the flow and the exchange layer respectively the signs of s i 1 and s i 2 define the direction of the supply the function g i is an equilibrium function ts i s is a relaxation time and a a constant coefficient the parameters g i ts i and a are defined by the physical problem under consideration and consequently they depend on the intended application in case of null source terms s i 1 s i 2 0 summing the two equations of 1 cancels the right hand side and the overall mass balance becomes 2 hc i t a m i t qc i x 0 the transfer equations 1 are considered as a system and in this formulation we cannot impose one concentration to be at the equilibrium in one equation but not the other if the ts i are of the same magnitude some studies such as sander et al 2002 consider so called partial equilibria of the hairsine and rose model i e they cancel some terms in one equation but not in the other that can lead to states of the system that could not be attained by the complete model questioning the relevancy of such an approach the transfer equations 1 couple the evolution of the concentration of materials in the fluid and the concentration of materials in the exchange layer this draws two remarks related to the capabilities of the transfer equations 1 first if an equilibrium state is to be achieved it will be related to both the concentration in the fluid and the concentration in the exchange layer second an equilibrium will be achieved only if the prescribed conditions permit otherwise the system will not converge to an equilibrium 2 1 2 implementation fullswof for full shallow water equations for overland flow is a free open source software gpl compatible licence that solves the shallow water equations and gives the evolution of a shallow layer of water in space and time delestre et al 2017 written in c it implements the finite volume numerical method it is developed by idp ex mapmo and inrae there exists a one dimensional version for one dimensional flows where the quantities such as the water height depend only on one space dimension x and time and a two dimensional version to simulate more general flows where functions depend on the two space dimensions x and y and time currently the transfer model framework 1 is integrated in the one dimensional version of fullswof fullswof 1d version 2 00 00 with a splitting method meaning that at each time step the evolution of the water is computed first giving the water height h and the water discharge q in space and then the transfer equations 1 are solved as implemented the transfer equations 1 could also be used as a library by another flow software in fact for any other software giving the evolution of water height and discharge as functions of time one can extract the resolution of the transfer model framework and make the coupling easily for details about the implementation see appendix a in the following the calculations are done using fullswof 1d the parameters files are not fully detailed here but are available in the source code repository of fullswof 1d https sourcesup renater fr projects fullswof 1d either in the benchmarks folder for bedload transport in river or in the examples folder for the other three cases 2 1 3 verification of proper functioning before doing comparisons with other physical models we perform an academic test to check the proper functioning of the software this is possible because we were able to write a nearly exact solution at each time and at each point for a given choice of parameters a software computing the solutions of the transfer equations 1 should return a good approximation of this solution under the corresponding conditions and the results should be improved when decreasing the space step we consider two sizes of particles inside the domain distributed in the flowing layer and in the exchange layer without any source and we let the system evolve in time we choose g i m k i m i with k 1 243 and k 2 0 3 ts 1 0 087 s and ts 2 7 17 10 4 s and a 1 we solve the system 3 hc 1 t qc 1 x 1 0 087 243 m 1 hc 1 m 1 t 1 0 087 243 m 1 hc 1 hc 2 t qc 2 x 1 0 000717 0 3 m 2 hc 2 m 2 t

stays constant as well as the water height and 4 c 1 t 0 x x 1 for 1 x 2 1 for 2 x 3 4 x for 3 x 4 0 elsewhere c 2 t 0 x x 1 5 for 1 5 x 2 0 5 for 2 x 3 3 5 x for 3 x 3 5 0 elsewhere and m 1 t 0 x hc 1 t 0 x k 1 m 2 t 0 x hc 2 t 0 x k 2 for the particle concentrations fig 4 summing the two equations for the same class of particles i the right hand sides cancel two by two see eq 2 and we get 5 hc i m i t qc i x 0 in our configuration as the ts i are small using an asymptotic development such as in james et al 2000 and lajeunesse et al 2018 one can prove that a good approximation of the solution is given by m i t x hc i t x k i and consequently c i t x c i t 0 x q h 1 k i t these theoretical approximations are useful to validate the code and to check the propagation velocities of the particles 2 2 erosion on an hillslope the hairsine and rose model 2 2 1 description hairsine et al 2002 described a model of hillslope erosion by rainfall for a set of particle sizes the model includes erosion deposition and reentrainment the eroded particles can be deposited forming a cohesive deposition layer this deposition layer can be eroded too hence the possible reentrainment built up on hairsine and rose 1991 and hairsine and rose 1992 the model of hairsine et al 2002 takes into account spatial variations such as varying slopes it is written as fig 2 6 hc i t qc i x r i r ri e i e di d i m di t d i r ri e di the variables h and q denote the water height and the discharge of the fluid respectively the equations are written considering n different classes of particle sizes denoted by the subscript i from 1 to n the c i term stands for the particle concentration in the fluid for the i th size class and m di for the mass of particles of size class i in the deposited layer per unit area the r i term is the rate of entrainment of the original soil r ri is the rate of reentrainment of the deposited layer the term e i is the rate of rainfall detachment of the original soil and e di is the rate of rainfall detachment of the deposited layer finally the term d i is the deposition rate explicit formulas are detailed in the next section and can be found in the original article this model was evaluated and confronted to experimental results obtained with a laboratory rainfall simulator on a bare soil and published in proffitt et al 1991 2 2 2 rewriting of the model of hairsine et al 2002 the hairsine and rose equations 6 can be rewritten in the form of the unifying transfer equations 1 the deposited layer of the hairsine and rose model is easily identified to the exchange layer of the transfer equations the terms r i and e i are source terms from the original soil while r ri e di and d i are exchange terms between the fluid and the exchange layer we obtain 7 hc i t qc i x r ri e di d i r i e i 1 ts i g i m hc i s i 1 a m i t d i r ri e di 1 ts i g i m hc i s i 2 with a 1 m i m di the mass of particles of the class i per unit area of the deposited layer s i 1 r i e i and s i 2 0 the source terms and the exchange is given thanks to the relation 1 t s i g i m hc i r ri e di d i more precisely the deposition term d i expresses as d i v i c i where v i is the settling velocity of the i th class of particles such that ts i h v i where we recall that h is the water height the r ri and e di terms are functions of m i the explicit formulas are given below and the function g i reads g i m ts i r ri e di following hairsine et al 2002 and sander et al 2007 the source and exchange terms can be written as 8 r i 1 h p i f j ω ω 0 e i 1 h p i ar p r ri h f gh ρ s ρ s ρ ω ω 0 m i m t e di ha d r p m i m t where p i is the proportion of particles in the size class i of the original i e uneroded soil f is the fraction of excess stream power effective in entrainment and reentrainment j is the specific energy of entrainment m t i 1 n m i is the total mass of particles in the deposited layer h is the fractional shielding of the underlying soil provided by the deposited layer h min 1 m t m t with m t the mass of deposited particles required to shield the original soil completely a is the detachability of the original soil a d is the detachability of the deposited layer ρ s and ρ are the particle and water densities respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity ω ρ gsq is the stream power s is the slope of the domain and q the water discharge and ω 0 the critical threshold stream power r is the rain intensity and p is an exponent that was evaluated to be close to unity proffitt et al 1991 in the following we take p 1 as a consequence the source term s i 1 is given by s i 1 1 h p i f j ω ω 0 ar p and the exchange function g i writes g i m hf gv i ρ s ρ s ρ ω ω 0 m t h v i ha d r p m t m i note that because there is no direct particle flux between the soil and the exchange layer in the model of hairsine et al 2002 the source term s i 2 equals zero 2 2 3 numerical comparison hogarth et al 2004 simulated the experiments of proffitt et al 1991 and specifically temporal changes in sediment concentrations along a flume according to proffitt et al 1991 the evolution of sediment concentrations is thought to be due to the development of a coarser deposited layer that shields an increasing fraction of the original soil surface until an equilibrium is achieved to numerically reproduce the experiments of proffitt et al 1991 hogarth et al 2004 propose a numerical model for rainfall driven erosion over a slope s 0 4 considering n 10 classes of particles uniformly distributed with a constant rain of r 100 mm h 1 they fit the values of 1 the detachabilities a and a d and of 2 the mass of deposited particles required to shield the original soil m t as their numerical solution is in good agreement with the experiments we take the same parameters as the ones they use they found the value of m t to be m t 0 0767 kg m 2 m t is larger than m t so h m t m t such that g i becomes a linear function as they also get an approximation of the water height as a linear function we choose to initialize our flow solver with this expression and let it evolve in time towards the equilibrium 2 3 bedload transport in rivers the model of lajeunesse et al 2013 2 3 1 description bedload transport results from the particle entrainment near the bed by a flow a model for the spreading of a plume of tracer particles in a river by bedload transport was proposed in lajeunesse et al 2013 for the case of a steady state transport over a flat bed of uniform particles they denote by n the number of particles in motion per unit bed area v the mean particle velocity t s the characteristic settling time of a particle and α 1 the ratio of mobile to immobile particles for steady state uniform particle transport erosion and deposition are balanced the erosion and deposition rates being the same both equal to n t s lajeunesse et al 2013 are interested in the evolution in time and space of a plume of marked particles tracers in their test case the tracers are initially immobile on the upstream part of the domain as they are entrained the tracers move downstream this phenomenon is modeled by the following system 9 ϕ t v ϕ x 1 t s ψ ϕ 1 α ψ t 1 t s ψ ϕ where ϕ is the proportion of marked particles in the moving layer and ψ is the proportion of marked particles on the bed surface 2 3 2 rewriting of the model of lajeunesse et al 2013 let us explain how to write the model of lajeunesse et al 2013 as a particular case of the unifying transfer equations 1 multiplying the two equations of system 9 by m g n where m g is the mass of one particle and n the number of particles in motion per unit bed area we get 10 c t v c x 1 ts α m c m t 1 ts α m c with c m g n ϕ and m m g n α ψ the mass concentration of mobile and immobile marked particles per unit bed area respectively note that these equations can also be written in a dimensionless form with the characteristic time t t t s and the characteristic space x x t s v 11 c t c x α m c m t α m c if we identify c hc g m α m s 1 s 2 0 and a 1 the bedload transport model of lajeunesse et al 2013 can be written in the form of the transfer equations 1 this clearly shows that the proposed transfer equations are really a unifying model framework 2 3 3 numerical comparison let us consider the tracer dispersion in bedload transport proposed by lajeunesse et al 2013 at the beginning of the experiment the tracers are only immobile particles located between 0 and 20 dimensionless distance the proportion of marked particles on the bed surface ψ being equal to 1 we denote by α the ratio of the surface concentration of moving particles to the concentration of static particles following lajeunesse et al 2013 we choose α equal to 0 3 we obtain an initial concentration of tracer immobile particles of 1 1 α ψ 0 77 fig 6 black line then we solve eqs 11 in terms of the variables ϕ and ψ the proportions of marked particles in the moving layer and on the bed surface respectively see the parameters file in the benchmarks folder of the software repository 2 4 chemical transport the model of gao et al 2004 2 4 1 description the considered material can be dissolved chemicals such as tracers pollutants nutrients etc this approach is studied in gao et al 2004 with a model that takes into account both raindrop driven processes and diffusion in the soil gao et al 2004 consider three different vertically distributed horizontal layers fig 3 the upper layer of height d w is the runoff or surface water ponding zone the exchange layer of height d e from which chemicals leave the soil and enter surface runoff the lower layer of height l d e is the soil where chemicals are transported by diffusion and infiltration they proposed the following model 12 d w c w t qc w x e r c e λ c w ic w for d w z 0 α d e c e t j e r λ c w c e i c w c e for 0 z d e α c s t z d s c s z ic s for d e z l with c s z 0 for z l and c s c e for z d e where the unknowns are the chemical concentrations c w is the chemical solute concentration in the runoff c e is the chemical solute concentration in the exchange layer and c s is the dissolved chemical concentration in the soil water the total chemical concentration in the soil is α c s where α is equal to the soil moisture in case of non adsorbed chemicals or takes into account a partition coefficient in case of adsorbed chemicals the variable j is the diffusion rate of solute from the soil at z d e and is given by fick s law 13 j d s c s z z d e the parameter i is the infiltration rate in the soil p is the rainfall rate q is the volumetric runoff flux per unit width d s is the dispersivity of chemicals in the soil and e r function of p is the rate of soil water feeded into the runoff as d s is very small compared to e r the diffusion between the exchange layer and the runoff is neglected finally λ between 0 and 1 is the proportion of chemical concentration c w entering the exchange layer λ 0 if there is only rainwater without chemicals and λ 1 if the water that enters in the exchange layer is only runoff through comparisons between experiments and numerical results gao et al 2004 show that their model reproduces well the experiments and can be fitted using only measured parameters i e without calibration 2 4 2 rewriting of the model of gao et al 2004 the model 12 of gao et al 2004 can be written as a particular case of the unifying transfer equations 1 the equation on c s the third equation of 12 can be considered as a secondary equation to be solved at each time step to obtain the value of the diffusion j the water height is d w which corresponds to the variable h and the water discharge is denoted by q in both models if we denote by m d e c e to get a concentration per surface unit and c c w we get 14 hc t qc x e r d e m λ e r i d w hc α m t e r d e m λ e r i d w hc j i d e m which takes the form of the transfer equations 1 with a α s 1 0 s 2 j i d

which fits their experiments they apply the crank nicolson finite difference scheme with a spatial discretization of 0 02 cm and a time step of 1 s to get c s as a function of z at each time step c e and c w can be computed easily at each time from the values at the previous time as their numerical results are in very good agreement with their experiments we consider them as the reference solution to be compared to the results of the unifying transfer equations as computed by fullswof 1d we reproduce the first experiment of gao et al 2004 taking their values of the parameters namely a rain intensity of 7 4 cm h 1 an initial concentration of cl in the soil and in the exchange layer of 29 82 g l 1 a water height of 7 mm a height of the exchange layer of 7 6 mm a bulk density of ρ b 1 5 g cm 1 a soil moisture of θ 0 37 α a soil erodibility of a 0 40 g cm 3 a soil diffusivity coefficient of 4 2 10 6 cm2 s 1 a parameter λ 1 and a raindrop chemical transfer rate of e r 2 1 10 4 cm s 1 3 results 3 1 verification of proper functioning as explained in section 2 1 3 we have an approximation of the exact solution for the unifying transfer equations in the case of two classes of particles without any source in fig 4 we compare the values of c and m for the two classes of particles with the numerical solution obtained by fullswof 1d see the parameters file in the examples sediment deposition folder of the repository the results are given at time t 8 s the values of m 1 are multiplied by 100 in order to display them within the same graph as m 2 values the approximation of the exact solution and the numerical solution are in good agreement note that we took 1000 cells in space i e the space step is equal to 1 cm to have a good precision if the number of cells is decreased the results get less accurate and the numerical errors accumulate with time 3 2 rainfall detachment and deposition in the context of rainfall driven erosion over a slope the experiments of proffitt et al 1991 were reproduced numerically by hogarth et al 2004 and now by the unifying transfer model framework in fig 5 we plot the total concentration of particles detached by the rain and suspended in the fluid as a function of space for several times fig 5a and at the output as a function of time fig 5b the numerical concentrations obtained with fullswof 1d and by hogarth s computations are in good agreement except for the first times t 5 min this discrepancy is due to the difference in the initial condition we start from flow conditions near the equilibrium and by solving the shallow water equations coupled with the hairsine and rose equations for the particles the steady state for the water flow is attained after some time while in their calculations hogarth et al 2004 consider the steady state for the flow and only solve the equation for the particles as explained in the description of the unifying transfer model framework section 2 1 1 it is not possible to catch a partial equilibrium of the complete system where the fluid is at a steady state but not the particles the global equilibrium can be attained only if the experimental conditions allow it in this experiment the solution at the first times namely on fig 5 for t 1 min is very dependent on the initial condition taken for the water height one can see on fig 5b that the coupled shallow water unifying transfer equations catches the first experimental point t 1 min in a much better way than hogarth et al 2004 while using the same parameters we can also note at the end of the experiment near the steady state that the results of hogarth et al 2004 are quite similar to the ones of the unifying transfer equations solved by fullswof 1d for large times the same system is solved in both cases the flow is at the equilibrium and the results are the same thus our approach can simulate both equilibrium and non equilibrium conditions 3 3 bedload transport in rivers the dispersion of tracer particles by bedload transport as proposed by lajeunesse et al 2013 was simulated using the unifying transfer model framework in fig 6 we plot the concentrations of tracer particles section 2 3 3 namely 1 1 α ψ and α 1 α ϕ against distance dimensionless to better see the particles and their actual behavior in the two layers mobile and immobile particles we decided to perform the same plot as in lajeunesse et al 2013 we plot 1 1 α ψ immobile particles and the sum 1 1 α ψ α 1 α ϕ to see the concentration of mobile particles above the immobile particles for all times t 100 700 and 1400 dimensionless the unifying transfer equations solved by fullswof 1d match exactly the results obtained by lajeunesse et al 2013 3 4 chemical transport an experiment of chemical transport with rain was simulated numerically by gao et al 2004 and now with the unifying transfer model framework in fig 7 we plot the solute concentration i e cl in the exchange layer and in the runoff layer corresponding to this experiment with the numerical approximation proposed by gao et al 2004 represented as cross marks fullswof 1d solves the shallow water equations and the unifying transfer equations with the same parameters and we choose a point of the domain to plot the evolution in time in both layers the concentrations as computed by the unifying transfer equations match very well the results of gao et al 2004 4 discussion the first point we want to underline in this discussion is the correctness of the results and the comparison with exact solutions the writing of a code from a set of equations that models physical phenomena can be affected by two types of errors either a bug or an issue in the numerical scheme used to solve the equations in both cases it negatively affects the results however this may easily go unnoticed assessing that the results are faithful to the equations is not a trivial task the use of quasi analytical solutions allows to verify the proper functioning delestre et al 2013 as shown in the present paper this approach has been applied successfully to the unifying transfer equations as implemented in fullswof 1d such a verification was previously carried out to check that fullswof 1d accurately solves the shallow water equations fullswof 1d is routinely tested via a benchmarking script using ten analytical solutions of the shallow water equations taken from the library swashes delestre et al 2013 following the implementation of the unifying transfer equations the exact solution of lajeunesse et al 2013 was added to the list of benchmarks these analytical solutions representing a diversity of flow conditions enable users and developers to assess the quality of the numerical results see https sourcesup renater fr projects fullswof 1d on the one hand they allow developers to check that code changes do not decrease the simulation quality on the other hand they allow users to check that fullswof 1d and the unifying transfer equations runs faithfully with their computer and compiler we believe such an approach should be carried out as a standard procedure before any scientific results be reported since different computer codes of the same model can lead to non identical results we strongly recommend that other implementations of the transfer equations are validated using exact solutions let us come now to the unifying transfer model framework proposed in this article for soil erosion by rainfall bedload transport in rivers and chemical transport the numerical results of the unifying transfer equations coupled to the shallow water equations are in good agreement with the results reported in the literature this clearly shows that the transfer equations are able to simulate soil erosion by rainfall bedload transport in rivers and chemical transport this underlines the unifying character of this model framework up to now to simulate within a catchment both soil erosion on hillslopes and bedload transport in rivers two set of equations had to be implemented together with their boundary conditions such as the boundary condition between hillslopes and rivers with the unifying transfer model framework both processes could be simulated within the same domain by the same computer code just by changing the parameters of the unifying transfer equations depending if the grid cells are within the hillslope or the river note that the current implementation of the transfer equations of fullswof 1d allows for a unique set of parameters within the domain the implementation of the unifying transfer equations in the 2d version of fullswof namely fullswof 2d see https sourcesup renater fr projects fullswof 2d will overcome this limitation in the case of soil erosion by rainfall our results are not the same as the ones of hogarth et al 2004 because the authors simplified the equations considering that one part of the model the fluid is at the equilibrium and not the other part the particles as a consequence the transitory evolutions towards the equilibrium are different while the same equilibrium is attained our numerical results outperform the results of hogarth et al 2004 because our implementation in fullswof 1d can simulate transitory states our approach is more complete giving the evolution of the physical system in time as well as the final steady state in the environment most of the processes are transitory steady states being more of an exception than a common case thus the capability to simulate transitory states should be a requirement for most of the computer codes the unifying transfer model framework could also simulate processes not considered in the present paper as long as they can be described as an exchange between two layers following the scheme of fig 1a while we show that the unifying transfer model framework is able to simulate soil erosion by rainfall bedload transport in rivers and chemical transport this set of equations may have application for other processes in the environment or in other fields of science our approach consisting in unifying various models from different fields of application opens up interesting horizons the same code can be used for different processes alleviating the need to develop a specific code for each process as detailed before this also makes the combined simulation of different processes easier finally for each specific problem the reader can identify the layers and the fluxes between the layers as represented in fig 1a and the corresponding parameters thus the physical meaning of the parameters is not lost in all the cases considered in this paper the relaxation term was linear leading to the advection of symmetric distributions of concentration e g fig 6 indeed lajeunesse et al 2018 showed that for this system the distribution of concentration tends asymptotically i e for long time to a gaussian curve for future works it would be interesting to investigate the physical relevance of non linear terms for hydrology as it has already been done for the field of chromatography james et al 2000 that will lead to asymmetric distribution of concentrations depending on the type of non linearity the front edge or the back edge of the concentration distribution could get sharper skewing the distribution thus the unifying transfer model framework could have an even wider range of applications than presently illustrated 5 conclusions a unifying framework was proposed to model different transfers between a fluid layer and the soil it is based on a general mass balance between the fluid layer and an exchange layer implemented in fullswof 1d its proper functioning was verified by comparison with a nearly exact solution this ascertained the adequacy of the computer programming based on three examples with various parameters and physical conditions the obtained results were similar to or better than those in the literature these examples covered three environmental transfer processes soil erosion on a hillslope bedload transport in rivers and chemical transport with rain and diffusion in the soil while these examples are usually simulated using apparently different models and completely different computer codes the unifying transfer model framework and the same computer code was able to simulate them this exemplifies the unifying character of the proposed transfer model framework the unifying transfer equations relate the evolution of the concentrations of particles or chemicals in a fluid and in an exchange layer they can account for several classes of particles or chemicals they are proposed as a unifying transfer model framework for soil erosion river bedload and chemical transport the unifying transfer equations could open new prospects to understand one model thanks to another and to use a single model framework for several processes credit authorship contribution statement amina nouhou bako conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

the numerical scheme for the homogeneous part of the first equation of 1 the right hand side terms and the second equation of 1 are added at the end this section the scheme described here is performed for each class i of materials one class after the other denoting by v hc i and f v uv q h v qc i the homogeneous part of the first equality of the transfer equations 1 reads a 1 v t f v x 0 the velocity u is the eigenvalue of system 1 we use a finite volume method to discretize eq a 1 over a 1d grid with a space step denoted by δ x and a time step denoted by δ t 1 1 the time and space steps must be adapted to the parameters of the system in particular they must be small if the values of ts i are small fig 8 the discrete time is t 0 0 t 1 t n t n 1 t n δ t with t 0 the initial time on the colored cell t n t n 1 x k 1 2 x k 1 2 the value of v is considered as constant and is denoted by v k n integrating eq a 1 over each space time cell we get the relation a 2 v k n 1 v k n δ t δ x f k 1 2 n f k 1 2 n where f k 1 2 n and f k 1 2 n are the approximations of the fluxes at the interfaces x k 1 2 and x k 1 2 respectively they depend on the values of v k n on the left and right boundaries of the cell denoted by v l n and v r n respectively a 1 spatial scheme at order 1 to compute the values of the f k 1 2 n and f k 1 2 n fluxes we choose the hll scheme harten lax van leer detailed in harten et al 1983 that was proved to be robust and simple delestre 2010 it is one of the fluxes already implemented in fullswof 1d for the hydrodynamic part for a given interface we denote by φ v l n v r n the numerical flux that reads a 3 φ v l n v r n f v l n if 0 c l c r f v l n c l f v r n c r c l c l c r c r c l v r n v l n if c l 0 c r f v r n if c r 0 where c l and c r are propagating speeds computed by the following formulas delestre et al 2014 a 4 c l min v l n v r n min u 0 c r max v l n v r n max u 0 the values of v l n and v r n are taken equal to the values of v in the neighbor cells and consequently the fluxes are approximated by f k 1 2 n φ v k 1 n v k n and f k 1 2 n φ v k n v k 1 n which means that the scheme is at order one in space a 2 spatial scheme at order 2 to improve the numerical scheme one can linearly reconstruct the variables v l n et v r n in order to obtain a second order scheme in space we choose muscl method introduced in van leer 1979 the variables are reconstructed using a piece wise linear function depending on the slope of each cell of the grid denoted by σ k n on each side of the interface located at x k 1 2 the reconstructed values are a 5 v k 1 2 l n v k n δ x 2 σ k n v k 1 2 r n v k 1 n δ x 2 σ k 1 n which gives f k 1 2 n φ v k 1 2 l n v k 1 2 r n and f k 1 2 n φ v k 1 2 l n v k 1 2 r n to assure the stability of the scheme one can compute three slopes from the neighbor cells with a 6 α k 1 v k n v k 1 n δ x α k v k 1 n v k 1 n 2 δ x α k 1 v k 1 n v k n δ x and compute σ k n as σ k n minmod α k 1 α k α k 1 where the minmod function is defined by a 7 minmod a b c min a b c if a b c 0 max a b c if a b c 0 0 else as described in delestre 2010 and godlewski and raviart 1996 a 3 second order in time in the previous eq a 2 we perform an euler scheme of order 1 in time to improve the accuracy of the scheme and get a second order in time we choose the heun method as it is also the one already implemented in fullswof delestre et al 2014 it is a predictor corrector method that computes first some predicted values v k and v k and then performs a correction step to obtain the value at the following time n

variables h and q hu are computed at time n by fullswof 1d and then are used by the transfer part to compute the concentrations c i and m i at time n 1 
8574,green roofs can be valuable components in sustainable urban drainage systems and hydrological models may provide useful information about the runoff from green roofs for planning purposes various models have been proposed in the literature but so far no papers have compared the performance of multiple models across multiple full size green roofs this paper compared 4 models the conceptual models urbis and swmm and the physically based models hydrus 1d and mike she across two field sites lyon france and umeå sweden and two calibration periods for each site the uncertainty and accuracy of model predictions were dependent on the selected calibration site and period overall model predictions from the simple conceptual model urbis were least accurate and most uncertain predictions from swmm and mike she were jointly the best in terms of raw percentage observations covered by their flow prediction intervals but the uncertainty in the predictions in swmm was smaller however predictions from hydrus were more accurate in terms of how well the observations conformed to probabilistic flow predictions mike she performed best in terms of total runoff volume in urbis swmm and hydrus uncertainty in model predictions was almost completely driven by random uncertainty while parametric uncertainty played a significant role in mike she parameter identifiability and most likely parameter values determined with the dream bayesian algorithm were found to be inconsistent across calibration periods in all models raising questions about the generalizability of model applications

introduction green roofs are an increasingly popular design feature in urban areas that can limit the increase in runoff peaks and volumes caused by urbanization e g carson et al 2013 while providing additional benefits for e g air quality e g tomson et al 2021 and building insulation e g susca 2019 the hydrology of green roofs has been studied both in full scale roofs for overviews see e g carson et al 2013 cipolla et al 2016 mentens et al 2006 and in purpose built test beds e g stovin et al 2012 factors that influence the hydrologic performance include substrate properties berretta et al 2014 fassman beck et al 2013 szota et al 2017 evapotranspiration cascone et al 2019 ebrahimian et al 2019 roof slope getter et al 2007 vegetation properties berretta et al 2014 and roof dimensions hakimdavar et al 2014 for example liu et al 2019 found based on irrigation lab experiments that substrate material was the most important factor influencing the runoff retention in green roofs followed by substrate depth roof slope and vegetation planning of new green roofs and drainage systems that include green roofs requires predictions of roof runoff e g palla and gnecco 2020 versini et al 2015 this interest has led several authors to propose models of varying complexity and levels of detail for specific green roofs regression equations e g carson et al 2013 fassman beck et al 2013 or unit hydrographs villarreal and bengtsson 2005 can be developed to quantify their long term performance on either an event basis or for longer periods mentens et al 2006 the downside of such approaches is that they remain site specific and thus might lack generality such simplified rainfall runoff relationships may not be directly applicable in forecasting contexts a different approach is represented by conceptual models i e simplified descriptions retaining a physical basis which have been proposed by several authors in the green roof context e g carbone et al 2014 herrera et al 2018 kasmin et al 2010 li et al 2019 locatelli et al 2014 rossman and huber 2016 she and pang 2010 sherrard and jacobs 2012 skala et al 2019 vesuviano et al 2014 some of these modelling approaches mainly focused on sub models for specific parts or processes of green roofs such as the drainage layer vesuviano and stovin 2013 and evapotranspiration feng and burian 2016 jahanfar et al 2018 one commonly used model for green roofs is the u s e p a storm water management model swmm which has had official support for green roofs since version 5 1 rossman and huber 2016 although green roofs could be simulated in older versions using the curve number approach or representing the green roof as a storage node in the drainage network alfredo et al 2010 attempts to model green roofs using the swmm bioretention cell module were successful in some cases burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 but not in others versini et al 2015 different studies have confirmed that the swmm green roof module added in version 5 1 is applicable to individual rainfall events e g hamouz and muthanna 2019 palla et al 2012 and over longer periods e g cipolla et al 2016 hamouz and muthanna 2019 krebs et al 2016 however further studies have also raised concerns about this software regarding e g the description of evapotranspiration feng and burian 2016 hamouz and muthanna 2019 peng and stovin 2017 the inability of calibrated parameters to be transferred to similar roofs in different locations johannessen et al 2019 and the use of a large number of parameters to which the modelling outputs are insensitive leimgruber et al 2018 similar considerations are likely to apply to some other conceptual models as well but have rarely been investigated in detail or reported another type of descriptions used for green roof modelling are physically based models mainly based on the richards equation operating most commonly in one i e the vertical dimension e g avellaneda et al 2014 hilten et al 2008 peng et al 2019 sims et al 2019 skala et al 2020 although two dimensional li and babcock 2015 palla et al 2009 or three dimensional brunetti et al 2016 descriptions have also been reported one frequently named advantage of physically based models is that parameter values represent physical characteristics which can be measured in situ e g de ville et al 2018b sims et al 2019 or in the lab e g brunetti et al 2016 peng et al 2020 however the representativeness of parameter values measured in the laboratory under controlled conditions has been questioned szota et al 2017 this finding raises concerns about whether laboratory measurements of model parameters may also be applicable for roofs that have already been built another concern is that different models may interpret the same physical parameter in different ways in the model equations an ideal model would be capable of reproducing the runoff from green roofs with different designs under different climatic conditions and for all times of the year in addition in an ideal situation models would be able to reliably predict runoff from green roofs without calibration e g when considering the implementation of new green roofs comparing multiple models using the same dataset may be one way of generating insights into shortcomings of and potential improvements to model structures that might help achieve this goal some studies have tried to identify the best performing models by applying multiple models to the same dataset carson et al 2017 found that the empirical curve number method and characteristic runoff equation performed slightly better 0 03 difference in nash sutcliffe efficiency nse than swmm for two full scale roofs however the site specific nature of these first two models is less appealing in practice and more complex models were not considered palla et al 2012 performed event based calibrations of a 16 22 m roof comparing a simple conceptual model consisting of three linear reservoirs with the mechanistic model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 both models closely reproduced the observed runoff hydrographs but the mechanistic model s predictions were somewhat more accurate by contrast soulis et al 2017 reported better performance for 2 1 m test modules for the conceptual swmm model than for hydrus 1d xie et al 2020 performed irrigation experiments on laboratory modules and found that hydrus 1d obtained a higher nse than swmm in calibration but worse scores for testing periods with higher rainfall intensities regarding runoff volumes and peak flows brunetti et al 2020 performed a detailed calibration study of a month long laboratory irrigation experiment with a 57 36 cm green roof module they found that a conceptual model and a relatively simple mechanistic model were equally suited to describe the hydrological behaviour of the test module while the use of more complex mechanistic models was not justified given the limited improvements in performance although these studies contributed to elucidate some aspects of modelling green roofs they might still present certain limitations first only one of them palla et al 2012 is based on an actual green roof and not purpose built lab or pilot modules dismissing aspects of real green roofs such as scale effects heterogeneity and non vertical water movement second the simulations were most commonly event based descriptions palla et al 2012 xie et al 2020 ignoring the processes that take place in the roof during dry periods and being sensitive to initial conditions brunetti et al 2020 did use a continuous simulation but their irrigation experiment only used block rainfalls of identical intensity which is not representative of the variability in natural rainfall and runoff from green roofs third the mentioned comparative studies brunetti et al 2020 palla et al 2012 soulis et al 2017 were all carried out under a mediterranean climate except xie et al 2020 who only simulated different rain intensities and ignored evapotranspiration so their conclusions might not be applicable to other climates fourth a number of the previous studies present a limited assessment of uncertainties in model parameters and predictions which might also have a significant influence in the conclusions thereby reported hydrological simulations of green roofs provided by reliable models seem to be an essential tool for the operation and design of these structures which ultimately encourages more sustainable urban drainage systems therefore the goal of this study is to propose a comparative evaluation of models of varying complexity from simple conceptual to mechanistic ones applied to two full scale green roofs with different physical layouts and in two different climates the models are compared under a context of continuous simulation assessing modelling uncertainties and accuracy by means of bayesian methods and monitored data of rainfall potential evapotranspiration and output flow rate from different time periods a formal bayesian calibration approach is used to estimate values of model parameters that fit best with the observed flow data including parameters that are not directly linked to observable characteristics of the green roof system or may be difficult to determine in situ while evaluating the inherent uncertainties in such estimates and the resulting uncertainties in the model predictions 2 methods 2 1 green roofs data sets for this study two green roofs were selected one in lyon france and one in umeå sweden representing different designs and different climate conditions the green roof in lyon was built in the congress centre of lyon france in 1995 and covers 280 m2 the roof is flat and consists of a 50 mm egg box shaped drainage layer underneath the substrate layer which has a depth varying between 40 and 140 mm and is planted with sedum outflows from both the substrate and the drainage layer join in a single drain in which discharge was measured using an electromagnetic flow meter krohne optiflux 2000 allowing to measure flow rates up to 330 l min 1 the specified accuracy of the flow meter depends on the flow value and varies from 2 9 at 10 l min 1 to 1 0 at 30 l min 1 i e for typical low and high flow rates for this roof rainfall was measured using a 0 2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge installed on the roof flow rate and rainfall measurements were reported with a constant one minute time step from september 2012 to may 2013 bertrand krajewski and vacherie 2014 other meteorological data temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure solar radiation and relative humidity were provided by the french national meteorological office météo france from the bron weather monitoring station located 9 km from the green roof the 2012 2013 green roof monitoring campaign was carried out for other objectives than model calibration and no local measurements of potential evapotranspiration were available the bron station is the closest station where daily measurements of potential evapotranspiration epot were also available therefore epot values were initially estimated on an hourly basis from temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure solar radiation and relative humidity records employing the penman monteith equation e g zotarelli et al 2010 these hourly epot values were further corrected to sum to the meteo france available total daily epot values considered as reference values afterwards hourly epot corrected values were linearly interpolated to a one minute time step principato 2015 the second roof was built in umeå sweden in 2014 and covers 2469 m2 a 25 mm drainage layer underlies a substrate layer whose depth varies between 42 and 80 mm with an average of 60 mm planted with a mixture of grass and sedum the original design depth of the substrate was 70 mm bg byggros ab 2018a the roof consists see fig 1 of 7 v shaped sections i e 14 sloped sections in total with half facing due north half facing due south that are angled between 15 and 38 in the narrow section of the roof a drain receiving flow from both the surface and the drainage layer is installed on either side of the roof at the bottom of the v in the wider section drains are installed at ¼ and ¾ of the total width each receiving flow from half of the v shaped section a network of pipes collects the water from these roof sections and from two small impervious roofs 169 m2 in total flow was measured using a 1 l tipping bucket for flow rates up to 25 l min 1 hyquest 2016 and an area velocity flow meter for higher flow rates teledyne isco 2010 the accuracy of the tipping bucket gauge was not quantified precisely but based on a flow rate dependent correction from the manufacturer hyquest 2016 and in situ checks of the volume per tip it is believed to be reasonably small previous laboratory tests of this model of area velocity sensor showed that the accuracy of the flow measurement is typically within 5 in the flow range of 120 540 l min 1 broekhuizen 2021 rainfall was measured using a 0 2 mm tipping bucket measurements were carried out from late 2017 to early november 2020 although some gaps were present in the data in addition periods influenced by snow fall or snow melt occurring as early as october and as late as may were excluded since they pose additional challenges outside the scope of this paper e g hamouz and muthanna 2019 evapotranspiration was calculated using the penman monteith equation and data from two stations from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute station 140 615 for solar radiation approx 2 7 km from the green roof and 140 480 for other data approx 1 1 km from the green roof for both sites two independent one month long periods were selected to calibrate and test different green roof models independent calibrations were undertaken for each period and then cross tested against the data for the other period this was done to test whether a model calibrated for a given period is usable for other periods with potentially different meteorological conditions for each site one period was selected that showed high variability among the retention rates for individual events while the other had similar total rainfall depth but with less varied retention for lyon the selected periods were november 2012 reporting low retention rates with a low inter event retention variability and april 2013 with high variability of the inter event retention rates for umeå the selected periods were from 9 september 2020 to 11 october 2020 reporting a high inter event retention variability hereafter referred to as just september and from 29 june 2020 to 28 july 2020 with low inter event retention variability hereafter july when analysing monthly time series including data from dry periods zero registered rainfall and flow rate values were found to represent the majority of the values however the inclusion of these zero registered values in the model calibrations might tend to favour the representation of low flow rate values penalizing the peaks of the hydrographs e g oliveira et al 2018 in addition the predictive capabilities of the models could also be overestimated during these dry periods since almost any model will predict no flow if it has not rained for some time on the other hand close to zero flow rate values during rainy periods can also represent valuable information about the model performance as models or parameter setups that predict flows when none occurred are not desirable therefore flow rate values lower than the detection limit of the measurement devices 0 79 and 2 l min 1 for lyon and umea resp were not considered in the calculations as long as no rainfall was registered within the preceding 15 min 2 2 hydrological models four models of varying complexity were selected for this study the model structures are shown visually in fig 2 and described in more detail in the sections below all models used in the study assume that flow through the substrate is vertical with lateral flow occurring on the surface and in the drainage layer the slopes of the roof in umeå may give rise to some lateral flow in the substrate however this is believed to play at most a minor role for a number of reasons first water input precipitation and output drainage from the substrate take places uniformly across the entire roof second the permeability of the geotextile separating the substrate from the drainage layer 90 mm hr 1 bg byggros ab 2018a bg byggros ab 2018b is higher than the observed rainfall intensities so the formation of a saturated layer on top of the geotextile i e in the bottom of the substrate is unlikely third the substrate is very thin compared to the length in the direction of the slope of the roof segments so water moving down through the substrate has little time to travel laterally before reaching the bottom of the substrate and the drainage layer fourth the thin substrate means that should the drainage layer capacity be exceeded the substrate will quickly become saturated at which point drainage outflow and surface runoff will be larger than lateral flow through the substrate for these reasons the assumption of only vertical flow in the substrate is considered appropriate in addition this is also the assumption most commonly used in green roof modelling studies and it is therefore appropriate here given that the study goal is to test existing models 2 2 1 urbis urbis is a scenario simulation and decision support tool aimed at simulating long term hydrological dynamics of different stand alone and interconnected stormwater control measures scms such as green roofs swales retention basins or permeable surfaces at the block and building scales this free software https deep insa lyon fr fr content urbis was developed in the python programming language by insa lyon france in collaboration with the companies nidaplast siplast and as2c sandoval et al 2019 the model is based on conceptual simplifications of these systems into a set of connected boxes or reservoirs that represent e g the storage zone or the substrate of each structure focusing on the case of green roofs the option alveolar flat green roof was chosen in urbis to model both the lyon and umeå green roofs urbis uses the term alveolar to refer to the egg box like layer of plastic compartments forming the bottom of the roof that allow for some storage volume and for drainage swmm uses the term drainage layer urbis was selected as an example of a simple conceptual model because computer code for it was already available and the authors were already familiar with it helping to avoid errors in the model setup other simple conceptual models have been proposed see section 1 and could be used as well but given the large number of available models it was not feasible to compare all models here in the following lines a brief description is given of this alveolar flat green roof modelling setup in urbis the potential evapotranspiration is calculated according to 1 e tot b season e pot where e tot is the total actual evapotranspiration e pot is a user supplied potential evapotranspiration time series e g calculated using the penman monteith equation and default values of the coefficient bseason are 0 5 for winter and 1 for summer evapotranspiration from the alveolus layer to the substrate is calculated from the following equations 2 e dr min b dr e tot d dr 3600 δ t 3 b dr d dr ϕ dr d dr η where bdr is a fraction of the potential evapotranspiration that is available for the drainage alveolus layer d dr is the current water stored in the alveolus layer since alveolus layers in urbis are similar to drainage layers in swmm the subscript dr is used for both d dr is the drainage layer thickness 50 mm for lyon and 25 mm for umeå and ϕ dr is the void index of the layer structure set as a calibration parameter for the case of lyon and as a fixed value of 0 54 for umeå based on available information from the manufacturer bg byggros ab 2019 the coefficient η describes the relationship between water level in the alveolus layer and movement of water from the alveolus layer to the substrate see next paragraph furthermore evapotranspiration from the substrate e sub to the atmosphere is calculated according to 4 e sub e dr d dr 0 m i n e tot θ d sub 3600 δ t d dr 0 where d sub is the substrate depth and θ the current water content of the substrate d sub was set to 60 mm for umeå and it was established as a calibration parameter for the green roof in lyon given the high variability of this value reported from in situ measurements for the studied green roofs no evapotranspiration or re humidification occurs from the alveolus layer to the substrate and no storage exists in the drainage layer during dry periods this was explicitly considered in urbis by setting η 10000 a very high value to make b dr equal to zero eq 3 leading to set e dr 0 eq 2 indeed this conduces to cancel the water transfer from the alveolus drainage layer to the substrate leading to estimations of e sub eq 4 only dependent on the potential evapotranspiration and the substrate water content θ eq 4 allows evapotranspiration to occur up to the potential rate but reducing when the substrate moisture contents becomes low the maximum storage capacity of the substrate c sub is calculated as follows 5 c sub θ fc θ wp d sub where θ fc and θ wp are the field capacity and wilting point of the substrate respectively the wilting point was set to urbis default value θ wp 0 05 and θ fc was established as a calibration parameter for both green roofs if inflow into the substrate exceeds c sub saturation of the substrate the excess water l from the saturated substrate transferred to the alveolus drainage layer is calculated as follows 6 l max θ d sub 3600 δ t p e sub e dr c sub 3600 δ t 0 if the maximum storage capacity of the alveolus layer is reached the excess becomes overflow q ov and if the maximum storage of the substrate is reached any excess water on the surface of the substrate becomes runoff q sur this alveolar structure can also include a controlled outflow aimed to simulate the output flows from the roof delivered to the pipe system this flow rate q dr is then calculated by an orifice equation as follows 7 q dr r u a reg 2 g d dr where r u is a coefficient set to 0 6 by default in urbis the area of the regulation orifice a reg was set as a calibration parameter because a reg is normally calculated in the software based on the design flow rate to be delivered from the roof to the drainage system which was unknown in this case it was not possible to calculate a reg directly since conceptually the value of the parameter refers to an orifice in the wall of a tank while in the actual system the opening was a drainage outlet in the bottom of the roof the regulation orifice is set to be located at the bottom of the alveolar layer in order to avoid stormwater storage in the drainage layer during dry periods as neither roof was designed for this purpose the roof runoff that was studied in this paper is the sum of q dr q ov and q sur 2 2 2 swmm swmm v 5 1 013 rossman and huber 2016 is a conceptual model that still relies on some physically based parameters and process descriptions swmm is commonly used in both research and practice and it is therefore of particular interest to evaluate its capabilities a short description of the main process equations is given below for details see rossman and huber 2016 infiltration is represented using the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 8 i k s 1 θ s θ top d s u r ψ ga j where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity θ s the saturated water content θ top the water content of the top layer of the soil d sur the depth of water on the surface ψ ga the soil suction head at the wetting front and j the accumulated infiltration volume during the rainfall event the percolation of water from the substrate layer to the drainage layer is described by darcy s law 9 l k s e γ θ s θ where γ is a calibration parameter describing the change of conductivity as a function of soil moisture content and θ is the current substrate moisture content percolation is disabled if θ θ fc surface runoff is described using manning s equation 10 q sur 1 n m w ϕ sur d sur d sur 5 3 where n is manning s roughness coefficient m and w the slope and width of the roof ϕ sur the void fraction of the surface i e fraction of volume not filled by plants and d sur the depression storage flow in the drainage layer is also described using manning s equation 11 q dr 1 n dr m w ϕ dr d d r 5 3 with n dr a separate manning s coefficient ϕ dr the void fraction of the drainage layer and d dr the water depth in the same layer evapotranspiration takes place at the user supplied potential rate e pot using first any water available on the surface the evapotranspiration is labelled e sur then from the substrate labelled e sub and finally from the drainage layer labelled e dr the roof runoff that was studied in this paper is the sum of q dr and q sur the roof in lyon was represented as a single green roof for umeå the individual roof sections were included as individual sub catchments with individual green roofs so that the dimensions and slope of each section could be input directly the pipe network was included explicitly in the swmm model although it had a negligible influence on the output of the model the small impervious roof areas in umeå were simulated only in swmm the calculated flow was added to the total outflow from the roof in the other models in this way the impermeable roof sections were treated the same way in all models and not subject to any calibration following the scope of the paper 2 2 3 hydrus 1d hydrological modelling of the studied green roofs is also simulated by using the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2018 two and three dimensional versions of hydrus also exist but in this paper we refer to hydrus 1d as simply hydrus this model describes one dimensional vertical water movement using richards equation 12 θ ψ t z k ψ ψ z 1 h where k ψ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of the tensiometer pressure potential ψ z is the vertical coordinate positive upward and h is a sink term representing evaporation and root water uptake the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties can be simulated in hydrus with six different models in this study the van genuchten and mualem model is adopted van genuchten 1980 as in similar green roof modelling settings e g brunetti et al 2020 the van genuchten relationships can be written as 13 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ β μ ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 14 k ψ k s s eff λ 1 1 s eff 1 μ μ 2 15 s eff θ θ r θ s θ r where θ r and θ s are the residual and the saturated water content of the soil ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and s eff is the effective saturation α related to the inverse of the air entry suction β pore size distribution λ tortuosity and μ 1 1 β dimensionless are fitting parameters of the soil water retention curve coarse grained soils have a high value of α and β whereas fine textured soils have a lower α and β rassam et al 2018 β is used instead of the more common symbol n to avoid confusion with manning s coefficient at the surface of the substrate the boundary condition bc atmospheric bc with surface run off was applied where observed time series of precipitation and evapotranspiration are used by the model ψe denotes the minimum surface pressure head at which actual evapotranspiration can still take place at the potential rate epot below this value soil moisture availability limits the actual evapotranspiration ψe was set to a fixed value of 300 000 mm brunetti et al 2016 since evapotranspiration parameters were not calibrated in any of the other models a constant pressure head bc was applied at the bottom of the substrate for this case the pressure head at the bottom node ψinit bot is set constant and equal to the value given by the initial conditions at the bottom of the substrate this ψinit bot value was included as a calibration parameter it is worth clarifying that alternative bcs at the bottom of the substrate have been applied for modelling green roofs with hydrus namely the free drainage palla et al 2012 hakimdavar et al 2014 or seepage face brunetti et al 2016 bcs the constant pressure head bc was selected because it was found to have better performance compared to the two mentioned alternatives by peng et al 2019 and in initial calibration runs using the data sets from this paper the initial conditions for every model run were linearly interpolated from a typical pressure head of 3000 mm brunetti et al 2016 at the top of the substrate to the provided ψinit bot parameter value at the bottom this approach aimed to maintain similar initial conditions for all model runs and to avoid numerical problems related to zero valued or abruptly changing vertical gradients in addition a 14 day warming up period was applied to reduce furthermore the effect of these initial conditions on the results the python library phydrus phydrus readthedocs io was used as interface to hydrus in the calibrations collenteur et al 2020 the egg box like drainage layers in the roofs do not have a suitable physical representation in hydrus so it was not included for this model in any of the studied roofs 2 3 mike she the physically based model mike she version 2019 not updated dhi 2019a 2019b was selected as a more extensive mechanistic model newer versions of mike she were not used since they produced identical results but with approximately double model runtimes the model uses a regular rectangular grid 1 m grid spacing was used here and vertically discretizes the unsaturated zone into a user specified number of cells here 1 cm cells were used overland flow across the grid cells is described using the saint venant equations using the diffusive wave approximation where mannings coefficient describes the friction from the surface note that mike she uses the inverse of manning s n used in swmm richards equation see eq 12 is used to describe vertical flow in the unsaturated zone different options are available for the hydraulic conductivity function for reasons of numerical stability the averjanov equation was used here 16 k θ k s θ θ r θ s θ r v where θ r is the residual soil water content and v a calibration coefficient v is used instead of the more common symbol n to avoid confusion with manning s coefficient the relation between ψ and θ is expressed by calibrating saturated moisture content θ s corresponding to a pressure head ψ 10 mm and θ fc ψ 103 mm while the wilting point moisture content θ wp ψ 104 2 mm was fixed at 0 1 and the residual moisture content θ r ψ 106 mm at 0 02 intermediate values were linearly interpolated between adjacent points the use of classical hydraulic conductivity curves e g van genuchten 1980 was avoided since first calibration runs showed that this sometimes led to failed model runs or very long model run times which made it infeasible to perform calibrations in a reasonable amount of time the egg box like drainage layers in the roofs do not have a suitable physical representation in mike she initial attempts to model the drainage layers using she s saturated zone module were unsuccessful a simple conceptual drainage function is thus used 17 q dr d dr r dr a cell where d dr is the hydraulic head in the saturated zone and r dr a calibrated constant and a cell the horizontal area of a single cell in the model domain drainage is calculated for each cell individually since d dr varies spatially and then summed to obtain the drainage outflow for the entire model domain the roof runoff that was studied in this paper is the sum of q dr and the overland flow q sur across the model boundaries to decrease model runtime symmetry in the roofs was used to reduce the size of the simulation domain in lyon half the roof was simulated and the resulting flow multiplied by 2 in umeå one half of the narrow roof section was simulated i e the contributing area for one of the two drains installed at the edge and one quarter of the wider part of the roof i e the area contributing to a roof drain from one side since drains were installed at ¼ and ¾ of the total width see fig 1 2 4 calibration approach all tested models were calibrated for the selected sites and calibration periods using the bayesian algorithm dream zs laloy and vrugt 2012 as implemented in the python package pydream shockley et al 2018 and with the following log likelihood function 18 l n 2 ln 2 π i 1 i n ln σ i i 1 i n q obs i q sim i 2 2 σ i 2 where n is the number of observations qobs is the observed flow qsim is the simulated flow from the hydrological model and σ is the standard deviation of the distribution which needs to be established during calibration since it is expected that this standard deviation will be higher for larger flows i e the errors show heteroscedasticity it was parameterized following ammann et al 2019 19 σ i σ 0 σ 1 q sim i c where σ 0 and σ 1 are calibration parameters for this study c was set to 0 5 to limit the expansion of σ for high flows as preliminary runs showed it becoming so large that the simulated runoff underestimated peak flows to an undesirable extent while still obtaining good likelihood values due to the large σ this approach was also used in earlier research for natural catchments to improve the performance of model predictions mcinerney et al 2017 more complex likelihood functions that account for bias skew and autocorrelation of the residuals are an on going topic of research e g ammann et al 2019 evin et al 2013 mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 schoups and vrugt 2010 wani et al 2017 however there are as of yet no universal recommendations on what more complex likelihood functions are applicable in what conditions problems have been reported with accounting for autocorrelation at the short time steps common in urban hydrology métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 and for natural catchments it has been reported that accounting for autocorrelation can produce worse predictions especially for dry catchments evin et al 2014 schoups and vrugt 2010 with which urban catchments share some similarities in this light it was preferred to use a relatively simple likelihood function in this study for comparison the assumptions of normality and independence of the residuals were also employed in earlier green roof modelling work brunetti et al 2020 calibration parameters and prior ranges i e the minimum and maximum allowed values are given in table 1 for the green roof in lyon the maximum substrate depth in the calibration range of dsub was increased from 140 mm to 175 mm in order to include the remaining substrate at the inner part of the egg box drainage which could represent a higher storage capacity than in situ measurements 2 5 probabilistic predictions of roof outflow a successful calibration with dream results in a sample of parameter sets that form a representative set of samples of the joint parameter posterior distribution the hydrological model output q sim for each of those parameter sets is available for each observation time step this ensemble of hydrological model outputs can be summarized by a confidence bound here the 90 central bound was used to visualize the predicted outflow over time and the uncertainty that arises from uncertainty in the estimates of the hydrological model parameters in addition the total uncertainty parametric model structure uncertainty see e g kuczera et al 2006 can be visualized stochastic model outputs q stoch are sampled from a normal distribution where the mean is the hydrological model output for a parameter sample q sim and the flow dependent standard deviation is given by eq 19 any negative flow values are set to zero the resulting ensemble of stochastic model outputs is again summarized using the 90 confidence bound at each observational time step thus visualizing total uncertainty 2 6 model evaluation criteria 2 6 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is calculated using 20 nse 1 i 1 i n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 i n q obs i q o b s 2 where q sim is the flow for the parameter sample with the highest posterior probability map and q o b s the mean of all flow observations 2 6 2 volume error the volume error ve is calculated as 21 ve q sim q obs q obs 100 where q sim and q obs are the simulated map and observed flow volumes calculated taking into account the non constant time steps between observations in the data from umeå where a tipping bucket was used for measuring low flow rates section 2 1 2 6 3 reliability for perfectly reliable probabilistic model predictions i e probability distributions the actual observations should be proportionately distributed across the corresponding predictive distributions i e with more observations in the peak s of the predictive distributions and fewer observations falling in the tails of the predictive distributions this can be checked by first calculating for each observation where it falls along the cumulative distribution function cdf of the predictions for the same time step i e resulting in a value in the interval 0 1 then if the observations are appropriately distributed across the predictive distributions all the cdf values together should follow a uniform 0 1 distribution this can be measured by the distance between the cdfs of a u 0 1 distribution and of the observed distribution of cdf values if this is evaluated at each observation s cdf value it results in the following metric for reliability ammann et al 2019 evin et al 2014 22 ω rel 1 2 n 1 i 1 i n f qi q obs i f ζ f qi q obs i where f ζ is the empirical cumulative distribution function of f qi q obs i i 1 2 n i e the set of the cdf values of the observations for all time steps i this value can vary from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates perfect reliability 2 7 relative spread of model predictions the precision of model predictions based either on parametric or total uncertainty can be measured by the spread of the predictions relative to the observed flows ammann et al 2019 mcinerney et al 2017 23 ω spread i 1 i n σ q i i 1 i n q obs i where σ q i is the standard deviation of the ensemble of runoff predictions at time step i generally a smaller spread is desirable as it means model predictions are more precise i e less uncertain although increased precision may come at the cost of reduced reliability 3 results 3 1 posterior parameter distributions the marginal posterior distributions pd hereafter of the model parameters are shown in fig 3 for lyon and fig 4 for umeå since uniform prior distributions were used the prior distribution is simply a horizontal line if no information is gained about a certain parameter in the calibration period the posterior distribution will be the same as the prior and the parameter is considered non identifiable from the data the more information about suitable values for a parameter is gained in calibration i e the more identifiable it is the more its pd will diverge from a horizontal line moving instead towards a single peak parameters that showed to be well identifiable in all calibrations were the field capacity θfc and porosity θs γ swmm only van genuchten s α λ β hydrus drainage parameters ndr in swmm ψinit bot in hydrus r s in she and the error model parameters σ0 and σ1 the only parameter which remained practically unidentifiable in all calibrations was the void index of the drainage layer ϕdr in lyon for urbis not calibrated in umeå since it was known from manufacturer s information for the other parameters the identifiability was found to be site and calibration period dependent the information content of the different calibration periods for each site can be compared using the kullback leibler divergence from the prior to the posterior this value is indicated for each individual parameter in figs 3 and 4 the sum of the values for all parameters in each calibration is given in table 2 for umeå the september calibration period was the most informative for all four models and for lyon the april period was the most informative these periods were selected section 2 1 because they include high variability in the retention of the individual rainfall events indicating that this may be a useful method for identifying suitable calibration periods although this assumption would need to be verified for additional sites in some cases the parameter posterior distributions collapse towards the boundaries imposed in calibration e g for θfc and θs the drainage constant tdr in she and ks in swmm umeå only in these cases it could be considered to extend the prior range but this was not implemented because the bounds of these parameters aimed to retain a physically realistic representation 3 2 predictive uncertainty the model predictions i e central 90 confidence bounds showing both parametric and total uncertainty for the calibration phase are shown in fig 5 for lyon and fig 6 for umeå uncertainties in urbis swmm and hydrus seemed to be driven by the uncertainties related to the model structure as parametric uncertainty narrow dark grey band presented a minor contribution to the total predictive uncertainty average of 2 7 of the total uncertainty for she the contribution of parametric uncertainty was larger 24 of the total predictive uncertainty on average in rainfall events with multiple peaks and troughs e g the event on may 2nd 3rd in lyon the total uncertainty bounds in urbis did not follow the same pattern of peaks and troughs while the other models managed to capture these patterns with their narrower uncertainty bounds for several events especially in lyon runoff from hydrus started too early and initial peaks in the hydrograph were also sometimes overestimated see e g the events in lyon on april 27th and november 26th for the first events in each period this could be possibly related to the initial conditions of the model run despite using a 14 day warmup period but this seems unlikely as the issue still occurs later in the simulation period e g on november 26th in lyon considering the testing phase fig 7 for lyon fig 8 for umeå the wider hydrological parameter uncertainty bounds in she stood out especially for the april period in lyon and the september period in umeå where they formed most of the total uncertainty bound on two occasions around october 7th 00 00 and around october 9th 12 00 the uncertainty bounds are much wider than for other similar flow rates and driven completely by the hydrological parameter uncertainty this behaviour may be partially related to some numerical problems encountered in she see section 3 3 urbis completely missed one small event in umeå july 23rd and two modest to large events in lyon november 4th and 8th but otherwise the uncertainty bounds behaved similarly to the calibration phase swmm had some problems where it over or underestimated flow at the start of events in lyon the problem with hydrus predicting too high runoff early in some rainfall events that was present in the calibration phase persisted in the testing phase the predictive performance of the models is summarized in table 3 she had the largest relative spread i e the widest uncertainty bounds of flow predictions resulting from uncertainty in the hydrological model parameters alone but urbis had the largest total uncertainty with swmm uncertainties being the smallest parametric uncertainty relative to the observations was small for urbis swmm and hydrus 0 03 but somewhat larger for she 0 14 on average total uncertainty was smallest in swmm followed by hydrus she and finally urbis predictive uncertainty in she was driven by uncertainty in hydrological model parameters to a greater extent 24 in calibration 32 in testing than in urbis 2 in both swmm 3 and 8 respectively and hydrus 7 in calibration 3 in testing the agreement between the probabilistic model predictions total uncertainty and the observations was measured using the reliability metric see eq 20 and the percentage of observations falling inside the 90 prediction interval reliability varied between the different sites and calibration periods urbis was the most reliable model in lyon in april and a close second to hydrus in november but the least reliable in umeå reliability of swmm and she was similar for the different calibration scenarios hydrus had the highest reliability overall 0 80 on average although it did not score well 0 61 in umeå september in testing reliability was lower than in calibration for urbis from 0 73 to 0 60 swmm 0 74 to 0 72 and she 0 77 to 0 73 but hydrus had the same average reliability as in the calibration phase 0 80 in terms of the percentage of observations captured by the total uncertainty bounds the models showed generally good performance with 13 out of 16 calibrations capturing 90 of the observations in the 90 confidence bounds of the predictions in testing the percentage cover was somewhat lower reaching 90 for only 6 out of 16 calibrated models swmm hydrus and she still consistently exceeded 80 observation cover while for urbis this varied from 72 to 83 the nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated for the map parameter set gives an overall indication of the goodness of fit of the model the july period in umeå shows relatively low scores in both calibration and testing for all models suggesting that some processes were not properly accounted for by any of the studied models or that there may be some issue with the data in this period the nse for swmm and she was generally high 0 9 in calibration 0 8 in testing except for she in the july period in umeå 0 6 urbis had worse performances in this metric 0 8 in calibration 0 7 in testing performance for hydrus was rather variable ranging in calibration from 0 51 umeå july to 0 91 umeå september and in testing from 0 03 umeå september to 0 84 umeå july nse for hydrus in lyon was always low compared to swmm and she these relatively poor nse scores for hydrus can be linked to occasional issues with reproducing flow rates in the beginning of the events discussed above and visible in figs 5 8 finally the volume errors calculated for the map parameter set indicate how well the models approximate the water balance in the roof during the simulations for lyon swmm and she showed good performances 8 error in calibration 17 in testing urbis had similar performances in calibration 8 and 10 for april and november respectively but considerably larger errors in testing 33 in april and 42 in testing volume error for umeå was rather high across all models in calibration only she had acceptable errors 7 with larger errors for swmm up to 24 in july hydrus 28 in july and urbis 52 in july in testing volume errors were generally large 20 note that volume errors in one part of the record may be compensated by errors in the other direction in another part of the record so the volume error is primarily an indication of model bias and should not be interpreted without considering other performance indicators 3 3 computational requirements and errors the practical value of a model depends in part on its computational demands the runtime for the various calibrations is therefore given in table 4 runtimes were up to 10 times longer for the more complex she model than for the simpler urbis and swmm for swmm and urbis run times were similar although it should be pointed out that urbis has not been optimized to the same degree as the other models and it may therefore be possible to lower its runtime further although both she and hydrus use the computationally intensive richards equation for unsaturated zone flow the fact that hydrus operated in only one dimension i e simulating just a single vertical profile compared to 600 profiles in she meant that this model was still 2 3 times faster than she in addition to the pure computational time the numerical stability of the models can also affect their applicability urbis directly showed good convergence of the markov chains in calibrations while some further experiments were required in swmm and hydrus to ensure good performance of the calibration algorithm on the other hand two types of major numerical problems were encountered with she first the markov chains of the dream algorithm sometimes got stuck in a state with a relatively high likelihood value where even small proposed jumps would have a much lower likelihood value which led to a systematic rejection of all the proposals for example in one such state changing only θs by 10 5 reduced the probability of accepting the new point to effectively zero this unexpected behaviour can be attributed to numerical instability of the she model that may be associated with the model s origin in natural catchment modelling rather than green roofs i e with larger time steps and spatial scales it was therefore necessary to include an additional step in the calibration where the likelihood would be re evaluated with a very small perturbation to the parameter values and the new likelihood value used in evaluating the acceptance probability second the dependence between model numerical stability and parameter values meant that some of the parameter samples from the calibration period resulted in an abnormal termination of the model when applied to the testing period specifically after calibrating the she model for umeå for the july period 45 of the obtained parameter samples resulted in failed model runs i e the simulation either stopped prematurely or got completely stuck when applied in testing to the september period the same happened with 0 5 of the samples from the lyon november calibration no such errors occurred in the other models 4 discussion 4 1 parameter consistency and identifiability in an ideal model where the structure adequately describes the green roof processes and model parameters describe physical aspects of the system model parameters are expected to be stationary i e independent of the selected calibration period this property can be defined as parametric consistency thyer et al 2009 however some changes over time have been reported for physical properties of green roofs de ville et al 2018a 2017 which could be reflected in some of the model parameters further parametric identifiability can be defined as the amount of information obtained while updating the parameters prior distribution to the posterior distribution pd during the calibration process for the case study these properties of consistency and identifiability were unsatisfactory for various parameters in all of the models and for both sites see figs 3 and 4 this is an indication that the four models still suffer from inadequacies in their representations of all physical processes in green roofs the dependence of parameter pds on the selected calibration period lack of consistency can be interpreted as evidence that parameter values are dependent not just on physical characteristics of the green roof but also on the meteorological conditions the dependence of parameter values on meteorological conditions may have also played a role in an earlier study johannessen et al 2019 where it was found that calibrated parameter values for one site gave poor model performance when applied to a roof with the same design in a different location however other factors e g vegetation which will always have some dependence on local the meteorological conditions may have also played a role in that study the variability of estimated parameter values from different calibration periods implies that models might deliver different results when applied to new periods or for forecasting this is already visible to some extent in the testing phase where model predictions are less accurate compared to calibration results the fact that parameter values obtained for the different calibration periods differ as much as they do raises the question of what the impact of this will be when the meteorological differences between the calibration period and the prediction period become larger e g when models are used to forecast the behaviour of green roofs under climate change scenarios e g karlsson et al 2016 the identifiability of parameter values was previously investigated by brunetti et al 2020 in an experiment with a green roof module in a climate chamber as in the current paper they found that soil porosity θs was well identifiable using outflow measurements for both conceptual and mechanistic models they also found that both the identifiability and the optimal values i e the parameter values with the maximum posterior likelihood map depended on the type of calibration data used substrate water content outflow or tracer transport the results from this paper provide evidence that these values are further dependent on properties of the specific calibration period chosen e g different meteorological and vegetation conditions identifiability of model parameters is related to the model s sensitivity to changes in the values of parameters which was previously investigated for swmm in a sensitivity analysis rather than a calibration context by leimgruber et al 2018 for example they found that substrate depth and porosity were the most sensitive parameters which is confirmed by their high identifiability see figs 3 and 4 by contrast leimgruber et al reported low sensitivity of field capacity and γ called conductivity slope in their paper but in our results the identifiability of field capacity was site dependent while γ was well identifiable in all cases furthermore they reported that hydraulic conductivity was almost completely insensitive but this parameter was nonetheless well identifiable in all calibrations except november in lyon the green ampt suction head was identifiable in umeå more so for september than july despite being reported as an insensitive parameter by leimgruber et al most notably they also reported that the manning s coefficient for the drainage layer was completely insensitive unidentifiable while this parameter was identifiable in all calibrations for both field sites in this study compared to the other models urbis uses a relatively simple structure with fewer calibration parameters which can explain the good identifiability of the model parameters in all calibrations except for the drainage layer void index in lyon however as stated in similar calibration settings within the hydrological context thyer et al 2009 parametric consistency for highly identifiable parameters is more likely to be unsatisfactory as the posteriors delivered from different calibration periods are less likely to overlap higher parametric identifiability at the expense of the lack of consistency besides from urbis is also appreciable for almost all parameters in swmm and hydrus in the umeå site and to a lower extent for the parameters n dr in swmm d sub in she and ψ init bot in hydrus in lyon complementarily the observed stability and rapid convergence of the markov chains in bayesian calibrations for urbis may also be related to the high parameter identifiability and lower complexity of the inference given the lower number of parameters used to by this model 4 2 physical interpretation of parameter values the differences in identifiability and low consistency that was found for parameters included in multiple of the studied models e g substrate depth lyon and porosity in all models manning s coefficient depression storage field capacity for swmm and she saturated hydraulic conductivity in all models except urbis can be considered a further indication that model parameters are not exclusively representing the variability of the physical characteristics that they are aimed to represent the obtained parameter map values also raise some questions for swmm both calibration periods and hydrus september only in umeå the pd of the hydraulic conductivity ks was concentrated towards the minimum value allowed in calibration this minimum was set based on literature values for natural soils rawls et al 1983 but it is rather low compared to values reported for green roof substrate peng et al 2020 this could be an unexpected result of the calibration process e g compensating for some other parameter or some process not well accounted for in the model or it may indicate that laboratory measurements of ks are not necessarily indicative of effective field values the latter could for example depend on the effects of vegetation compaction and aging of the substrate e g de ville et al 2017 or the lower permeability of the geotextile separating the substrate from the drainage layer reported as 90 mm hr 1 by the manufacturer bg byggros ab 2018b unrealistic calibrated values of green roof model parameters have been found in earlier studies as well avellaneda et al 2014 even in carefully controlled laboratory experiments brunetti et al 2020 the current study provides further evidence that calibrated parameters for even rather detailed green roof models may not be exclusively linked to physical characteristics of the system it is not completely clear why different models results in different estimates of the same parameter but some potential explanations can be found by examining the model structures saturated hydraulic conductivity k s is also estimated differently for the three models that include it one aspect that may influence this is that the models used k s for different calculations hydrus used van genuchten s model and she used the averjanov equation to describe unsaturated hydraulic conductivity while swmm used k s to calculate both infiltration green ampt equation and percolation to the drainage layer darcy equation these equations all have different forms which may be part of the reason why the estimated values of ks differ between the models the maximum storage capacity of the green roofs depends on the substrate thickness d sub and the saturated moisture content θ s but these parameters also calibrated to different values in the different models this may be explained by the fact that the models were calibrated against only outflow data while the relationship between outflow and current water storage is different across the models in addition for swmm and urbis part of the difference in maximum water storage capacity may instead be represented by the storage in the drainage layer this separate compartment does not exist in the other two models in swmm and she the estimates for manning s coefficient n and n she respectively are remarkably similar keeping in mind that n she is the inverse of n so the regions of highest likelihood peaks in the distribution for the september calibration in umeå are actually around the same value the depression storage is not well identifiable for either model in lyon while in umeå the values are somewhat different which may be related to the differences in maximum substrate storage capacity between the two roofs 4 3 predictive uncertainty in calibration all models included close to or more than 90 of observations in the 90 confidence intervals of the model predictions the relative spread of the model predictions was however lower in swmm making its predictions more precise in testing the performance was only slightly lower for swmm hydrus and she while the relative spread of the predictions was the same for urbis the prediction bounds were slightly narrower than in calibration but still larger than the other models but at the cost of lower coverage of the observations 78 the larger uncertainty bounds and lower cover in urbis suggest that the model contains the highest structural deficiencies in attempting to capture the main dynamics of the hydrological process for the studied green roofs this is also confirmed by the lower nash sutcliffe values overall swmm and she had similar performances and which one performed better depended on the calibration site and period and on the considered performance metric in most cases umeå september being the exception hydrus had slightly higher reliability values than swmm and she but similar or lower cover of the observations hydrus also frequently had lower nse values than swmm and she palla et al 2012 found that hydrus performed better than a still acceptable conceptual model in the present study hydrus usually performs better than the simple conceptual model urbis except for the calibration phase in lyon compared to swmm hydrus usually has better reliability but lower observation cover and nse finally in terms of volume error she clearly performed better than the other models one reason for the differences in performance between the models may be the varying ways in which lateral flow is represented urbis lacks a routing component for overland flow but since this also applies to hydrus which performed better it is likely that other factors e g the simple model structure with few calibration parameters are influencing the performance for urbis comparing swmm hydrus and she which model performs best depends on the evaluation criterion used because of this and because the models differ in their descriptions of other aspects e g vertical flow as well it is not possible to say in general which conceptualization of lateral flow is more appropriate manning s equation for surface and drainage layer flow swmm no explicit routing hydrus although the calibrated lower boundary condition may act to provide some flow routing or a calibrated drainage constant and 2d overland flow she differences between the studied models were most noticeable around high flow peaks which are also practically relevant in sizing of drainage systems for example in umeå calibration the upper bound of the predicted peak flow on july 11th varies strongly approx 210 l min 1 in urbis 300 l min 1 in hydrus 400 l min 1 in she and 180 l min 1 in swmm compared to the observed value of approx 100 l min 1 see fig 6 this shows how large the uncertainty arising from the choice of a specific model structure can be and that this source of uncertainty should perhaps receive more attention in future urban drainage studies see also broekhuizen et al 2019 xie et al 2020 reported that swmm always had higher peak flow rates than hydrus by contrast we found that peak flows in hydrus are similar to or larger than in swmm furthermore the simplest conceptual model urbis usually showed the lowest peak flows while she would usually predict larger peak flows than swmm with some exceptions for example for the event on july 3rd in umeå see figs 4 and 6 the swmm peak flow was more than twice that of she deviations between observed and simulated flows are usually the largest at the beginning of events where models may not accurately predict when runoff starts or how large the outflow will be initially this further leads to single peak events being generally less well represented than events with multiple peaks this suggests that the studied models are unable to properly represent the processes in the roofs during dry periods e g berretta et al 2014 cascone et al 2019 leading to under or overestimations of the initial conditions of the roofs at the beginning of rainfall events further investigations into the representation of evapotranspiration in models may be valuable to remedy this issue as may the collection of relevant additional data such as substrate moisture content for hydrus the choice of boundary conditions may also be affecting the model behaviour early in rainfall events 4 4 influence of calibration site and period for most performance metrics the models reported more satisfactory results in lyon than in umeå especially regarding runoff volume this may be caused by a number of different factors e g larger flow measurement uncertainties different climate and greater complexity and less typical construction of the roof in umeå the latter could be especially relevant for urbis and hydrus since it was not possible to represent the inclination of all the individual sections in umeå these will make the large green roof behave more like a collection of smaller roofs the variability of the model performances between the two roofs should also serve as a reminder that study findings about models developed tested for a single roof should be interpreted carefully given their low generality for different climates and experimental settings it is remarkable that for all four models and both calibration sites the calibration period which was selected for its high variability in event retention was the period that was most informative in terms of maximizing the distance between the prior and posterior distributions of model parameters kullback leibler divergence see table 2 although the generality of this finding should be checked for additional sites two potential implications arise first it underlines the importance of long term measurement campaigns in actual field sites with the aim to provide datasets containing a richer mapping of the inter event variability second in laboratory irrigation experiments e g brunetti et al 2020 more information about the behaviour of the system may be gained by using varied rainfall events e g longer and shorter more and less intense single and multiple peaks dry periods and initial conditions 4 5 impact of computational challenges on model predictions perhaps the most noticeable effect of the occasional numerical problems with she is the problematic behaviour of the error bands in the testing for umeå on the 6th of october because 45 of the posterior parameter samples caused an abnormal termination of the model run these samples had to be excluded from the construction of the uncertainty bounds apparently numerical stability of models depends on the parameter values to some extent so the removed parameter sets were not evenly distributed in the sample which led to the abnormally large error bounds for some time periods in october it can even be questioned if these uncertainty bounds for the testing period should be used since they do not accurately reflect the inferences made about the parameter values in the calibration period the inability to apply the calibrated model to other time periods rather limits its utility although model numerical errors have not received much attention in urban drainage studies see alfredo et al 2010 for an example this indicates that numerical problems may occur and need to be considered partially as a consequence of the numerical issues with she the time required for the calibration of this model was up to a factor 10 larger than for swmm and urbis table 4 this requirement may prove problematic in some studies or practical applications there was also no significant difference in performance between she and the much faster swmm that might have justified the difference in computational time however there are also potential benefits associated with she first it can explicitly handle green roofs with almost any geometrical design in a relatively straightforward way second it can easily handle spatially variable model parameters e g for roof slope substrate depth or varying vegetation that may be more difficult to represent in other models finally the explicit representation of overland flow may be a benefit where such flow occurs as was the case for some combinations of parameter values in the umeå roof it may be worth considering the use of a model emulator to speed up the calibration process e g machac et al 2016 5 conclusions planning and control of green roofs in order to realize their potential as a stormwater control measure can benefit from accurate predictions of roof runoff but so far it has not been investigated extensively what hydrological models are most suitable for this task therefore this study compared the performance of four different models the conceptual models urbis and swmm and the mechanistic models hydrus 1d and mike she for two full scale roofs in lyon france and umeå sweden across two one month calibration periods the model predictions of roof runoff were least accurate for the simple conceptual model urbis although the predictions from this model still captured 90 of observations during calibration and 70 during testing in terms of reliability i e how well the observations conform to probabilistic flow predictions the hydrus model had best performance while swmm and she had the best performance in terms of what percentage of observations fell anywhere in the model prediction interval and in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency she had the best performance in terms of total runoff volume the differences between the models predicted flow rates are large enough that they could lead to different designs of green roofs to meet e g runoff reduction targets for all models but especially for swmm hydrus and she there were large differences between the posterior distributions and most likely values of most model parameters obtained for different calibration periods in some cases the posterior distributions also tended towards values that are less likely for the physical characteristics that the parameters are meant to represent these two results indicate that for all four models tested here the parameter values do not fully reflect physical properties of the studied roofs but are also dependent on the meteorological conditions of the different calibration periods even if model performance was still good when switching to the testing phase in this study the question remains what the impact of these discrepancies in parameter values may be when models are used e g in long term forecasts of green roof performance under climate change scenarios the discrepancies in parameter estimates also imply that the model structures do not adequately describe the relevant processes in the roofs and more work is needed to improve these descriptions such future studies might also benefit from the use of more measured variables e g substrate water content or evapotranspiration for both umeå and lyon the information about parameters gained during the calibration i e the distance between the prior and posterior distributions of parameters as measured by the kullback leibler divergence was the largest when calibrating with the period containing the highest variability in event retention this could provide a useful method for selecting calibration periods in future studies the differences in complexity between the models also manifested in differing computational requirements and problems the simpler models urbis and swmm took considerably less time for the calibration than the physically based models hydrus and she in the case of she there were some challenges in regards to the model numerical schemes which resulted in e g failed model runs and

8574,green roofs can be valuable components in sustainable urban drainage systems and hydrological models may provide useful information about the runoff from green roofs for planning purposes various models have been proposed in the literature but so far no papers have compared the performance of multiple models across multiple full size green roofs this paper compared 4 models the conceptual models urbis and swmm and the physically based models hydrus 1d and mike she across two field sites lyon france and umeå sweden and two calibration periods for each site the uncertainty and accuracy of model predictions were dependent on the selected calibration site and period overall model predictions from the simple conceptual model urbis were least accurate and most uncertain predictions from swmm and mike she were jointly the best in terms of raw percentage observations covered by their flow prediction intervals but the uncertainty in the predictions in swmm was smaller however predictions from hydrus were more accurate in terms of how well the observations conformed to probabilistic flow predictions mike she performed best in terms of total runoff volume in urbis swmm and hydrus uncertainty in model predictions was almost completely driven by random uncertainty while parametric uncertainty played a significant role in mike she parameter identifiability and most likely parameter values determined with the dream bayesian algorithm were found to be inconsistent across calibration periods in all models raising questions about the generalizability of model applications

introduction green roofs are an increasingly popular design feature in urban areas that can limit the increase in runoff peaks and volumes caused by urbanization e g carson et al 2013 while providing additional benefits for e g air quality e g tomson et al 2021 and building insulation e g susca 2019 the hydrology of green roofs has been studied both in full scale roofs for overviews see e g carson et al 2013 cipolla et al 2016 mentens et al 2006 and in purpose built test beds e g stovin et al 2012 factors that influence the hydrologic performance include substrate properties berretta et al 2014 fassman beck et al 2013 szota et al 2017 evapotranspiration cascone et al 2019 ebrahimian et al 2019 roof slope getter et al 2007 vegetation properties berretta et al 2014 and roof dimensions hakimdavar et al 2014 for example liu et al 2019 found based on irrigation lab experiments that substrate material was the most important factor influencing the runoff retention in green roofs followed by substrate depth roof slope and vegetation planning of new green roofs and drainage systems that include green roofs requires predictions of roof runoff e g palla and gnecco 2020 versini et al 2015 this interest has led several authors to propose models of varying complexity and levels of detail for specific green roofs regression equations e g carson et al 2013 fassman beck et al 2013 or unit hydrographs villarreal and bengtsson 2005 can be developed to quantify their long term performance on either an event basis or for longer periods mentens et al 2006 the downside of such approaches is that they remain site specific and thus might lack generality such simplified rainfall runoff relationships may not be directly applicable in forecasting contexts a different approach is represented by conceptual models i e simplified descriptions retaining a physical basis which have been proposed by several authors in the green roof context e g carbone et al 2014 herrera et al 2018 kasmin et al 2010 li et al 2019 locatelli et al 2014 rossman and huber 2016 she and pang 2010 sherrard and jacobs 2012 skala et al 2019 vesuviano et al 2014 some of these modelling approaches mainly focused on sub models for specific parts or processes of green roofs such as the drainage layer vesuviano and stovin 2013 and evapotranspiration feng and burian 2016 jahanfar et al 2018 one commonly used model for green roofs is the u s e p a storm water management model swmm which has had official support for green roofs since version 5 1 rossman and huber 2016 although green roofs could be simulated in older versions using the curve number approach or representing the green roof as a storage node in the drainage network alfredo et al 2010 attempts to model green roofs using the swmm bioretention cell module were successful in some cases burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 but not in others versini et al 2015 different studies have confirmed that the swmm green roof module added in version 5 1 is applicable to individual rainfall events e g hamouz and muthanna 2019 palla et al 2012 and over longer periods e g cipolla et al 2016 hamouz and muthanna 2019 krebs et al 2016 however further studies have also raised concerns about this software regarding e g the description of evapotranspiration feng and burian 2016 hamouz and muthanna 2019 peng and stovin 2017 the inability of calibrated parameters to be transferred to similar roofs in different locations johannessen et al 2019 and the use of a large number of parameters to which the modelling outputs are insensitive leimgruber et al 2018 similar considerations are likely to apply to some other conceptual models as well but have rarely been investigated in detail or reported another type of descriptions used for green roof modelling are physically based models mainly based on the richards equation operating most commonly in one i e the vertical dimension e g avellaneda et al 2014 hilten et al 2008 peng et al 2019 sims et al 2019 skala et al 2020 although two dimensional li and babcock 2015 palla et al 2009 or three dimensional brunetti et al 2016 descriptions have also been reported one frequently named advantage of physically based models is that parameter values represent physical characteristics which can be measured in situ e g de ville et al 2018b sims et al 2019 or in the lab e g brunetti et al 2016 peng et al 2020 however the representativeness of parameter values measured in the laboratory under controlled conditions has been questioned szota et al 2017 this finding raises concerns about whether laboratory measurements of model parameters may also be applicable for roofs that have already been built another concern is that different models may interpret the same physical parameter in different ways in the model equations an ideal model would be capable of reproducing the runoff from green roofs with different designs under different climatic conditions and for all times of the year in addition in an ideal situation models would be able to reliably predict runoff from green roofs without calibration e g when considering the implementation of new green roofs comparing multiple models using the same dataset may be one way of generating insights into shortcomings of and potential improvements to model structures that might help achieve this goal some studies have tried to identify the best performing models by applying multiple models to the same dataset carson et al 2017 found that the empirical curve number method and characteristic runoff equation performed slightly better 0 03 difference in nash sutcliffe efficiency nse than swmm for two full scale roofs however the site specific nature of these first two models is less appealing in practice and more complex models were not considered palla et al 2012 performed event based calibrations of a 16 22 m roof comparing a simple conceptual model consisting of three linear reservoirs with the mechanistic model hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 both models closely reproduced the observed runoff hydrographs but the mechanistic model s predictions were somewhat more accurate by contrast soulis et al 2017 reported better performance for 2 1 m test modules for the conceptual swmm model than for hydrus 1d xie et al 2020 performed irrigation experiments on laboratory modules and found that hydrus 1d obtained a higher nse than swmm in calibration but worse scores for testing periods with higher rainfall intensities regarding runoff volumes and peak flows brunetti et al 2020 performed a detailed calibration study of a month long laboratory irrigation experiment with a 57 36 cm green roof module they found that a conceptual model and a relatively simple mechanistic model were equally suited to describe the hydrological behaviour of the test module while the use of more complex mechanistic models was not justified given the limited improvements in performance although these studies contributed to elucidate some aspects of modelling green roofs they might still present certain limitations first only one of them palla et al 2012 is based on an actual green roof and not purpose built lab or pilot modules dismissing aspects of real green roofs such as scale effects heterogeneity and non vertical water movement second the simulations were most commonly event based descriptions palla et al 2012 xie et al 2020 ignoring the processes that take place in the roof during dry periods and being sensitive to initial conditions brunetti et al 2020 did use a continuous simulation but their irrigation experiment only used block rainfalls of identical intensity which is not representative of the variability in natural rainfall and runoff from green roofs third the mentioned comparative studies brunetti et al 2020 palla et al 2012 soulis et al 2017 were all carried out under a mediterranean climate except xie et al 2020 who only simulated different rain intensities and ignored evapotranspiration so their conclusions might not be applicable to other climates fourth a number of the previous studies present a limited assessment of uncertainties in model parameters and predictions which might also have a significant influence in the conclusions thereby reported hydrological simulations of green roofs provided by reliable models seem to be an essential tool for the operation and design of these structures which ultimately encourages more sustainable urban drainage systems therefore the goal of this study is to propose a comparative evaluation of models of varying complexity from simple conceptual to mechanistic ones applied to two full scale green roofs with different physical layouts and in two different climates the models are compared under a context of continuous simulation assessing modelling uncertainties and accuracy by means of bayesian methods and monitored data of rainfall potential evapotranspiration and output flow rate from different time periods a formal bayesian calibration approach is used to estimate values of model parameters that fit best with the observed flow data including parameters that are not directly linked to observable characteristics of the green roof system or may be difficult to determine in situ while evaluating the inherent uncertainties in such estimates and the resulting uncertainties in the model predictions 2 methods 2 1 green roofs data sets for this study two green roofs were selected one in lyon france and one in umeå sweden representing different designs and different climate conditions the green roof in lyon was built in the congress centre of lyon france in 1995 and covers 280 m2 the roof is flat and consists of a 50 mm egg box shaped drainage layer underneath the substrate layer which has a depth varying between 40 and 140 mm and is planted with sedum outflows from both the substrate and the drainage layer join in a single drain in which discharge was measured using an electromagnetic flow meter krohne optiflux 2000 allowing to measure flow rates up to 330 l min 1 the specified accuracy of the flow meter depends on the flow value and varies from 2 9 at 10 l min 1 to 1 0 at 30 l min 1 i e for typical low and high flow rates for this roof rainfall was measured using a 0 2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge installed on the roof flow rate and rainfall measurements were reported with a constant one minute time step from september 2012 to may 2013 bertrand krajewski and vacherie 2014 other meteorological data temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure solar radiation and relative humidity were provided by the french national meteorological office météo france from the bron weather monitoring station located 9 km from the green roof the 2012 2013 green roof monitoring campaign was carried out for other objectives than model calibration and no local measurements of potential evapotranspiration were available the bron station is the closest station where daily measurements of potential evapotranspiration epot were also available therefore epot values were initially estimated on an hourly basis from temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure solar radiation and relative humidity records employing the penman monteith equation e g zotarelli et al 2010 these hourly epot values were further corrected to sum to the meteo france available total daily epot values considered as reference values afterwards hourly epot corrected values were linearly interpolated to a one minute time step principato 2015 the second roof was built in umeå sweden in 2014 and covers 2469 m2 a 25 mm drainage layer underlies a substrate layer whose depth varies between 42 and 80 mm with an average of 60 mm planted with a mixture of grass and sedum the original design depth of the substrate was 70 mm bg byggros ab 2018a the roof consists see fig 1 of 7 v shaped sections i e 14 sloped sections in total with half facing due north half facing due south that are angled between 15 and 38 in the narrow section of the roof a drain receiving flow from both the surface and the drainage layer is installed on either side of the roof at the bottom of the v in the wider section drains are installed at ¼ and ¾ of the total width each receiving flow from half of the v shaped section a network of pipes collects the water from these roof sections and from two small impervious roofs 169 m2 in total flow was measured using a 1 l tipping bucket for flow rates up to 25 l min 1 hyquest 2016 and an area velocity flow meter for higher flow rates teledyne isco 2010 the accuracy of the tipping bucket gauge was not quantified precisely but based on a flow rate dependent correction from the manufacturer hyquest 2016 and in situ checks of the volume per tip it is believed to be reasonably small previous laboratory tests of this model of area velocity sensor showed that the accuracy of the flow measurement is typically within 5 in the flow range of 120 540 l min 1 broekhuizen 2021 rainfall was measured using a 0 2 mm tipping bucket measurements were carried out from late 2017 to early november 2020 although some gaps were present in the data in addition periods influenced by snow fall or snow melt occurring as early as october and as late as may were excluded since they pose additional challenges outside the scope of this paper e g hamouz and muthanna 2019 evapotranspiration was calculated using the penman monteith equation and data from two stations from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute station 140 615 for solar radiation approx 2 7 km from the green roof and 140 480 for other data approx 1 1 km from the green roof for both sites two independent one month long periods were selected to calibrate and test different green roof models independent calibrations were undertaken for each period and then cross tested against the data for the other period this was done to test whether a model calibrated for a given period is usable for other periods with potentially different meteorological conditions for each site one period was selected that showed high variability among the retention rates for individual events while the other had similar total rainfall depth but with less varied retention for lyon the selected periods were november 2012 reporting low retention rates with a low inter event retention variability and april 2013 with high variability of the inter event retention rates for umeå the selected periods were from 9 september 2020 to 11 october 2020 reporting a high inter event retention variability hereafter referred to as just september and from 29 june 2020 to 28 july 2020 with low inter event retention variability hereafter july when analysing monthly time series including data from dry periods zero registered rainfall and flow rate values were found to represent the majority of the values however the inclusion of these zero registered values in the model calibrations might tend to favour the representation of low flow rate values penalizing the peaks of the hydrographs e g oliveira et al 2018 in addition the predictive capabilities of the models could also be overestimated during these dry periods since almost any model will predict no flow if it has not rained for some time on the other hand close to zero flow rate values during rainy periods can also represent valuable information about the model performance as models or parameter setups that predict flows when none occurred are not desirable therefore flow rate values lower than the detection limit of the measurement devices 0 79 and 2 l min 1 for lyon and umea resp were not considered in the calculations as long as no rainfall was registered within the preceding 15 min 2 2 hydrological models four models of varying complexity were selected for this study the model structures are shown visually in fig 2 and described in more detail in the sections below all models used in the study assume that flow through the substrate is vertical with lateral flow occurring on the surface and in the drainage layer the slopes of the roof in umeå may give rise to some lateral flow in the substrate however this is believed to play at most a minor role for a number of reasons first water input precipitation and output drainage from the substrate take places uniformly across the entire roof second the permeability of the geotextile separating the substrate from the drainage layer 90 mm hr 1 bg byggros ab 2018a bg byggros ab 2018b is higher than the observed rainfall intensities so the formation of a saturated layer on top of the geotextile i e in the bottom of the substrate is unlikely third the substrate is very thin compared to the length in the direction of the slope of the roof segments so water moving down through the substrate has little time to travel laterally before reaching the bottom of the substrate and the drainage layer fourth the thin substrate means that should the drainage layer capacity be exceeded the substrate will quickly become saturated at which point drainage outflow and surface runoff will be larger than lateral flow through the substrate for these reasons the assumption of only vertical flow in the substrate is considered appropriate in addition this is also the assumption most commonly used in green roof modelling studies and it is therefore appropriate here given that the study goal is to test existing models 2 2 1 urbis urbis is a scenario simulation and decision support tool aimed at simulating long term hydrological dynamics of different stand alone and interconnected stormwater control measures scms such as green roofs swales retention basins or permeable surfaces at the block and building scales this free software https deep insa lyon fr fr content urbis was developed in the python programming language by insa lyon france in collaboration with the companies nidaplast siplast and as2c sandoval et al 2019 the model is based on conceptual simplifications of these systems into a set of connected boxes or reservoirs that represent e g the storage zone or the substrate of each structure focusing on the case of green roofs the option alveolar flat green roof was chosen in urbis to model both the lyon and umeå green roofs urbis uses the term alveolar to refer to the egg box like layer of plastic compartments forming the bottom of the roof that allow for some storage volume and for drainage swmm uses the term drainage layer urbis was selected as an example of a simple conceptual model because computer code for it was already available and the authors were already familiar with it helping to avoid errors in the model setup other simple conceptual models have been proposed see section 1 and could be used as well but given the large number of available models it was not feasible to compare all models here in the following lines a brief description is given of this alveolar flat green roof modelling setup in urbis the potential evapotranspiration is calculated according to 1 e tot b season e pot where e tot is the total actual evapotranspiration e pot is a user supplied potential evapotranspiration time series e g calculated using the penman monteith equation and default values of the coefficient bseason are 0 5 for winter and 1 for summer evapotranspiration from the alveolus layer to the substrate is calculated from the following equations 2 e dr min b dr e tot d dr 3600 δ t 3 b dr d dr ϕ dr d dr η where bdr is a fraction of the potential evapotranspiration that is available for the drainage alveolus layer d dr is the current water stored in the alveolus layer since alveolus layers in urbis are similar to drainage layers in swmm the subscript dr is used for both d dr is the drainage layer thickness 50 mm for lyon and 25 mm for umeå and ϕ dr is the void index of the layer structure set as a calibration parameter for the case of lyon and as a fixed value of 0 54 for umeå based on available information from the manufacturer bg byggros ab 2019 the coefficient η describes the relationship between water level in the alveolus layer and movement of water from the alveolus layer to the substrate see next paragraph furthermore evapotranspiration from the substrate e sub to the atmosphere is calculated according to 4 e sub e dr d dr 0 m i n e tot θ d sub 3600 δ t d dr 0 where d sub is the substrate depth and θ the current water content of the substrate d sub was set to 60 mm for umeå and it was established as a calibration parameter for the green roof in lyon given the high variability of this value reported from in situ measurements for the studied green roofs no evapotranspiration or re humidification occurs from the alveolus layer to the substrate and no storage exists in the drainage layer during dry periods this was explicitly considered in urbis by setting η 10000 a very high value to make b dr equal to zero eq 3 leading to set e dr 0 eq 2 indeed this conduces to cancel the water transfer from the alveolus drainage layer to the substrate leading to estimations of e sub eq 4 only dependent on the potential evapotranspiration and the substrate water content θ eq 4 allows evapotranspiration to occur up to the potential rate but reducing when the substrate moisture contents becomes low the maximum storage capacity of the substrate c sub is calculated as follows 5 c sub θ fc θ wp d sub where θ fc and θ wp are the field capacity and wilting point of the substrate respectively the wilting point was set to urbis default value θ wp 0 05 and θ fc was established as a calibration parameter for both green roofs if inflow into the substrate exceeds c sub saturation of the substrate the excess water l from the saturated substrate transferred to the alveolus drainage layer is calculated as follows 6 l max θ d sub 3600 δ t p e sub e dr c sub 3600 δ t 0 if the maximum storage capacity of the alveolus layer is reached the excess becomes overflow q ov and if the maximum storage of the substrate is reached any excess water on the surface of the substrate becomes runoff q sur this alveolar structure can also include a controlled outflow aimed to simulate the output flows from the roof delivered to the pipe system this flow rate q dr is then calculated by an orifice equation as follows 7 q dr r u a reg 2 g d dr where r u is a coefficient set to 0 6 by default in urbis the area of the regulation orifice a reg was set as a calibration parameter because a reg is normally calculated in the software based on the design flow rate to be delivered from the roof to the drainage system which was unknown in this case it was not possible to calculate a reg directly since conceptually the value of the parameter refers to an orifice in the wall of a tank while in the actual system the opening was a drainage outlet in the bottom of the roof the regulation orifice is set to be located at the bottom of the alveolar layer in order to avoid stormwater storage in the drainage layer during dry periods as neither roof was designed for this purpose the roof runoff that was studied in this paper is the sum of q dr q ov and q sur 2 2 2 swmm swmm v 5 1 013 rossman and huber 2016 is a conceptual model that still relies on some physically based parameters and process descriptions swmm is commonly used in both research and practice and it is therefore of particular interest to evaluate its capabilities a short description of the main process equations is given below for details see rossman and huber 2016 infiltration is represented using the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 8 i k s 1 θ s θ top d s u r ψ ga j where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity θ s the saturated water content θ top the water content of the top layer of the soil d sur the depth of water on the surface ψ ga the soil suction head at the wetting front and j the accumulated infiltration volume during the rainfall event the percolation of water from the substrate layer to the drainage layer is described by darcy s law 9 l k s e γ θ s θ where γ is a calibration parameter describing the change of conductivity as a function of soil moisture content and θ is the current substrate moisture content percolation is disabled if θ θ fc surface runoff is described using manning s equation 10 q sur 1 n m w ϕ sur d sur d sur 5 3 where n is manning s roughness coefficient m and w the slope and width of the roof ϕ sur the void fraction of the surface i e fraction of volume not filled by plants and d sur the depression storage flow in the drainage layer is also described using manning s equation 11 q dr 1 n dr m w ϕ dr d d r 5 3 with n dr a separate manning s coefficient ϕ dr the void fraction of the drainage layer and d dr the water depth in the same layer evapotranspiration takes place at the user supplied potential rate e pot using first any water available on the surface the evapotranspiration is labelled e sur then from the substrate labelled e sub and finally from the drainage layer labelled e dr the roof runoff that was studied in this paper is the sum of q dr and q sur the roof in lyon was represented as a single green roof for umeå the individual roof sections were included as individual sub catchments with individual green roofs so that the dimensions and slope of each section could be input directly the pipe network was included explicitly in the swmm model although it had a negligible influence on the output of the model the small impervious roof areas in umeå were simulated only in swmm the calculated flow was added to the total outflow from the roof in the other models in this way the impermeable roof sections were treated the same way in all models and not subject to any calibration following the scope of the paper 2 2 3 hydrus 1d hydrological modelling of the studied green roofs is also simulated by using the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2018 two and three dimensional versions of hydrus also exist but in this paper we refer to hydrus 1d as simply hydrus this model describes one dimensional vertical water movement using richards equation 12 θ ψ t z k ψ ψ z 1 h where k ψ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of the tensiometer pressure potential ψ z is the vertical coordinate positive upward and h is a sink term representing evaporation and root water uptake the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties can be simulated in hydrus with six different models in this study the van genuchten and mualem model is adopted van genuchten 1980 as in similar green roof modelling settings e g brunetti et al 2020 the van genuchten relationships can be written as 13 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ β μ ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 14 k ψ k s s eff λ 1 1 s eff 1 μ μ 2 15 s eff θ θ r θ s θ r where θ r and θ s are the residual and the saturated water content of the soil ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and s eff is the effective saturation α related to the inverse of the air entry suction β pore size distribution λ tortuosity and μ 1 1 β dimensionless are fitting parameters of the soil water retention curve coarse grained soils have a high value of α and β whereas fine textured soils have a lower α and β rassam et al 2018 β is used instead of the more common symbol n to avoid confusion with manning s coefficient at the surface of the substrate the boundary condition bc atmospheric bc with surface run off was applied where observed time series of precipitation and evapotranspiration are used by the model ψe denotes the minimum surface pressure head at which actual evapotranspiration can still take place at the potential rate epot below this value soil moisture availability limits the actual evapotranspiration ψe was set to a fixed value of 300 000 mm brunetti et al 2016 since evapotranspiration parameters were not calibrated in any of the other models a constant pressure head bc was applied at the bottom of the substrate for this case the pressure head at the bottom node ψinit bot is set constant and equal to the value given by the initial conditions at the bottom of the substrate this ψinit bot value was included as a calibration parameter it is worth clarifying that alternative bcs at the bottom of the substrate have been applied for modelling green roofs with hydrus namely the free drainage palla et al 2012 hakimdavar et al 2014 or seepage face brunetti et al 2016 bcs the constant pressure head bc was selected because it was found to have better performance compared to the two mentioned alternatives by peng et al 2019 and in initial calibration runs using the data sets from this paper the initial conditions for every model run were linearly interpolated from a typical pressure head of 3000 mm brunetti et al 2016 at the top of the substrate to the provided ψinit bot parameter value at the bottom this approach aimed to maintain similar initial conditions for all model runs and to avoid numerical problems related to zero valued or abruptly changing vertical gradients in addition a 14 day warming up period was applied to reduce furthermore the effect of these initial conditions on the results the python library phydrus phydrus readthedocs io was used as interface to hydrus in the calibrations collenteur et al 2020 the egg box like drainage layers in the roofs do not have a suitable physical representation in hydrus so it was not included for this model in any of the studied roofs 2 3 mike she the physically based model mike she version 2019 not updated dhi 2019a 2019b was selected as a more extensive mechanistic model newer versions of mike she were not used since they produced identical results but with approximately double model runtimes the model uses a regular rectangular grid 1 m grid spacing was used here and vertically discretizes the unsaturated zone into a user specified number of cells here 1 cm cells were used overland flow across the grid cells is described using the saint venant equations using the diffusive wave approximation where mannings coefficient describes the friction from the surface note that mike she uses the inverse of manning s n used in swmm richards equation see eq 12 is used to describe vertical flow in the unsaturated zone different options are available for the hydraulic conductivity function for reasons of numerical stability the averjanov equation was used here 16 k θ k s θ θ r θ s θ r v where θ r is the residual soil water content and v a calibration coefficient v is used instead of the more common symbol n to avoid confusion with manning s coefficient the relation between ψ and θ is expressed by calibrating saturated moisture content θ s corresponding to a pressure head ψ 10 mm and θ fc ψ 103 mm while the wilting point moisture content θ wp ψ 104 2 mm was fixed at 0 1 and the residual moisture content θ r ψ 106 mm at 0 02 intermediate values were linearly interpolated between adjacent points the use of classical hydraulic conductivity curves e g van genuchten 1980 was avoided since first calibration runs showed that this sometimes led to failed model runs or very long model run times which made it infeasible to perform calibrations in a reasonable amount of time the egg box like drainage layers in the roofs do not have a suitable physical representation in mike she initial attempts to model the drainage layers using she s saturated zone module were unsuccessful a simple conceptual drainage function is thus used 17 q dr d dr r dr a cell where d dr is the hydraulic head in the saturated zone and r dr a calibrated constant and a cell the horizontal area of a single cell in the model domain drainage is calculated for each cell individually since d dr varies spatially and then summed to obtain the drainage outflow for the entire model domain the roof runoff that was studied in this paper is the sum of q dr and the overland flow q sur across the model boundaries to decrease model runtime symmetry in the roofs was used to reduce the size of the simulation domain in lyon half the roof was simulated and the resulting flow multiplied by 2 in umeå one half of the narrow roof section was simulated i e the contributing area for one of the two drains installed at the edge and one quarter of the wider part of the roof i e the area contributing to a roof drain from one side since drains were installed at ¼ and ¾ of the total width see fig 1 2 4 calibration approach all tested models were calibrated for the selected sites and calibration periods using the bayesian algorithm dream zs laloy and vrugt 2012 as implemented in the python package pydream shockley et al 2018 and with the following log likelihood function 18 l n 2 ln 2 π i 1 i n ln σ i i 1 i n q obs i q sim i 2 2 σ i 2 where n is the number of observations qobs is the observed flow qsim is the simulated flow from the hydrological model and σ is the standard deviation of the distribution which needs to be established during calibration since it is expected that this standard deviation will be higher for larger flows i e the errors show heteroscedasticity it was parameterized following ammann et al 2019 19 σ i σ 0 σ 1 q sim i c where σ 0 and σ 1 are calibration parameters for this study c was set to 0 5 to limit the expansion of σ for high flows as preliminary runs showed it becoming so large that the simulated runoff underestimated peak flows to an undesirable extent while still obtaining good likelihood values due to the large σ this approach was also used in earlier research for natural catchments to improve the performance of model predictions mcinerney et al 2017 more complex likelihood functions that account for bias skew and autocorrelation of the residuals are an on going topic of research e g ammann et al 2019 evin et al 2013 mcinerney et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 schoups and vrugt 2010 wani et al 2017 however there are as of yet no universal recommendations on what more complex likelihood functions are applicable in what conditions problems have been reported with accounting for autocorrelation at the short time steps common in urban hydrology métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 and for natural catchments it has been reported that accounting for autocorrelation can produce worse predictions especially for dry catchments evin et al 2014 schoups and vrugt 2010 with which urban catchments share some similarities in this light it was preferred to use a relatively simple likelihood function in this study for comparison the assumptions of normality and independence of the residuals were also employed in earlier green roof modelling work brunetti et al 2020 calibration parameters and prior ranges i e the minimum and maximum allowed values are given in table 1 for the green roof in lyon the maximum substrate depth in the calibration range of dsub was increased from 140 mm to 175 mm in order to include the remaining substrate at the inner part of the egg box drainage which could represent a higher storage capacity than in situ measurements 2 5 probabilistic predictions of roof outflow a successful calibration with dream results in a sample of parameter sets that form a representative set of samples of the joint parameter posterior distribution the hydrological model output q sim for each of those parameter sets is available for each observation time step this ensemble of hydrological model outputs can be summarized by a confidence bound here the 90 central bound was used to visualize the predicted outflow over time and the uncertainty that arises from uncertainty in the estimates of the hydrological model parameters in addition the total uncertainty parametric model structure uncertainty see e g kuczera et al 2006 can be visualized stochastic model outputs q stoch are sampled from a normal distribution where the mean is the hydrological model output for a parameter sample q sim and the flow dependent standard deviation is given by eq 19 any negative flow values are set to zero the resulting ensemble of stochastic model outputs is again summarized using the 90 confidence bound at each observational time step thus visualizing total uncertainty 2 6 model evaluation criteria 2 6 1 nash sutcliffe efficiency the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is calculated using 20 nse 1 i 1 i n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 i n q obs i q o b s 2 where q sim is the flow for the parameter sample with the highest posterior probability map and q o b s the mean of all flow observations 2 6 2 volume error the volume error ve is calculated as 21 ve q sim q obs q obs 100 where q sim and q obs are the simulated map and observed flow volumes calculated taking into account the non constant time steps between observations in the data from umeå where a tipping bucket was used for measuring low flow rates section 2 1 2 6 3 reliability for perfectly reliable probabilistic model predictions i e probability distributions the actual observations should be proportionately distributed across the corresponding predictive distributions i e with more observations in the peak s of the predictive distributions and fewer observations falling in the tails of the predictive distributions this can be checked by first calculating for each observation where it falls along the cumulative distribution function cdf of the predictions for the same time step i e resulting in a value in the interval 0 1 then if the observations are appropriately distributed across the predictive distributions all the cdf values together should follow a uniform 0 1 distribution this can be measured by the distance between the cdfs of a u 0 1 distribution and of the observed distribution of cdf values if this is evaluated at each observation s cdf value it results in the following metric for reliability ammann et al 2019 evin et al 2014 22 ω rel 1 2 n 1 i 1 i n f qi q obs i f ζ f qi q obs i where f ζ is the empirical cumulative distribution function of f qi q obs i i 1 2 n i e the set of the cdf values of the observations for all time steps i this value can vary from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates perfect reliability 2 7 relative spread of model predictions the precision of model predictions based either on parametric or total uncertainty can be measured by the spread of the predictions relative to the observed flows ammann et al 2019 mcinerney et al 2017 23 ω spread i 1 i n σ q i i 1 i n q obs i where σ q i is the standard deviation of the ensemble of runoff predictions at time step i generally a smaller spread is desirable as it means model predictions are more precise i e less uncertain although increased precision may come at the cost of reduced reliability 3 results 3 1 posterior parameter distributions the marginal posterior distributions pd hereafter of the model parameters are shown in fig 3 for lyon and fig 4 for umeå since uniform prior distributions were used the prior distribution is simply a horizontal line if no information is gained about a certain parameter in the calibration period the posterior distribution will be the same as the prior and the parameter is considered non identifiable from the data the more information about suitable values for a parameter is gained in calibration i e the more identifiable it is the more its pd will diverge from a horizontal line moving instead towards a single peak parameters that showed to be well identifiable in all calibrations were the field capacity θfc and porosity θs γ swmm only van genuchten s α λ β hydrus drainage parameters ndr in swmm ψinit bot in hydrus r s in she and the error model parameters σ0 and σ1 the only parameter which remained practically unidentifiable in all calibrations was the void index of the drainage layer ϕdr in lyon for urbis not calibrated in umeå since it was known from manufacturer s information for the other parameters the identifiability was found to be site and calibration period dependent the information content of the different calibration periods for each site can be compared using the kullback leibler divergence from the prior to the posterior this value is indicated for each individual parameter in figs 3 and 4 the sum of the values for all parameters in each calibration is given in table 2 for umeå the september calibration period was the most informative for all four models and for lyon the april period was the most informative these periods were selected section 2 1 because they include high variability in the retention of the individual rainfall events indicating that this may be a useful method for identifying suitable calibration periods although this assumption would need to be verified for additional sites in some cases the parameter posterior distributions collapse towards the boundaries imposed in calibration e g for θfc and θs the drainage constant tdr in she and ks in swmm umeå only in these cases it could be considered to extend the prior range but this was not implemented because the bounds of these parameters aimed to retain a physically realistic representation 3 2 predictive uncertainty the model predictions i e central 90 confidence bounds showing both parametric and total uncertainty for the calibration phase are shown in fig 5 for lyon and fig 6 for umeå uncertainties in urbis swmm and hydrus seemed to be driven by the uncertainties related to the model structure as parametric uncertainty narrow dark grey band presented a minor contribution to the total predictive uncertainty average of 2 7 of the total uncertainty for she the contribution of parametric uncertainty was larger 24 of the total predictive uncertainty on average in rainfall events with multiple peaks and troughs e g the event on may 2nd 3rd in lyon the total uncertainty bounds in urbis did not follow the same pattern of peaks and troughs while the other models managed to capture these patterns with their narrower uncertainty bounds for several events especially in lyon runoff from hydrus started too early and initial peaks in the hydrograph were also sometimes overestimated see e g the events in lyon on april 27th and november 26th for the first events in each period this could be possibly related to the initial conditions of the model run despite using a 14 day warmup period but this seems unlikely as the issue still occurs later in the simulation period e g on november 26th in lyon considering the testing phase fig 7 for lyon fig 8 for umeå the wider hydrological parameter uncertainty bounds in she stood out especially for the april period in lyon and the september period in umeå where they formed most of the total uncertainty bound on two occasions around october 7th 00 00 and around october 9th 12 00 the uncertainty bounds are much wider than for other similar flow rates and driven completely by the hydrological parameter uncertainty this behaviour may be partially related to some numerical problems encountered in she see section 3 3 urbis completely missed one small event in umeå july 23rd and two modest to large events in lyon november 4th and 8th but otherwise the uncertainty bounds behaved similarly to the calibration phase swmm had some problems where it over or underestimated flow at the start of events in lyon the problem with hydrus predicting too high runoff early in some rainfall events that was present in the calibration phase persisted in the testing phase the predictive performance of the models is summarized in table 3 she had the largest relative spread i e the widest uncertainty bounds of flow predictions resulting from uncertainty in the hydrological model parameters alone but urbis had the largest total uncertainty with swmm uncertainties being the smallest parametric uncertainty relative to the observations was small for urbis swmm and hydrus 0 03 but somewhat larger for she 0 14 on average total uncertainty was smallest in swmm followed by hydrus she and finally urbis predictive uncertainty in she was driven by uncertainty in hydrological model parameters to a greater extent 24 in calibration 32 in testing than in urbis 2 in both swmm 3 and 8 respectively and hydrus 7 in calibration 3 in testing the agreement between the probabilistic model predictions total uncertainty and the observations was measured using the reliability metric see eq 20 and the percentage of observations falling inside the 90 prediction interval reliability varied between the different sites and calibration periods urbis was the most reliable model in lyon in april and a close second to hydrus in november but the least reliable in umeå reliability of swmm and she was similar for the different calibration scenarios hydrus had the highest reliability overall 0 80 on average although it did not score well 0 61 in umeå september in testing reliability was lower than in calibration for urbis from 0 73 to 0 60 swmm 0 74 to 0 72 and she 0 77 to 0 73 but hydrus had the same average reliability as in the calibration phase 0 80 in terms of the percentage of observations captured by the total uncertainty bounds the models showed generally good performance with 13 out of 16 calibrations capturing 90 of the observations in the 90 confidence bounds of the predictions in testing the percentage cover was somewhat lower reaching 90 for only 6 out of 16 calibrated models swmm hydrus and she still consistently exceeded 80 observation cover while for urbis this varied from 72 to 83 the nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated for the map parameter set gives an overall indication of the goodness of fit of the model the july period in umeå shows relatively low scores in both calibration and testing for all models suggesting that some processes were not properly accounted for by any of the studied models or that there may be some issue with the data in this period the nse for swmm and she was generally high 0 9 in calibration 0 8 in testing except for she in the july period in umeå 0 6 urbis had worse performances in this metric 0 8 in calibration 0 7 in testing performance for hydrus was rather variable ranging in calibration from 0 51 umeå july to 0 91 umeå september and in testing from 0 03 umeå september to 0 84 umeå july nse for hydrus in lyon was always low compared to swmm and she these relatively poor nse scores for hydrus can be linked to occasional issues with reproducing flow rates in the beginning of the events discussed above and visible in figs 5 8 finally the volume errors calculated for the map parameter set indicate how well the models approximate the water balance in the roof during the simulations for lyon swmm and she showed good performances 8 error in calibration 17 in testing urbis had similar performances in calibration 8 and 10 for april and november respectively but considerably larger errors in testing 33 in april and 42 in testing volume error for umeå was rather high across all models in calibration only she had acceptable errors 7 with larger errors for swmm up to 24 in july hydrus 28 in july and urbis 52 in july in testing volume errors were generally large 20 note that volume errors in one part of the record may be compensated by errors in the other direction in another part of the record so the volume error is primarily an indication of model bias and should not be interpreted without considering other performance indicators 3 3 computational requirements and errors the practical value of a model depends in part on its computational demands the runtime for the various calibrations is therefore given in table 4 runtimes were up to 10 times longer for the more complex she model than for the simpler urbis and swmm for swmm and urbis run times were similar although it should be pointed out that urbis has not been optimized to the same degree as the other models and it may therefore be possible to lower its runtime further although both she and hydrus use the computationally intensive richards equation for unsaturated zone flow the fact that hydrus operated in only one dimension i e simulating just a single vertical profile compared to 600 profiles in she meant that this model was still 2 3 times faster than she in addition to the pure computational time the numerical stability of the models can also affect their applicability urbis directly showed good convergence of the markov chains in calibrations while some further experiments were required in swmm and hydrus to ensure good performance of the calibration algorithm on the other hand two types of major numerical problems were encountered with she first the markov chains of the dream algorithm sometimes got stuck in a state with a relatively high likelihood value where even small proposed jumps would have a much lower likelihood value which led to a systematic rejection of all the proposals for example in one such state changing only θs by 10 5 reduced the probability of accepting the new point to effectively zero this unexpected behaviour can be attributed to numerical instability of the she model that may be associated with the model s origin in natural catchment modelling rather than green roofs i e with larger time steps and spatial scales it was therefore necessary to include an additional step in the calibration where the likelihood would be re evaluated with a very small perturbation to the parameter values and the new likelihood value used in evaluating the acceptance probability second the dependence between model numerical stability and parameter values meant that some of the parameter samples from the calibration period resulted in an abnormal termination of the model when applied to the testing period specifically after calibrating the she model for umeå for the july period 45 of the obtained parameter samples resulted in failed model runs i e the simulation either stopped prematurely or got completely stuck when applied in testing to the september period the same happened with 0 5 of the samples from the lyon november calibration no such errors occurred in the other models 4 discussion 4 1 parameter consistency and identifiability in an ideal model where the structure adequately describes the green roof processes and model parameters describe physical aspects of the system model parameters are expected to be stationary i e independent of the selected calibration period this property can be defined as parametric consistency thyer et al 2009 however some changes over time have been reported for physical properties of green roofs de ville et al 2018a 2017 which could be reflected in some of the model parameters further parametric identifiability can be defined as the amount of information obtained while updating the parameters prior distribution to the posterior distribution pd during the calibration process for the case study these properties of consistency and identifiability were unsatisfactory for various parameters in all of the models and for both sites see figs 3 and 4 this is an indication that the four models still suffer from inadequacies in their representations of all physical processes in green roofs the dependence of parameter pds on the selected calibration period lack of consistency can be interpreted as evidence that parameter values are dependent not just on physical characteristics of the green roof but also on the meteorological conditions the dependence of parameter values on meteorological conditions may have also played a role in an earlier study johannessen et al 2019 where it was found that calibrated parameter values for one site gave poor model performance when applied to a roof with the same design in a different location however other factors e g vegetation which will always have some dependence on local the meteorological conditions may have also played a role in that study the variability of estimated parameter values from different calibration periods implies that models might deliver different results when applied to new periods or for forecasting this is already visible to some extent in the testing phase where model predictions are less accurate compared to calibration results the fact that parameter values obtained for the different calibration periods differ as much as they do raises the question of what the impact of this will be when the meteorological differences between the calibration period and the prediction period become larger e g when models are used to forecast the behaviour of green roofs under climate change scenarios e g karlsson et al 2016 the identifiability of parameter values was previously investigated by brunetti et al 2020 in an experiment with a green roof module in a climate chamber as in the current paper they found that soil porosity θs was well identifiable using outflow measurements for both conceptual and mechanistic models they also found that both the identifiability and the optimal values i e the parameter values with the maximum posterior likelihood map depended on the type of calibration data used substrate water content outflow or tracer transport the results from this paper provide evidence that these values are further dependent on properties of the specific calibration period chosen e g different meteorological and vegetation conditions identifiability of model parameters is related to the model s sensitivity to changes in the values of parameters which was previously investigated for swmm in a sensitivity analysis rather than a calibration context by leimgruber et al 2018 for example they found that substrate depth and porosity were the most sensitive parameters which is confirmed by their high identifiability see figs 3 and 4 by contrast leimgruber et al reported low sensitivity of field capacity and γ called conductivity slope in their paper but in our results the identifiability of field capacity was site dependent while γ was well identifiable in all cases furthermore they reported that hydraulic conductivity was almost completely insensitive but this parameter was nonetheless well identifiable in all calibrations except november in lyon the green ampt suction head was identifiable in umeå more so for september than july despite being reported as an insensitive parameter by leimgruber et al most notably they also reported that the manning s coefficient for the drainage layer was completely insensitive unidentifiable while this parameter was identifiable in all calibrations for both field sites in this study compared to the other models urbis uses a relatively simple structure with fewer calibration parameters which can explain the good identifiability of the model parameters in all calibrations except for the drainage layer void index in lyon however as stated in similar calibration settings within the hydrological context thyer et al 2009 parametric consistency for highly identifiable parameters is more likely to be unsatisfactory as the posteriors delivered from different calibration periods are less likely to overlap higher parametric identifiability at the expense of the lack of consistency besides from urbis is also appreciable for almost all parameters in swmm and hydrus in the umeå site and to a lower extent for the parameters n dr in swmm d sub in she and ψ init bot in hydrus in lyon complementarily the observed stability and rapid convergence of the markov chains in bayesian calibrations for urbis may also be related to the high parameter identifiability and lower complexity of the inference given the lower number of parameters used to by this model 4 2 physical interpretation of parameter values the differences in identifiability and low consistency that was found for parameters included in multiple of the studied models e g substrate depth lyon and porosity in all models manning s coefficient depression storage field capacity for swmm and she saturated hydraulic conductivity in all models except urbis can be considered a further indication that model parameters are not exclusively representing the variability of the physical characteristics that they are aimed to represent the obtained parameter map values also raise some questions for swmm both calibration periods and hydrus september only in umeå the pd of the hydraulic conductivity ks was concentrated towards the minimum value allowed in calibration this minimum was set based on literature values for natural soils rawls et al 1983 but it is rather low compared to values reported for green roof substrate peng et al 2020 this could be an unexpected result of the calibration process e g compensating for some other parameter or some process not well accounted for in the model or it may indicate that laboratory measurements of ks are not necessarily indicative of effective field values the latter could for example depend on the effects of vegetation compaction and aging of the substrate e g de ville et al 2017 or the lower permeability of the geotextile separating the substrate from the drainage layer reported as 90 mm hr 1 by the manufacturer bg byggros ab 2018b unrealistic calibrated values of green roof model parameters have been found in earlier studies as well avellaneda et al 2014 even in carefully controlled laboratory experiments brunetti et al 2020 the current study provides further evidence that calibrated parameters for even rather detailed green roof models may not be exclusively linked to physical characteristics of the system it is not completely clear why different models results in different estimates of the same parameter but some potential explanations can be found by examining the model structures saturated hydraulic conductivity k s is also estimated differently for the three models that include it one aspect that may influence this is that the models used k s for different calculations hydrus used van genuchten s model and she used the averjanov equation to describe unsaturated hydraulic conductivity while swmm used k s to calculate both infiltration green ampt equation and percolation to the drainage layer darcy equation these equations all have different forms which may be part of the reason why the estimated values of ks differ between the models the maximum storage capacity of the green roofs depends on the substrate thickness d sub and the saturated moisture content θ s but these parameters also calibrated to different values in the different models this may be explained by the fact that the models were calibrated against only outflow data while the relationship between outflow and current water storage is different across the models in addition for swmm and urbis part of the difference in maximum water storage capacity may instead be represented by the storage in the drainage layer this separate compartment does not exist in the other two models in swmm and she the estimates for manning s coefficient n and n she respectively are remarkably similar keeping in mind that n she is the inverse of n so the regions of highest likelihood peaks in the distribution for the september calibration in umeå are actually around the same value the depression storage is not well identifiable for either model in lyon while in umeå the values are somewhat different which may be related to the differences in maximum substrate storage capacity between the two roofs 4 3 predictive uncertainty in calibration all models included close to or more than 90 of observations in the 90 confidence intervals of the model predictions the relative spread of the model predictions was however lower in swmm making its predictions more precise in testing the performance was only slightly lower for swmm hydrus and she while the relative spread of the predictions was the same for urbis the prediction bounds were slightly narrower than in calibration but still larger than the other models but at the cost of lower coverage of the observations 78 the larger uncertainty bounds and lower cover in urbis suggest that the model contains the highest structural deficiencies in attempting to capture the main dynamics of the hydrological process for the studied green roofs this is also confirmed by the lower nash sutcliffe values overall swmm and she had similar performances and which one performed better depended on the calibration site and period and on the considered performance metric in most cases umeå september being the exception hydrus had slightly higher reliability values than swmm and she but similar or lower cover of the observations hydrus also frequently had lower nse values than swmm and she palla et al 2012 found that hydrus performed better than a still acceptable conceptual model in the present study hydrus usually performs better than the simple conceptual model urbis except for the calibration phase in lyon compared to swmm hydrus usually has better reliability but lower observation cover and nse finally in terms of volume error she clearly performed better than the other models one reason for the differences in performance between the models may be the varying ways in which lateral flow is represented urbis lacks a routing component for overland flow but since this also applies to hydrus which performed better it is likely that other factors e g the simple model structure with few calibration parameters are influencing the performance for urbis comparing swmm hydrus and she which model performs best depends on the evaluation criterion used because of this and because the models differ in their descriptions of other aspects e g vertical flow as well it is not possible to say in general which conceptualization of lateral flow is more appropriate manning s equation for surface and drainage layer flow swmm no explicit routing hydrus although the calibrated lower boundary condition may act to provide some flow routing or a calibrated drainage constant and 2d overland flow she differences between the studied models were most noticeable around high flow peaks which are also practically relevant in sizing of drainage systems for example in umeå calibration the upper bound of the predicted peak flow on july 11th varies strongly approx 210 l min 1 in urbis 300 l min 1 in hydrus 400 l min 1 in she and 180 l min 1 in swmm compared to the observed value of approx 100 l min 1 see fig 6 this shows how large the uncertainty arising from the choice of a specific model structure can be and that this source of uncertainty should perhaps receive more attention in future urban drainage studies see also broekhuizen et al 2019 xie et al 2020 reported that swmm always had higher peak flow rates than hydrus by contrast we found that peak flows in hydrus are similar to or larger than in swmm furthermore the simplest conceptual model urbis usually showed the lowest peak flows while she would usually predict larger peak flows than swmm with some exceptions for example for the event on july 3rd in umeå see figs 4 and 6 the swmm peak flow was more than twice that of she deviations between observed and simulated flows are usually the largest at the beginning of events where models may not accurately predict when runoff starts or how large the outflow will be initially this further leads to single peak events being generally less well represented than events with multiple peaks this suggests that the studied models are unable to properly represent the processes in the roofs during dry periods e g berretta et al 2014 cascone et al 2019 leading to under or overestimations of the initial conditions of the roofs at the beginning of rainfall events further investigations into the representation of evapotranspiration in models may be valuable to remedy this issue as may the collection of relevant additional data such as substrate moisture content for hydrus the choice of boundary conditions may also be affecting the model behaviour early in rainfall events 4 4 influence of calibration site and period for most performance metrics the models reported more satisfactory results in lyon than in umeå especially regarding runoff volume this may be caused by a number of different factors e g larger flow measurement uncertainties different climate and greater complexity and less typical construction of the roof in umeå the latter could be especially relevant for urbis and hydrus since it was not possible to represent the inclination of all the individual sections in umeå these will make the large green roof behave more like a collection of smaller roofs the variability of the model performances between the two roofs should also serve as a reminder that study findings about models developed tested for a single roof should be interpreted carefully given their low generality for different climates and experimental settings it is remarkable that for all four models and both calibration sites the calibration period which was selected for its high variability in event retention was the period that was most informative in terms of maximizing the distance between the prior and posterior distributions of model parameters kullback leibler divergence see table 2 although the generality of this finding should be checked for additional sites two potential implications arise first it underlines the importance of long term measurement campaigns in actual field sites with the aim to provide datasets containing a richer mapping of the inter event variability second in laboratory irrigation experiments e g brunetti et al 2020 more information about the behaviour of the system may be gained by using varied rainfall events e g longer and shorter more and less intense single and multiple peaks dry periods and initial conditions 4 5 impact of computational challenges on model predictions perhaps the most noticeable effect of the occasional numerical problems with she is the problematic behaviour of the error bands in the testing for umeå on the 6th of october because 45 of the posterior parameter samples caused an abnormal termination of the model run these samples had to be excluded from the construction of the uncertainty bounds apparently numerical stability of models depends on the parameter values to some extent so the removed parameter sets were not evenly distributed in the sample which led to the abnormally large error bounds for some time periods in october it can even be questioned if these uncertainty bounds for the testing period should be used since they do not accurately reflect the inferences made about the parameter values in the calibration period the inability to apply the calibrated model to other time periods rather limits its utility although model numerical errors have not received much attention in urban drainage studies see alfredo et al 2010 for an example this indicates that numerical problems may occur and need to be considered partially as a consequence of the numerical issues with she the time required for the calibration of this model was up to a factor 10 larger than for swmm and urbis table 4 this requirement may prove problematic in some studies or practical applications there was also no significant difference in performance between she and the much faster swmm that might have justified the difference in computational time however there are also potential benefits associated with she first it can explicitly handle green roofs with almost any geometrical design in a relatively straightforward way second it can easily handle spatially variable model parameters e g for roof slope substrate depth or varying vegetation that may be more difficult to represent in other models finally the explicit representation of overland flow may be a benefit where such flow occurs as was the case for some combinations of parameter values in the umeå roof it may be worth considering the use of a model emulator to speed up the calibration process e g machac et al 2016 5 conclusions planning and control of green roofs in order to realize their potential as a stormwater control measure can benefit from accurate predictions of roof runoff but so far it has not been investigated extensively what hydrological models are most suitable for this task therefore this study compared the performance of four different models the conceptual models urbis and swmm and the mechanistic models hydrus 1d and mike she for two full scale roofs in lyon france and umeå sweden across two one month calibration periods the model predictions of roof runoff were least accurate for the simple conceptual model urbis although the predictions from this model still captured 90 of observations during calibration and 70 during testing in terms of reliability i e how well the observations conform to probabilistic flow predictions the hydrus model had best performance while swmm and she had the best performance in terms of what percentage of observations fell anywhere in the model prediction interval and in terms of nash sutcliffe efficiency she had the best performance in terms of total runoff volume the differences between the models predicted flow rates are large enough that they could lead to different designs of green roofs to meet e g runoff reduction targets for all models but especially for swmm hydrus and she there were large differences between the posterior distributions and most likely values of most model parameters obtained for different calibration periods in some cases the posterior distributions also tended towards values that are less likely for the physical characteristics that the parameters are meant to represent these two results indicate that for all four models tested here the parameter values do not fully reflect physical properties of the studied roofs but are also dependent on the meteorological conditions of the different calibration periods even if model performance was still good when switching to the testing phase in this study the question remains what the impact of these discrepancies in parameter values may be when models are used e g in long term forecasts of green roof performance under climate change scenarios the discrepancies in parameter estimates also imply that the model structures do not adequately describe the relevant processes in the roofs and more work is needed to improve these descriptions such future studies might also benefit from the use of more measured variables e g substrate water content or evapotranspiration for both umeå and lyon the information about parameters gained during the calibration i e the distance between the prior and posterior distributions of parameters as measured by the kullback leibler divergence was the largest when calibrating with the period containing the highest variability in event retention this could provide a useful method for selecting calibration periods in future studies the differences in complexity between the models also manifested in differing computational requirements and problems the simpler models urbis and swmm took considerably less time for the calibration than the physically based models hydrus and she in the case of she there were some challenges in regards to the model numerical schemes which resulted in e g failed model runs and
