11935,ingestion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs contaminated water has potential human health and ecological consequences a comprehensive investigation of pahs occurrence and distribution in the surface water and sediment samples of the damodar river basin was conducted using the agilent 7890b gas chromatograph gc fid coupled with 5977a mass spectrometry the results showed that concentrations of the individual pahs in surface water and sediments ranged from nd to 36 μg l and nd to 582 ng g with the highest detected levels of 3 ring pah acenapthylene acy and 4 ring pah benzo a anthracene baa with a mean concentration of 6 12 6 06 μg l and 2 79 4 5 μg l respectively the concentration of 4 ring pahs such as fluoranthene flur pyrene pye benzo a anthracene baa and chrysene chry in sediment samples has mean levels of 43 41 ng g 32 29 ng g 52 50 ng g and 83 105 ng g respectively the 4 ring pah chry was frequently detected in all sediment samples while the 3 ring pah acy was dominant in surface water samples the principal component analysis pca and diagnostic ratios suggested that the pahs contamination in surface water was due to petrogenic and fuel combustion in sediments pahs primary sources were coal burning fuel combustion petrogenic and pyrolysis the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr for children and adults due to ingestion of surface water ranged from nd to 4 25 10 5 and nd to 7 21 10 5 respectively in contrast the risk index ri values ranged from 4 3 10 5 and 7 3 10 5 for sediment samples higher toxic equivalent quotient teq 1865 ng kg and mutagenic equivalent quotient meq 1665 ng kg for eight carcinogenic pahs indicate extremely high toxicity improper management of mine drainage frequent flooding of open cast mines and hydraulic connection between the surface water sediments and groundwater significantly deteriorated overall water quality in the drb graphical abstract image 1 keywords diagnostic ratio ilcr principal component analysis petrogenic risk index 1 introduction the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs occur naturally in coal crude oil and gasoline while others are manufactured two of the primary natural sources of pahs include wild forest fire and volcanic eruptions liu et al 2014 some pahs are the byproduct of anthropogenic activities such as pahs released due to incomplete combustion of pahs containing substances coal oil gas creosote plastics pesticides dyes wood garbage and tobacco additional anthropogenic input includes oil spills urban runoff incomplete combustion domestic and industrial wastewater discharges vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions boonyatumanond et al 2006 zakaria et al 2002 adeniji et al 2019a the pahs are ubiquitous in the environment and often detected in various environmental matrices including soil water sediments and aquatic microorganisms countway et al 2003 chen et al 2004 cheollee et al 2005 wang et al 2018 stout et al 2004 the petrogenic and pyrogenic pahs were most abundant and generally formed by the reduction of biogenic precursors tongo et al 2017 xiao et al 2014 low molecular weight lmw pahs typical molecular structure comprises more than one fused aromatic ring of carbon and hydrogen atoms while the higher molecular weight hmw pahs comprised of four or more benzene rings and are far more stable and persistent than the lmw pahs to date approximately 200 such compounds have been detected in various environmental compartments pahs are hydrophobic and lipophilic making them susceptible to adsorption on the suspended particulates in the aquatic environment studies have reported that high pahs deposits on soil and estuarian lake and marine sediments could exert toxic effects on aquatic biota tolosa et al 2004 brazkova et al 2013 olatunji et al 2014 due to their higher toxicity mutagenic and carcinogenic potential pahs are of critical environmental concern the toxicity of pahs depends on the type of species molecular structure and exposure routes douben 2003 for example oral intake of pahs through food inhalation and dermal interaction causes a significant risk to human health such exposures could result in severe short and long term health effects including some major cardiovascular and respiratory diseases adeniji et al 2019 perez padilla et al 2010 based on pahs toxicity the united states environmental protection agency usepa has declared sixteen pahs as priority pollutants the rapid growth of industrialization has increased the daily emission of pahs lang et al 2008 zhang and tao 2009 for example developing countries like india and china have witnessed a steady increase in the environmental releases of pahs in 2004 three countries accounted for the maximum global atmospheric emission of usepa s 16 priority pahs they are china 114 gg y 1 india 90 gg y 1 and the united states 32 gg y 1 zhang and tao 2009 studies on pahs exposure in hooghly and brahmaputra river india khuman et al 2018 algoa bay south africa adeniji et al 2019a buffalo river estuary south africa adeniji et al 2019 gomti river india malik et al 2011 have raised serious concern on exposure to pahs and resulting in adverse human health impacts in recent years in india river water pollution has become one of the most significant issues due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization increased river water pollution in india is routinely reported the damodar river basin drb which includes many industries has witnessed large scale water pollution the drb is a seasonal water system situated in the mineral rich area of the chotanagpur plateau it receives both regulated and unregulated discharge from various industries including wastewater discharge from the steel industry coal washery mining and coke industry few studies have documented widespread pollution in the drb including heavy metal contamination soil erosion and deteriorating water overall water quality for the first time in this manuscript we document the occurrence distribution and human and ecological risk assessment due to pahs pollution in the drb the drb serves as a critical water resource for millions of inhabitants in the jharkhand and west bengal area who use water for domestic and agricultural purposes given the importance of drb we have decided to study the sources of pollution and the resulting impact on surface water sediments and groundwater need to be evaluated in this manuscript we have chosen pahs as a primary pollutant due to the nature of industries located in the areas large scale coal mining activities and the inhabitants general lifestyle we have documented the analysis of extensive surface water and sediment samples and evaluated groundwater vulnerability in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the drb is in one of the major industrial areas surrounded by four large coalfields jharia north kanakpura east bokaro and raniganj besides coalfields it is also home to several large thermal power plants captive steel plants and coal mines the location of drb is ideally suited to investigate the occurrence of pahs in surface water sediments and groundwater the drb lies between 22 n and 24 n latitude and 84 e to 88 e longitude covering approximately 23 170 km2 areas damodar river is the central part of the basin and millions of people living in the adjoining area use river water of the drb for drinking and agricultural purposes the damodar river situated in eastern india at elevation 1068 m is a small rain fed perennial river originates from the chhotanagpur hill khamerpet hill the total length of damodar river is 541 km out of which it 240 km in the state of jharkhand while the remaining flows in west bengal before finally merging into the bay of bengal bob besides the damodar river the drb has several tributaries and sub tributaries such as garga nalla barakar konar khudia jamunia katri tamna nalla and noonia it also has five reservoirs of which two are located on the barakar river at tilaiya and maithon two on damodar river at tenughat and panchet and one on konar river fig 1 damodar river receives the discharge from large scale industries in the area and unprecedented levels of mining activities further challenged the rivers assimilation capacity not surprisingly the damodar river is one of india s most polluted rivers singh et al 2008 singh and hasnain 1999 tiwary 2001 the drb is the repository of approximately 46 of india s entire coal reserve large scale coal mining activities in this area increase the net pollution load on the damodar river and the underlying groundwater tiwary and dhar 1994 improper management of mine water affects the surface water quality of the damodar river according to one estimate nearly 50 of the discharged effluent from coal mine water ends up in the damodar river additionally a series of coal washeries located on the riverbank often discharge polluted water containing fine coal particles thereby impacting the sediment quality many studies have documented the impact of mine drainage on surface and groundwater quality these studies mainly focused on the occurrence of ions total dissolved solids trace elements and water quality parameters to assess mining activities net impact on groundwater resources in this study we have focused on pahs occurrence in surface water and sediments in the damodar river impacted by industrial activities and mine drainage originating from several coalfields 2 2 sampling and pretreatment a total of n 108 samples including 54 sediment samples and 54 surface water samples were collected in the pre monsoon season february to april 2019 sediment samples were collected using a stainless steel van veen grab sampler aisi 316 station steel the grab 8 mm arms manufactured from the square tube 60 60 4 mm with 12 mm reinforcements from 5 cm to 7 cm depth and were packed in 2 kg capacity polythene bags the surface water samples were collected from half meter depth directly from the river using screw cap glass bottles 2 l before sampling the containers were thoroughly washed with diluted nitric acid 10 and deionized water to prevent potential cross contamination during sample handling and were rinsed with the respective samples during sampling salaudeen et al 2018 four subsamples of 1 liter capacity have been collected from the basin at four different points to obtain the representative water samples the subsamples were mixed in a steel bucket and a fixed quantity of 1 l sample was taken four sediment subsamples were collected from the basin near the sites in a random manner to form representative samples to preserve the samples they were kept in the icebox and transferred to the laboratory within 10 h the semi solid samples were kept in the refrigerator at 16 c until analysis the water samples were stored in the refrigerator at 3 c for further analysis 2 3 extraction clean up and analysis of pahs from samples for 16 pahs

presented in the study by chakraborty et al 2016a dichloromethane dcm was used for liquid liquid extraction three times 50 25 25 ml with 1 l of water samples the organic phase was then separated and collected by mixing 10 g sodium chloride and shaking it for 4 6 min this procedure was repeated three times and finally the combined organic phase was collected the drying process started by passing it through sodium sulfate placed on 3 cm thick glass wool a rotary evaporator hei vap core hand lift model with g1 diagonal glassware was used for concentrating the extract a standard solvent extraction procedure was used to extract pahs from sediment samples the dry samples were collected homogenized properly cultured and kept for the sample preparation this process included mixing 2 g of dry solid sample with 0 5 g anhydrous na2so4 and was sonicated using 10 ml of dcm for 1 h followed by centrifugation a 3 ml of supernatant was filtered through 2 g of silica gel column with 11 ml 1 1 v v elution of hexane and dcm chen et al 2007 the evaporation of solvent fractions was carried out with exchanging by acetonitrile with a final volume of 2 ml radiolabeled standards of pahs naphthalene d8 phenanthrene d10 and chrysene d12 were used as surrogate standards for sample extraction a silica gel glass column 30 cm long and 3 cm diameter glass filled with 10 g activated silica gel and 5 g anhydrous na2so4 was used the pahs were eluted using 100 ml of dcm and n hexane mixture 1 1 v v finally under a gentle stream of pure nitrogen the eluent solvent was concentrated to 20 μl the analytes were quantified by adding an internal standard of hexamethyl benzene before analysis khuman et al 2018 extracted water and sediment samples collected from the drb were analyzed to detect the usepa s 16 priority pahs the analytical quantitation was carried out using the agilent 7890b gas chromatograph gc fid system equipped with the flame ionization detector fid the system is coupled with 5977a mass spectrometry equipped with an hp 5 ms capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm with a 7 inch cage because of the low sensitivity of the single gc system we utilized the gc system coupled with the ms system which has its stand alone detector while using the ms system we only relied on the detector associated with the ms system in splitless mode 1 μl of each sample was injected high purity nitrogen gas was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 83 ml min in the beginning the oven temperature was set at 70 c for 1 min and then increased to 300 c at a rate of 5 c min 1 over 20 min the temperature of the injector and transfer line were maintained at 300 c and 325 c respectively 2 4 quality assurance and quality control for quality assurance and quality control field blank samples and sample duplicates were collected the samples spiked with radiolabeled surrogate standards phenanthrene d10 naphthalene d8 and chrysene d12 were used as an internal standard for calibration of all species of pahs the quality control for pahs analysis was ascertained from these samples the recovery percentages of 16 pahs in water and sediment samples were approximately 90 100 and 85 95 respectively the method detection limits mdls of the target pahs were calculated as three times the standard deviation sd plus the mean concentrations of target compounds in blank samples the mdls of the target pahs for sediment and surface water samples were 1 ng g and 0 1 μg l respectively the laboratory and field blanks were extracted and analyzed in the same way as the samples the concentration of pahs less than the method detection limits was deemed as non detect nd 2 5 health risk assessment for human health risk assessment the possibility of adverse health effects due to

concentration ccme 2010 lerda 2011 adeniji et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 pahs concentration in surface water and sediments the concentration of 16 pahs in surface water and sediments of the drb were summarized in table 1 except for the bap da and in all pahs were detected in water samples with a total mean concentration of 10 11 μg l and a total standard deviation of 11 59 μg l in the drb water samples pahs total concentration ranged from nd not detect to 36 μg l the three ring pahs were more dominant in water samples followed by the four rings pahs and contained about 67 and 28 of the total pahs concentration the three ring pahs acy and four ring pahs baa were dominant in most surface water samples a high concentration of these lmw pahs could be attributed to the high coal mining in the drb s valley this observation is consistent with the findings documented in numerous studies that reported large scale mining activities and widespread pahs pollution in soil sediments and water bodies the high concentration of pahs in the coal mining areas is well documented as evidenced by numerous studies for example studies conducted by ouyang et al 2018 have documented the presence of varying levels of three four ring pahs including 16 priority pahs in soil and sediments of coal mining subsidence areas in huainan china the authors attributed the occurrence of pahs in the surface sediments to the hydrogeological condition of the mining area similarly studies conducted by liu et al 2012 reported extensive pahs pollution in the tiefa coal mine district liaoning china the authors reported widespread pahs contamination in the mining zone soils agricultural and lake bank soils in the surrounding area of the tiefa coal mine through pca analysis the authors concluded that extensive mining activities in this area with pahs pollution originating from unburned coal 19 8 and coal gangue 26 7 while pahs pollution is mostly attributed to combustion sources the environmental impact of native hard coal is not fully understood according to achten and hofmann 2009 unburnt hard bituminous coal contains anywhere between hundreds to thousands of mg kg of pahs the macromolecular and mobile phase of the hard coal containing pahs is of particular concern due to its mobility and likelihood of its release during fugitive airborne emission accidental releases natural erosion of coal seams coal preparation and washing dumping of tailings loading operations and slumping and runoff from the storage area poses a more significant threat to the aquatic environment in this study the water samples s30 and s36 collected at the barakar river of the drb showed a higher concentration of acy and baa with a maximum concentration of acy and baa were found as 36 μg l and 23 μg l fig 2 the dominance of 3 ring acy in this study shows similarity with other studies in india gomti river malik et al 2009 brahmaputra and hooghly river khuman et al 2018 the concentration ranges of pahs in surface water found in this study were higher than the concentration of pahs reported at brahmaputra and hooghly river india khuman et al 2018 xiamen harbor china zhou et al 2000 ulsan bay korea khim et al 2001 and gao ping river taiwan doong and lin 2004 table 2 the concentration of pahs in the gomti river india malik et al 2011 is higher than the concentration reported in this study table 2 the absence and low concentration of hmw pahs in this study are similar to the other studies reported by gao ping river taiwan doong and lin 2004 and brahmaputra and hooghly river india khuman et al 2018 the hmw pahs 5 and 6 ring were not detected frequently and mostly absent in water samples as they remained adsorbed to sediments due to their non biodegradable nonvolatile and less water soluble properties jiries et al 2000 the pahs concentration in sediment samples showed a wide range of variations and almost all 16 pahs were detected in sediment samples among which chrysene was the most dominant pah compound that accounted for around 22 of the ʃ16 pahs mean concentration the detected concentrations of pahs for 2 ring 3 ring 4 ring 5 ring and 6 ring accounted for approximately 5 20 55 15 and 4 of the mean concentrations of ʃ16 pahs respectively the total pahs concentration ranged from nd not detected to 582 ng g with a higher concentration of 4 ring pahs the samples from s23 to s42 were rich in 4 ring pahs and a concentration of 582 ng g was detected at the sampling site s35 at barakar river one of the high coal mining areas the ʃ16 pahs mean sd is 380 365 ng g with an individual higher concentration of pah chry 83 105 ng g followed by baa 52 50 ng g the box plots clearly show the number of variations of pahs concentrations in sediments with a higher value of standard deviation and concentration of the 4 ring pahs fig 2 the toxic pahs like baa chry bbf and da were found in higher concentration than the other toxic pahs with mean values of 52 50 ng g 83 105 ng g 27 24 ng g and 15 10 ng g in this study the concentration of ʃ16 pahs in the sediment samples was lower than the concentration reported by similar studies in other riverine sediments such as the dalio river watershed china wei and mengchang 2007 gomti river india malik et al 2011 liaohe river basin china yang et al 2014 tonghui river china huang 2004 and ulsan bay korea khim et al 2001 table 2 pahs in the drb were comparable with riverine sediments from the hooghly and brahmaputra river india khuman et al 2018 kor river iran farshid and amir 2011 songhua river china xuesong and jing 2014 however they were more than the concentration reported from the gao ping river taiwan doong and lin 2004 and xiamen harbor in china zhou et al 2000 table 2 3 2 assessment of groundwater pollution vulnerability to pahs various studies have documented the adverse effect of mining activities on the groundwater resources at the drb most of these studies focused on assessing groundwater quality parameters such as ph total dissolved solids turbidity conductivity and sulfate the presence of various pahs in the surface water and sediments in the drb as discussed earlier can potentially impact groundwater in the drb three primary processes are responsible for pahs potential contamination of groundwater in the drb flooding of the damodar river discharge of washery effluents and induced recharge through direct hydraulic connection the sorbed pahs will remain confined to the sediments while the direct hydraulic connection between the groundwater and river water could transport hydrophilic pahs to the groundwater resources particularly during the river stages higher stages will artificially induce groundwater recharge thereby transporting pahs to the groundwater proximal to the wells in the drb series of pumping tests and modeling of aquifer stream water interaction using groundwater modeling system software showed that damodar river stages impact the groundwater flow in the drb roy et al 2015 the groundwater at the drb is increasingly vulnerable to various pollutants including pahs studies have shown that the groundwater in contact with coal bearing sediments is also vulnerable to coal mining drainage potentially enriching the groundwater with trace metals mohanty et al 2018 while the authors have indicated the groundwater vulnerability to pollution from mine drainage other contributory factors such as surface runoff potentially negate the adverse impact similarly singh et al 2008 demonstrated that groundwater in the drb area is indeed impacted by mining and other associated activities excavation and dumping the vulnerability of groundwater pollution due to pahs in the drb cannot be understated studies have shown pahs in the groundwater samples collected from the coal mine in henan province china wang et al 2009a b the authors have demonstrated that the lmw pahs such as naphthalene phenanthrene fluorene and chrysene were predominant in the groundwater samples similar results were also reported by chen et al 2019 documenting extensive pahs in the groundwater samples collected from six mines in xuzhou china the high concentration of lmw pahs and its subsurface mobility is a cause of concern due to its potential threat to groundwater resources studies conducted by liu et al 2012 in the tiefa coal mining area showed that extensive mining activities and poor coal mine waste management adversely affect water resources improper mine waste management such as dumped spoil tips coal gangue coal dust unburned coal and weathering leaching in the mining areas contaminate the surrounding soils with pahs and vertically mobilizes the lmw pahs thereby threatening the groundwater resources it is particularly true for the high solubility lmw pahs that deposits on the soil particulate matter that may eventually reach the shallow aquifer contaminating the groundwater liu et al 2012 for the first time we document the presence of a high concentration of low molecular weight pahs in the drb we also observed a high concentration of lmw pahs in the samples taken from and near the coal mining areas the evidence clearly shows a causal relationship between the coal mining activities in the area and the pahs occurrence distribution and the likelihood of groundwater pollution in the drb groundwater in the drb is a valuable resource and as such contamination of this resource due to lmw pahs originating from intensive coal mining operations in the region deserves serious consideration 3 3 pahs composition the 16 pahs are generally characterized by low 2 3 ring middle 4 ring and higher 5 6 ring molecular weight pahs the compositional diagrams of pahs in surface water and sediments of the drb are shown in fig 3 it shows that the lower and middle ring pahs were most abundant in surface water and sediment samples in general 2 ring pahs were dominant in surface water samples of the total ʃ16 pahs mean concentrations the 2 ring 3 ring and 4 ring accounted for 3 28 and 67 concentration the higher concentration of lmw pahs in surface water samples may be due to their high aqueous solubility and high vapor pressure xu et al 2014 on the contrary the hmw pahs compounds with low water solubility and hydrophobic nature tend to adsorb on sediments and suspended particulate matter li et al 2006 the pahs in sediment samples mainly composed of 3 ring 4 ring and 5 ring but the 2 ring and 6 ring pahs contribute a less amount towards the total pahs concentration the pahs of 2 ring 3 ring 4 ring 5 ring and 6 rings contribute 5 20 55 15 and 4 towards the ʃ16 pahs mean concentration respectively fig 3 compared to the pahs concentrations in the surface water samples the higher ring pahs were more dominant in the sediment samples due to their non biodegradable nonvolatile and less water soluble properties jiries et al 2000 3 4 pahs source identification 3 4 1 diagnostic ratio the concentration ratios or molecular ratios of some selected pahs are widely used for identifying the sources yunker et al 2002 the primary sources of pahs contamination are petrogenic pyrogenic and diagenetic sources the pahs concentration ratios such as fia py pha an an an ph fia fia py baa baa chy and ip ip bghip liu et al 2008 baa baa chyr wang et al 2007 bap b g h i p wang et al 2010 an an phen flur flur pye chakraborty et al 2016b have been used in environmental samples as distinct chemical tracers to identify possible sources of pahs in this study pahs sources in water and sediment samples are determined from an an phen vs flur flur pye and in in bgp vs baa baa chry ratios table 3 in fig 4 the 85 ratios of an an phen were 0 1 and 15 of ratios were 0 1 which suggested a source of combustion and petroleum origin the 93 ratios of flur flur pye were 0 4 which showed a petrogenic origin 2 of ratios from 0 4 to 0 5 and 0 5 which suggested fuel combustion and coal grass wood burning in this study 37 ratios of baa baa chry were 0 2 and 63 of ratios were 0 35 which showed the source of pahs at drb is petrogenic and fuel combustion thus 100 ratios of in in bgp were less than 0 2 which showed a petrogenic origin for the sources of contamination in sediment samples the ratios of an an phen vs flur flur pye and in in bgp vs baa baa chry was used however the ratio of an an phen 0 1 indicates combustion and a ratio 0 1 the source of pahs are generally petroleum sources the flur flur pye ratios of 0 5 are considered as the transition point of combustion petroleum the flur flur pye ratios 0 5 shows a pyrolytic source and ratios of flur flur pye 0 5 considered as an origin of petrogenic source zhu et al 2008 the ratios of in in bgp 0 5 suggested a petrogenic origin and the ratios 0 5 indicates coal gross and wood combustion origins the ratios of baa baa chry a ratio 0 2 showed petrogenic origin ratios 0 35 suggested pyrogenic sources and the ratios between 0 2 and 0 35 showed a mixed source yunker et al 2002 the scatter plots for water and sediment samples were used for identifying the emission sources of pahs fig 4 in fig 4 the 89 ratios of an an phen were 0 1 and 11 of ratios were 0 1 which showed a combustion and petroleum sources the 63 ratios of flur flur pye were 0 5 31 were 0 5 and 5 of ratios were equal to 0 5 which showed a source of pyrolytic origin petrogenic origin and transition point of combustion petroleum respectively the 68 ratios of baa baa chry were 0 35 16 of ratios were from 0 2 to 0 35 and 15 of ratios were 0 2 which suggested a source of pyrogenic origin mixed sources and from the petrogenic origin furthermore 61 ratios of in in bgp were 0 5 and 39 of ratios were 0 5 which showed a petrogenic origin and coal gross and wood combustion origins 3 4 2 principal component analysis pca principal component analysis pca is a statistical tool traditionally used to highlight similarities and differences between large data sets and facilitate better visualization simpson et al 1996 doong and lin 2004 in this study the pca analysis was conducted for the sediment samples only no pca analysis for the data generated from the analysis of surface water samples was conducted since most pahs concentrations in the surface water sample were below the method detection limit the three principal components pcs pc1 pc2 and pc3 were extracted in sediment samples that accounted for more than 40 of the total variance the final coefficients of the eigenvectors based on the pcs were used for drawing inferences about the potential pahs sources in sediments table 4 the pca biplot of the sediments shown in fig 5 described the load of the pahs at pc 1 and pc 2 the principal component 1 pc 1 explained 17 58 of the total variance and heavily loaded with the lmw pahs na ac acy hmw pahs bkf in bgp and moderately loaded with pahs flur baa chry bbf bap da the pah na is the main component of diesel fuels and gasoline which may be formed by incomplete combustion dong and lee 2009 soltani et al 2015 pahs such as bkf are potentially resulting from wood combustion sources bixiong et al 2006 and in may be originated from pyrolysis or incomplete fuel combustion jiang et al 2009 bgp is generally a marker of automobile emissions liu et al 2009b thus pc 1 describes pahs sources due to incomplete fuel combustion and wood burning the diagnostic ratios analysis also validated similar results the principal component 2 pc 2 and principal component 3 pc 3 analysis explained 11 72 and 11 35 of the total variance and heavily loaded with the pahs such as ac in pc 2 and the pahs fluor flur chry bbf and da were heavily loaded in both pc 1 and pc 2 the pah chry was predominant in most sediment samples and generally identified with the coal combustion tavakoly et al 2014 the drb is one of the predominant mining and industrialized area in jharkhand and west bengal it has some of the largest coalfields such as jharia coalfield north kanakpura coalfield east bokaro coalfield and raniganj coalfield located within the drb as such coal combustion is one of the significant sources of emission of pahs in the drb other pahs like flur and da are primarily originated from the high amount of vehicular emissions tavakoly et al 2014 transportation of coal from mining sites may be a significant reason for vehicular emissions from pca and diagnostic ratio it is evident that pahs in the drb primarily originate from coal and fuel combustion petrogenic and pyrolysis sources 3 5 potential ecosystem risk assessment the pahs concentration in surface water samples at the drb was less than 10 μg l except for two pahs acy 36 μg l and baa 23 μg l these concentrations were higher than the world health organization stipulated 50 ng l standards for surface and coastal waters who 1998 according to one estimate pahs aqueous concentration greater than 10 μg l suggests extensive water contamination by pahs chen et al 2004 the higher concentration of these pahs potentially results in adverse biological effects for the aquatic organisms environmental scientists have developed effect based guideline values on the relationship between the contaminant concentration and toxic response exhibited by an organism these values were used to estimate the amount of pollution in sediments mccready et al 2006 liu et al 2009a 2014 long et al 1995 wang et al 2017 the effects were characterized as the effect range low er l and effect range median er m table 5 the probability of negative toxic effect is more than 50 and lower than 10 suggested that pahs concentration in sediments is higher than er m and lower than er l values the concentration of individual pahs recorded in this study ranged from non detect nd to 582 ng g all 16 pahs concentration was less than the er m values while the pahs like ac acy fluor baa and chry have higher concentration values than the er l hence these pahs can exert adverse biological responses at the sampling sites within the drb uncertainties are ubiquitous in all natural and life sciences mudelsee et al 2019 therefore validation of results with a higher confidence interval is required the uncertainties from the measurements arise due to limited data size hence the estimation may not be actual so an uncertainty measure must accompany estimation results by this the assessment of the accuracy of the estimation of results will be allowed hence it needs to present the estimates with the error 3 6 human health risk assessment human health risks due to exposure to the aqueous and sediment bound pahs were assessed the ilcr were calculated for exposure to pahs to children and adults the results show that the ilcr for seven carcinogenic pahs in surface water samples of the drb ranged from nd to 4 25 10 5 for children and nd to 7 21 10 5 for adults the ri sum of ilcr for the seven carcinogenic pahs was 4 3 10 5 for children and 7 3 10 5 for adults table 6 respectively according to the regulatory guidelines ilcr 10 6 indicates no or negligible risk similar to the risk arising from exposure to therapeutic procedures like x ray when ilcr 10 4 indicates a high risk with adverse health effects like cancer between these two extreme ilcr the risk is considered acceptable huang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the ilcrs calculated in this study are within the acceptable limit other carcinogenic pahs like bap da and in had concentration below the method detection limit and hence no ilcr was calculated the teq and meq values for the carcinogenic pahs baa chry bbf bkf bap da bgp in in the sediments were calculated using the values of tef and mef table 6 the total teq and meq values for eight pahs in sediments were 1865 ng kg and 1665 ng kg higher teq and meq values were due to the observed higher concentrations of baa bbf bap and da their higher concentration accounted for 92 of the total teq values and 79 of the total meq values for other carcinogenic pahs teq and meq values were significantly less except for bgp in meq that accounts for 8 of the total values 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the occurrence and distribution of usepa regulated 16 pahs in the drb and documented its concentration levels contamination sources human health and ecological risk assessment surprisingly some high molecular weight pahs bap da and in were absent in the surface water samples while others were detected at low concentration on the contrary much higher concentrations of the low molecular weight pahs pah acy and pah baa were detected in the surface water samples the diagnostic ratios analysis suggests that pahs in the surface water samples were attributed to the petrogenic origin and fuel combustion the concentration of some pahs in the sediment samples were below the effect range median er m values while the concentration of some pahs like ac acy fluor baa and chry were above effect range low er l values indicating potential adverse ecological risk two sampling sites s30 and s36 had a higher concentration of acy and baa respectively due to their low concentration in surface water the ilcr was below the acceptable level indicating no carcinogenic risk to human health the concentration of some pahs such as acy and baa in surface water were above the threshold limit of 10 μg l indicating an adverse effect on aquatic organisms the high amount of coal mining and industrial emission in this area may cause pahs contamination in sediments the diagnostic ratios and pca analysis suggest that the pahs occurrence in sediments were originated from coal and fuel combustion petrogenic and pyrolysis sources higher values of er l and er m were recorded for pahs in the sediment samples these higher values are attributed to the widespread detection of 4 ring pahs with some sampling sites at barakar river of the drb that had mean concentration as high as 83 ng g chry the total teq and meq values for sediment samples were calculated as 1865 ng kg and 1665 ng kg which are significantly higher than the values reported by other researchers the drb is located in one of the major coal mining areas accounting for nearly 46 of all indian coal reserves for example the rajrappa coal mining area situated on the bank of the damodar river holds a coal reserve of 72 million tons alone mohanty et al 2018 surface water and groundwater in the drb are at increased risk of pollution due to poorly managed mining waste discharge of a large volume of polluted water from underground open cast mines into the adjoining area is a significant concern in drb groundwater in the drb especially in the jharia coalfield one of the four large coalfields located in the drb occurs mostly in the unconfined shallow aquifers where pre monsoon groundwater depth ranges from 3 to 5 m singh et al 2008 discharge of drilling waste especially from the opencast mining activities dramatically increases groundwater pollution chances activities such as coal washing improper management of liquid effluent generated during the mining operation opencast mines unregulated discharge of slurry and surface runoff have great potential to contaminate the water resources in the area water pollution by acid mine drainage is a serious environmental concern worldwide luckily this is not a significant problem in the drb due to low sulfur and pyrite content coal in this region tiwary and dhar 1994 given that damodar river is the central part of the basin and millions of people living in the adjoining area use drb water for drinking and agricultural purposes preserving the water quality in the drb area should be given priority proactive measures are required to mitigate the continued deterioration of water quality in the drb particular emphasis should be placed on better management of mine waste and implementing best management practices for controlling sub surface runoff originating from the mining

11935,ingestion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs contaminated water has potential human health and ecological consequences a comprehensive investigation of pahs occurrence and distribution in the surface water and sediment samples of the damodar river basin was conducted using the agilent 7890b gas chromatograph gc fid coupled with 5977a mass spectrometry the results showed that concentrations of the individual pahs in surface water and sediments ranged from nd to 36 μg l and nd to 582 ng g with the highest detected levels of 3 ring pah acenapthylene acy and 4 ring pah benzo a anthracene baa with a mean concentration of 6 12 6 06 μg l and 2 79 4 5 μg l respectively the concentration of 4 ring pahs such as fluoranthene flur pyrene pye benzo a anthracene baa and chrysene chry in sediment samples has mean levels of 43 41 ng g 32 29 ng g 52 50 ng g and 83 105 ng g respectively the 4 ring pah chry was frequently detected in all sediment samples while the 3 ring pah acy was dominant in surface water samples the principal component analysis pca and diagnostic ratios suggested that the pahs contamination in surface water was due to petrogenic and fuel combustion in sediments pahs primary sources were coal burning fuel combustion petrogenic and pyrolysis the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr for children and adults due to ingestion of surface water ranged from nd to 4 25 10 5 and nd to 7 21 10 5 respectively in contrast the risk index ri values ranged from 4 3 10 5 and 7 3 10 5 for sediment samples higher toxic equivalent quotient teq 1865 ng kg and mutagenic equivalent quotient meq 1665 ng kg for eight carcinogenic pahs indicate extremely high toxicity improper management of mine drainage frequent flooding of open cast mines and hydraulic connection between the surface water sediments and groundwater significantly deteriorated overall water quality in the drb graphical abstract image 1 keywords diagnostic ratio ilcr principal component analysis petrogenic risk index 1 introduction the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs occur naturally in coal crude oil and gasoline while others are manufactured two of the primary natural sources of pahs include wild forest fire and volcanic eruptions liu et al 2014 some pahs are the byproduct of anthropogenic activities such as pahs released due to incomplete combustion of pahs containing substances coal oil gas creosote plastics pesticides dyes wood garbage and tobacco additional anthropogenic input includes oil spills urban runoff incomplete combustion domestic and industrial wastewater discharges vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions boonyatumanond et al 2006 zakaria et al 2002 adeniji et al 2019a the pahs are ubiquitous in the environment and often detected in various environmental matrices including soil water sediments and aquatic microorganisms countway et al 2003 chen et al 2004 cheollee et al 2005 wang et al 2018 stout et al 2004 the petrogenic and pyrogenic pahs were most abundant and generally formed by the reduction of biogenic precursors tongo et al 2017 xiao et al 2014 low molecular weight lmw pahs typical molecular structure comprises more than one fused aromatic ring of carbon and hydrogen atoms while the higher molecular weight hmw pahs comprised of four or more benzene rings and are far more stable and persistent than the lmw pahs to date approximately 200 such compounds have been detected in various environmental compartments pahs are hydrophobic and lipophilic making them susceptible to adsorption on the suspended particulates in the aquatic environment studies have reported that high pahs deposits on soil and estuarian lake and marine sediments could exert toxic effects on aquatic biota tolosa et al 2004 brazkova et al 2013 olatunji et al 2014 due to their higher toxicity mutagenic and carcinogenic potential pahs are of critical environmental concern the toxicity of pahs depends on the type of species molecular structure and exposure routes douben 2003 for example oral intake of pahs through food inhalation and dermal interaction causes a significant risk to human health such exposures could result in severe short and long term health effects including some major cardiovascular and respiratory diseases adeniji et al 2019 perez padilla et al 2010 based on pahs toxicity the united states environmental protection agency usepa has declared sixteen pahs as priority pollutants the rapid growth of industrialization has increased the daily emission of pahs lang et al 2008 zhang and tao 2009 for example developing countries like india and china have witnessed a steady increase in the environmental releases of pahs in 2004 three countries accounted for the maximum global atmospheric emission of usepa s 16 priority pahs they are china 114 gg y 1 india 90 gg y 1 and the united states 32 gg y 1 zhang and tao 2009 studies on pahs exposure in hooghly and brahmaputra river india khuman et al 2018 algoa bay south africa adeniji et al 2019a buffalo river estuary south africa adeniji et al 2019 gomti river india malik et al 2011 have raised serious concern on exposure to pahs and resulting in adverse human health impacts in recent years in india river water pollution has become one of the most significant issues due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization increased river water pollution in india is routinely reported the damodar river basin drb which includes many industries has witnessed large scale water pollution the drb is a seasonal water system situated in the mineral rich area of the chotanagpur plateau it receives both regulated and unregulated discharge from various industries including wastewater discharge from the steel industry coal washery mining and coke industry few studies have documented widespread pollution in the drb including heavy metal contamination soil erosion and deteriorating water overall water quality for the first time in this manuscript we document the occurrence distribution and human and ecological risk assessment due to pahs pollution in the drb the drb serves as a critical water resource for millions of inhabitants in the jharkhand and west bengal area who use water for domestic and agricultural purposes given the importance of drb we have decided to study the sources of pollution and the resulting impact on surface water sediments and groundwater need to be evaluated in this manuscript we have chosen pahs as a primary pollutant due to the nature of industries located in the areas large scale coal mining activities and the inhabitants general lifestyle we have documented the analysis of extensive surface water and sediment samples and evaluated groundwater vulnerability in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the drb is in one of the major industrial areas surrounded by four large coalfields jharia north kanakpura east bokaro and raniganj besides coalfields it is also home to several large thermal power plants captive steel plants and coal mines the location of drb is ideally suited to investigate the occurrence of pahs in surface water sediments and groundwater the drb lies between 22 n and 24 n latitude and 84 e to 88 e longitude covering approximately 23 170 km2 areas damodar river is the central part of the basin and millions of people living in the adjoining area use river water of the drb for drinking and agricultural purposes the damodar river situated in eastern india at elevation 1068 m is a small rain fed perennial river originates from the chhotanagpur hill khamerpet hill the total length of damodar river is 541 km out of which it 240 km in the state of jharkhand while the remaining flows in west bengal before finally merging into the bay of bengal bob besides the damodar river the drb has several tributaries and sub tributaries such as garga nalla barakar konar khudia jamunia katri tamna nalla and noonia it also has five reservoirs of which two are located on the barakar river at tilaiya and maithon two on damodar river at tenughat and panchet and one on konar river fig 1 damodar river receives the discharge from large scale industries in the area and unprecedented levels of mining activities further challenged the rivers assimilation capacity not surprisingly the damodar river is one of india s most polluted rivers singh et al 2008 singh and hasnain 1999 tiwary 2001 the drb is the repository of approximately 46 of india s entire coal reserve large scale coal mining activities in this area increase the net pollution load on the damodar river and the underlying groundwater tiwary and dhar 1994 improper management of mine water affects the surface water quality of the damodar river according to one estimate nearly 50 of the discharged effluent from coal mine water ends up in the damodar river additionally a series of coal washeries located on the riverbank often discharge polluted water containing fine coal particles thereby impacting the sediment quality many studies have documented the impact of mine drainage on surface and groundwater quality these studies mainly focused on the occurrence of ions total dissolved solids trace elements and water quality parameters to assess mining activities net impact on groundwater resources in this study we have focused on pahs occurrence in surface water and sediments in the damodar river impacted by industrial activities and mine drainage originating from several coalfields 2 2 sampling and pretreatment a total of n 108 samples including 54 sediment samples and 54 surface water samples were collected in the pre monsoon season february to april 2019 sediment samples were collected using a stainless steel van veen grab sampler aisi 316 station steel the grab 8 mm arms manufactured from the square tube 60 60 4 mm with 12 mm reinforcements from 5 cm to 7 cm depth and were packed in 2 kg capacity polythene bags the surface water samples were collected from half meter depth directly from the river using screw cap glass bottles 2 l before sampling the containers were thoroughly washed with diluted nitric acid 10 and deionized water to prevent potential cross contamination during sample handling and were rinsed with the respective samples during sampling salaudeen et al 2018 four subsamples of 1 liter capacity have been collected from the basin at four different points to obtain the representative water samples the subsamples were mixed in a steel bucket and a fixed quantity of 1 l sample was taken four sediment subsamples were collected from the basin near the sites in a random manner to form representative samples to preserve the samples they were kept in the icebox and transferred to the laboratory within 10 h the semi solid samples were kept in the refrigerator at 16 c until analysis the water samples were stored in the refrigerator at 3 c for further analysis 2 3 extraction clean up and analysis of pahs from samples for 16 pahs

presented in the study by chakraborty et al 2016a dichloromethane dcm was used for liquid liquid extraction three times 50 25 25 ml with 1 l of water samples the organic phase was then separated and collected by mixing 10 g sodium chloride and shaking it for 4 6 min this procedure was repeated three times and finally the combined organic phase was collected the drying process started by passing it through sodium sulfate placed on 3 cm thick glass wool a rotary evaporator hei vap core hand lift model with g1 diagonal glassware was used for concentrating the extract a standard solvent extraction procedure was used to extract pahs from sediment samples the dry samples were collected homogenized properly cultured and kept for the sample preparation this process included mixing 2 g of dry solid sample with 0 5 g anhydrous na2so4 and was sonicated using 10 ml of dcm for 1 h followed by centrifugation a 3 ml of supernatant was filtered through 2 g of silica gel column with 11 ml 1 1 v v elution of hexane and dcm chen et al 2007 the evaporation of solvent fractions was carried out with exchanging by acetonitrile with a final volume of 2 ml radiolabeled standards of pahs naphthalene d8 phenanthrene d10 and chrysene d12 were used as surrogate standards for sample extraction a silica gel glass column 30 cm long and 3 cm diameter glass filled with 10 g activated silica gel and 5 g anhydrous na2so4 was used the pahs were eluted using 100 ml of dcm and n hexane mixture 1 1 v v finally under a gentle stream of pure nitrogen the eluent solvent was concentrated to 20 μl the analytes were quantified by adding an internal standard of hexamethyl benzene before analysis khuman et al 2018 extracted water and sediment samples collected from the drb were analyzed to detect the usepa s 16 priority pahs the analytical quantitation was carried out using the agilent 7890b gas chromatograph gc fid system equipped with the flame ionization detector fid the system is coupled with 5977a mass spectrometry equipped with an hp 5 ms capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm with a 7 inch cage because of the low sensitivity of the single gc system we utilized the gc system coupled with the ms system which has its stand alone detector while using the ms system we only relied on the detector associated with the ms system in splitless mode 1 μl of each sample was injected high purity nitrogen gas was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 83 ml min in the beginning the oven temperature was set at 70 c for 1 min and then increased to 300 c at a rate of 5 c min 1 over 20 min the temperature of the injector and transfer line were maintained at 300 c and 325 c respectively 2 4 quality assurance and quality control for quality assurance and quality control field blank samples and sample duplicates were collected the samples spiked with radiolabeled surrogate standards phenanthrene d10 naphthalene d8 and chrysene d12 were used as an internal standard for calibration of all species of pahs the quality control for pahs analysis was ascertained from these samples the recovery percentages of 16 pahs in water and sediment samples were approximately 90 100 and 85 95 respectively the method detection limits mdls of the target pahs were calculated as three times the standard deviation sd plus the mean concentrations of target compounds in blank samples the mdls of the target pahs for sediment and surface water samples were 1 ng g and 0 1 μg l respectively the laboratory and field blanks were extracted and analyzed in the same way as the samples the concentration of pahs less than the method detection limits was deemed as non detect nd 2 5 health risk assessment for human health risk assessment the possibility of adverse health effects due to

concentration ccme 2010 lerda 2011 adeniji et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 pahs concentration in surface water and sediments the concentration of 16 pahs in surface water and sediments of the drb were summarized in table 1 except for the bap da and in all pahs were detected in water samples with a total mean concentration of 10 11 μg l and a total standard deviation of 11 59 μg l in the drb water samples pahs total concentration ranged from nd not detect to 36 μg l the three ring pahs were more dominant in water samples followed by the four rings pahs and contained about 67 and 28 of the total pahs concentration the three ring pahs acy and four ring pahs baa were dominant in most surface water samples a high concentration of these lmw pahs could be attributed to the high coal mining in the drb s valley this observation is consistent with the findings documented in numerous studies that reported large scale mining activities and widespread pahs pollution in soil sediments and water bodies the high concentration of pahs in the coal mining areas is well documented as evidenced by numerous studies for example studies conducted by ouyang et al 2018 have documented the presence of varying levels of three four ring pahs including 16 priority pahs in soil and sediments of coal mining subsidence areas in huainan china the authors attributed the occurrence of pahs in the surface sediments to the hydrogeological condition of the mining area similarly studies conducted by liu et al 2012 reported extensive pahs pollution in the tiefa coal mine district liaoning china the authors reported widespread pahs contamination in the mining zone soils agricultural and lake bank soils in the surrounding area of the tiefa coal mine through pca analysis the authors concluded that extensive mining activities in this area with pahs pollution originating from unburned coal 19 8 and coal gangue 26 7 while pahs pollution is mostly attributed to combustion sources the environmental impact of native hard coal is not fully understood according to achten and hofmann 2009 unburnt hard bituminous coal contains anywhere between hundreds to thousands of mg kg of pahs the macromolecular and mobile phase of the hard coal containing pahs is of particular concern due to its mobility and likelihood of its release during fugitive airborne emission accidental releases natural erosion of coal seams coal preparation and washing dumping of tailings loading operations and slumping and runoff from the storage area poses a more significant threat to the aquatic environment in this study the water samples s30 and s36 collected at the barakar river of the drb showed a higher concentration of acy and baa with a maximum concentration of acy and baa were found as 36 μg l and 23 μg l fig 2 the dominance of 3 ring acy in this study shows similarity with other studies in india gomti river malik et al 2009 brahmaputra and hooghly river khuman et al 2018 the concentration ranges of pahs in surface water found in this study were higher than the concentration of pahs reported at brahmaputra and hooghly river india khuman et al 2018 xiamen harbor china zhou et al 2000 ulsan bay korea khim et al 2001 and gao ping river taiwan doong and lin 2004 table 2 the concentration of pahs in the gomti river india malik et al 2011 is higher than the concentration reported in this study table 2 the absence and low concentration of hmw pahs in this study are similar to the other studies reported by gao ping river taiwan doong and lin 2004 and brahmaputra and hooghly river india khuman et al 2018 the hmw pahs 5 and 6 ring were not detected frequently and mostly absent in water samples as they remained adsorbed to sediments due to their non biodegradable nonvolatile and less water soluble properties jiries et al 2000 the pahs concentration in sediment samples showed a wide range of variations and almost all 16 pahs were detected in sediment samples among which chrysene was the most dominant pah compound that accounted for around 22 of the ʃ16 pahs mean concentration the detected concentrations of pahs for 2 ring 3 ring 4 ring 5 ring and 6 ring accounted for approximately 5 20 55 15 and 4 of the mean concentrations of ʃ16 pahs respectively the total pahs concentration ranged from nd not detected to 582 ng g with a higher concentration of 4 ring pahs the samples from s23 to s42 were rich in 4 ring pahs and a concentration of 582 ng g was detected at the sampling site s35 at barakar river one of the high coal mining areas the ʃ16 pahs mean sd is 380 365 ng g with an individual higher concentration of pah chry 83 105 ng g followed by baa 52 50 ng g the box plots clearly show the number of variations of pahs concentrations in sediments with a higher value of standard deviation and concentration of the 4 ring pahs fig 2 the toxic pahs like baa chry bbf and da were found in higher concentration than the other toxic pahs with mean values of 52 50 ng g 83 105 ng g 27 24 ng g and 15 10 ng g in this study the concentration of ʃ16 pahs in the sediment samples was lower than the concentration reported by similar studies in other riverine sediments such as the dalio river watershed china wei and mengchang 2007 gomti river india malik et al 2011 liaohe river basin china yang et al 2014 tonghui river china huang 2004 and ulsan bay korea khim et al 2001 table 2 pahs in the drb were comparable with riverine sediments from the hooghly and brahmaputra river india khuman et al 2018 kor river iran farshid and amir 2011 songhua river china xuesong and jing 2014 however they were more than the concentration reported from the gao ping river taiwan doong and lin 2004 and xiamen harbor in china zhou et al 2000 table 2 3 2 assessment of groundwater pollution vulnerability to pahs various studies have documented the adverse effect of mining activities on the groundwater resources at the drb most of these studies focused on assessing groundwater quality parameters such as ph total dissolved solids turbidity conductivity and sulfate the presence of various pahs in the surface water and sediments in the drb as discussed earlier can potentially impact groundwater in the drb three primary processes are responsible for pahs potential contamination of groundwater in the drb flooding of the damodar river discharge of washery effluents and induced recharge through direct hydraulic connection the sorbed pahs will remain confined to the sediments while the direct hydraulic connection between the groundwater and river water could transport hydrophilic pahs to the groundwater resources particularly during the river stages higher stages will artificially induce groundwater recharge thereby transporting pahs to the groundwater proximal to the wells in the drb series of pumping tests and modeling of aquifer stream water interaction using groundwater modeling system software showed that damodar river stages impact the groundwater flow in the drb roy et al 2015 the groundwater at the drb is increasingly vulnerable to various pollutants including pahs studies have shown that the groundwater in contact with coal bearing sediments is also vulnerable to coal mining drainage potentially enriching the groundwater with trace metals mohanty et al 2018 while the authors have indicated the groundwater vulnerability to pollution from mine drainage other contributory factors such as surface runoff potentially negate the adverse impact similarly singh et al 2008 demonstrated that groundwater in the drb area is indeed impacted by mining and other associated activities excavation and dumping the vulnerability of groundwater pollution due to pahs in the drb cannot be understated studies have shown pahs in the groundwater samples collected from the coal mine in henan province china wang et al 2009a b the authors have demonstrated that the lmw pahs such as naphthalene phenanthrene fluorene and chrysene were predominant in the groundwater samples similar results were also reported by chen et al 2019 documenting extensive pahs in the groundwater samples collected from six mines in xuzhou china the high concentration of lmw pahs and its subsurface mobility is a cause of concern due to its potential threat to groundwater resources studies conducted by liu et al 2012 in the tiefa coal mining area showed that extensive mining activities and poor coal mine waste management adversely affect water resources improper mine waste management such as dumped spoil tips coal gangue coal dust unburned coal and weathering leaching in the mining areas contaminate the surrounding soils with pahs and vertically mobilizes the lmw pahs thereby threatening the groundwater resources it is particularly true for the high solubility lmw pahs that deposits on the soil particulate matter that may eventually reach the shallow aquifer contaminating the groundwater liu et al 2012 for the first time we document the presence of a high concentration of low molecular weight pahs in the drb we also observed a high concentration of lmw pahs in the samples taken from and near the coal mining areas the evidence clearly shows a causal relationship between the coal mining activities in the area and the pahs occurrence distribution and the likelihood of groundwater pollution in the drb groundwater in the drb is a valuable resource and as such contamination of this resource due to lmw pahs originating from intensive coal mining operations in the region deserves serious consideration 3 3 pahs composition the 16 pahs are generally characterized by low 2 3 ring middle 4 ring and higher 5 6 ring molecular weight pahs the compositional diagrams of pahs in surface water and sediments of the drb are shown in fig 3 it shows that the lower and middle ring pahs were most abundant in surface water and sediment samples in general 2 ring pahs were dominant in surface water samples of the total ʃ16 pahs mean concentrations the 2 ring 3 ring and 4 ring accounted for 3 28 and 67 concentration the higher concentration of lmw pahs in surface water samples may be due to their high aqueous solubility and high vapor pressure xu et al 2014 on the contrary the hmw pahs compounds with low water solubility and hydrophobic nature tend to adsorb on sediments and suspended particulate matter li et al 2006 the pahs in sediment samples mainly composed of 3 ring 4 ring and 5 ring but the 2 ring and 6 ring pahs contribute a less amount towards the total pahs concentration the pahs of 2 ring 3 ring 4 ring 5 ring and 6 rings contribute 5 20 55 15 and 4 towards the ʃ16 pahs mean concentration respectively fig 3 compared to the pahs concentrations in the surface water samples the higher ring pahs were more dominant in the sediment samples due to their non biodegradable nonvolatile and less water soluble properties jiries et al 2000 3 4 pahs source identification 3 4 1 diagnostic ratio the concentration ratios or molecular ratios of some selected pahs are widely used for identifying the sources yunker et al 2002 the primary sources of pahs contamination are petrogenic pyrogenic and diagenetic sources the pahs concentration ratios such as fia py pha an an an ph fia fia py baa baa chy and ip ip bghip liu et al 2008 baa baa chyr wang et al 2007 bap b g h i p wang et al 2010 an an phen flur flur pye chakraborty et al 2016b have been used in environmental samples as distinct chemical tracers to identify possible sources of pahs in this study pahs sources in water and sediment samples are determined from an an phen vs flur flur pye and in in bgp vs baa baa chry ratios table 3 in fig 4 the 85 ratios of an an phen were 0 1 and 15 of ratios were 0 1 which suggested a source of combustion and petroleum origin the 93 ratios of flur flur pye were 0 4 which showed a petrogenic origin 2 of ratios from 0 4 to 0 5 and 0 5 which suggested fuel combustion and coal grass wood burning in this study 37 ratios of baa baa chry were 0 2 and 63 of ratios were 0 35 which showed the source of pahs at drb is petrogenic and fuel combustion thus 100 ratios of in in bgp were less than 0 2 which showed a petrogenic origin for the sources of contamination in sediment samples the ratios of an an phen vs flur flur pye and in in bgp vs baa baa chry was used however the ratio of an an phen 0 1 indicates combustion and a ratio 0 1 the source of pahs are generally petroleum sources the flur flur pye ratios of 0 5 are considered as the transition point of combustion petroleum the flur flur pye ratios 0 5 shows a pyrolytic source and ratios of flur flur pye 0 5 considered as an origin of petrogenic source zhu et al 2008 the ratios of in in bgp 0 5 suggested a petrogenic origin and the ratios 0 5 indicates coal gross and wood combustion origins the ratios of baa baa chry a ratio 0 2 showed petrogenic origin ratios 0 35 suggested pyrogenic sources and the ratios between 0 2 and 0 35 showed a mixed source yunker et al 2002 the scatter plots for water and sediment samples were used for identifying the emission sources of pahs fig 4 in fig 4 the 89 ratios of an an phen were 0 1 and 11 of ratios were 0 1 which showed a combustion and petroleum sources the 63 ratios of flur flur pye were 0 5 31 were 0 5 and 5 of ratios were equal to 0 5 which showed a source of pyrolytic origin petrogenic origin and transition point of combustion petroleum respectively the 68 ratios of baa baa chry were 0 35 16 of ratios were from 0 2 to 0 35 and 15 of ratios were 0 2 which suggested a source of pyrogenic origin mixed sources and from the petrogenic origin furthermore 61 ratios of in in bgp were 0 5 and 39 of ratios were 0 5 which showed a petrogenic origin and coal gross and wood combustion origins 3 4 2 principal component analysis pca principal component analysis pca is a statistical tool traditionally used to highlight similarities and differences between large data sets and facilitate better visualization simpson et al 1996 doong and lin 2004 in this study the pca analysis was conducted for the sediment samples only no pca analysis for the data generated from the analysis of surface water samples was conducted since most pahs concentrations in the surface water sample were below the method detection limit the three principal components pcs pc1 pc2 and pc3 were extracted in sediment samples that accounted for more than 40 of the total variance the final coefficients of the eigenvectors based on the pcs were used for drawing inferences about the potential pahs sources in sediments table 4 the pca biplot of the sediments shown in fig 5 described the load of the pahs at pc 1 and pc 2 the principal component 1 pc 1 explained 17 58 of the total variance and heavily loaded with the lmw pahs na ac acy hmw pahs bkf in bgp and moderately loaded with pahs flur baa chry bbf bap da the pah na is the main component of diesel fuels and gasoline which may be formed by incomplete combustion dong and lee 2009 soltani et al 2015 pahs such as bkf are potentially resulting from wood combustion sources bixiong et al 2006 and in may be originated from pyrolysis or incomplete fuel combustion jiang et al 2009 bgp is generally a marker of automobile emissions liu et al 2009b thus pc 1 describes pahs sources due to incomplete fuel combustion and wood burning the diagnostic ratios analysis also validated similar results the principal component 2 pc 2 and principal component 3 pc 3 analysis explained 11 72 and 11 35 of the total variance and heavily loaded with the pahs such as ac in pc 2 and the pahs fluor flur chry bbf and da were heavily loaded in both pc 1 and pc 2 the pah chry was predominant in most sediment samples and generally identified with the coal combustion tavakoly et al 2014 the drb is one of the predominant mining and industrialized area in jharkhand and west bengal it has some of the largest coalfields such as jharia coalfield north kanakpura coalfield east bokaro coalfield and raniganj coalfield located within the drb as such coal combustion is one of the significant sources of emission of pahs in the drb other pahs like flur and da are primarily originated from the high amount of vehicular emissions tavakoly et al 2014 transportation of coal from mining sites may be a significant reason for vehicular emissions from pca and diagnostic ratio it is evident that pahs in the drb primarily originate from coal and fuel combustion petrogenic and pyrolysis sources 3 5 potential ecosystem risk assessment the pahs concentration in surface water samples at the drb was less than 10 μg l except for two pahs acy 36 μg l and baa 23 μg l these concentrations were higher than the world health organization stipulated 50 ng l standards for surface and coastal waters who 1998 according to one estimate pahs aqueous concentration greater than 10 μg l suggests extensive water contamination by pahs chen et al 2004 the higher concentration of these pahs potentially results in adverse biological effects for the aquatic organisms environmental scientists have developed effect based guideline values on the relationship between the contaminant concentration and toxic response exhibited by an organism these values were used to estimate the amount of pollution in sediments mccready et al 2006 liu et al 2009a 2014 long et al 1995 wang et al 2017 the effects were characterized as the effect range low er l and effect range median er m table 5 the probability of negative toxic effect is more than 50 and lower than 10 suggested that pahs concentration in sediments is higher than er m and lower than er l values the concentration of individual pahs recorded in this study ranged from non detect nd to 582 ng g all 16 pahs concentration was less than the er m values while the pahs like ac acy fluor baa and chry have higher concentration values than the er l hence these pahs can exert adverse biological responses at the sampling sites within the drb uncertainties are ubiquitous in all natural and life sciences mudelsee et al 2019 therefore validation of results with a higher confidence interval is required the uncertainties from the measurements arise due to limited data size hence the estimation may not be actual so an uncertainty measure must accompany estimation results by this the assessment of the accuracy of the estimation of results will be allowed hence it needs to present the estimates with the error 3 6 human health risk assessment human health risks due to exposure to the aqueous and sediment bound pahs were assessed the ilcr were calculated for exposure to pahs to children and adults the results show that the ilcr for seven carcinogenic pahs in surface water samples of the drb ranged from nd to 4 25 10 5 for children and nd to 7 21 10 5 for adults the ri sum of ilcr for the seven carcinogenic pahs was 4 3 10 5 for children and 7 3 10 5 for adults table 6 respectively according to the regulatory guidelines ilcr 10 6 indicates no or negligible risk similar to the risk arising from exposure to therapeutic procedures like x ray when ilcr 10 4 indicates a high risk with adverse health effects like cancer between these two extreme ilcr the risk is considered acceptable huang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 the ilcrs calculated in this study are within the acceptable limit other carcinogenic pahs like bap da and in had concentration below the method detection limit and hence no ilcr was calculated the teq and meq values for the carcinogenic pahs baa chry bbf bkf bap da bgp in in the sediments were calculated using the values of tef and mef table 6 the total teq and meq values for eight pahs in sediments were 1865 ng kg and 1665 ng kg higher teq and meq values were due to the observed higher concentrations of baa bbf bap and da their higher concentration accounted for 92 of the total teq values and 79 of the total meq values for other carcinogenic pahs teq and meq values were significantly less except for bgp in meq that accounts for 8 of the total values 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the occurrence and distribution of usepa regulated 16 pahs in the drb and documented its concentration levels contamination sources human health and ecological risk assessment surprisingly some high molecular weight pahs bap da and in were absent in the surface water samples while others were detected at low concentration on the contrary much higher concentrations of the low molecular weight pahs pah acy and pah baa were detected in the surface water samples the diagnostic ratios analysis suggests that pahs in the surface water samples were attributed to the petrogenic origin and fuel combustion the concentration of some pahs in the sediment samples were below the effect range median er m values while the concentration of some pahs like ac acy fluor baa and chry were above effect range low er l values indicating potential adverse ecological risk two sampling sites s30 and s36 had a higher concentration of acy and baa respectively due to their low concentration in surface water the ilcr was below the acceptable level indicating no carcinogenic risk to human health the concentration of some pahs such as acy and baa in surface water were above the threshold limit of 10 μg l indicating an adverse effect on aquatic organisms the high amount of coal mining and industrial emission in this area may cause pahs contamination in sediments the diagnostic ratios and pca analysis suggest that the pahs occurrence in sediments were originated from coal and fuel combustion petrogenic and pyrolysis sources higher values of er l and er m were recorded for pahs in the sediment samples these higher values are attributed to the widespread detection of 4 ring pahs with some sampling sites at barakar river of the drb that had mean concentration as high as 83 ng g chry the total teq and meq values for sediment samples were calculated as 1865 ng kg and 1665 ng kg which are significantly higher than the values reported by other researchers the drb is located in one of the major coal mining areas accounting for nearly 46 of all indian coal reserves for example the rajrappa coal mining area situated on the bank of the damodar river holds a coal reserve of 72 million tons alone mohanty et al 2018 surface water and groundwater in the drb are at increased risk of pollution due to poorly managed mining waste discharge of a large volume of polluted water from underground open cast mines into the adjoining area is a significant concern in drb groundwater in the drb especially in the jharia coalfield one of the four large coalfields located in the drb occurs mostly in the unconfined shallow aquifers where pre monsoon groundwater depth ranges from 3 to 5 m singh et al 2008 discharge of drilling waste especially from the opencast mining activities dramatically increases groundwater pollution chances activities such as coal washing improper management of liquid effluent generated during the mining operation opencast mines unregulated discharge of slurry and surface runoff have great potential to contaminate the water resources in the area water pollution by acid mine drainage is a serious environmental concern worldwide luckily this is not a significant problem in the drb due to low sulfur and pyrite content coal in this region tiwary and dhar 1994 given that damodar river is the central part of the basin and millions of people living in the adjoining area use drb water for drinking and agricultural purposes preserving the water quality in the drb area should be given priority proactive measures are required to mitigate the continued deterioration of water quality in the drb particular emphasis should be placed on better management of mine waste and implementing best management practices for controlling sub surface runoff originating from the mining

11936,long term 9 years from 2011 and spatial 106 points in 2012 and 2013 observation of water temperature and electric conductivity were conducted for groundwater and river water throughout the kurobe river basin to clarify the recharge area and recharge situation for the safety use of groundwater resources the results of these observations show that the water temperature of the river rose in the lower basin 0 3 c 100 m but that the temperature of the coastal area was lower than the annual average the ec rises further away from the river indicating that kurobe river water have been infiltrated into ground and the interaction with the rocks is progressing most groundwater in the alluvial fan was recharged from the top of the fan however the coastal area was recharged from a river about 142 450 masl about 13 34 km from an estuary of the kurobe river graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater water temperature electric conductivity long term observations alluvium fan 1 introduction groundwater is used for various purposes including domestic water industrial water and agricultural water however excessive pumping of groundwater is a factor responsible for obstacles such as salinization of groundwater land subsidence and well withering groundwater failures have occurred in large numbers throughout the world causing many types of damage including cracks in farmland level differences in roads destruction of water pipes deterioration of embankments and building collapse e g yanaka et al 1989 hachiya et al 1996 sun et al 1999 onizuka and negami 2006 phien wej et al 2006 marfai and king 2007 in coastal areas groundwater has become salinized and unusable as drinking water causing incompatibility as industrial water and salt damage to crops e g yada 1970 shimizu and kurokawa 1975 kishira 1983 al rashed et al 1998 sherif et al 2012 shi and jiao 2014 it takes time to recover the groundwater environment where groundwater failure occurs it is therefore necessary to observe the groundwater environment over a wide area and a long time period to continuously and effectively utilize groundwater at the kurobe river alluvial fan in the eastern part of toyama prefecture annual groundwater pumping from april 1986 was 56 million m3 year toyama prefecture 1992 from april 2015 it was 32 million m3 year toyama prefecture 2018 decreasing by 24 million m3 year over 29 years however groundwater levels across alluvial fans show a statistically significant decreasing trend and salinization has been reported in certain coastal areas because of reduced groundwater levels tebakari 2010 tebakari et al 2015 matsuura et al 2017a in recent years groundwater has been used as a heat source for renewable energy this use case is growing in china europe the united states and northern europe ministry of the environment 2015 vienken et al 2019 in this system the temperature difference between groundwater and the outside air is used to melt snow on roads and perform indoor air conditioning using a geothermal heat pump ground source heat pump systems gshp the number of global gshp installations in 2020 6 46 million was nearly twice as high as in 2010 lund and toth 2020 the installation of gshp in japan is accelerating thus showing a threefold increase 2230 cases over 2010 ministry of the environment 2017 there are two types of gshp open loop and closed loop in an open loop gshp system groundwater pumped up to the surface is heat exchanged using a heat exchanger and returned to the aquifer through a reduction well after cooling and heating closed loop gshp systems however perform heat exchange underground by burying u shaped piping and circulating antifreeze liquid as heat medium if this gshp is used as a heat source for snow melting on roads and indoor cooling and heating in the kurobe river alluvial fan it is expected to both reduce the lowering of the water level in the alluvial fan and to be highly effective for energy saving furthermore neither type of gshp system discharges groundwater to the surface this indicates that they cause neither environmental pollution nor ground subsidence making gshp a remarkable solution for groundwater level lowering via excessive setting for winter snowmelt however to use the open loop gshp for a long time period it is necessary to supply a certain amount of groundwater and groundwater temperature is an important factor to determine the system s heat exchange rate research on groundwater quality and flow conditions has been extensively conducted using geochemical methods such as major and minor chemical components stable isotopes such as hydrogen oxygen and sulfur isotopes and radioisotopes such as tritium the measurements of water temperature and electric conductivity ec of groundwater and river water are not new technology fidelibus and pulido bosch 2016 stonestrom and constantz 2003 however it is possible to discuss the origin and flow situation of groundwater in the target area by observing them over a wide area and over a long time period water temperature and ec can be easily measured even at the local government school or individual level where expensive equipment cannot be used the groundwater temperature is somewhat constant throughout the year at depths of 10 m or more and the groundwater with residence time of 1 year or more shows temperature equal to or slightly lower than the annual average temperature e g yamamoto 1992 bartolino and niswonger 1999 bartolino 2003 sekiya 2003 hanova and dowlatabadi 2007 it can therefore be said that water temperature is an important natural tracer for clarifying the flow of groundwater because the residence time of groundwater can be estimated by comparing the temperature and air temperature of groundwater and river water e g taniguchi 1993 anderson 2005 genton et al 2005 baena et al 2009 bailly comte et al 2011 konishi et al 2020 electric conductivity is extensively used for monitoring the

observed groundwater level water temperature and ec at 191 points throughout the kurobe river alluvial fan from 1969 to 1971 for 2 years they reported no significant changes in groundwater flow mode between irrigation and non irrigation periods and that the groundwater was recharged from the top to the middle of the fan note that the testing 50 sites of groundwater and river water on the right side bank of the alluvial fan maruyama 2006 calculated the proportion of river water from the kurobe river in the alluvial fan groundwater based on observation of water temperature ec and dissolved ions for seven periods from 2002 to 2003 and the observation of groundwater level for five years the results showed that kurobe river water infiltrated underground from the central part over the fan edge throughout the year and that the contribution of river water lowers as it moves away from the kurobe river this study aims to understand the current groundwater flow in the kurobe alluvial fan especially in the coastal area to continuously and effectively utilize groundwater there are a number of artesian wells in the coastal areas however there is concern about a decrease in the amount of discharge in recent years this suggests that the flow rate across the alluvial fan has decreased this investigation performed analysis taking the whole area of adjacent alluvial fan and the catchment area in the mountainous area as a water source as an object to grasp the flow condition of groundwater in the coastal area of alluvial fan in the past matsuura et al 2017b observed seasonal changes in the amount of groundwater flowing out naturally in the coastal area and its water quality ph ec water temperature dissolved ion concentration and discharge rate for five years from 2011 to 2016 in this study we continued to observe the observation sites by matsuura et al 2017 b newly collected river water and groundwater fig 1 a throughout the kurobe river basin and conducted a wide area survey of alluvial fans in 2012 and 2013 to investigate groundwater sources and their relationships in coastal areas fig 1b in this study changes in groundwater environment contributing to the kurobe river alluvial fan were investigated focusing on water temperature and ec which can be easily and inexpensively observed by anyone in previous wide area surveys the number of observation sites for groundwater was small and the observation density was as low as 0 007 0 08 points km2 however in this study we conducted a detailed survey of 106 points with observation density as high as 1 1 points km2 fig 1b in addition to these results recharge sources and flow changes of groundwater in the kurobe alluvial fan particularly in the coastal area were investigated 2 overview and geology of the kurobe river basin kurobe river located in the northeastern part of toyama prefecture originates in mt washiba at an altitude of 2924 m and has a catchment area of 682 km2 fig 1a in the river the channel length is 85 km and the riverbed gradient is 1 5 1 80 in the mountainous area and 1 80 1 120 in the alluvial fan area therefore a large amount of gravel is transported and gravel with a large particle size 2 50 mm accumulates in the downstream area thus forming the kurobe river alluvial fan the alluvial fan measures 13 4 km from fan top to ocean 96 km2 area and 1 100 gradient and is shaped such as a fan with concentric contour fig 1b fig 2 a shows a geological map of the study area aist 2019 konno et al 1992 the mountainous area of the kurobe river basin is formed from granite and granodiorite which are mesozoic and quaternary igneous rocks the kurobe river alluvial fan is covered with gravel layers which are quaternary fan deposits the alluvial fan has hunami terrace lower level on the east side and the terrace faces of urayama terrace lower level maesawa terrace middle level and junikanno terrace high level on the west side kurobe river is an inundated river and its channel has changed with the times moving from north to south many old river channels remain in the area their density is particularly high in the right bank area fig 2b yamamoto and kayane 1971 the main aquifer in the kurobe river alluvial fan is composed of gravel and gravel layers composed of present day alluvial fan deposits sg or pleistocene old alluvial fan deposits g1 g3 equivalent and the kurehayama formation g1 g3 equivalent g4 sg or the deposits of the current alluvial fan are generally uniform throughout the area from 0 to 100 m deep tebakari et al 2016 groundwater that enters under the clay layer becomes confined and forms the artesian zone at the fan edge it passes through the highly permeable gravel layer sandwiched in the clay layer and forms the spring water zone in the sea bed zhang and satake 2003 this gravel layer is reported in the present river channel furthermore because the topsoil is thin the subsidence of surface water becomes large in the kurobe river alluvial fan therefore rice paddy cultivation on alluvial fans was once known for severe water leakage however water leakage from rice paddies has considerably decreased as a result of foundation improvement projects performed since 1951 kagose 1957 3 observation point and observation method as a long term observation in this study we carried out the observation of groundwater at 29 points and river water at 28 points in the section of 85 km from the kurobe river upstream area 2546 masl above sea level to the downstream area 1 masl the observation period was from april 2011 to june 2020 for 9 years however the data from 2011 to 2016 is based on matsuura et al 2017b and the same observation points was used until 2020 tables 1 a and 1b fig 1a the observation points were classified into three area based on altitude area i 190 m area ii 190 1600 m and area iii 1600 m fig 1a and b the observation point at no 29 is groundwater flowing out from the tateyama fault zone located outside the kurobe river basin fig 1a as a wide area investigation of the kurobe river alluvial fan groundwater and river water in the alluvial fan were observed in july 2012 and august and september 2013 fig 1b table 3

annually in august during the period from 2014 to 2016 and 2018 2019 was the period from july to september long term observation items were water temperature ec and ph which were observed using a

logger interval is 5 min from november 8 2013 to january 23 2014 and 10 min from july 9 2014 to june 24 2020 in the long term observation of water samples along the alluvial fan coast the amount of groundwater discharge was observed at 15 points table 1a the time until a container of 15 l became full of water was observed three times and the average value was adopted 4 results and discussion 4 1 temperature and ec of river water on long term observations figs 3 6 show the results of long term observations of river water temperature and ec in the kurobe river basin the observation point numbers correspond to tables 1 and 2 and fig 1a and b fig 3 shows the monthly changes in water temperatures and ecs of representative river water samples in area i ii and iii from march 2011 to june 2020 fig 3 shows the points with the longest observation period as representative points in each area no 33 in area i no 39 in area ii and no 48 in area ⅲ moreover fig 3a shows the monthly mean temperature at the uozu meteorological observatory fig 1a of area i japan meteorological agency 2020 the temperature of river water varies greatly from about 1 5 to 27 5 c water samples in area iii were collected only around august every year and so no changes were observed in areas i and ii temperature wildly fluctuates rising in summer july to september and declining in winter december to february fig 3a and b this reflects changes in air temperature fig 3a river water ecs varied in the range of 5 35 ms m in area i and ii fig 3a and b the ec of no 33 s river water in area i was observed to decrease from april to june fig 3a in this study the data of water temperature in all years are only available for area i and only summer and august data are available for area ii and iii respectively to compare and examine the annual water temperature of the river water with elevation the water temperature data in each region were compared with those of the river water no 33 in area i fig 4a consequently a relatively good correlation was reported from the correlation obtained the water temperature of each month at no 39 in area ii was estimated red line in fig 4b the estimated values agreed well with the measured values black line except for one part a good correlation shown by the following equation was obtained between the average annual mean water temperature of the river water at the observation points and the elevation obtained by this method fig 4c 1 elevation m 328 water temperature c 3831 r2 0 75 n 6 fig 4c shows the average water temperature in march july and november at each observation points indicating that there is a correlation of the same gradient 5 c 1200 m as the annual average fig 5 shows the results of ec observation at no 33 during heavy snowfall 2018 and light snowfall 2019 and the time series changes of snow depth at keyakidaira and river discharge at the top of the fan ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2020 the river discharge increases in the period from april to june because of snowmelt water consequently the ec of no 33 during this period was diluted and reduced by snowmelt water the snow depth at keyakidaira in 2018 was deeper than in 2019 and the peak snow depth in february was about 140 cm deeper than in 2019 ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2020 consequently the river discharge in 2018 was larger than that in 2019 during snowmelt april to june in both 2018 and 2019 the ec of no 33 decreased from march to may however the ec of no 33 in 2018 was lower than in 2019 this is attributed to the dilution of ec in 2018 river discharge increased in 2018 because of snowmelt water thus it was clarified that the ec value of the river water in the downstream area changed by the difference of snow accumulation in the upstream area in area ii no 39 the results showed higher values of ec in september and october 2014 october 2015 july september and october 2016 and august and september 2018 it is assumed that this is due to the increase of groundwater level in the stratum and the inflow of groundwater with high ec into the river 4 2 long term observations of groundwater temperatures and ecs in the kurobe river basin fig 6 shows changes over month in groundwater temperature and ec in the kurobe river basin because the behavior of water temperature and ec in area i is similar at all observations groundwater in the vicinity of the river on the right side and left side banks and groundwater away from the river were shown as representative observations in the right side bank the groundwater near the river is no 17 and the groundwater away from the river is no 14 on the left side bank groundwater near the river is no 10 and groundwater away from the river is no 2 no 7 is also shown in fig 6 because it behaves differently from the other groundwater fig 6a shows the daily average temperature japan meteorological agency 2020 at the uozu meteorological observatory of the japan meteorological agency the observation points in area ii were selected based on the observation by matsuura et al 2017c and analysis of tritium concentration in the groundwater the groundwater temperature at five points nos 2 7 10 14 and 17 in area i showed seasonal change similar to the air temperature data with an increase in summer june to august and a decrease in winter december to february however the fluctuation range was as small as 3 3 4 7 c compared with river water fig 6a the water temperatures of no 10 and no 17 groundwater near the river were lower than those of no 2 and no 14 groundwater far from the river however groundwater at no 2 and no 14 showed values close to the average daily mean temperature this indicates that the kurobe river alluvial fan is a site where the groundwater contribution rate of river water decreases and that from precipitation increases as the area leaves the river this result is similar to the result okakita et al 2019 analyzed using the oxygen isotope ratio of precipitation river water and groundwater the groundwater temperature in area ii tended to rise in summer although the number of data was small it is a feature that the ec of groundwater fluctuated little throughout the year at both five points in area i and one point in area ii fig 6a and b the groundwater of no 7 has higher ec than other sites this is because the concentration of dissolved ions such as hco3 ca2 na and k is higher here than in other groundwater matsuura et al 2017b the ec of no 14 was 8 7 16 4 ms m mean 12 3 ms m which was higher than that of no 10 in the same area this is because the distance from kurobe river for no 10 and no 14 is 400 m and 4 3 km respectively the residence time of groundwater is long and the reaction with rocks is advanced no 29 in area ii had a lower ec than that of area i groundwater the tritium concentration in the groundwater in area i was 3 3 5 tu and the residence time was estimated to be 60 years matsuura et al 2017c the tritium concentration in the groundwater of no 29 was 3 4 tu which was the same as in area i and the residence time was estimated to be the same therefore the groundwater of no 29 is recharged by river water and precipitation with high elevation and low ec 4 3 changes in groundwater discharge amount in the kurobe river basin on long term observations fig 6a shows the monthly changes in the amount of groundwater discharge from march 2011 to june 2020 the amount of the no 17 groundwater was larger than that of other groundwater therefore its value is shown on the right axis in fig 6a because the change of artesian groundwater discharge at each observation shows similar behavior this study illustrates water temperature and discharge amount at the same observation no 7 is not shown in fig 6a because the amount of discharge was not observed whereas no 26 was illustrated because it showed behavior unlike other observations for comparison fig 6a shows monthly mean precipitation at uozu meteorological observatory from 2011 to 2019 japan meteorological agency 2020 in no 10 and no 17 in the vicinity of the river there is a seasonal variation the amount of artesian groundwater discharge increases from february to august and decreases from september to february fig 6a it is a rainy season from may to august and the amount of recharge from the rice field to the underground increases because the rice field is flooded with water from february to may the water level of the river rose from snowmelt note that the discharge amount of artesian groundwater increased because of infiltration from the river to the underground however in the period from january to march note that the discharge amount of artesian groundwater decreased because of the small amount of rainfall and the small amount of river water in no 2 and no 14 located away from the river the time of increase of the amount of spouting is delayed by 1 2 months compared with points in the vicinity of the river the effect of the rise of the river water level reduced because the residence time lengthened by being away from the river however no 26 has a seasonal variation in which the amount of artesian groundwater decreases from march to june and increases from october to march the seasonal variation of the amount of artesian groundwater was different from other points whereas that of no 26 did not increase from may to september when the river discharge rate increased no 26 is in a mountainous and hilly area therefore precipitation is its main source of recharge fig 2b 4 4 spatial observation of groundwater temperature and ec in the kurobe river alluvial fan in 2012 and 2013 fig 8a and c shows the spatial distributions of water temperature and ec in the kurobe river alluvial fan in july 2012 are shown in respectively the groundwater temperature in the alluvial fan showed a range of 11 1 24 1 c table 3 the water temperature of groundwater near the estuary was low 12 c however the temperature around the central part of the fan was close to 20 c from the result predicted from the simultaneous river discharge observation takeuchi et al 2012 tebakari et al 2016 the infiltration section in kurobe river is around the center of the fan located from 5 3 to 10 8 km from the river mouth this agrees with the present result furthermore although there are water temperatures of 24 c in certain areas these samples are considered to have risen in water temperature because the water within the tanks could not be adequately replaced with fresh groundwater while sampling this is excluded from fig 7 a fig 7b shows the difference in groundwater temperature between july 2012 and august 2013 in the central part of the fan along the kurobe river the water temperature difference was within 5 c because of the large amount of infiltration from rivers in the subsidence section the temperature difference became larger however with increase in distance from kurobe river and the water temperature difference remarkably appears even in the groundwater in the point close to the hunami and maesawa terrace planes fig 2b because groundwater in these areas is primarily composed of precipitation okakita et al 2019 it is assumed that precipitation gushes out in a short time period after it infiltrates into the ground strongly reflecting temperature related changes the ec of groundwater in the alluvial fan shows a range of 10 40 ms m across the entire area the ec of groundwater near kurobe river is low and then increases with distance from rivers fig 7c accordingly it is determined that the groundwater close to kurobe river is considerably affected by river water in hunami and maesawa terraces in the south of the study area ec is higher compared to other areas moreover there is almost no effect of the kurobe river water fig 7d shows difference in ec between july 2012 and august 2013 in the urayama terrace ec increased and there was no difference in water temperature therefore unlike other terrace surfaces it is considered that the residence time of this groundwater is extensive 4 5 groundwater recharge sources and flow patterns in the kurobe river alluvial fan groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan originates from a mixture of precipitation and river water as demonstrated by oxygen and hydrogen isotope studies mizutani et al 2001 okakita et al 2019 most of the catchment area of the kurobe river is a mountainous area in the northern alps containing 3000 m class mountains fig 1a furthermore the precipitation that falls on this area flows to the kurobe river it has been reported that isotopic ratios in kurobe river do not seasonally vary although the precipitation is altitudinal and isotopic ratios are low this is because for several years precipitation stays underground before flowing into rivers satake et al 1984 from the water temperature results of water samples obtained in this study in the area of the alluvial fan infiltration from kurobe river was predominant in the rivers vicinity however the contribution decreased with increase in distance and precipitation became the primary source of recharge in the middle area of kurobe and ogawa rivers groundwater was observed to change its water temperature by 5 c in 2012 and 2013 suggesting that precipitation strongly affected by temperature change seeped in and gushed out because the temperature difference between january and august was 30 c fig 6a it is unlikely that the rainwater seeped underground and gushed out in a few days or weeks although it is assumed that the rainwater gushed out after staying for 1 year fig 8a and b shows vertical profiles of groundwater temperature at 100 and 200 m from kurobe river at points no 19 and no 21 fig 1a at depths of 1 5 and 20 m in 2017 although these two wells are adjacent we examined the extent of the impact of kurobe river water interpolation was then performed using the kriging method at depths where no observation sites existed the result of no 19 in depth from 0 to 20 m showed little seasonal variation from 12 c to 16 c throughout the year however the water temperature of no 21 was observed to rise from may to november to a maximum depth of 10 m and to decrease from december to april kurobe river is known to be affected by snowmelt in the period from may to july every year and that the river discharge increases in the period from september to october because of rainfall fig 2b shows that no 21 is in the old river channel near the river and is strongly influenced by kurobe river furthermore no 19 is not located on the old river channel which seems to result in little seasonal variation throughout the year fig 9 shows the relationship between the average water temperature and distance of artesian groundwater in coastal areas to rivers cross sectional view of the line a a in fig 1a for all points except for the shallow groundwater of 5 m depth nos 18 22 no 24 and no 7 the groundwater temperature increased with increase in the distance from the river the groundwater temperatures of nos 9 10 17 and 23 close the river showed values close to the average of the water temperatures of no 33 river water however the groundwater temperature of no 14 which is the furthest from the river was 1 5 c higher than that in the vicinity of the river furthermore it showed a value close to the annual average temperature fig 9a the cause of the spatial variation of the groundwater temperature in the alluvial fan is that the water temperature of the groundwater became uniform and approached the annual mean temperature as the residence time increased with the distance from the river the same spatial characteristics were obtained for ec fig 9b furthermore it has been reported that the groundwater temperature is almost constant throughout the year at depths of 10 m or more and that groundwater with a residence time of 1 year coincides with or shows a slightly lower value than the annual average temperature of the area e g yamamoto 1992 sekiya 2003 hanova and dowlatabadi 2007 however the groundwater temperature in the kurobe river alluvial fan seasonally changes it rises in summer and falls in winter fig 8 the groundwater in the vicinity of the river is 2 3 c lower than the annual average temperature fig 9 thus it is possible to estimate groundwater flow by comparing water temperature air temperature and ec of groundwater and river water water temperature in the coastal area of the kurobe alluvial fan is lesser than that in other areas of the alluvial fan this cannot be explained by the infiltration of the water from the top of the fan to the end of the fan from kurobe river the annual mean water temperature of river water decreases with elevation fig 4c therefore it is possible that in the high altitude area the artesian groundwater in the coastal area is recharged from river water fig 4c shows the relationship between the annual mean value and elevation from may 2014 to november 2019 when comparing the relation between water temperature and altitude in august fig 3c the inclination agrees note that the intercept was larger at water temperature and altitude in august it is considered that this is caused by the rise in water temperature of river water because of air temperature in this study the recharge area of artesian groundwater in the coastal area was estimated using the mean value of groundwater temperature in the low water season january consequently the recharge elevation is estimated to be between 142 and 450 m and it is considered that there are recharge areas in area ii from nos 34 to 37 table 4 shows the calculation results of the ratio of river water in the area of alluvial fan to that in the area of 142 450 m above recharge elevation using the temperature difference the contribution of river water in the alluvial fan was lesser in the groundwater on the left side bank nos 2 10 than in the groundwater on the right side bank nos 14 17 however in the central part of the alluvial fan it was estimated that the flow from kurobe river to the underground was more significant in the right side bank than the left this was similar to the results of groundwater contour analysis of the fan kita and tebakari 2015 5 conclusions in this study we investigated groundwater in the kurobe river basin once a month for nine years from 2011 to 2020 up to 2016 data from matsuura et al 2017c were cited and conducted detailed surveys in july 2012 and from august to september 2013 at 106 groundwater points observed density 1 1 samples km2 in the kurobe river alluvial fan as a result of spatial observation in the whole kurobe river basin ec has seasonal variation only in area i of river water moreover ec rises on the downstream area and it is anticipated that precipitation infiltrating the mountain reacts with rocks and that ec rises and flows into the river seasonal changes in water temperature were observed in all area with an increase in summer and a decrease in winter it was clarified that the water temperature of the river water was lowered by the incorporation of snowmelt water in the place where the altitude near the headwater is high the groundwater temperature of the kurobe river alluvial fan increased in summer and decreased in winter the period during which groundwater temperature increased and coincided with the period during which river discharge increased because of snowmelt and precipitation it was additionally clarified that ec and water temperature rose the residence time of groundwater in the alluvial fan lengthened the contribution rate from the river decreased and the contribution rate from the precipitation increased as a site s distance to kurobe river increased the water temperature of groundwater in the area on the left bank of kurobe river nos 19 20 reflected the changes in river water and air temperature 1 2 months and 7 8 months later respectively it was clarified that groundwater with long residence time existed in certain points even in groundwater shallower than 5 m in depth the water temperature rose by 0 3 c 100 m as it flowed down it was able to be used as a tracer for estimating recharge areas of alluvial fan groundwater from 2011 to 2019 river water temperature in the kurobe river basin was used to estimate the recharge area of alluvial fan groundwater the results show that the main recharge area was a river at the top of the fan in the central part of the fan where groundwater was shallower than 5 m in depth and subsidence was observed however the groundwater in the artesian zone in the coastal zone had lower water temperature than both the rivers at the top of the fan and the annual mean air temperature the river water from nos 34 37 was estimated to be the main recharge area by estimating groundwater flow in the alluvial fan using seasonal change of underground water temperature in january and august it was determined that infiltration from river to groundwater in the alluvial fan was more significant on the right bank side than on the left bank side in this manner the water temperature and ec of river water and groundwater can be easily measured and provide important information for analyzing groundwater flow declaration of

11936,long term 9 years from 2011 and spatial 106 points in 2012 and 2013 observation of water temperature and electric conductivity were conducted for groundwater and river water throughout the kurobe river basin to clarify the recharge area and recharge situation for the safety use of groundwater resources the results of these observations show that the water temperature of the river rose in the lower basin 0 3 c 100 m but that the temperature of the coastal area was lower than the annual average the ec rises further away from the river indicating that kurobe river water have been infiltrated into ground and the interaction with the rocks is progressing most groundwater in the alluvial fan was recharged from the top of the fan however the coastal area was recharged from a river about 142 450 masl about 13 34 km from an estuary of the kurobe river graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater water temperature electric conductivity long term observations alluvium fan 1 introduction groundwater is used for various purposes including domestic water industrial water and agricultural water however excessive pumping of groundwater is a factor responsible for obstacles such as salinization of groundwater land subsidence and well withering groundwater failures have occurred in large numbers throughout the world causing many types of damage including cracks in farmland level differences in roads destruction of water pipes deterioration of embankments and building collapse e g yanaka et al 1989 hachiya et al 1996 sun et al 1999 onizuka and negami 2006 phien wej et al 2006 marfai and king 2007 in coastal areas groundwater has become salinized and unusable as drinking water causing incompatibility as industrial water and salt damage to crops e g yada 1970 shimizu and kurokawa 1975 kishira 1983 al rashed et al 1998 sherif et al 2012 shi and jiao 2014 it takes time to recover the groundwater environment where groundwater failure occurs it is therefore necessary to observe the groundwater environment over a wide area and a long time period to continuously and effectively utilize groundwater at the kurobe river alluvial fan in the eastern part of toyama prefecture annual groundwater pumping from april 1986 was 56 million m3 year toyama prefecture 1992 from april 2015 it was 32 million m3 year toyama prefecture 2018 decreasing by 24 million m3 year over 29 years however groundwater levels across alluvial fans show a statistically significant decreasing trend and salinization has been reported in certain coastal areas because of reduced groundwater levels tebakari 2010 tebakari et al 2015 matsuura et al 2017a in recent years groundwater has been used as a heat source for renewable energy this use case is growing in china europe the united states and northern europe ministry of the environment 2015 vienken et al 2019 in this system the temperature difference between groundwater and the outside air is used to melt snow on roads and perform indoor air conditioning using a geothermal heat pump ground source heat pump systems gshp the number of global gshp installations in 2020 6 46 million was nearly twice as high as in 2010 lund and toth 2020 the installation of gshp in japan is accelerating thus showing a threefold increase 2230 cases over 2010 ministry of the environment 2017 there are two types of gshp open loop and closed loop in an open loop gshp system groundwater pumped up to the surface is heat exchanged using a heat exchanger and returned to the aquifer through a reduction well after cooling and heating closed loop gshp systems however perform heat exchange underground by burying u shaped piping and circulating antifreeze liquid as heat medium if this gshp is used as a heat source for snow melting on roads and indoor cooling and heating in the kurobe river alluvial fan it is expected to both reduce the lowering of the water level in the alluvial fan and to be highly effective for energy saving furthermore neither type of gshp system discharges groundwater to the surface this indicates that they cause neither environmental pollution nor ground subsidence making gshp a remarkable solution for groundwater level lowering via excessive setting for winter snowmelt however to use the open loop gshp for a long time period it is necessary to supply a certain amount of groundwater and groundwater temperature is an important factor to determine the system s heat exchange rate research on groundwater quality and flow conditions has been extensively conducted using geochemical methods such as major and minor chemical components stable isotopes such as hydrogen oxygen and sulfur isotopes and radioisotopes such as tritium the measurements of water temperature and electric conductivity ec of groundwater and river water are not new technology fidelibus and pulido bosch 2016 stonestrom and constantz 2003 however it is possible to discuss the origin and flow situation of groundwater in the target area by observing them over a wide area and over a long time period water temperature and ec can be easily measured even at the local government school or individual level where expensive equipment cannot be used the groundwater temperature is somewhat constant throughout the year at depths of 10 m or more and the groundwater with residence time of 1 year or more shows temperature equal to or slightly lower than the annual average temperature e g yamamoto 1992 bartolino and niswonger 1999 bartolino 2003 sekiya 2003 hanova and dowlatabadi 2007 it can therefore be said that water temperature is an important natural tracer for clarifying the flow of groundwater because the residence time of groundwater can be estimated by comparing the temperature and air temperature of groundwater and river water e g taniguchi 1993 anderson 2005 genton et al 2005 baena et al 2009 bailly comte et al 2011 konishi et al 2020 electric conductivity is extensively used for monitoring the

2020 the groundwater environment around the kurobe river alluvial fan has been primarily observed on the basis of single year sampling analyses of major chemical constituents and stable isotopes kayane and oba 1972 shimano et al 1992 mizutani et al 2001 tokunaga et al 2003 takeuchi et al 2012 tebakari et al 2013 2016 kita and tebakari 2015 onitsuka and negami 2006 yamamoto and kayane 1971 observed groundwater level water temperature and ec at 191 points throughout the kurobe river alluvial fan from 1969 to 1971 for 2 years they reported no significant changes in groundwater flow mode between irrigation and non irrigation periods and that the groundwater was recharged from the top to the middle of the fan note that the testing 50 sites of groundwater and river water on the right side bank of the alluvial fan maruyama 2006 calculated the proportion of river water from the kurobe river in the alluvial fan groundwater based on observation of water temperature ec and dissolved ions for seven periods from 2002 to 2003 and the observation of groundwater level for five years the results showed that kurobe river water infiltrated underground from the central part over the fan edge throughout the year and that the contribution of river water lowers as it moves away from the kurobe river this study aims to understand the current groundwater flow in the kurobe alluvial fan especially in the coastal area to continuously and effectively utilize groundwater there are a number of artesian wells in the coastal areas however there is concern about a decrease in the amount of discharge in recent years this suggests that the flow rate across the alluvial fan has decreased this investigation performed analysis taking the whole area of adjacent alluvial fan and the catchment area in the mountainous area as a water source as an object to grasp the flow condition of groundwater in the coastal area of alluvial fan in the past matsuura et al 2017b observed seasonal changes in the amount of groundwater flowing out naturally in the coastal area and its water quality ph ec water temperature dissolved ion concentration and discharge rate for five years from 2011 to 2016 in this study we continued to observe the observation sites by matsuura et al 2017 b newly collected river water and groundwater fig 1 a throughout the kurobe river basin and conducted a wide area survey of alluvial fans in 2012 and 2013 to investigate groundwater sources and their relationships in coastal areas fig 1b in this study changes in groundwater environment contributing to the kurobe river alluvial fan were investigated focusing on water temperature and ec which can be easily and inexpensively observed by anyone in previous wide area surveys the number of observation sites for groundwater was small and the observation density was as low as 0 007 0 08 points km2 however in this study we conducted a detailed survey of 106 points with observation density as high as 1 1 points km2 fig 1b in addition to these results recharge sources and flow changes of groundwater in the kurobe alluvial fan particularly in the coastal area were investigated 2 overview and geology of the kurobe river basin kurobe river located in the northeastern part of toyama prefecture originates in mt washiba at an altitude of 2924 m and has a catchment area of 682 km2 fig 1a in the river the channel length is 85 km and the riverbed gradient is 1 5 1 80 in the mountainous area and 1 80 1 120 in the alluvial fan area therefore a large amount of gravel is transported and gravel with a large particle size 2 50 mm accumulates in the downstream area thus forming the kurobe river alluvial fan the alluvial fan measures 13 4 km from fan top to ocean 96 km2 area and 1 100 gradient and is shaped such as a fan with concentric contour fig 1b fig 2 a shows a geological map of the study area aist 2019 konno et al 1992 the mountainous area of the kurobe river basin is formed from granite and granodiorite which are mesozoic and quaternary igneous rocks the kurobe river alluvial fan is covered with gravel layers which are quaternary fan deposits the alluvial fan has hunami terrace lower level on the east side and the terrace faces of urayama terrace lower level maesawa terrace middle level and junikanno terrace high level on the west side kurobe river is an inundated river and its channel has changed with the times moving from north to south many old river channels remain in the area their density is particularly high in the right bank area fig 2b yamamoto and kayane 1971 the main aquifer in the kurobe river alluvial fan is composed of gravel and gravel layers composed of present day alluvial fan deposits sg or pleistocene old alluvial fan deposits g1 g3 equivalent and the kurehayama formation g1 g3 equivalent g4 sg or the deposits of the current alluvial fan are generally uniform throughout the area from 0 to 100 m deep tebakari et al 2016 groundwater that enters under the clay layer becomes confined and forms the artesian zone at the fan edge it passes through the highly permeable gravel layer sandwiched in the clay layer and forms the spring water zone in the sea bed zhang and satake 2003 this gravel layer is reported in the present river channel furthermore because the topsoil is thin the subsidence of surface water becomes large in the kurobe river alluvial fan therefore rice paddy cultivation on alluvial fans was once known for severe water leakage however water leakage from rice paddies has considerably decreased as a result of foundation improvement projects performed since 1951 kagose 1957 3 observation point and observation method as a long term observation in this study we carried out the observation of groundwater at 29 points and river water at 28 points in the section of 85 km from the kurobe river upstream area 2546 masl above sea level to the downstream area 1 masl the observation period was from april 2011 to june 2020 for 9 years however the data from 2011 to 2016 is based on matsuura et al 2017b and the same observation points was used until 2020 tables 1 a and 1b fig 1a the observation points were classified into three area based on altitude area i 190 m area ii 190 1600 m and area iii 1600 m fig 1a and b the observation point at no 29 is groundwater flowing out from the tateyama fault zone located outside the kurobe river basin fig 1a as a wide area investigation of the kurobe river alluvial fan groundwater and river water in the alluvial fan were observed in july 2012 and august and september 2013 fig 1b table 3 the observed frequency of long term water samples varies from area to area it is once a month in area i groundwater nos 1 26 river water nos 30 33 in area ii groundwater nos 27 29 river water nos 34 42 monthly sampling was conducted from may to november every year from december to april observation was impossible because of snow in area iii river water nos 43 57 only river water was observed annually in august during the period from 2014 to 2016 and 2018 2019 was the period from july to september long term observation items were water temperature ec and ph which were observed using a portable water quality meter horiba laquaactd 70 es 70 in the field in addition to water temperature ec and ph oxidation reduction potential orp was measured with an orp meter toa rm 12 p at sample

logger interval is 5 min from november 8 2013 to january 23 2014 and 10 min from july 9 2014 to june 24 2020 in the long term observation of water samples along the alluvial fan coast the amount of groundwater discharge was observed at 15 points table 1a the time until a container of 15 l became full of water was observed three times and the average value was adopted 4 results and discussion 4 1 temperature and ec of river water on long term observations figs 3 6 show the results of long term observations of river water temperature and ec in the kurobe river basin the observation point numbers correspond to tables 1 and 2 and fig 1a and b fig 3 shows the monthly changes in water temperatures and ecs of representative river water samples in area i ii and iii from march 2011 to june 2020 fig 3 shows the points with the longest observation period as representative points in each area no 33 in area i no 39 in area ii and no 48 in area ⅲ moreover fig 3a shows the monthly mean temperature at the uozu meteorological observatory fig 1a of area i japan meteorological agency 2020 the temperature of river water varies greatly from about 1 5 to 27 5 c water samples in area iii were collected only around august every year and so no changes were observed in areas i and ii temperature wildly fluctuates rising in summer july to september and declining in winter december to february fig 3a and b this reflects changes in air temperature fig 3a river water ecs varied in the range of 5 35 ms m in area i and ii fig 3a and b the ec of no 33 s river water in area i was observed to decrease from april to june fig 3a in this study the data of water temperature in all years are only available for area i and only summer and august data are available for area ii and iii respectively to compare and examine the annual water temperature of the river water with elevation the water temperature data in each region were compared with those of the river water no 33 in area i fig 4a consequently a relatively good correlation was reported from the correlation obtained the water temperature of each month at no 39 in area ii was estimated red line in fig 4b the estimated values agreed well with the measured values black line except for one part a good correlation shown by the following equation was obtained between the average annual mean water temperature of the river water at the observation points and the elevation obtained by this method fig 4c 1 elevation m 328 water temperature c 3831 r2 0 75 n 6 fig 4c shows the average water temperature in march july and november at each observation points indicating that there is a correlation of the same gradient 5 c 1200 m as the annual average fig 5 shows the results of ec observation at no 33 during heavy snowfall 2018 and light snowfall 2019 and the time series changes of snow depth at keyakidaira and river discharge at the top of the fan ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2020 the river discharge increases in the period from april to june because of snowmelt water consequently the ec of no 33 during this period was diluted and reduced by snowmelt water the snow depth at keyakidaira in 2018 was deeper than in 2019 and the peak snow depth in february was about 140 cm deeper than in 2019 ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2020 consequently the river discharge in 2018 was larger than that in 2019 during snowmelt april to june in both 2018 and 2019 the ec of no 33 decreased from march to may however the ec of no 33 in 2018 was lower than in 2019 this is attributed to the dilution of ec in 2018 river discharge increased in 2018 because of snowmelt water thus it was clarified that the ec value of the river water in the downstream area changed by the difference of snow accumulation in the upstream area in area ii no 39 the results showed higher values of ec in september and october 2014 october 2015 july september and october 2016 and august and september 2018 it is assumed that this is due to the increase of groundwater level in the stratum and the inflow of groundwater with high ec into the river 4 2 long term observations of groundwater temperatures and ecs in the kurobe river basin fig 6 shows changes over month in groundwater temperature and ec in the kurobe river basin because the behavior of water temperature and ec in area i is similar at all observations groundwater in the vicinity of the river on the right side and left side banks and groundwater away from the river were shown as representative observations in the right side bank the groundwater near the river is no 17 and the groundwater away from the river is no 14 on the left side bank groundwater near the river is no 10 and groundwater away from the river is no 2 no 7 is also shown in fig 6 because it behaves differently from the other groundwater fig 6a shows the daily average temperature japan meteorological agency 2020 at the uozu meteorological observatory of the japan meteorological agency the observation points in area ii were selected based on the observation by matsuura et al 2017c and analysis of tritium concentration in the groundwater the groundwater temperature at five points nos 2 7 10 14 and 17 in area i showed seasonal change similar to the air temperature data with an increase in summer june to august and a decrease in winter december to february however the fluctuation range was as small as 3 3 4 7 c compared with river water fig 6a the water temperatures of no 10 and no 17 groundwater near the river were lower than those of no 2 and no 14 groundwater far from the river however groundwater at no 2 and no 14 showed values close to the average daily mean temperature this indicates that the kurobe river alluvial fan is a site where the groundwater contribution rate of river water decreases and that from precipitation increases as the area leaves the river this result is similar to the result okakita et al 2019 analyzed using the oxygen isotope ratio of precipitation river water and groundwater the groundwater temperature in area ii tended to rise in summer although the number of data was small it is a feature that the ec of groundwater fluctuated little throughout the year at both five points in area i and one point in area ii fig 6a and b the groundwater of no 7 has higher ec than other sites this is because the concentration of dissolved ions such as hco3 ca2 na and k is higher here than in other groundwater matsuura et al 2017b the ec of no 14 was 8 7 16 4 ms m mean 12 3 ms m which was higher than that of no 10 in the same area this is because the distance from kurobe river for no 10 and no 14 is 400 m and 4 3 km respectively the residence time of groundwater is long and the reaction with rocks is advanced no 29 in area ii had a lower ec than that of area i groundwater the tritium concentration in the groundwater in area i was 3 3 5 tu and the residence time was estimated to be 60 years matsuura et al 2017c the tritium concentration in the groundwater of no 29 was 3 4 tu which was the same as in area i and the residence time was estimated to be the same therefore the groundwater of no 29 is recharged by river water and precipitation with high elevation and low ec 4 3 changes in groundwater discharge amount in the kurobe river basin on long term observations fig 6a shows the monthly changes in the amount of groundwater discharge from march 2011 to june 2020 the amount of the no 17 groundwater was larger than that of other groundwater therefore its value is shown on the right axis in fig 6a because the change of artesian groundwater discharge at each observation shows similar behavior this study illustrates water temperature and discharge amount at the same observation no 7 is not shown in fig 6a because the amount of discharge was not observed whereas no 26 was illustrated because it showed behavior unlike other observations for comparison fig 6a shows monthly mean precipitation at uozu meteorological observatory from 2011 to 2019 japan meteorological agency 2020 in no 10 and no 17 in the vicinity of the river there is a seasonal variation the amount of artesian groundwater discharge increases from february to august and decreases from september to february fig 6a it is a rainy season from may to august and the amount of recharge from the rice field to the underground increases because the rice field is flooded with water from february to may the water level of the river rose from snowmelt note that the discharge amount of artesian groundwater increased because of infiltration from the river to the underground however in the period from january to march note that the discharge amount of artesian groundwater decreased because of the small amount of rainfall and the small amount of river water in no 2 and no 14 located away from the river the time of increase of the amount of spouting is delayed by 1 2 months compared with points in the vicinity of the river the effect of the rise of the river water level reduced because the residence time lengthened by being away from the river however no 26 has a seasonal variation in which the amount of artesian groundwater decreases from march to june and increases from october to march the seasonal variation of the amount of artesian groundwater was different from other points whereas that of no 26 did not increase from may to september when the river discharge rate increased no 26 is in a mountainous and hilly area therefore precipitation is its main source of recharge fig 2b 4 4 spatial observation of groundwater temperature and ec in the kurobe river alluvial fan in 2012 and 2013 fig 8a and c shows the spatial distributions of water temperature and ec in the kurobe river alluvial fan in july 2012 are shown in respectively the groundwater temperature in the alluvial fan showed a range of 11 1 24 1 c table 3 the water temperature of groundwater near the estuary was low 12 c however the temperature around the central part of the fan was close to 20 c from the result predicted from the simultaneous river discharge observation takeuchi et al 2012 tebakari et al 2016 the infiltration section in kurobe river is around the center of the fan located from 5 3 to 10 8 km from the river mouth this agrees with the present result furthermore although there are water temperatures of 24 c in certain areas these samples are considered to have risen in water temperature because the water within the tanks could not be adequately replaced with fresh groundwater while sampling this is excluded from fig 7 a fig 7b shows the difference in groundwater temperature between july 2012 and august 2013 in the central part of the fan along the kurobe river the water temperature difference was within 5 c because of the large amount of infiltration from rivers in the subsidence section the temperature difference became larger however with increase in distance from kurobe river and the water temperature difference remarkably appears even in the groundwater in the point close to the hunami and maesawa terrace planes fig 2b because groundwater in these areas is primarily composed of precipitation okakita et al 2019 it is assumed that precipitation gushes out in a short time period after it infiltrates into the ground strongly reflecting temperature related changes the ec of groundwater in the alluvial fan shows a range of 10 40 ms m across the entire area the ec of groundwater near kurobe river is low and then increases with distance from rivers fig 7c accordingly it is determined that the groundwater close to kurobe river is considerably affected by river water in hunami and maesawa terraces in the south of the study area ec is higher compared to other areas moreover there is almost no effect of the kurobe river water fig 7d shows difference in ec between july 2012 and august 2013 in the urayama terrace ec increased and there was no difference in water temperature therefore unlike other terrace surfaces it is considered that the residence time of this groundwater is extensive 4 5 groundwater recharge sources and flow patterns in the kurobe river alluvial fan groundwater in the kurobe river alluvial fan originates from a mixture of precipitation and river water as demonstrated by oxygen and hydrogen isotope studies mizutani et al 2001 okakita et al 2019 most of the catchment area of the kurobe river is a mountainous area in the northern alps containing 3000 m class mountains fig 1a furthermore the precipitation that falls on this area flows to the kurobe river it has been reported that isotopic ratios in kurobe river do not seasonally vary although the precipitation is altitudinal and isotopic ratios are low this is because for several years precipitation stays underground before flowing into rivers satake et al 1984 from the water temperature results of water samples obtained in this study in the area of the alluvial fan infiltration from kurobe river was predominant in the rivers vicinity however the contribution decreased with increase in distance and precipitation became the primary source of recharge in the middle area of kurobe and ogawa rivers groundwater was observed to change its water temperature by 5 c in 2012 and 2013 suggesting that precipitation strongly affected by temperature change seeped in and gushed out because the temperature difference between january and august was 30 c fig 6a it is unlikely that the rainwater seeped underground and gushed out in a few days or weeks although it is assumed that the rainwater gushed out after staying for 1 year fig 8a and b shows vertical profiles of groundwater temperature at 100 and 200 m from kurobe river at points no 19 and no 21 fig 1a at depths of 1 5 and 20 m in 2017 although these two wells are adjacent we examined the extent of the impact of kurobe river water interpolation was then performed using the kriging method at depths where no observation sites existed the result of no 19 in depth from 0 to 20 m showed little seasonal variation from 12 c to 16 c throughout the year however the water temperature of no 21 was observed to rise from may to november to a maximum depth of 10 m and to decrease from december to april kurobe river is known to be affected by snowmelt in the period from may to july every year and that the river discharge increases in the period from september to october because of rainfall fig 2b shows that no 21 is in the old river channel near the river and is strongly influenced by kurobe river furthermore no 19 is not located on the old river channel which seems to result in little seasonal variation throughout the year fig 9 shows the relationship between the average water temperature and distance of artesian groundwater in coastal areas to rivers cross sectional view of the line a a in fig 1a for all points except for the shallow groundwater of 5 m depth nos 18 22 no 24 and no 7 the groundwater temperature increased with increase in the distance from the river the groundwater temperatures of nos 9 10 17 and 23 close the river showed values close to the average of the water temperatures of no 33 river water however the groundwater temperature of no 14 which is the furthest from the river was 1 5 c higher than that in the vicinity of the river furthermore it showed a value close to the annual average temperature fig 9a the cause of the spatial variation of the groundwater temperature in the alluvial fan is that the water temperature of the groundwater became uniform and approached the annual mean temperature as the residence time increased with the distance from the river the same spatial characteristics were obtained for ec fig 9b furthermore it has been reported that the groundwater temperature is almost constant throughout the year at depths of 10 m or more and that groundwater with a residence time of 1 year coincides with or shows a slightly lower value than the annual average temperature of the area e g yamamoto 1992 sekiya 2003 hanova and dowlatabadi 2007 however the groundwater temperature in the kurobe river alluvial fan seasonally changes it rises in summer and falls in winter fig 8 the groundwater in the vicinity of the river is 2 3 c lower than the annual average temperature fig 9 thus it is possible to estimate groundwater flow by comparing water temperature air temperature and ec of groundwater and river water water temperature in the coastal area of the kurobe alluvial fan is lesser than that in other areas of the alluvial fan this cannot be explained by the infiltration of the water from the top of the fan to the end of the fan from kurobe river the annual mean water temperature of river water decreases with elevation fig 4c therefore it is possible that in the high altitude area the artesian groundwater in the coastal area is recharged from river water fig 4c shows the relationship between the annual mean value and elevation from may 2014 to november 2019 when comparing the relation between water temperature and altitude in august fig 3c the inclination agrees note that the intercept was larger at water temperature and altitude in august it is considered that this is caused by the rise in water temperature of river water because of air temperature in this study the recharge area of artesian groundwater in the coastal area was estimated using the mean value of groundwater temperature in the low water season january consequently the recharge elevation is estimated to be between 142 and 450 m and it is considered that there are recharge areas in area ii from nos 34 to 37 table 4 shows the calculation results of the ratio of river water in the area of alluvial fan to that in the area of 142 450 m above recharge elevation using the temperature difference the contribution of river water in the alluvial fan was lesser in the groundwater on the left side bank nos 2 10 than in the groundwater on the right side bank nos 14 17 however in the central part of the alluvial fan it was estimated that the flow from kurobe river to the underground was more significant in the right side bank than the left this was similar to the results of groundwater contour analysis of the fan kita and tebakari 2015 5 conclusions in this study we investigated groundwater in the kurobe river basin once a month for nine years from 2011 to 2020 up to 2016 data from matsuura et al 2017c were cited and conducted detailed surveys in july 2012 and from august to september 2013 at 106 groundwater points observed density 1 1 samples km2 in the kurobe river alluvial fan as a result of spatial observation in the whole kurobe river basin ec has seasonal variation only in area i of river water moreover ec rises on the downstream area and it is anticipated that precipitation infiltrating the mountain reacts with rocks and that ec rises and flows into the river seasonal changes in water temperature were observed in all area with an increase in summer and a decrease in winter it was clarified that the water temperature of the river water was lowered by the incorporation of snowmelt water in the place where the altitude near the headwater is high the groundwater temperature of the kurobe river alluvial fan increased in summer and decreased in winter the period during which groundwater temperature increased and coincided with the period during which river discharge increased because of snowmelt and precipitation it was additionally clarified that ec and water temperature rose the residence time of groundwater in the alluvial fan lengthened the contribution rate from the river decreased and the contribution rate from the precipitation increased as a site s distance to kurobe river increased the water temperature of groundwater in the area on the left bank of kurobe river nos 19 20 reflected the changes in river water and air temperature 1 2 months and 7 8 months later respectively it was clarified that groundwater with long residence time existed in certain points even in groundwater shallower than 5 m in depth the water temperature rose by 0 3 c 100 m as it flowed down it was able to be used as a tracer for estimating recharge areas of alluvial fan groundwater from 2011 to 2019 river water temperature in the kurobe river basin was used to estimate the recharge area of alluvial fan groundwater the results show that the main recharge area was a river at the top of the fan in the central part of the fan where groundwater was shallower than 5 m in depth and subsidence was observed however the groundwater in the artesian zone in the coastal zone had lower water temperature than both the rivers at the top of the fan and the annual mean air temperature the river water from nos 34 37 was estimated to be the main recharge area by estimating groundwater flow in the alluvial fan using seasonal change of underground water temperature in january and august it was determined that infiltration from river to groundwater in the alluvial fan was more significant on the right bank side than on the left bank side in this manner the water temperature and ec of river water and groundwater can be easily measured and provide important information for analyzing groundwater flow declaration of

11937,the pampean plain in argentina is one of the most extended plain regions of the world with numerous wetland systems and very shallow lakes certain anomalies related to geomorphology and shallow lakes hydrology are particularly present in a sector of the southern pampean plain specifically in the southwestern limit of the quequén grande river basin here shallow lakes can be defined as upland embedded wetlands characterized by the lack of observable hydrological connectivity due to the absence of surface water flows the aim of this study was to identify groundwater connectivity of pampean

hydrological and biogeochemical cycles harboring a large part of the world s biodiversity and providing multiple services to humankind from local to global scales mea 2005 despite these important benefits they are threatened by the impacts of climate change and human activities including hydrological changes intense resource exploitation and pollution gardner et al 2015 kandus et al 2018 triggering numerous environmental and social problems fang et al 2016 therefore monitoring of these aquatic systems and producing reliable up to date maps of these areas are important in terms of both biological habitats and human activities amani et al 2017 xing and niu 2019 in situ data collection is highly informative about changes in the hydrological functioning of shallow lakes and the related environmental drivers and consequences of those changes gallant 2015 since shallow lakes are complex dynamic systems connected to the water cycle through both surface and underground inflow and outflow as well as via precipitation evaporation fluxes the interaction with the local environment can be determinate by using natural tracers the combined use of natural tracers such as heat electrical conductivity ec cl and so4 2 content and 18o 16o 2h 1h allow to distinguish different lake water origins and water mixing suggest water residence time and identify hydrological connectivity

consuming and many water bodies are in remote locations or logistically challenging to monitor having a restricted access due to the higher natural fragmentation and temporal variability of wetlands zoffoli et al 2008 remote sensing becomes a key tool to address the complexity of these ecosystems because satellite images are multi temporal multispectral and provide repeated extensive coverage for monitoring lake changes over time ozesmi and bauer 2002 gallant 2015 fang et al 2016 amani et al 2017 in this sense several hydrologic information can be obtained including the extension of water

in multitemporal analysis such as the normalized water index ndwi gao 1996 and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 which are the most broadly applied spectral indices proposed for mapping and monitoring wetlands zoffoli et al 2008 borro et al 2014 guo et al 2017 kaplan and avdan 2017 south america is the continent with the largest area covered by wetlands 3 106 km2 representing more than 20 of its surface zhu and gong 2014 during the last 10 years a substantial increase of research works related to remote sensing in wetland studies has taken place in this continent most of them associated with floodplains of large rivers zoffoli et al 2008 borro et al 2014 kandus et al 2018 particularly the pampean plain in argentina is one of the most extended plain regions of the world with numerous lentic systems being shallow lakes the most abundant lake type in the landscape iriondo and kröhling 2007 this region is characterized by the occurrence of drought flood period alternation initially quoted by ameghino 1896 which affects the availability of water resources and the hydrological functioning of shallow lakes lakes here are permanent or intermittent typically shallow 2 m and highly variable in size salinity and nutrient content quirós and drago 1999 certain anomalies related to geomorphology and shallow lakes hydrology are particularly present in a sector of the southern pampean plain specifically in the southwestern limit of the quequén grande river basin here shallow lakes can be defined as upland embedded wetlands i e condition of being surrounded by uplands as the relevant distinguishing characteristic according to mushet et al 2015 and calhoun et al 2017 several studies have reported hydrologic connectivity of upland embedded wetlands with other surface water systems wilcox et al 2011 forbes et al 2012 however there is a lack of observable hydrological connectivity in the study area due to the absence of surface water flows e g rivers stream channels despite this water movement can also be along flow paths that are difficult to observe such as shallow sub surface or groundwater flows mushet et al 2015 neff et al 2020 in this complex hydrological scenario shallow lakeś hydrological dynamics and functioning are little known in the area the aim of this study was to identify groundwater connectivity of pampean

and analyze the response of these ecosystems to climate change and human activities xing and niu 2019 2 study area the study area is located in the southeast of buenos aires province according to thornthwaite classification thornthwaite 1948 the climate is dry sub humid mesothermal type b2 kruse et al 1996 over the past eight years annual precipitation values have ranged from 619 to 1105 mm year with an average of 836 mm year evapotranspiration potential values estimated for the same period by the thornthwaite method ranged from 737 to 814 mm year with an average of 771 mm solana et al in press the area under study encompasses 3 000 km2 and is specifically located in the southwestern limit of the quequén grande river basin qgrb fig 1 which is an extensive river basin of 10 000 km2 it reveals flatness with slope values that generally do not exceed the 3 6 with an elevation ranging from 73 to 225 m a s l llambías and prozzi 1975 reported the exposure of basement rocks at the southwestern limit of the qgrb according to sala and angelelli 1975 these rocks correspond to the impermeable hydrogeological basement acting as an hydraulic barrier to the groundwater flow system this positive structural element coincides with the development of several temporary and permanent shallow lakes with no observable hydrological connectivity due to the lack of surface water flows from a hydrogeological point of view the quaternary loess like deposits presented in the region called pampean sediments constitute the most important hydrogeological sequence these sediments ranging in thickness from 70 to 100 m form an unconfined multilayer aquifer called pampeano aquifer with changes in permeability resulting from subtle changes in grain size and local increases of clay content martínez and bocanegra 2002 typical values of unsaturated zone thickness are in the range of 0 85 41 m aquifer recharge is mainly due to rainfall and discharge occurs towards streams rivers shallow lakes and or directly to the atlantic ocean groundwater regional flow occurs in two preferential directions to the south and the southeast this phenomenon could be related to the presence in depth of the mentioned hydraulic barrier acting as a regional discharge zone of the pampeano aquifer solana et al in press previous studies in the area martínez et al 2012 quiroz londoño et al 2015a associated electrical conductivity values in situ measurements higher than 5000 μs cm with regional flows as a result of a longer groundwater residence time a groundwater age of 60 years or older was estimated for one deep well located in the study area by using cfcs determinations martinez et al 2017 3 methodology remote sensing gis techniques and a spatially workflow model were integrated in order to perform a remote shallow lake inventory and map the water bodies of the study area moreover field work was carried out in order to characterize and classify shallow lakes according to their water origin and frequency a summary of the proposed methodological framework is displayed in fig 2 3 1 imagery selection and pre processing a total of 34 landsat images landsat 4 5 tm landsat 7 etm slc and landsat 8 oli tirs path row 225 86 from 1984 to 2017 34 years were downloaded from the united states geological survey server https earthexplorer usgs gov shallow lakes were classified according to their water presence frequency based on one spring summer landsat image per year in order to discard events of rainfall accumulation these seasons were selected due to the higher evaporation rate which allows assuming that water bodies detected are most likely to be permanent a cloud coverage filter less than 20 was used for the imagery selection atmospheric corrections were performed by using the semi automatic classification plugin scp under the qgis software environment team 2016 image data conversion from digital numbers dn to top of atmosphere toa reflectance was done yulianto et al 2016 then it was modified by the dark object subtraction 1 dos1 a method which is an image based technique congedo 2016 the rasters for the respective years were mosaicked and the portions within the study area were clipped out for image classification 3 2 multitemporal shallow lake mapping in order to discriminate shallow lake water from surrounding vegetated areas on a single date the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 and the normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 were used as indicators of both vegetation and water coverage the ndvi values range from 1 to 1 high positive values correspond to closed plant coverage while low positive values are linked to areas with sparse plant coverage and zero values to predominance of bare soil tucker 1979 regarding shallow lakes negative values are expected when open water is present with increasing and even positive values when the proportion of plant coverage over water increases borro et al 2014 likewise the ndwi values range between 1 and 1 where values lower than 0 are associated with surfaces without the presence of vegetation or water while values greater than 0 indicate the presence of water and vegetation water presence is greater when the value of this index is closed to 1 aguayo et al 2018 ndvi and ndwi are defined by the following equations 1 n d v i n i r r n i r r 2 n d w i n i r s w i r n i r s w i r where r red band nir near infrared band and swir short wave infrared band by the combination of these indices a greater spectral range analysis was achieved allowing the identification of land surfaces covered by water in order to streamline and standardize satellite image processing focused on the remote wetland inventory an automatic workflow process was implemented by using the dinamica ego platform silveira soares et al 2015 this modeling environment holds the most common spatial analysis algorithms available in commercial gis software plus algorithms specially designed for spatial simulations the designed workflow process for the shallow lake inventory is shown in fig 3 for each landsat corrected image the following data flow chain was executed i calculation of both ndvi and ndwi indices equations 1 and 2 per pixel ii index map reclassifications to binary maps being 0 false and 1 true if a pixel had no evidence or evidence of water respectively iii sum of ndvi and ndwi binary maps three numerical results were possible here 0 dry uplands 1 pixel where one index identified water or 2 pixel where both inde ces identified water coverage iv conversion to a total binary surface water bsw map maps resulted from the preceding step iii were reclassified as 0 false and 1 true false when the pixel had a value 2 or true when the pixel had a value 2 in each bsw pixels with the value of 1 included shallow lakes at that date this 4 step process applied for each image fig 3 produced 34 total bsw maps in raster format the spatial resolution in each case was inherited from the original landsat image 30 m pixel size due to the climatic variations in the pampean region a single image cannot adequately represent the extent of shallow lakes presented in the area therefore a frequency approach to estimate the aboveground water presence frequency awpf at each pixel in a given set of images s was used based on the following equation defined by borro et al 2014 3 a w p f s j i 1 n s b s w i j n s where awpfsj is the aboveground water presence frequency value of the pixel j for the set s and represents the proportion of images i with bsw equal to 1 in the pixel j bswij in relation to the total number of images in the analyzed set of images ns thus a pixel j that was equal to 1 in every bsw map of the set s had a value of 1 in the resulting awpf map the pixel was always with water aboveground whereas a pixel that was equal to 0 in every bsw map of the set s had a value of 0 in the resulting awpf map in order to avoid confusion in the quantification of pixels of shallow lakes the ququénriver and streams were masked the awpf map describes the degree of water permanence in each pixel i e considering the relative frequency of occurrence of water in each pixel ranging from 0 absence to 1 100 it was transformed into the shallow lake map by reclassifying it into four lake water frequency classes permanently 0 8 awpfsj 1 usually 0 6 awpfsj 0 8 regularly 0 4 awpfsj 0 6 and occasionally 0 awpfsj 0 4 with water 3 3 water sampling after remote shallow lake identification several sampling campaigns were performed between september 2015 and august of 2018 a total of 48 shallow lakes representative of the classes permanently n 36 usually n 4 regularly n 4 and occasionally n 4 with water were sampled for electrical conductivity ec ph and water temperature by using a multiparametric probe hanna edge hi2040 the spatial distribution of shallow lakes and their accessibility were the main factors taken into account to define the shallow lake survey additionally a total of 35 groundwater samples were collected from mills domiciliary and irrigation wells that had been purged sufficiently to remove at least 3 borehole volumes prior to sampling and were only taken once stable field measurements ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature were obtained all water samples were collected for stable isotope δ18o and δ2h and cl content determinations stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h in water were analyzed by using a laser spectroscopy liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research 45 ep at the hydrochemical and isotopic hydrology laboratory universidad nacional de mar del plata the analytical uncertainties were 0 15 and 1 0 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the stable isotope ratios were expressed in delta δ units and a per mil notation relative to an international standard 4 δ s a m p l e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d r s t a n d a r d 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the 2h 1h or 18o 16o ratios of the sample and the international reference standard the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow gonfiantini 1978 one isotope derived lc excess parameter was calculated using the local meteoric water line lmwl as a reference to identify water that experienced evaporation losses and subsequent fractionation sprenger et al 2017 it is used as a qualitative index of evaporation intensity that the water experienced only xiang et al 2020 this parameter allows recognizing the processes that a sample has taken regarding the lmwl it was defined by landwehr and coplen 2006 as follows 5 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b s where a is the slope b is the intercept of the lmwl and s is the standard deviation of the uncertainty measure a value of lc excess 0 indicates a meteoric origin while a negative value located below the lmwl represents evaporation the more negative more evaporated enriched is the sample otherwise a value of lc excess 0 located above the lmwl represents a depletion generated by contribution from other sources estimations of lc excess for each shallow lake sample were performed the lmwl for the qgrb located close to the present study area defined by quiroz londoño et al 2015a was used for these calculations this lmwl is defined as follows δ 2 h 8 19 0 14 δ 18 o 13 15 0 82 4 results 4 1 shallow lake mapping water frequency classification the 4 step automated process applied to the 34 satellite images together with the awpf map reclassification allowed identifying a total of 3754 shallow lakes corresponding to 15193 14 ha of the study area fig 4 according to the water presence frequency shallow lakes were classified in four categories occasionally 89 0 regularly 6 7 usually 1 9 and permanently 2 3 with water as a general pattern the shallow lake area increased with the degree of water permanence of the aquatic system occasionally shallow lakes were spread all over the area characterized by a mean area of 1 18 ha regularly shallow lakes had a mean area of 8 0 ha while usually shallow lakes had a mean area of 20 86 ha permanent shallow lakes were the ones with the highest mean area being of 89 18 ha an increase of 13 in the mean total shallow lakes surface was detected between the years 1985 and 1987 in comparison to the rest of the years under study fig 5 however the rainfall trend line based on total annual values from 1981 to 2017 showed a slight increase over the years several increases in shallow lakes surface were associated with those years where annual rainfall values were higher than the general mean annual rainfall value in the area 924 mm for the last 34 years the rainfall does not match the change of total shallow lakes surface in trend indicating that evaporation and or groundwater discharge should be influencing shallow lakeś hydrological regimes 4 2 shallow lake classification water origin biplot diagrams of ph ec and δ18o in relation to shallow lake water frequency classes are shown in fig 6 the class occasionally with water was characterized by shallow lakes with a wide ranging δ18o values 0 3 2 7 ph values of 8 6 0 2 and ec values of 1535 3 1300 8 μs cm the class regularly with water in the area had δ18o values of 0 4 3 2 with ph values of 8 9 0 3 and ec values of 1752 3 822 1 μs cm in the case of usually with water class these lentic systems had δ18o values of 2 2 3 0 ph values of 8 6 0 4 and ec values of 1173 461 1 μs cm generally the permanently with water class was represented by shallow lakes with δ18o values of 0 7 1 3 with alkaline ph values of 9 0 0 5 and ec values of 2527 1723 μs cm the isotopic composition of samples from shallow lakes belonging to the classes permanently n 36 usually n 4 regularly n 4 and occasionally n 4 with water was analyzed isotopic data together with the global

samples were grouped between mean rainwater samples suggesting a well mixed system recharged directly by rainwater fig 7 several groundwater samples had detectable evaporative signal indicating that water stored in some shallow lakes did recharge the aquifer on the other hand all shallow lake waters during all sampling years showed an enriched isotopic composition and exhibited a strong lineal correlation r2 0 87 the different local evaporation water lines lewls for each year were estimated the intercept values of the lewls with the lmwl represent the isotopic value of the original source of water before evaporation to the shallow lakes in each case the sources of recharge corresponded to a mixing between rainfall and groundwater regarding rainfall input lake water source was especially due to rainfalls during the spring and the summer season with an enriched isotopic composition δ 18 o 4 3 and δ 2 h 22 5 with the aim of defining the different water source origin and processes which are likely to explain the mineralization and isotopic composition of the shallow lakes a scatter plot of lc excess vs electrical conductivity was done fig 8 the cl content was also included and indicated by symbol size when a water sample has undergone evaporation the dissolved solute concentrations increase and the lc excess values decrease i e more negative values most groundwater samples were grouped close to the meteoric water composition with highest lc excess values 0 fig 8 several samples showed more negative values 10 lc excess 5 suggesting a greater evaporation degree as a consequence of aquifer recharge from evaporated shallow lake water another groundwater group with lc excess 0 values was identified reflecting the contribution of different water sources to its composition in the case of shallow lakes all samples showed different evaporation degrees from their original source of water lc excess 0 which was also confirmed with fig 7 considering the regional electrical conductivity values defined in previous studies by martínez et al 2012 and quiroz londoño et al 2015b together with the lc excess values three groups of lentic systems were identified in the area 1 shallow lakes having less mineralized water low ec and cl values and more negative lc excess values mainly recharged by rainwater ec 1000 μs cm and or receiving discharge from local flow systems 1000 ec 2000 μs cm 2 shallow lakes having highly mineralized water high ec and cl values and less negative lc excess values mainly receiving discharge from intermediate 2000 ec 4000 μs cm or regional ec 4000 μs cm flow systems and in a lesser extent rainwater and 3 shallow lakes having moderate mineralized water moderate ec and cl values and more negative lc excess values recharged by a mixing between rainfall and local intermediate groundwater flow systems with high in situ evaporation the expected evolution trend line from the main water sources i e rainfall local and regional groundwater flow for each shallow lake group was also included in fig 8 based on the shallow lake water origins evolution trends and water permanence classes a schematic conceptual model of the hydrological functioning of the lentic systems in the area was defined fig 9 the shallow lake aquifer interactions according to water table fluctuations and the contribution of the different groundwater flow paths are shown 5 discussion shallow lake boundaries appear as a set of mixed pixels in satellite images due to their intrinsic spatial and temporal variability the presence of water table aboveground the saturation of the top soil layer and or the presence of partial or total vegetation cover on them which contributes to uncertainties about their real areal extent borro et al 2014 additionally pampean shallow lakes as most shallow lakes alternatively shift from a turbid to a clear state quirós et al 2002 scheffer and jeppesen 2007 promoting cycling changes in water cover types i e water with different macrophyte communities open water with high inorganic turbidity clear open water and water bodies with high content of phytoplankton important variations occur in the visible spectrum depending on the quantity of sediment in suspension chlorophyll content or the presence of water contaminants causing distortions in the ndvi and ndwi signals zoffoli et al 2008 for all these reasons the use of only one image of a single date may lead to misclassification of other shallow lake cover types and to artificially impose shallow lake boundaries therefore in order to improve water body extraction from satellite images the detection of spatio temporal variability due to annual and interannual fluctuations is required for proper shallow lake mapping borro et al 2014 in this sense the present paper proposed a methodological framework involving a multitemporal analysis of satellite imagery together with the combined use of two spectral indices in order to identify and classify shallow lakes according to their water permanence over 34 years the following aspects of the applied approach improved an accurate shallow lake mapping in the study area 1 the combination of the ndvi and ndwi indices enhances water body recognition based on a greater number of bands i e combining information from visible near infrared and short wave infrared channels and therefore a greater spectral signature range moreover it also ameliorate misrecognition uncertainties i e non water features are misrecognized as water features documented by several authors zoffoli et al 2008 ma et al 2013 kaplan and avdan 2017 since water body extraction is restricted to a duplicate identification by both indices 2 the spring summer seasons satellite imagery has been chosen considering that during these season some type of hydrological deficit can occur in the area quiroz londoño et al 2012 bocanegra et al 2013a glok galli et al 2014 so it could be assumed that water bodies detected in spring summer are the most likely to be permanent finally 3 the application of an automatized algorithm under the dinamica ego platform also tends to reduce errors during the manipulation and processing of cartographic information and consequently in the estimation of the indeces the superposition of local flow systems associated with surface water bodies on this regional framework results in complex interactions between groundwater and surface water in all landscapes regardless of regional topographic position fluxes of water and chemicals from and to groundwater reflect the positions of the surface water bodies with respect to different scale groundwater flow systems local geologic controls on seepage distribution through their beds could modify the potential groundwater inflow or draws water from the surface water body winter 1999 thus water level fluctuations emerge as the decisive element of hydrology especially in shallow lakes that are particularly sensitive to any rapid change in water level and input coops et al 2003 specifically water levels in pampean shallow lakes naturally fluctuate intra and inter annually depending largely on regional climatic conditions and also human activities during droughts the water table decreases drying many shallow lakes mainly those classified as occasionally and regularly with water and in a lesser extent the usually type whereas during humid periods the phreatic levels rise increasing the lake surface fig 9 therefore as also mentioned by other authors quirós et al 2002 pisano et al 2020 there is a direct relationship between precipitation evaporation processes with the seasonal climatic cycles and typical drought and flood cycles of the pampean region which determines the shallow lakes water regimes regarding the class permanently with water the hydrological scenario with continuous groundwater input to the lake and the likely relative short water residence time explain their permanent regime in this sense they could be classified as flow through lakes where hydrologic fluxes remain constant and volumetric changes are minor gibson et al 2002 while the analysis performed in this work is based on the use of data from a one time isotope and chemistry based assessment this is a promising first approximation for establishing water source relationships i e rainfall groundwater contribution for upland embedded shallow lakes in the region a temporal monitoring of the isotopic composition of these lakes will be particularly helpful for tracking site specific and regional changes according to the different climatic conditions and for the identification of spatio temporal hydrologic responses in the different classes of shallow lakes besides it is necessary to increase the number of samples of occasionally and regularly shallow lake types in order to improve their characterization towards a better understanding of their hydrological functioning according to skrzypek et al 2015 the local evaporation line lel can be derived from pan evaporation experiments or multiple measurements of the changes in stable isotope composition of water of a few wetlands or lakes in the study area in this work lel was derived from the isotopic data of several shallow lakes undergoing different degree of evaporation during three different years the slope value of the lel for lakes is expected to be typically less than 5 gibson et al 2008 in this paper the estimated mean local evaporation water line lewl δ2h 4 8 δ18o 0 23 showed a slope value of 4 8 however if the lake isotopic values from each year are separately considered the obtained lel slope values showed significant differences ranging from 5 09 to 6 fig 7 with intersection values between lel and lmwl indicating a dominant groundwater or rainfall water origin for the shallow lakes according to the considered year by integrating all shallow lake isotopic data the different regional climatic scenarios were considered involving the intra and inter annually hydrological fluctuations which allowed a deeper understanding of the factors affecting evaporation processes in the region despite this a longer version of these time series including more isotopic samples from each water body under different climatic seasons may exhibit better results the dual isotope approach using the lc excess showed advantages over simpler and direct analysis of δ2h and δ18o to better distinguish the influences of the enrichment due to evaporation fractionation on the shallow lake isotopic data sprenger et al 2017 however increase in solute concentration can be as a result of geochemical processes such as mineral dissolution and or plant transpiration where solutes are not taken up by the plant roots but it do not affect the lc excess therefore the relationship between lc excess and dissolved ion concentrations ec values as proxy resulting from evapoconcentration is inversely proportional whilst the contributions from mineral dissolution and or transpiration are constant bam 2018 in this contribution plotting lc excess versus electrical conductivity together with cl content allowed inferring the mechanisms of dissolved ion concentration in the water bodies and the expected evolution trend from the main water sources i e provide insights and bridge the gap between what happens to water molecules discharge before and after it stores in the shallow lakes 6 conclusion the evaporation signal in water isotopes was useful to assess connectivity between shallow lakes and groundwater water stored within these lentic systems was characterized by differential evaporative enrichment that could be used as a tracer indicating the contribution of groundwater to the shallow lakes and the relative importance of surface water storage recharging the aquifer the combined use of remote sensing techniques with physicochemical and isotopic data has proved to be a very powerful tool for classifying shallow lakes according to their water origin and water permanence over time obtained results allowed identifying shallow lakes having low moderate or high mineralized water due to both different evaporation degree and water sources recharged by rainwater and or receiving discharge from different groundwater flow paths the identification of non permanent shallow lakes has significant implications for a region if only permanent water bodies are considered the available water resources are strongly underestimated this becomes extremely important when quantifying the hydrological balance surface water groundwater interactions and groundwater recharge rates besides the defined hydrological functioning scenario for the shallow lakes in the area should be included in future mathematical modeling considering these water bodies as potential recharge discharge sources to the pampeano aquifer which is the main water supply for the region the implication of these finding in shallow lakes defined as upland embedded wetlands is that more careful consideration has to be applied when draining or changing the land use activities in the region alterations in the hydrological functioning of these shallow lakes threaten their existence and spatial extension especially temporal water bodies which are the most vulnerable to water table

11937,the pampean plain in argentina is one of the most extended plain regions of the world with numerous wetland systems and very shallow lakes certain anomalies related to geomorphology and shallow lakes hydrology are particularly present in a sector of the southern pampean plain specifically in the southwestern limit of the quequén grande river basin here shallow lakes can be defined as upland

hydrological and biogeochemical cycles harboring a large part of the world s biodiversity and providing multiple services to humankind from local to global scales mea 2005 despite these important benefits they are threatened by the impacts of climate change and human activities including hydrological changes intense resource exploitation and pollution gardner et al 2015 kandus et al 2018 triggering numerous environmental and social problems fang et al 2016 therefore monitoring of these aquatic systems and producing reliable up to date maps of these areas are important in terms of both biological habitats and human activities amani et al 2017 xing and niu 2019 in situ data collection is highly informative about changes in the hydrological functioning of shallow lakes and the related environmental drivers and consequences of those changes gallant 2015 since shallow lakes are complex dynamic systems connected to the water cycle through both surface and underground inflow and outflow as well as via precipitation evaporation fluxes the interaction with the local environment can be determinate by using natural tracers the combined use of natural tracers such as heat electrical conductivity ec cl and so4 2 content and 18o 16o 2h 1h allow to distinguish different lake water origins and water mixing suggest water residence time and identify hydrological connectivity

consuming and many water bodies are in remote locations or logistically challenging to monitor having a restricted access due to the higher natural fragmentation and temporal variability of wetlands zoffoli et al 2008 remote sensing becomes a key tool to address the complexity of these ecosystems because satellite images are multi temporal multispectral and provide repeated extensive coverage for monitoring lake changes over time ozesmi and bauer 2002 gallant 2015 fang et al 2016 amani et al 2017 in this sense several hydrologic information can be obtained including the extension of water

in multitemporal analysis such as the normalized water index ndwi gao 1996 and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 which are the most broadly applied spectral indices proposed for mapping and monitoring wetlands zoffoli et al 2008 borro et al 2014 guo et al 2017 kaplan and avdan 2017 south america is the continent with the largest area covered by wetlands 3 106 km2 representing more than 20 of its surface zhu and gong 2014 during the last 10 years a substantial increase of research works related to remote sensing in wetland studies has taken place in this continent most of them associated with floodplains of large rivers zoffoli et al 2008 borro et al 2014 kandus et al 2018 particularly the pampean plain in argentina is one of the most extended plain regions of the world with numerous lentic systems being shallow lakes the most abundant lake type in the landscape iriondo and kröhling 2007 this region is characterized by the occurrence of drought flood period alternation initially quoted by ameghino 1896 which affects the availability of water resources and the hydrological functioning of shallow lakes lakes here are permanent or intermittent typically shallow 2 m and highly variable in size salinity and nutrient content quirós and drago 1999 certain anomalies related to geomorphology and shallow lakes hydrology are particularly present in a sector of the southern pampean plain specifically in the southwestern limit of the quequén grande river basin here shallow lakes can be defined as upland embedded wetlands i e condition of being surrounded by uplands as the relevant distinguishing characteristic according to mushet et al 2015 and calhoun et al 2017 several studies have reported hydrologic connectivity of upland embedded wetlands with other surface water systems wilcox et al 2011 forbes et al 2012 however there is a lack of observable hydrological connectivity in the study area due to the absence of surface water

and analyze the response of these ecosystems to climate change and human activities xing and niu 2019 2 study area the study area is located in the southeast of buenos aires province according to thornthwaite classification thornthwaite 1948 the climate is dry sub humid mesothermal type b2 kruse et al 1996 over the past eight years annual precipitation values have ranged from 619 to 1105 mm year with an average of 836 mm year evapotranspiration potential values estimated for the same period by the thornthwaite method ranged from 737 to 814 mm year with an average of 771 mm solana et al in press the area under study encompasses 3 000 km2 and is specifically located in the southwestern limit of the quequén grande river basin qgrb fig 1 which is an extensive river basin of 10 000 km2 it reveals flatness with slope values that generally do not exceed the 3 6 with an elevation ranging from 73 to 225 m a s l llambías and prozzi 1975 reported the exposure of basement rocks at the southwestern limit of the qgrb according to sala and angelelli 1975 these rocks correspond to the impermeable hydrogeological basement acting as an hydraulic barrier to the groundwater flow system this positive structural element coincides with the development of several temporary and permanent shallow lakes with no observable hydrological connectivity due to the lack of surface water flows from a hydrogeological point of view the quaternary loess like deposits presented in the region called pampean sediments constitute the most important hydrogeological sequence these sediments ranging in thickness from 70 to 100 m form an unconfined multilayer aquifer called pampeano aquifer with changes in permeability resulting from subtle changes in grain size and local increases of clay content martínez and bocanegra 2002 typical values of unsaturated zone thickness are in the range of 0 85 41 m aquifer recharge is mainly due to rainfall and discharge occurs towards streams rivers shallow lakes and or directly to the atlantic ocean groundwater regional flow occurs in two preferential directions to the south and the southeast this phenomenon could be related to the presence in depth of the mentioned hydraulic barrier acting as a regional discharge zone of the pampeano aquifer solana et al in press previous studies in the area martínez et al 2012 quiroz londoño et al 2015a associated electrical conductivity values in situ measurements higher than 5000 μs cm with regional flows as a result of a longer groundwater residence time a groundwater age of 60 years or older was estimated for one deep well located in the study area by using cfcs determinations martinez et al 2017 3 methodology remote sensing gis techniques and a spatially workflow model were integrated in order to perform a remote shallow lake inventory and map the water bodies of the study area moreover field work was carried out in order to characterize and classify shallow lakes according to their water origin and frequency a summary of the proposed methodological framework is displayed in fig 2 3 1 imagery selection and pre processing a total of 34 landsat images landsat 4 5 tm landsat 7 etm slc and landsat 8 oli tirs path row 225 86 from 1984 to 2017 34 years were downloaded from the united states geological survey server https earthexplorer usgs gov shallow lakes were classified according to their water presence frequency based on one spring summer landsat image per year in order to discard events of rainfall accumulation these seasons were selected due to the higher evaporation rate which allows assuming that water bodies detected are most likely to be permanent a cloud coverage filter less than 20 was used for the imagery selection atmospheric corrections were performed by using the semi automatic classification plugin scp under the qgis software environment team 2016 image data conversion from digital numbers dn to top of atmosphere toa reflectance was done yulianto et al 2016 then it was modified by the dark object subtraction 1 dos1 a method which is an image based technique congedo 2016 the rasters for the respective years were mosaicked and the portions within the study area were clipped out for image classification 3 2 multitemporal shallow lake mapping in order to discriminate shallow lake water from surrounding vegetated areas on a single date the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 and the normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 were used as indicators of both vegetation and water coverage the ndvi values range from 1 to 1 high positive values correspond to closed plant coverage while low positive values are linked to areas with sparse plant coverage and zero values to predominance of bare soil tucker 1979 regarding shallow lakes negative values are expected when open water is present with increasing and even positive values when the proportion of plant coverage over water increases borro et al 2014 likewise the ndwi values range between 1 and 1 where values lower than 0 are associated with surfaces without the presence of vegetation or water while values greater than 0 indicate the presence of water and vegetation water presence is greater when the value of this index is closed to 1 aguayo et al 2018 ndvi and ndwi are defined by the following equations 1 n d v i n i r r n i r r 2 n d w i n i r s w i r n i r s w i r where r red band nir near infrared band and swir short wave infrared band by the combination of these indices a greater spectral range analysis was achieved allowing the identification of land surfaces covered by water in order to streamline and standardize satellite image processing focused on the remote wetland inventory an automatic workflow process was implemented by using the dinamica ego platform silveira soares et al 2015 this modeling environment holds the most common spatial analysis algorithms available in commercial gis software plus algorithms specially designed for spatial simulations the designed workflow process for the shallow lake inventory is shown in fig 3 for each landsat corrected image the following data flow chain was executed i calculation of both ndvi and ndwi indices equations 1 and 2 per pixel ii index map reclassifications to binary maps being 0 false and 1 true if a pixel had no evidence or evidence of water respectively iii sum of ndvi and ndwi binary maps three numerical results were possible here 0 dry uplands 1 pixel where one index identified water or 2 pixel where both inde ces identified water coverage iv conversion to a total binary surface water bsw map maps resulted from the preceding step iii were reclassified as 0 false and 1 true false when the pixel had a value 2 or true when the pixel had a value 2 in each bsw pixels with the value of 1 included shallow lakes at that date this 4 step process applied for each image fig 3 produced 34 total bsw maps in raster format the spatial resolution in each case was inherited from the original landsat image 30 m pixel size due to the climatic variations in the pampean region a single image cannot adequately represent the extent of shallow lakes presented in the area therefore a frequency approach to estimate the aboveground water presence frequency awpf at each pixel in a given set of images s was used based on the following equation defined by borro et al 2014 3 a w p f s j i 1 n s b s w i j n s where awpfsj is the aboveground water presence frequency value of the pixel j for the set s and represents the proportion of images i with bsw equal to 1 in the pixel j bswij in relation to the total number of images in the analyzed set of images ns thus a pixel j that was equal to 1 in every bsw map of the set s had a value of 1 in the resulting awpf map the pixel was always with water aboveground whereas a pixel that was equal to 0 in every bsw map of the set s had a value of 0 in the resulting awpf map in order to avoid confusion in the quantification of pixels of shallow lakes the ququénriver and streams were masked the awpf map describes the degree of water permanence in each pixel i e considering the relative frequency of occurrence of water in each pixel ranging from 0 absence to 1 100 it was transformed into the shallow lake map by reclassifying it into four lake water frequency classes permanently 0 8 awpfsj 1 usually 0 6 awpfsj 0 8 regularly 0 4 awpfsj 0 6 and occasionally 0 awpfsj 0 4 with water 3 3 water sampling after remote shallow lake identification several sampling campaigns were performed between september 2015 and august of 2018 a total of 48 shallow lakes representative of the classes permanently n 36 usually n 4 regularly n 4 and occasionally n 4 with water were sampled for electrical conductivity ec ph and water temperature by using a multiparametric probe hanna edge hi2040 the spatial distribution of shallow lakes and their accessibility were the main factors taken into account to define the shallow lake survey additionally a total of 35 groundwater samples were collected from mills domiciliary and irrigation wells that had been purged sufficiently to remove at least 3 borehole volumes prior to sampling and were only taken once stable field measurements ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature were obtained all water samples were collected for stable isotope δ18o and δ2h and cl content determinations stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h in water were analyzed by using a laser spectroscopy liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research 45 ep at the hydrochemical and isotopic hydrology laboratory universidad nacional de mar del plata the analytical uncertainties were 0 15 and 1 0 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the stable isotope ratios were expressed in delta δ units and a per mil notation relative to an international standard 4 δ s a m p l e r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d r s t a n d a r d 1000 where rsample and rstandard are the 2h 1h or 18o 16o ratios of the sample and the international reference standard the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow gonfiantini 1978 one isotope derived lc excess parameter was calculated using the local meteoric water line lmwl as a reference to identify water that experienced evaporation losses and subsequent fractionation sprenger et al 2017 it is used as a qualitative index of evaporation intensity that the water experienced only xiang et al 2020 this parameter allows recognizing the processes that a sample has taken regarding the lmwl it was defined by landwehr and coplen 2006 as follows 5 l c e x c e s s δ 2 h a δ 18 o b s where a is the slope b is the intercept of the lmwl and s is the standard deviation of the uncertainty measure a value of lc excess 0 indicates a meteoric origin while a negative value located below the lmwl represents evaporation the more negative more evaporated enriched is the sample otherwise a value of lc excess 0 located above the lmwl represents a depletion generated by contribution from other sources estimations of lc excess for each shallow lake sample were performed the lmwl for the qgrb located close to the present study area defined by quiroz londoño et al 2015a was used for these calculations this lmwl is defined as follows δ 2 h 8 19 0 14 δ 18 o 13 15 0 82 4 results 4 1 shallow lake mapping water frequency classification the 4 step automated process applied to the 34 satellite images together with the awpf map reclassification allowed identifying a total of 3754 shallow lakes corresponding to 15193 14 ha of the study area fig 4 according to the water presence frequency shallow lakes were classified in four categories occasionally 89 0 regularly 6 7 usually 1 9 and permanently 2 3 with water as a general pattern the shallow lake area increased with the degree of water permanence of the aquatic system occasionally shallow lakes were spread all over the area characterized by a mean area of 1 18 ha regularly shallow lakes had a mean area of 8 0 ha while usually shallow lakes had a mean area of 20 86 ha permanent shallow lakes were the ones with the highest mean area being of 89 18 ha an increase of 13 in the mean total shallow lakes surface was detected between the years 1985 and 1987 in comparison to the rest of the years under study fig 5 however the rainfall trend line based on total annual values from 1981 to 2017 showed a slight increase over the years several increases in shallow lakes surface were associated with those years where annual rainfall values were higher than the general mean annual rainfall value in the area 924 mm for the last 34 years the rainfall does not match the change of total shallow lakes surface in trend indicating that evaporation and or groundwater discharge should be influencing shallow lakeś hydrological regimes 4 2 shallow lake classification water origin biplot diagrams of ph ec and δ18o in relation to shallow lake water frequency classes are shown in fig 6 the class occasionally with water was characterized by shallow lakes with a wide ranging δ18o values 0 3 2 7 ph values of 8 6 0 2 and ec values of 1535 3 1300 8 μs cm the class regularly with water in the area had δ18o values of

461 1 μs cm generally the permanently with water class was represented by shallow lakes with δ18o values of 0 7 1 3 with alkaline ph values of 9 0 0 5 and ec values of 2527 1723 μs cm the isotopic composition of samples from shallow lakes belonging to the classes permanently n 36 usually n 4 regularly n 4 and occasionally n 4 with water was analyzed isotopic data together with the global meteoric water line gmwl δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 and local meteoric water line lmwl δ 2 h 8 19 0 14 δ 18 o 13 15 0 82 were plotted in a conventional diagram δ18o vs δ2h as a general pattern groundwater samples were grouped between mean rainwater samples suggesting a well mixed system recharged directly by rainwater fig 7 several groundwater samples had detectable evaporative signal indicating that water stored in some shallow lakes did recharge the aquifer on the other hand all shallow lake waters during all sampling years showed an enriched isotopic composition and exhibited a strong lineal correlation r2 0 87 the different local evaporation water lines lewls for each year were estimated the intercept values of the lewls with the lmwl represent the isotopic value of the original source of water before evaporation to the shallow lakes in each case the sources of recharge corresponded to a mixing between rainfall and groundwater regarding rainfall input lake water source was especially due to rainfalls during the spring and the summer season with an enriched isotopic composition δ 18 o 4 3 and δ 2 h 22 5 with the aim of defining the different water source origin and processes which are likely to explain the mineralization and isotopic composition of the shallow lakes a scatter plot of lc excess vs electrical conductivity was done fig 8 the cl content was also included and indicated by symbol size when a water sample has undergone evaporation the dissolved solute concentrations increase and the lc excess values decrease i e more negative values most groundwater samples were grouped close to the meteoric water composition with highest lc excess values 0 fig 8 several samples showed more negative values 10 lc excess 5 suggesting a greater evaporation degree as a consequence of aquifer recharge from evaporated shallow lake water another groundwater group with lc excess 0 values was identified reflecting the contribution of different water sources to its composition in the case of shallow lakes all samples showed different evaporation degrees from their original source of water lc excess 0 which was also confirmed with fig 7 considering the regional electrical conductivity values defined in previous studies by martínez et al 2012 and quiroz londoño et al 2015b together with the lc excess values three groups of lentic systems were identified in the area 1 shallow lakes having less mineralized water low ec and cl values and more negative lc excess values mainly recharged by rainwater ec 1000 μs cm and or receiving discharge from local flow systems 1000 ec 2000 μs cm 2 shallow lakes having highly mineralized water high ec and cl values and less negative lc excess values mainly receiving discharge from intermediate 2000 ec 4000 μs cm or regional ec 4000 μs cm flow systems and in a lesser extent rainwater and 3 shallow lakes having moderate mineralized water moderate ec and cl values and more negative lc excess values recharged by a mixing between rainfall and local intermediate groundwater flow systems with high in situ evaporation the expected evolution trend line from the main water sources i e rainfall local and regional groundwater flow for each shallow lake group was also included in fig 8 based on the shallow lake water origins evolution trends and water permanence classes a schematic conceptual model of the hydrological functioning of the lentic systems in the area was defined fig 9 the shallow lake aquifer interactions according to water table fluctuations and the contribution of the different groundwater flow paths are shown 5 discussion shallow lake boundaries appear as a set of mixed pixels in satellite images due to their intrinsic spatial and temporal variability the presence of water table aboveground the saturation of the top soil layer and or the presence of partial or total vegetation cover on them which contributes to uncertainties about their real areal extent borro et al 2014 additionally pampean shallow lakes as most shallow lakes alternatively shift from a turbid to a clear state quirós et al 2002 scheffer and jeppesen 2007 promoting cycling changes in water cover types i e water with different macrophyte communities open water with high inorganic turbidity clear open water and water bodies with high content of phytoplankton important variations occur in the visible spectrum depending on the quantity of sediment in suspension chlorophyll content or the presence of water contaminants causing distortions in the ndvi and ndwi signals zoffoli et al 2008 for all these reasons the use of only one image of a single date may lead to misclassification of other shallow lake cover types and to artificially impose shallow lake boundaries therefore in order to improve water body extraction from satellite images the detection of spatio temporal variability due to annual and interannual fluctuations is required for proper shallow lake mapping borro et al 2014 in this sense the present paper proposed a methodological framework involving a multitemporal analysis of satellite imagery together with the combined use of two spectral indices in order to identify and classify shallow lakes according to their water permanence over 34 years the following aspects of the applied approach improved an accurate shallow lake mapping in the study area 1 the combination of the ndvi and ndwi indices enhances water body recognition based on a greater number of bands i e combining information from visible near infrared and short wave infrared channels and therefore a greater spectral signature range moreover it also ameliorate misrecognition uncertainties i e non water features are misrecognized as water features documented by several authors zoffoli et al 2008 ma et al 2013 kaplan and avdan 2017 since water body extraction is restricted to a duplicate identification by both indices 2 the spring summer seasons satellite imagery has been chosen considering that during these season some type of hydrological deficit can occur in the area quiroz londoño et al 2012 bocanegra et al 2013a glok galli et al 2014 so it could be assumed that water bodies detected in spring summer are the most likely to be permanent finally 3 the application of an automatized algorithm under the dinamica ego platform also tends to reduce errors during the manipulation and processing of cartographic information and consequently in the estimation of the indeces the superposition of local flow systems associated with surface water bodies on this regional framework results in complex interactions between groundwater and surface water in all landscapes regardless of regional topographic position fluxes of water and chemicals from and to groundwater reflect the positions of the surface water bodies with respect to different scale groundwater flow systems local geologic controls on seepage distribution through their beds could modify the potential groundwater inflow or draws water from the surface water body winter 1999 thus water level fluctuations emerge as the decisive element of hydrology especially in shallow lakes that are particularly sensitive to any rapid change in water level and input coops et al 2003 specifically water levels in pampean shallow lakes naturally fluctuate intra and inter annually depending largely on regional climatic conditions and also human activities during droughts the water table decreases drying many shallow lakes mainly those classified as occasionally and regularly with water and in a lesser extent the usually type whereas during humid periods the phreatic levels rise increasing the lake surface fig 9 therefore as also mentioned by other authors quirós et al 2002 pisano et al 2020 there is a direct relationship between precipitation evaporation processes with the seasonal climatic cycles and typical drought and flood cycles of the pampean region which determines the shallow lakes water regimes regarding the class permanently with water the hydrological scenario with continuous groundwater input to the lake and the likely relative short water residence time explain their permanent regime in this sense they could be classified as flow through lakes where hydrologic fluxes remain constant and volumetric changes are minor gibson et al 2002 while the analysis performed in this work is based on the use of data from a one time isotope and chemistry based assessment this is a promising first approximation for establishing water source relationships i e rainfall groundwater contribution for upland embedded shallow lakes in the region a temporal monitoring of the isotopic composition of these lakes will be particularly helpful for tracking site specific and regional changes according to the different climatic conditions and for the identification of spatio temporal hydrologic responses in the different classes of shallow lakes besides it is necessary to increase the number of samples of occasionally and regularly shallow lake types in order to improve their characterization towards a better understanding of their hydrological functioning according to skrzypek et al 2015 the local evaporation line lel can be derived from pan evaporation experiments or multiple measurements of the changes in stable isotope composition of water of a few wetlands or lakes in the study area in this work lel was derived from the isotopic data of several shallow lakes undergoing different degree of evaporation during three different years the slope value of the lel for lakes is expected to be typically less than 5 gibson et al 2008 in this paper the estimated mean local evaporation water line lewl δ2h 4 8 δ18o 0 23 showed a slope value of 4 8 however if the lake isotopic values from each year are separately considered the obtained lel slope values showed significant differences ranging from 5 09 to 6 fig 7 with intersection values between lel and lmwl indicating a dominant groundwater or rainfall water origin for the shallow lakes according to the considered year by integrating all shallow lake isotopic data the different regional climatic scenarios were considered involving the intra and inter annually hydrological fluctuations which allowed a deeper understanding of the factors affecting evaporation processes in the region despite this a longer version of these time series including more isotopic samples from each water body under different climatic seasons may exhibit better results the dual isotope approach using the lc excess showed advantages over simpler and direct analysis of δ2h and δ18o to better distinguish the influences of the enrichment due to evaporation fractionation on the shallow lake isotopic data sprenger et al 2017 however increase in solute concentration can be as a result of geochemical processes such as mineral dissolution and or plant transpiration where solutes are not taken up by the plant roots but it do not affect the lc excess therefore the relationship between lc excess and dissolved ion concentrations ec values as proxy resulting from evapoconcentration is inversely proportional whilst the contributions from mineral dissolution and or transpiration are constant bam 2018 in this contribution plotting lc excess versus electrical conductivity together with cl content allowed inferring the mechanisms of dissolved ion concentration in the water bodies and the expected evolution trend from the main water sources i e provide insights and bridge the gap between what happens to water molecules discharge before and after it stores in the shallow lakes 6 conclusion the evaporation signal in water isotopes was useful to assess connectivity between shallow lakes and groundwater water stored within these lentic systems was characterized by differential evaporative enrichment that could be used as a tracer indicating the contribution of groundwater to the shallow lakes and the relative importance of surface water storage recharging the aquifer the combined use of remote sensing techniques with physicochemical and isotopic data has proved to be a very powerful tool for classifying shallow lakes according to their water origin and water permanence over time obtained results allowed identifying shallow lakes having low moderate or high mineralized water due to both different evaporation degree and water sources recharged by rainwater and or receiving discharge from different groundwater flow paths the identification of non permanent shallow lakes has significant implications for a region if only permanent water bodies are considered the available water resources are strongly underestimated this becomes extremely important when quantifying the hydrological balance surface water groundwater interactions and groundwater recharge rates besides the defined hydrological functioning scenario for the shallow lakes in the area should be included in future mathematical modeling considering these water bodies as potential recharge discharge sources to the pampeano aquifer which is the main water supply for the region the implication of these finding in shallow lakes defined as upland embedded wetlands is that more careful consideration has to be applied when draining or changing the land use activities in the region alterations in the hydrological functioning of these shallow lakes threaten their existence and spatial extension especially temporal water bodies which are the most vulnerable to water table

11938,an investigation was carried out in bankey bazar block of gaya and rajauli block of nawada districts in bihar to assess the fluoride contamination magnitude in groundwater and cultivated crops the toxicological risk of fluoride exposure on three different age groups of the local populations has been measured the groundwater was highly contaminated with fluoride mean 2 64 1 8 mg l and alkaline in character mean ph 7 8 0 38 about 48 1 and 91 of the groundwater samples from bankey bazar mean 2 15 1 78 mg l and rajauli mean 3 2 1 64 mg l respectively cross the permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water the major presence of fluoride in bankey bazar and rajauli was confined at a depth range of 12 2 18 3 m 0 5 8 0 mg l and 33 5 35 1 m 1 5 8 0 mg l respectively and expected to be the hotspot territory in the regions mean fluoride concentrations in locally grown rice and wheat grain were found as 1 15 0 81 1 374 0 667 mg kg and 0 855 0 226 0 84 0 186 mg kg respectively mean urinary fluoride concentrations of the studied populations were 10 4 4 72 and 3 004 1 97 mg l respectively the cumulative edi value for cte and rme of the studied children was higher as compared to teenagers and adults the hazard index hi for all the age groups residing in bhaktuari of bankey bazar and bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih of rajauli block was found much higher than the permissible limit hi 1 a good number of populations were suffering from dental and skeletal fluorosis the life time non cancerous risk hiltnr and probabilistic risk assessment based on fluoride exposure showed the potential threat among the residing populations graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoride groundwater cereals estimated daily intake hazard index probabilistic risk assessment 1 introduction the requirement of freshwater in day to day life is increasing on rapid rate freshwater is not only used for consumption purpose however also used in industrial and irrigation sectors rajesh et al 2015 the toxic effluents from households agricultural fields and industries pollute the freshwater reservoirs singaraja et al 2012 which creates a scarcity of fresh water globally other than anthropogenic pollution of water the groundwater is contaminated with many natural hazardous materials like arsenic fluoride bromide nitrate sulphate etc abiye and bhattacharya 2019 alcaine et al 2020 ali et al 2019 chakraborti et al 2016 chowdhury et al 2020 das et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2005 lucht and casey 2019 sharma and kumar 2020 fluoride is one of the halide basically present in granitic terrains adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 the arid and semi arid regions are more likely to be contaminated with fluoride due to the rapid chemical weathering of underneath minerals fluoride in underground aquifers comes from fluoride bearing minerals like fluorite topaz and apatite ayoob and gupta 2006 bundschuh et al 2017 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 yadav et al 2018 globally 200 million people across 29 countries including india china saudi arabia united states u s uganda tanzania and ethiopia consume fluoridated water on daily basis for different purposes ali et al 2016 amini et al 2008 brindha and elango 2011 kimambo et al 2019 liu et al 2014 various studies have been conducted to evaluate the magnitude of fluoride contamination in different parts of india jacks et al 2005 narsimha and sudarshan 2016 groundwater in several parts of andhra pradesh was contaminated with fluoride rao 2003 2009 rao and devadas 2003 rao et al 2017 similarly parts of tamil nadu were also contaminated with high groundwater fluoride gowrisankar et al 2017 jagadeshan and elango 2015 jagadeshan et al 2015a b magesh et al 2016 the northern and western states of india like haryana gujrat rajasthan and maharasthra were heavily contaminated with fluoride ali et al 2018 garg et al 2009 madhnure et al 2007 salve et al 2007 suthar et al 2008 other states like uttar pradesh west bengal bihar and north eastern hilly states like assam and tripura were reported with presence of higher level of fluoride in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2017 2020 hanse et al 2019 ranjan and yasmin 2019 yadav et al 2019 extensive use of agrochemicals and contaminated sewage and industrial effluent is also elevating the fluoride level in water agricultural fields are also getting contaminated due to the use of fluoride contaminated groundwater fornasiero 2001 kusa et al 2004 the plants cultivated using the contaminated water and agrochemicals also accumulate a good amount of fluoride in the different plant parts especially edible parts davison and weinstein 1998 previous studies also claimed that ingestion of water fluoride as a major cause of fluorosis ali et al 2019 ghaderpoori et al 2019 keshavarz et al 2015 a part of fluoride is still coming from food sources other than water thus the evaluation of fluoride from different food sources need to be addressed bhattacharya et al 2017 pal et al 2012 fluoride is one of the essential micronutrients which possesses both beneficial and detrimental effect on human health through the consumption of drinking water and other food sources chavoshi et al 2011 fromme et al 2009 kimambo et al 2019 there is very narrow line of fluoride dose between its essentiality and deleterious effect on health the highly electronegative fluoride ion is attracted by other positive metal ions ca and na and even in low concentration 0 5 mg l fluoride gets binds with ca in teeth which results in dental caries dissanayake 1991 keshavarz et al 2015 lower fluoride level in drinking water can cause dental fluorosis especially in warmer countries due to higher water consumption cao 1992 ipcs 1984 usepa 1985a however earlier studies found no or negligible effect on dental caries with water fluoride concentration 1 mg l dobaradaran et al 2009 rahmani et al 2010 subba reddy and tewari 1992 reported that the mutilated morphology of the fluorotic teeth enhances plaque accumulation and food lodgment that initiates dental caries the consumption of higher dose of fluoride 1 5 mg l cause fluorosis in children and consumption of more than 4 10 mg l of fluoride can lead to the development of dental and skeletal fluorosis dissanayake 1991 queste et al 2001 the permissible limit of fluoride set by world health organization is 1 5 mg l who 2006 apparently the highest desirable and maximum permissible range of fluoride sets by the indian council of medical research icmr are 1 0 and 1 5 mg l respectively icmr 1975 though the fluoride concentration from 0 6 to 1 2 mg l in drinking water is beneficial for development of bones and teeth bis 2003 brindha and elango 2011 usepa 2010 drinking water minerals and mineral balance was studied extensively considering its importance health significance and safety precautions rosborg 2015 bruvo et al 2008 reported that ca with a concentration of 170 mg l had the same antidental caries effects as fluoride with 1 mg l in drinking water and an optimum content of ca 40 50 mg l and f 0 75 mg l in drinking water was recommended to control dental caries in a studied populations of denmark presence of ca mg and hco3 in optimum concentrations in drinking water might play a significant role for a healthy body rylander 2008 concentrations of the elements like as f se pb cu fe mn and na in drinking water are much lower than concentrations of ca mg hco3 and so4 2 parr 1996 rosborg 2015 however daily intake of certain trace elements through drinking water gives a substantial contribution to the human health effects the long time exposure of fluoride may cause immense health problems xiang et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 the study of biomarker like urine milk sweats are also useful tool to know the recent exposure of fluoride dose rugg gunn et al 2011 urine can be used as a biomarker to study the recent and chronic exposure of fluoride in human beings as part of the absorbed fluoride in intestinal tract excreted via urine riddell et al 2019 bihar counts as category iii fluoride endemic state 50 of the districts affected in india susheela 2001 an earlier study conducted by susheela 1987 on bihar reported that approximately 30 50 of the populations were suffered from fluorosis in fluoride affected areas however in recent decades several studies were conducted on exposure of fluoride and its associated health risk in few districts of bihar kumar et al 2016 ranjan and yasmin 2019 yasmin et al 2011 gaya and nawada are the two districts where presence of fluoride in groundwater was confirmed by previous studies grover et al 2003 yasmin et al 2011 few local governmental agencies like public health engineering dept phed and central ground water board cgwb carried out investigations to address the fluorosis endemism in gaya yasmin et al 2011 the rocky terrain in south bihar has been already established to be contaminated with fluoride and many groundwater aquifers in this region have higher fluoride concentration khandare et al 2005 yasmin et al 2013 than who recommended permissible limit of 1 5 mg l the predominance of biotite in the rock and soil samples confirmed the geogenic source of fluoride in these regions ranjan and yasmin 2019 in a recent study groundwater in the rocky terrain of northern tanzania was reported to be fluoride contaminated with major fluoride bearing phases being titanite amphibole hornblende and biotite ijumulana et al 2020 previous studies on gaya and nawada only exposed the groundwater fluoride contamination scenario and determined the extent of fluorosis to some extent the present study aims to address the issues related to exposure of fluoride in groundwater with special reference to its spatial variation and depth wise distribution fluoride uptake by crops rice and wheat locally grown using fluoride contaminated groundwater toxicity assessment due to fluoride exposure and related health risk assessment of the studied population due to the physiological and behavioural differences the studied population was divided into three age groups children teenagers adults to estimate the fluoride exposure and non carcinogenic risk through consumption of groundwater and cereal grains locally cultivated in the studied areas of bankey bazar and rajauli block 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area two blocks namely bankey bazar and rajauli have been selected as study areas from gaya and nawada district respectively located in the southern part of bihar fig 1 gaya is famous for its historical importance and geographically located between longitude 85 0002 e and latitude 24 7914 n with a total area of 308 31 km2 and a population of 4 391 418 census 2011a gaya is situated 100 km away from the capital city patna and falgu is the main river flows through this district the district lies 120 m above the sea level gaya basically has hot temperate climatic condition with an average temperature of 26 5 c and an annual rainfall of 1105 mm total 13 villages in bankey bazar were surveyed during the study period june july 2019 namely dhaneta kamalpur bhoktadih raksi bhaktuari goitha bhalupur thaprand dhakan chuan chandpur balasot banahagaw and sherghati nawada is the neighbouring district of gaya located between longitude 85 5435 e and latitude 24 8867 n occupies a total area of 2494 km2 and a population of 2 219 146 census 2011b most of the parts of nawada district are plain except few hilly regions in rajauli block total 6 villages were surveyed namely tilaiya ghasiadih rajauli bypass bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih the overall climatic pattern is similar to the gaya with an annual average temperature of 26 4 c and an annual rainfall of 972 mm the major source of drinking water comes from the hand pumped tube wells and groundwater is also used for the cultivation purposes to irrigate the fields the studied populations are mainly rural and their main occupational income comes from the daily wage basis work and farming 2 2 sample collection preservation and preparation total 192 groundwater samples were collected out of which 104 samples from bankey bazar block gaya district and other 88 samples from rajauli block nawada district all the water samples were collected in individual properly cleaned polyethylene bottle 250 ml the collected water samples were not treated with any chemicals or preservatives and transported to the laboratory for further analysis for the collection of urine samples each of 20 ml polyethylene vial was used the urine samples were collected as biomarker to evaluate the exposure of fluoride in the body system a total number of 124 urine samples were collected out of which 63 samples were from bankey bazar and 61 samples were from rajauli the collected urine samples were not treated with any chemical or preservative stored in icebox to minimize the degradation during transportation and kept inside the refrigerator at 4 c in laboratory until further analysis kumar et al 2017 rice oryza sativa l and wheat triticum aestivum l are the main cereal crops in these regions and also the staple dietary food source for the local inhabitants the crops were locally grown and entered the local market apart from the collection of crops by the farmers from their own agricultural lands the food samples were collected from the household level and local markets to understand the health exposure and additional risk factor of fluoride through consumption of staple food sources among the studied populations a total number of 63 rice grain and 54 wheat grain samples were collected from bankey bazar similarly 47 rice grain and 35 wheat grain samples were collected from rajauli all the collected cereals were kept in plastic zipper bags for further analysis rice and wheat grains were washed thoroughly with double distilled water and dried at 60 c inside an oven the dried grain sample was then powered using a mortar and pestle 2 3 chemicals and reagents all the chemical and reagents used during this experiment were of laboratory grade to avoid any other mineral contamination double distilled water was used throughout the chemical analysis procedures the reagents like naoh and hcl were purchased from merck mumbai india the fluoride standard solution naf was available from thermo fisher scientific usa orion 940907 tisab iii total ionic strength adjustment buffer solution used for sample preparation was purchased from thermo fisher scientific usa orion 940911 2 4 digestion of cereal grains the earlier prescribed method by mcquaker and gurney 1977 was followed to extract the total fluoride from rice and wheat grains about 0 5 g of the powdered sample was taken in a 25 ml nickel crucible few drops of double distilled water followed by 6 ml of 8 n naoh solutions were added then the crucible was placed at 150 c for 2 h inside an oven the crucible was taken out placed inside a muffle furnace initially at 400 c with a gradual raised up to 600 c and kept for 30 min the crucible was then allowed to cool properly for dissolution of naoh fusion cake 10 ml of double distilled water was added finally the ph was reduced at 8 9 by adding concentrated hcl drop wise with continuous stirring the volume of the ph adjusted sample was made up to 50 ml with double distilled water and filtered through whatman no 42 filter paper the filtrate solutions were then preserved for fluoride estimation 2 5 analysis of fluoride fluoride concentration of all water and urine samples were analysed following the recommended procedure by american society for testing and materials astm astm 2010 fluoride concentration was measured electrochemically by ph ion selective electrode ise meter thermo scientific orion star a214 combined with fluoride electrode orion ise model no 9609bnwp a stock solution of 100 mg l naf was used for preparation of several standard fluoride solutions of 10 1 0 and 0 1 mg l through serial dilutions respectively to measure the sample fluoride concentration buffer grade iii solution was added to the sample at 1 10 ratio prior to the measurement of fluoride the ion meter was calibrated to a slope of 59 2 2 0 urine and digested cereal grain samples were diluted to 4 ml with water in 1 1 v v ratio and 0 4 ml of tisab iii was added for estimation of fluoride 2 6 quality control and quality assurance the reliability accuracy and precision of the generated analytical data were confirmed through standardization routine blank measurements and analysis of spiked samples das et al 2020 quality control tests were also performed by analyzing duplicates and calculating recovery 98 2 of spiked fluoride digested samples 2 7 evolution of fluoride dose exposure the fluoride exposure dose was assessed based on the intake of water and amount of food grains consumed per day by a person in this study the population was divided into three different age groups having their own dietary intake levels the three age groups irrespective of their gender like 3 10 years children 11 19 years teenagers and 20 70 years adults have been selected to evaluate the potential health risk due to the exposure of fluoride all related data about consumption habit of water and cereals were collected based on the guidelines provided by the national institute of nutrition hyderabad india thimmayamma and rau 1987 the quantitative fluoride exposure dose through dietary source was calculated in terms of estimated daily intake edi of water and foodstuffs cereals the calculation of edi was based on the formula introduced by usepa usepa 1992 e d i c i r e f e d a f c f b w a t where edi is the estimated daily intake mg kg bw day c is the concentration of fluoride in water mg l and cereal grains mg kg ir is the daily intake rate of water l d and cereals mg d ef is the exposure frequency d year ed is the exposure duration year af is the absorption factor unit less cf is the conversion factor 10 6 bw is the body weight kg and at averaging time d to calculate the exposure dose for three age groups children teenagers adults the body weights were taken as 19 kg children 52 kg teenagers and 70 kg adults respectively according to the usepa guidelines keshavarz 2015 usepa 2011 as there is no available data about body weight for indian aged group the exposures of fluoride and risk assessments for three age groups were performed for average or central tendency exposure cte and the high end or reasonable maximum exposure rme scenarios which was intended to represent a plausible worst case exposure erdal and buchanan 2005 usepa 1989 the ingested fluoride via all possible sources was readily absorbed in gastro intestinal tract and the estimated absorption of fluoride in gastro intestinal tract was 75 100 atsdr 2001 thus the af in this study to evaluate the exposure was taken 75 and 100 for cte and rme scenarios respectively bhattacharya et al 2017 the at was taken equal to ed 365 d year the characterization of fluoride exposure among the different age groups through drinking water and cereal grains was calculated in terms of cumulative edi with the following equation edicumulative ediwater edirice ediwheat 2 8 assessment of health risk from fluoride exposure to measure the quantitative health risk associated to fluoride exposure on three different age groups hazard index hi was calculated hazard index is basically a ratio between cumulative edi value and reference dose of fluoride hazard index hi is calculated according to usepa s recommended formula usepa 1993 h i e d i c u m u l a t i v e r f d for fluoride the oral reference dose rfd value of human was assumed to be 0 06 mg kg bw day usepa 2003 rfd was derived from the noael no observed adverse effect level value of 0 06 mg kg bw day usepa 1993 and loael lowest observe adverse effect level value of 0 12 mg kg bw day on children for causing dental fluorosis hodge 1950 the noael value was divided by uncertainty factor um and modifying factor mf the value of both um and mf is 1 hodge 1950 r f d n o a e l u m m f the health risk assessment based on hi among different age groups 3 70 years due to lifelong exposure to fluoride was summed together to study the lifelong non cancerous risk the following equation was used to calculate cumulative life time non cancerous risk ltnr gržetić and ghariani 2008 usepa 2003 hiltnr σ hi hi3 10years hi11 19years hi20 70years 2 9 statistical analysis the spatial variability of fluoride in groundwater of the studied areas was interpolated using arcgis 10 6 application via inverse distance weighting idw model the idw model is deterministic interpolation method where weightage assigned to the points is inverse to its distance the weightage will increase when the distance is less and vice versa 2d kernel density graph was used for plotting fluoride in different depth of water column 2d kernel density is a non parametric technique for probability density functions kernel density plot is a smoothed colour density representation of scatter plot based on kernel density estimation the idea of density estimation is to take a given sample data and infer the underlying probability density function everywhere including where no data point is presented in kernel density estimation the kernel density plot is a variation of histogram that uses kernel smoothing to plot analysed values finally allows smoother distribution by minimize the noise these smoothed density plot shows an average trend for the scatter plot in a contour plane the sophisticated plotting was prepared in origin 2018 originlab corporation usa all other statistical and graphical presentations were performed on microsoft excel 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluoride contamination in water fluoride concentration and ph level in groundwater from the studied villages of bankey bazar and rajauli block have been shown in table 1 the groundwater in this area is alkaline in nature with ph ranges between 7 36 and 8 18 fig 2 a shows the distribution of fluoride concentration in groundwater from the studied areas fluoride concentration in the groundwater samples n 104 collected from bankey bazar ranges between 0 38 and 8 56 mg l table 1 presence of elevated level of fluoride concentration in groundwater range 0 6 7 2 mg l n 77 was reported from the study area ranjan and yasmin 2019 approximately 52 of the water samples in bankey bazar fig 2a were found within the permissible range of fluoride in drinking water i e 1 5 mg l bis 1996 who 2011 about 4 08 and 48 of the water samples were found to be 0 5 mg l and 0 5 1 5 mg l of fluoride concentration respectively it was evident that fluoride concentrations 0 5 mg l found to develop dental carries and 0 5 1 5 mg l helped in bone and teeth development dissanayake 1991 moreover 34 9 water samples were in the range of 1 5 4 mg l of fluoride concentration fig 2a which might cause several adverse health effects on the population including the children in the studied areas bhaktuari bhoktadih and chandpur were the worst affected villages with respect to fluoride contamination level in groundwater compared to other villages in bankey bazar table 1 the condition was severe in bhaktuari village with fluoride concentration range of 1 48 8 56 mg l mean 3 82 2 03 mg l approximately 11 3 and 1 88 of the water samples were found to be fluoride contaminated in the range 4 8 mg l and 8 mg l respectively presence of such high level of fluoride in drinking water might lead to develop skeletal fluorosis in the living population yasmin et al 2011 confirmed the presence of high fluoride concentration in groundwater from that region however the situation remains same as no preventive measures were taken to provide safe drinking water to the people in those areas the scenario of fluoride contamination in the studied areas of rajauli block was comparatively more dreadful than bankey bazar the concentration of fluoride in the collected water samples n 88 from rajauli block was found within the range of 0 75 8 3 mg l table 1 only 9 of the samples were in the range 0 5 1 5 mg l fig 2a i e below than the safety limit of fluoride in drinking water fluoride concentration in 65 9 of the water samples was found within the range 1 5 4 mg l table 1 and fig 2a which makes the population more vulnerable to fluoride toxicity as it brings consequences like fluorosis on growing children villages like bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih were the worst affected areas in the sampling sites table 1 khandare et al 2005 also reported the presence of high fluoride concentration in groundwater from kachhariadih village groundwater in bhaur has the highest fluoride concentration mean 3 75 1 85 mg l range 1 87 8 3 mg l n 19 among all the 6 villages in rajauli block table 1 only groundwater in ghasiadih village has lowest fluoride concentration 0 822 mg l n 1 and it is below than the permissible limit of fluoride approximately 25 1 of the groundwater samples from different hand pumps of rajauli block were found with fluoride concentration 4 mg l up to 8 3 mg l the fluoride concentration in the range of 4 8 mg l present in drinking water from this study area is worst for human consumption as it leads to the development of skeletal fluorosis it has been reported that when drinking water contains fluoride in the range of 3 6 mg l the skeletal fluorosis with adverse changes in bone structure may be observed ipcs 1984 and a concentration of 4 mg l can be said to be protective against crippling skeletal fluorosis usepa 1985b 3 1 1 spatial distribution of fluoride the spatial variation of groundwater fluoride concentration in bankey bazar and rajouli is shown in fig 2b and c respectively idw method section 2 9 is used to represent the distribution of toxic pollutant s collected from an unknown sampling location with proper gis aided geo reference and spatial interpolation in the studied areas the lowest concentration of fluoride in bankey bazar block was found to be 0 38 mg l in sherghati town lat 24 32 558 and long 84 42 910 fig 2b at a depth of 16 8 m and this hand pump tube well installed by local government water was used by local public nearly 35 persons in the area at community level and on daily basis the maximum concentration of fluoride 8 56 mg l in bankey bazar block was found at bhaktauri village lat 24 33 148 and long 84 38 930 at a depth of 16 8 m this hand pump tube well water was used by a family consisted of 5 members at domestic level the existed maximum fluoride concentration was approx 5 7 times higher than the who recommended value of fluoride in drinking water interestingly both the lowest and highest fluoride concentrations were found at the same depth zone this indicates that two groundwater might be originated from different aquifer source as shown in fig 2b the lowest concentration of fluoride in rajauli block was found to be 0 751 mg l at rajauli bypass near patna ranchi road lat 24 36 650 and long 85 30 617 fig 2c at a depth of 21 3 m and this hand pump tube well water was catered for the need of local people the maximum concentration of fluoride 8 3 mg l in rajauli block was found at bhaunr village lat 24 36 149 and long 85 29 877 at a depth of 33 5 m and this hand pump tube well water was used by a family consisted of 6 members 3 1 2 distribution of fluoride in different depth kernel density graph of fluoride with depth in the studied areas has been shown in fig 3 all the groundwater samples collected from bankey bazar were available at a depth range of 9 14 36 6 m fig 3a though the major presence of fluoride was basically confined at a depth range of 12 2 18 3 m and a concentration of 0 5 8 0 mg l of fluoride was scattered in that depth zone according to the density plot 15 2 18 3 m was the highest density zone of fluoride and beyond the layer of 18 3 m no major fluoridate zone was observed compared to bankey bazar the fluoride contamination scenario in groundwater of rajauli was totally different in rajauli fluoride was present at a depth range of 18 3 36 6 m fig 3b fluoride was more or less evenly scattered in each depth level of underground water column compared to bankey bazar where fluoride was densely present in few depth layers though at a depth of 33 5 35 1 m fluoride was more frequently present with high concentration 1 5 8 0 mg l which indicates that the particular layer might be the hotspot territory for fluoride in that region of nawada district previous study by alabdulaaly et al 2013 reported the same pattern of fluoride distribution in different layers of groundwater aquifers in saudi arabia and the occurrence of high fluoride concentration was observed at a depth range of 15 2 30 5 m 3 2 amount of fluoride in cereal grains the fluoride concentration in the cereals grains collected from different households and markets of bankey bazar and rajauli were presented in fig 4 the fluoride concentration in rice was accounted more than in wheat the mean fluoride concentration in rice was 1 153 0 818 mg kg range 0 226 4 11 mg kg n 63 and 1 374 0 667 mg kg range 0 4 4 46 mg kg n 47 at bankey bazar and rajauli respectively the mean fluoride concentration in wheat was 0 855 0 226 mg kg range 0 52 1 16 mg kg n 54 and 0 84 0 186 mg kg range 0 68 1 32 mg kg n 35 in the collected samples of bankey bazar and rajauli respectively although the fluoride concentration in rice and wheat grain were much lower compared to water fluoride however in broader scenario these two cereals grains are the important dietary sources to the rural population in the studied areas the rice and wheat samples collected from bhoktadih bhaktuari thapran and chandpur village of bankey bazar have higher fluoride concentration as compared to other studied villages of bankey bazar block table 2 whereas the rice and wheat samples collected from bhaunr phulwariya kachhariadih of rajauli block have higher fluoride concentration in grains as compared to rest of the studied villages table 2 the presence of fluoride in the cereal grains was due to the fact that fluoride contaminated groundwater was used for cultivation in the studied areas and finally it entered in plant body system plant can only accumulate fluoride from soil when it is available in soluble form jha et al 2011 the contribution of dietary fluoride from rice wheat pulses and their impacts in exposure dose due to regular consumption were also discussed by other authors bhattacharya et al 2017 gupta and banerjee 2011 jha et al 2011 saini et al 2013 leafy vegetables like spinach and coriander showed higher accumulation of fluoride ranging from 9 88 to 12 9 mg kg and 23 1 25 7 mg kg respectively from an endemic area of gaya district bihar ranjan and yasmin 2015 higher fluoride content in rice was reported due to the use of more fluoridated groundwater for irrigation practices tegegne et al 2013 3 3 daily dietary intake of fluoride the survey on daily consumption habit of water rice and wheat among the population of three different age groups including children 3 10 years teenagers 11 19 years and adults 20 70 years was conducted in this study the mean volume amount of water rice and wheat intake by the studied population was 1 l 55 g 40 g 1 85 l 80 g 65 g and 3 l 185 g 140 g respectively the consumption pattern among the different age groups was being varied due to their difference in physiological and metabolic need a wide variation in dietary intake of fluoride among the studied population was observed table 3 fluoride intake per day by the residing population was categorized based on institute of medicine iom and national health and medical research council nhmrc guidelines iom 1997 nhmrc 2017 it was observed that 52 children from the entire surveyed areas have adequate level of fluoride intake ai i e 0 2 mg day and 48 of the children were characterized as tolerable however 78 of teenagers have fluoride intake with tolerable limits and 21 of adult population have fluoride intake above the ul limit i e 10 mg day the people residing in villages like bhoktiari in bankey bazar and bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih in rajauli have high fluoride intake per day mainly due to the higher mean fluoride concentration in water water contributed approximately 95 of total dietary intakes of fluoride for both the populations from the studied areas based on the data from dietary intakes further calculation of daily exposure dose edi of fluoride and health risk assessment was carried out in this study 3 4 urine fluoride concentration and its relationship with water fluoride the urine samples were collected from the inhabitants as a biomarker to study the recent fluoride exposure through the daily consumption of water and cereals other than plasma serum blood and saliva etc urine is considered as contemporary biomarker to study fluoride exposure on human villa et al 2000 a good correlation could be established between consumed water fluoride and urinary fluoride collected between different time intervals in 24 h cycle opydo szymaczek and borysewicz lewicka 2005 villa et al 2000 so to maintain a constant monitoring of fluoride exposure urine can serve as potential biomarker on this regard the mean urine fluoride concentration in children n 20 teenagers n 15 and adults n 28 of bankey bazar were 2 29 1 45 mg l range 1 15 6 73 mg l 3 05 1 90 mg l range 1 49 8 08 mg l and 3 42 2 35 mg l range 0 66 10 mg l respectively in the case of rajauli the mean urine fluoride in children n 20 teenagers n 17 and adults n 24 were 7 73 3 13 mg l range 3 32 15 2 mg l 6 15 3 11 mg l range 3 18 13 8 mg l and 8 08 4 77 mg l range 3 08 23 6 mg l respectively the urinary fluoride concentration for the rajauli population mean 10 4 4 72 mg l range 3 08 23 6 mg l n 61 has been found higher compared to the bankey bazar population mean 3 004 1 97 mg l range 0 66 10 mg l n 63 this is due to the fact that the rajauli population was exposed to higher concentration of fluoride through mainly drinking water mean 3 2 1 64 mg l range 0 75 8 13 mg l n 88 compared to bankey bazar population mean 2 15 1 78 mg l range 0 38 8 56 mg l n 104 table 1 the regression analysis p 0 05 between water and urine fluoride concentrations among the three studied age groups has been shown in fig 5 the r2 value in each case showed a good correlation between water and urine fluoride concentration among the two studied populations in most of the cases from our study results the urinary fluoride concentration was increased with increase of fluoride concentration in drinking water which was supported by other studies idowu et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 rugg gunn et al 2011 the urine fluoride concentration was increased with age of the studied population compared to children and teenagers fluoride excretion through urine was higher in adults this might be due to the saturation of fluoride absorption in the calcified tissues for adults that resulted rapid excretion of ingested fluoride through urine on later stage myers 1978 however during developmental phase at young ages fluoride gets rapidly absorbed into calcified tissues e g bones and teeth in children and teenagers compare to adults whitford 1996 1999 on the other hand the higher absorption rate of fluoride in the calcified tissues leads to the reduction in fluoride excretion through urine for children and teenagers body system rango et al 2014 the different rate of urinary excretion of fluoride among the different population from same age groups were also influenced by the diet habits protein and nutrient rich supplements water and other food intake genetic variation among population urinary flow rate and urinary ph usnrc 2006 yoder et al 1998 3 5 health risk assessment for fluoride exposure through consumption of water and cereal grains assessment of health risk due to fluoride exposure is a necessary tool to evaluate the potential damage caused by its consumption on daily basis the health risk assessment for fluoride was based on the ingestion of fluoride through different exposure routes i e water rice and wheat the health risk assessment for three different age groups in this study was evaluated based on central tendency exposure cte scenario and reasonable maximum exposure rme scenario by using 90th percentile value of the obtained fluoride concentration in water rice and wheat bhattacharya et al 2017 the detailed edi values for cte and rme scenario of the two studied areas have been presented in table 4 for three different age groups of the studied populations the institute of medicine iom us provided the tolerable upper intake level ul of fluoride ingestion considering all sources iom 1997 the recommended ul value of fluoride for infants toddlers and children up to 8 years is 0 1 mg kg bw day and for children 8 years old and adults is 0 15 0 2 mg kg bw day irrespective of their body weights based on cte and rme scenarios in most of the cases the cumulative edi values for children of bhoktidah bhaktuari goitha dhakanchuan chandpur and balasot village of bankey bazar block and tilaiya bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih village of rajauli block were found to have higher fluoride intake compared to the recommended ul limit specially the children of bhaktuari bhaunr and kachhariadih were exposed to 2 folds higher in fluoride uptake than the ul limit the children in the age group of 8 10 years bw 40 kg nhmrc 2017 had ul value less than iom limit of 0 15 0 2 mg kg bw day for both cte 0 011 0 106 mg kg bw day and rme 0 014 0 14 mg kg bw day scenarios the similar kind of observation was also reported from fluoride endemic areas of uttar pradesh india tiwari et al 2017 the intake of fluoride by teenagers were below the ul limit about 28 7 of the population in this study was children below 8 years of old and much vulnerable due to high ul value in both cte 0 017 0 161 mg kg bw day and rme 0 022 0 215 mg kg bw day however the rest of the population in the age group of 8 70 years had ul value less than iom limit except the adults of bhaktuari bhaunr and kachhariadih had fluoride intake level of 0 15 mg kg bw day the cumulative cte and rme edi calculated for children of rajauli block was found much higher than suggested ul value for fluoride compared to the children of bankey bazar the cumulative edi value in this study for cte and rme scenario in bankey bazar and rajauli showed that children in these two study areas were exposed to more fluoride as compared to other two age groups teenagers and adults the similar trend of observations were supported earlier by other studies bhattacharya et al 2017 jha et al 2011 keshavarz et al 2015 the cumulative fluoride exposure doses for children were 1 49 and 1 22 folds higher in bankey bazar and 1 62 and 1 21 folds higher in rajauli compared to the teenagers and adults in the studied populations respectively in the present study where fluoride concentration was relatively high in groundwater drinking water becomes increasingly important source of fluoride exposure who 2006 drinking water fluoride contributed on an average 95 9 and 96 in bankey bazar and 96 2 and 96 7 in rajauli to the studied populations considering all age groups with respect to their edicumulative for cte and rme respectively bo et al 2003 reported similar kind of observation in their study in jilin province china other than drinking water water used for cooking different food items also contributed significantly to the cumulative daily fluoride consumption for all age groups compared to the contributions from rice and wheat grain chavoshi et al 2011 erdal and buchanan 2005 keshavarz et al 2015 3 6 evolution of health risk associated to fluoride exposure in different age groups the hazard index hi values have been studied to measure the non carcinogenic risk in children teenagers and adults due to the consumption of fluoride contaminated groundwater and cereal grains according to the standard recommendation from usepa for health risk assessment the allowable limit for any hazard index is up to 1 usepa 2004 for non carcinogenic risk assessment hi 1 indicates high risk of fluorosis among the exposed population and hi 1 indicates a tolerable limit of non carcinogenic risk among population the hazard index values of fluoride for cte and rme scenario for three different age groups from the studied areas has been shown in fig 6 for fluoride the hazard index should be 1 is acceptable otherwise a detail risk assessment is required to evaluate the threat canada health act annual report 2004 till now there is no specific rfd value available in india to evaluate hi the hi is generally estimated by comparing the obtained edi with the recommended rfd value 0 06 mg kg bw day by usepa which includes fluoride dose intake from water 0 05 mg kg bw day and dietary sources 0 01 mg kg bw day usepa 1987 in most of the cases in this study the hi values for both cte fig 6a and rme fig 6b scenario for the three different studied age groups were 1 and moreover the children were exposed more from fluoride toxicity compared to teenagers and children specially the studied populations residing in bhaktuari village in bankey bazar block and bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih villages of rajauli block were found to have very high hi values all these health risk assessment studies on different age groups clearly indicate that the studied populations were in a greater risk of fluorosis which was supported by the previous study in this region jha et al 2011 as a micronutrient fluoride plays a crucial role in the development of bones and teeth at young age however a study in iran reported that 0 5 mg l dose of fluoride impacts the human thyroid hormones activity kheradpisheh et al 2018 in shanyin county shanxi province china children s intelligence and growth were affected by high concentration of fluoride in drinking water wang et al 2007 therefore all these study reports support our findings that children in bankey bazar and rajauli were more threatened due to fluoride toxicity the difference in hi values for three different age groups of bankey bazar and rajauli were mainly due to the variation in the fluoride concentration in water rice and wheat chavoshi et al 2011 erdal and buchanan 2005 the life of most individuals from all age groups in this study is at the brink of non cancerous risk of fluorosis due to the high hi values for both rme and cte scenario usepa 2003 3 6 1 contribution of water and cereals in non cancerous health risk index the contribution percentage of individual fluoride exposure pathway through water rice and wheat grain to hazard index hi has been shown in fig 7 approximately 95 and 96 of the hi was derived from water for each age group in bankey bazar and rajauli respectively the high contribution of water in hi is mainly due to the increasing consumption of water due the prevalence of hot climatic condition in this region of india it was reported that the estimated exposure dose of fluoride through water was much higher in hi compared to other foodstuffs in the populations of bushehr and dayyer iran battaleb looie et al 2013 keshavarz et al 2015 bo et al 2003 reported that approximately 90 of the calculated hi was derived from water in a study conducted in jilin province china hi value was directly estimated from edi and water was the principal source of fluoride intake among each age group chavoshi et al 2011 thus water was the main contributor to the calculated hi and might possess different health issues upon exposure 3 6 2 comparative evaluation of hi with previous studies the comparative evaluation of hi with previous findings has been presented in fig 8 the findings in this study clearly indicate that the children teenagers and adults have high health risk due to the exposure of fluoride from both bankey bazar and rajauli a fluoride exposure and health risk study by yousefi et al 2018 in poldasht iran reported that the mean hi of the exposed population was 1 and children were highly exposed to fluoride toxicity as compared to teenagers and adults a previous study by guissouma et al 2017 among different age groups in tunisia also confirmed that the vulnerability among young population was more than adults due to fluoride exposure a similar study by jha et al 2009 in unnao district uttar pradesh india observed that infants were at higher risk of vulnerability due to fluoride exposure similarly a seasonal study on fluoride exposure and related health risk conducted by rahman et al 2020 in bangladesh reported that mean hi value of the children were 1 81 and 2 22 folds higher than teenagers and adults respectively the hi value of infants and children in northwest of china was much higher upon fluoride exposure as 72 and 60 of the infants and children had mean hi 1 than adults who had relatively lower proportion of affection chen et al 2017 the adverse effect of fluoride exposure on children was revealed in an earlier study from birbhum district west bengal india mukherjee et al 2019 where mean hi value of children was increased by 2 32 and 11 29 folds as compared to teenagers and adults respectively whereas the magnitude of severity from fluoride exposure was not up to that extent in agra ali et al 2017 as compared to birbhum however the children were still have high hi value than adult population it was observed that mean hi values of children teenagers and adults were exceeded the safe limit hi 1 in the present study like other findings discussed above though like this study all the previous studies agreed that children had highest possible risk from fluoride toxicity as their hi values were much higher than the acceptable limit hi 1 3 7 assessment of life time non cancerous risk and present scenario of fluoride affected people the hiltnr is an estimate of cumulative life time non cancer risk due to the continuous inhalation of fluoride for life long period for each individual bhattacharya et al 2017 gržetić et al 2008 total life time non cancerous risk ltnr of fluoride toxicity for ages between 3 and 70 years is presented in fig 9 the greater hiltnr value the greater is the risk of developing severe chronic toxicity of fluoride among people the ltnr evaluated for cte and rme scenarios of bhaktuari villages of bankey bazar were found 6 5 and 8 67 respectively the opposite scenario was observed in raksi and sherghati villages of bankey bazar as the ltnr value for cte and rme scenario of raksi were 1 09 and 1 45 respectively and in sherghati 0 71 and 0 94 respectively in rajauli the estimated ltnr value for cte and rme scenario were found very high for bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih and the trend was totally opposite for ghasiadih village with low score of ltnr value the ltnr value for the studied population residing in areas like bhoktuari bhaunr khachhariadih was increased by 4 7 9 2 folds as compared to the areas like raksi sherghati and ghasiadih the similar kind of observations was reported from endemic fluoride affected regions in bankura and purulia districts of west bengal india bhattacharya et al 2017 altogether the life time non cancerous risk ltnr from fluoride exposure among the sensitive populations starting from childhood to adulthood residing in bankey bazar and rajauli were much higher and these high values of hiltnr may bring serious life threating consequences to the people a good number of populations in this survey were suffering from several adverse health effects of fluoride with special reference to dental skeletal fluorosis fig 10 altogether 9 out of 19 villages in bankey bazar and rajauli have been identified with fluoride affected patients approximately 20 3 and 33 of the surveyed populations have been suffering from fluorosis from dhaneta bhaktuari chandpur bhaluhar bhoktidah villages of bankey bazar n 637 and tilaiya bhaur phulwaria and kachhariadih villages of rajauli block n 803 respectively in bankey bazar the condition was quite severe in the case of bhaktuari bhoktidah and chandpur where maximum numbers of fluorosis patients 40 4 33 3 and 27 5 respectively have been identified fig 11 in rajauli the situation in bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih was worst as 42 33 7 and 32 3 of the population have been identified with different types of fluorosis among the six studied villages fig 11 therefore there is an urgent need to take special measures to reduce the undesirable health effects on the local populations 3 8 probabilistic health risk assessment for fluoride contaminated foodstuffs ingestion of drinking water is not only the elevated source of fluoride the foodstuffs contribute a small amount to dietary intakes and pose threat to human health in the case of consumption of highest brand of fluoride through foodstuffs like rice and wheat for the studied population the calculated edicumulative hi and hiltnr values become much lower compared to the threshold level of potential life risk for both cte and rme scenarios fig 12 the similar trend has been observed in the case for lowest brand of fluoride consumption for both cte and rme scenarios fig 12 however the consumption of other foodstuffs like pulses leafy and non leafy vegetables fruits tea milk meat fish etc from the studied areas was not considered in the risk analysis which might contribute additional amount of fluoride as reported in other studies from fluoride endemic areas bhattacharya and samal 2018 bhattacharya et al 2017 3 9 probabilistic risk characterization from fluoride exposure the current scenario of fluoride affected people in bankey bazar and rajauli block was very much accountable to discuss potential health risk from fluoride exposure table 5 among the population in near future 3 9 1 tooth cavities in bankey bazar block only 4 water samples fig 2a were below than the who recommended limit of fluoride i e class i 0 5 mg l which indicates the risk of dental caries among the population who 1996 however the fluoride concentration in groundwater samples of rajauli block was observed 0 5 mg l about 48 and 9 of the water samples from bankey bazar and rajauli block were in the range 0 5 1 5 mg l class ii respectively table 5 which promotes the development of tooth and bones 3 9 2 dental fluorosis the children from 14 out of 19 villages 73 in the studied areas table 4 had fluoride intake more than the usepa recommended dose of fluoride per day i e 60 μg kg bw day usepa 2001 which demonstrate the risk of dental fluorosis among the children the fluoride concentration of these 14 villages bhaktuari dhakanchuan chandpur balasot kamalpur bhoktadih goitha baluhar banhagaw of bankey bazar and tilaiya rajauli bypass bhaunr phulwariya kachhariadih of rajauli were 1 5 mg l which is categorized under class iii level and this amount of fluoride concentration was responsible for the dental fluorosis among the populations acute to chronic dental fluorosis results through consumption of water fluoride 1 5 mg l where the tooth become coloured from yellow to brown brindha and elango 2011 about 35 and 66 of the water samples from bankey bazar and rajauli block were in the range 1 5 4 0 mg l respectively table 5 the risk characterization based on the estimation of hi also found that the calculated hi value for three age groups were exceeded the unitary value hi 1 doornaert and pichard 2006 3 9 3 skeletal fluorosis the results from this study table 4 observed that the children from bhaktuari village of bankey bazar and bhaunr and kachhariadih villages of rajauli had high fluoride intake than the recommended limit of 200 μg kg bw day anses 2007 the fluoride concentration in groundwater samples collected from these villages was 4 0 mg l which might cause skeletal fluorosis long term consumption of higher level of fluoride through drinking water results in skeletal fluorosis which causes weakness and bending of the bones brindha and elango 2011 about 13 and 25 of the water samples from bankey bazar and rajauli block were in the range 4 0 10 mg l respectively table 5 the hi values of these 3 villages were observed 2 3 times higher than permissible limit and the high hi values indicate the possible threat of skeletal fluorosis among the populations previous studies in west azerbaijan iran brazil and india reported intake of elevated level of fluoride through drinking water ultimately leads to the development of skeletal fluorosis among the inhabitants asawa et al 2015 catani et al 2007 mohammadi et al 2017 3 9 4 crippling fluorosis in this exposure and risk assessment study no concentration or intake of fluoride was found 10 mg l which results in crippling fluorosis brindha and elango 2011 so the surveyed population might not be facing the threat of skeletal fluorosis upon fluoride exposure 3 10 classification of health risk based on fluoride exposure rate based on cumulative estimated daily intake edicumulative of fluoride for rme table 4 and probabilistic risk characterization from fluoride exposure table 5 classification of health risk class i v based on fluoride exposure rate among different age groups through intake of water and foodstuffs from the two studied areas has been shown in fig 13 approximately 58 9 and 61 1 of the studied populations from all age groups and 7 6 and 33 3 of the children might be at risk of suffering from dental fluorosis class iii and skeletal fluorosis class iv in bankey bazar and rajauli respectively no risk of suffering has been observed from crippling fluorosis class v in the studied populations 4 conclusion a detailed assessment of health risk was carried out in this study in relation to fluoride exposure through drinking water and cultivated crops in three different age groups of the studied populations from two exposed areas of bihar approximately 48 1 and 91 of the groundwater samples were found to contain more than recommended limit of fluoride in drinking water i e 1 5 mg l in bankey bazar and rajauli respectively the 2d kernel density plot showed that fluoride was scattered in groundwater in the depth range of 12 2 18 3 m in bankey bazar whereas in rajauli it was restricted to a depth range of 18 3 36 6 m the local grown cereal grains consumed by the studied populations were also contaminated with fluoride the daily exposure dose from water and cereal grains for the three different age groups of the study areas had high cumulative edi value than the rfd value of 0 06 mg kg bw day the ul value for children of bhaktuari bhaunr and khachhariadih was found higher by 2 folds than the threshold limit prescribed by iom the hi value for both cte and rme scenario suggested that all the three age groups in this study were in vulnerable stage due to fluoride toxicity especially the children water was appeared as main factor as compared to cereals to elevate the potential risk by contributing significantly in cumulative hi the cumulative hi hilntr values were calculated for rme and cte scenario to address the life time non cancer risk and found very high than the threshold limit for the populations living in bhaktuari bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih villages from the studied areas the probabilistic risk assessment was also discussed for the potential threat of dental caries dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis among the inhabitants in bankey bazar and rajauli so based on the health risk assessment studies this public health issue in the selected parts of gaya and nawada districts are needed to be addressed by providing safe drinking water the rain water harvesting and treated water for irrigation practice may reduce the fluoride accumulation in cereal grains finally a constant monitoring and exposure programme will be needed to carry out the further risk assessment due to fluoride toxicity in this region as well the other parts of these two districts this cohort study can be served as niche to the planners and policymakers to identify fluoride hotspots areas in this region and will be useful to develop proper watershed management for supply clean and safe drinking water to the populations in the fluoride endemic zones this assessment study also can provide a similar

11938,an investigation was carried out in bankey bazar block of gaya and rajauli block of nawada districts in bihar to assess the fluoride contamination magnitude in groundwater and cultivated crops the toxicological risk of fluoride exposure on three different age groups of the local populations has been measured the groundwater was highly contaminated with fluoride mean 2 64 1 8 mg l and alkaline in character mean ph 7 8 0 38 about 48 1 and 91 of the groundwater samples from bankey bazar mean 2 15 1 78 mg l and rajauli mean 3 2 1 64 mg l respectively cross the permissible limit of fluoride in drinking water the major presence of fluoride in bankey bazar and rajauli was confined at a depth range of 12 2 18 3 m 0 5 8 0 mg l and 33 5 35 1 m 1 5 8 0 mg l respectively and expected to be the hotspot territory in the regions mean fluoride concentrations in locally grown rice and wheat grain were found as 1 15 0 81 1 374 0 667 mg kg and 0 855 0 226 0 84 0 186 mg kg respectively mean urinary fluoride concentrations of the studied populations were 10 4 4 72 and 3 004 1 97 mg l respectively the cumulative edi value for cte and rme of the studied children was higher as compared to teenagers and adults the hazard index hi for all the age groups residing in bhaktuari of bankey bazar and bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih of rajauli block was found much higher than the permissible limit hi 1 a good number of populations were suffering from dental and skeletal fluorosis the life time non cancerous risk hiltnr and probabilistic risk assessment based on fluoride exposure showed the potential threat among the residing populations graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoride groundwater cereals estimated daily intake hazard index probabilistic risk assessment 1 introduction the requirement of freshwater in day to day life is increasing on rapid rate freshwater is not only used for consumption purpose however also used in industrial and irrigation sectors rajesh et al 2015 the toxic effluents from households agricultural fields and industries pollute the freshwater reservoirs singaraja et al 2012 which creates a scarcity of fresh water globally other than anthropogenic pollution of water the groundwater is contaminated with many natural hazardous materials like arsenic fluoride bromide nitrate sulphate etc abiye and bhattacharya 2019 alcaine et al 2020 ali et al 2019 chakraborti et al 2016 chowdhury et al 2020 das et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2005 lucht and casey 2019 sharma and kumar 2020 fluoride is one of the halide basically present in granitic terrains adimalla and venkatayogi 2017 the arid and semi arid regions are more likely to be contaminated with fluoride due to the rapid chemical weathering of underneath minerals fluoride in underground aquifers comes from fluoride bearing minerals like fluorite topaz and apatite ayoob and gupta 2006 bundschuh et al 2017 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 yadav et al 2018 globally 200 million people across 29 countries including india china saudi arabia united states u s uganda tanzania and ethiopia consume fluoridated water on daily basis for different purposes ali et al 2016 amini et al 2008 brindha and elango 2011 kimambo et al 2019 liu et al 2014 various studies have been conducted to evaluate the magnitude of fluoride contamination in different parts of india jacks et al 2005 narsimha and sudarshan 2016 groundwater in several parts of andhra pradesh was contaminated with fluoride rao 2003 2009 rao and devadas 2003 rao et al 2017 similarly parts of tamil nadu were also contaminated with high groundwater fluoride gowrisankar et al 2017 jagadeshan and elango 2015 jagadeshan et al 2015a b magesh et al 2016 the northern and western states of india like haryana gujrat rajasthan and maharasthra were heavily contaminated with fluoride ali et al 2018 garg et al 2009 madhnure et al 2007 salve et al 2007 suthar et al 2008 other states like uttar pradesh west bengal bihar and north eastern hilly states like assam and tripura were reported with presence of higher level of fluoride in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2017 2020 hanse et al 2019 ranjan and yasmin 2019 yadav et al 2019 extensive use of agrochemicals and contaminated sewage and industrial effluent is also elevating the fluoride level in water agricultural fields are also getting contaminated due to the use of fluoride contaminated groundwater fornasiero 2001 kusa et al 2004 the plants cultivated using the contaminated water and agrochemicals also accumulate a good amount of fluoride in the different plant parts especially edible parts davison and weinstein 1998 previous studies also claimed that ingestion of water fluoride as a major cause of fluorosis ali et al 2019 ghaderpoori et al 2019 keshavarz et al 2015 a part of fluoride is still coming from food sources other than water thus the evaluation of fluoride from different food sources need to be addressed bhattacharya et al 2017 pal et al 2012 fluoride is one of the essential micronutrients which possesses both beneficial and detrimental effect on human health through the consumption of drinking water and other food sources chavoshi et al 2011 fromme et al 2009 kimambo et al 2019 there is very narrow line of fluoride dose between its essentiality and deleterious effect on health the highly electronegative fluoride ion is attracted by other positive metal ions ca and na and even in low concentration 0 5 mg l fluoride gets binds with ca in teeth which results in dental caries dissanayake 1991 keshavarz et al 2015 lower fluoride level in drinking water can cause dental fluorosis especially in warmer countries due to higher water consumption cao 1992 ipcs 1984 usepa 1985a however earlier studies found no or negligible effect on dental caries with water fluoride concentration 1 mg l dobaradaran et al 2009 rahmani et al 2010 subba reddy and tewari 1992 reported that the mutilated morphology of the fluorotic teeth enhances plaque accumulation and food lodgment that initiates dental caries the consumption of higher dose of fluoride 1 5 mg l cause fluorosis in children and consumption of more than 4 10 mg l of fluoride can lead to the development of dental and skeletal fluorosis dissanayake 1991 queste et al 2001 the permissible limit of fluoride set by world health organization is 1 5 mg l who 2006 apparently the highest desirable and maximum permissible range of fluoride sets by the indian council of medical research icmr are 1 0 and 1 5 mg l respectively icmr 1975 though the fluoride concentration from 0 6 to 1 2 mg l in drinking water is beneficial for development of bones and teeth bis 2003 brindha and elango 2011 usepa 2010 drinking water minerals and mineral balance was studied extensively considering its importance health significance and safety precautions rosborg 2015 bruvo et al 2008 reported that ca with a concentration of 170 mg l had the same antidental caries effects as fluoride with 1 mg l in drinking water and an optimum content of ca 40 50 mg l and f 0 75 mg l in drinking water was recommended to control dental caries in a studied populations of denmark presence of ca mg and hco3 in optimum concentrations in drinking water might play a significant role for a healthy body rylander 2008 concentrations of the elements like as f se pb cu fe mn and na in drinking water are much lower than concentrations of ca mg hco3 and so4 2 parr 1996 rosborg 2015 however daily intake of certain trace elements through drinking water gives a substantial contribution to the human health effects the long time exposure of fluoride may cause immense health problems xiang et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 the study of biomarker like urine milk sweats are also useful tool to know the recent exposure of fluoride dose rugg gunn et al 2011 urine can be used as a biomarker to study the recent and chronic exposure of fluoride in human beings as part of the absorbed fluoride in intestinal tract excreted via urine riddell et al 2019 bihar counts as category iii fluoride endemic state 50 of the districts affected in india susheela 2001 an earlier study conducted by susheela 1987 on bihar reported that approximately 30 50 of the populations were suffered from fluorosis in fluoride affected areas however in recent decades several studies were conducted on exposure of fluoride and its associated health risk in few districts of bihar kumar et al 2016 ranjan and yasmin 2019 yasmin et al 2011 gaya and nawada are the two districts where presence of fluoride in groundwater was confirmed by previous studies grover et al 2003 yasmin et al 2011 few local governmental agencies like public health engineering dept phed and central ground water board cgwb carried out investigations to address the fluorosis endemism in gaya yasmin et al 2011 the rocky terrain in south bihar has been already established to be contaminated with fluoride and many groundwater aquifers in this region have higher fluoride concentration khandare et al 2005 yasmin et al 2013 than who recommended permissible limit of 1 5 mg l the predominance of biotite in the rock and soil samples confirmed the geogenic source of fluoride in these regions ranjan and yasmin 2019 in a recent study groundwater in the rocky terrain of northern tanzania was reported to be fluoride contaminated with major fluoride bearing phases being titanite amphibole hornblende and biotite ijumulana et al 2020 previous studies on gaya and nawada only exposed the groundwater fluoride contamination scenario and determined the extent of fluorosis to some extent the present study aims to address the issues related to exposure of fluoride in groundwater with special reference to its spatial variation and depth wise distribution fluoride uptake by crops rice and wheat locally grown using fluoride contaminated groundwater toxicity assessment due to fluoride exposure and related health risk assessment of the studied population due to the physiological and behavioural differences the studied population was divided into three age groups children teenagers adults to estimate the fluoride exposure and non carcinogenic risk through consumption of groundwater and cereal grains locally cultivated in the studied areas of bankey bazar and rajauli block 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area two blocks namely bankey bazar and rajauli have been selected as study areas from gaya and nawada district respectively located in the southern part of bihar fig 1 gaya is famous for its historical importance and geographically located between longitude 85 0002 e and latitude 24 7914 n with a total area of 308 31 km2 and a population of 4 391 418 census 2011a gaya is situated 100 km away from the capital city patna and falgu is the main river flows through this district the district lies 120 m above the sea level gaya basically has hot temperate climatic condition with an average temperature of 26 5 c and an annual rainfall of 1105 mm total 13 villages in bankey bazar were surveyed during the study period june july 2019 namely dhaneta kamalpur bhoktadih raksi bhaktuari goitha bhalupur thaprand dhakan chuan chandpur balasot banahagaw and sherghati nawada is the neighbouring district of gaya located between longitude 85 5435 e and latitude 24 8867 n occupies a total area of 2494 km2 and a population of 2 219 146 census 2011b most of the parts of nawada district are plain except few hilly regions in rajauli block total 6 villages were surveyed namely tilaiya ghasiadih rajauli bypass bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih the overall climatic pattern is similar to the gaya with an annual average temperature of 26 4 c and an annual rainfall of 972 mm the major source of drinking water comes from the hand pumped tube wells and groundwater is also used for the cultivation purposes to irrigate the fields the studied populations are mainly rural and their main occupational income comes from the daily wage basis work and farming 2 2 sample collection preservation and preparation total 192 groundwater samples were collected out of which 104 samples from bankey bazar block gaya district and other 88 samples from rajauli block nawada district all the water samples were collected in individual properly cleaned polyethylene bottle 250 ml the collected water samples were not treated with any chemicals or preservatives and transported to the laboratory for further analysis for the collection of urine samples each of 20 ml polyethylene vial was used the urine samples were collected as biomarker to evaluate the exposure of fluoride in the body system a total number of 124 urine samples were collected out of which 63 samples were from bankey bazar and 61 samples were from rajauli the collected urine samples were not treated with any chemical or preservative stored in icebox to minimize the degradation during transportation and kept inside the refrigerator at 4 c in laboratory until further analysis kumar et al 2017 rice oryza sativa l and wheat triticum aestivum l are the main cereal crops in these regions and also the staple dietary food source for the local inhabitants the crops were locally grown and entered the local market apart from the collection of crops by the farmers from their own agricultural lands the food samples were collected from the household level and local markets to understand the health exposure and additional risk factor of fluoride through consumption of staple food sources among the studied populations a total number of 63 rice grain and 54 wheat grain samples were collected from bankey bazar similarly 47 rice grain and 35 wheat grain samples were collected from rajauli all the collected cereals were kept in plastic zipper bags for further analysis rice and wheat grains were washed thoroughly with double distilled water and dried at 60 c inside an oven the dried grain sample was then powered using a mortar and pestle 2 3 chemicals and reagents all the chemical and reagents used during this experiment were of laboratory grade to avoid any other mineral contamination double distilled water was used throughout the chemical analysis procedures the reagents like naoh and hcl were purchased from merck mumbai india the fluoride standard solution naf was available from thermo fisher scientific usa orion 940907 tisab iii total ionic strength adjustment buffer solution used for sample preparation was purchased from thermo fisher scientific usa orion 940911 2 4 digestion of cereal grains the earlier prescribed method by mcquaker and gurney 1977 was followed to extract the total fluoride from rice and wheat grains about 0 5 g of the powdered sample was taken in a 25 ml nickel crucible few drops of double distilled water followed by 6 ml of 8 n naoh solutions were added then the crucible was placed at 150 c for 2 h inside an oven the crucible was taken out placed inside a muffle furnace initially at 400 c with a gradual raised up to 600 c and kept for 30 min the crucible was then allowed to cool properly for dissolution of naoh fusion cake 10 ml of double distilled water was added finally the ph was reduced at 8 9 by adding concentrated hcl drop wise with continuous stirring the volume of the ph adjusted sample was made up to 50 ml with double distilled water and filtered through whatman no 42 filter paper the filtrate solutions were then preserved for fluoride estimation 2 5 analysis of fluoride fluoride concentration of all water and urine samples were analysed following the recommended procedure by american society for testing and materials astm astm 2010 fluoride concentration was measured electrochemically by ph ion selective electrode ise meter thermo scientific orion star a214 combined with fluoride electrode orion ise model no 9609bnwp a stock solution of 100 mg l naf was used for preparation of several standard fluoride solutions of 10 1 0 and 0 1 mg l through serial dilutions respectively to measure the sample fluoride concentration buffer grade iii solution was added to the sample at 1 10 ratio prior to the measurement of fluoride the ion meter was calibrated to a slope of 59 2 2 0 urine and digested cereal grain samples were diluted to 4 ml with water in 1 1 v v ratio and 0 4 ml of tisab iii was added for estimation of fluoride 2 6 quality control and quality assurance the reliability accuracy and precision of the generated analytical data were confirmed through standardization routine blank measurements and analysis of spiked samples das et al 2020 quality control tests were also performed by analyzing duplicates and calculating recovery 98 2 of spiked fluoride digested samples 2 7 evolution of fluoride dose exposure the fluoride exposure dose was assessed based on the intake of water and amount of food grains consumed per day by a person in this study the population was divided into three different age groups having their own dietary intake levels the three age groups irrespective of their gender like 3 10 years children 11 19 years teenagers and 20 70 years adults have been selected to evaluate the potential health risk due to the exposure of fluoride all related data about consumption habit of water and cereals were collected based on the guidelines provided by the national institute of nutrition hyderabad india thimmayamma and rau 1987 the quantitative fluoride exposure dose through dietary source was calculated in terms of estimated daily intake edi of water and foodstuffs cereals the calculation of edi was based on the formula introduced by usepa usepa 1992 e d i c i r e f e d a f c f b w a t where edi is the estimated daily intake mg kg bw day c is the concentration of fluoride in water mg l and cereal grains mg kg ir is the daily intake rate of water l d and cereals mg d ef is the exposure frequency d year ed is the exposure duration year af is the absorption factor unit less cf is the conversion factor 10 6 bw is the body weight kg and at averaging time d to calculate the exposure dose for three age groups children teenagers adults the body weights were taken as 19 kg children 52 kg teenagers and 70 kg adults respectively according to the usepa guidelines keshavarz 2015 usepa 2011 as there is no available data about body weight for indian aged group the exposures of fluoride and risk assessments for three age groups were performed for average or central tendency exposure cte and the high end or reasonable maximum exposure rme scenarios which was intended to represent a plausible worst case exposure erdal and buchanan 2005 usepa 1989 the ingested fluoride via all possible sources was readily absorbed in gastro intestinal tract and the estimated absorption of fluoride in gastro intestinal tract was 75 100 atsdr 2001 thus the af in this study to evaluate the exposure was taken 75 and 100 for cte and rme scenarios respectively bhattacharya et al 2017 the at was taken equal to ed 365 d year the characterization of fluoride exposure among the different age groups through drinking water and cereal grains was calculated in terms of cumulative edi with the following equation edicumulative ediwater edirice ediwheat 2 8 assessment of health risk from fluoride exposure to measure the quantitative health risk associated to fluoride exposure on three different age groups hazard index hi was calculated hazard index is basically a ratio between cumulative edi value and reference dose of fluoride hazard index hi is calculated according to usepa s recommended formula usepa 1993 h i e d i c u m u l a t i v e r f d for fluoride the oral reference dose rfd value of human was assumed to be 0 06 mg kg bw day usepa 2003 rfd was derived from the noael no observed adverse effect level value of 0 06 mg kg bw day usepa 1993 and loael lowest observe adverse effect level value of 0 12 mg kg bw day on children for causing dental fluorosis hodge 1950 the noael value was divided by uncertainty factor um and modifying factor mf the value of both um and mf is 1 hodge 1950 r f d n o a e l u m m f the health risk assessment based on hi among different age groups 3 70 years due to lifelong exposure to fluoride was summed together to study the lifelong non cancerous risk the following equation was used to calculate cumulative life time non cancerous risk ltnr gržetić and ghariani 2008 usepa 2003 hiltnr σ hi hi3 10years hi11 19years hi20 70years 2 9 statistical analysis the spatial variability of fluoride in groundwater of the studied areas was interpolated using arcgis 10 6 application via inverse distance weighting idw model the idw model is deterministic interpolation method where weightage assigned to the points is inverse to its distance the weightage will increase when the distance is less and vice versa 2d kernel density graph was used for plotting fluoride in different depth of water column 2d kernel density is a non parametric technique for probability density functions kernel density plot is a smoothed colour density representation of scatter plot based on kernel density estimation the idea of density estimation is to take a given sample data and infer the underlying probability density function everywhere including where no data point is presented in kernel density estimation the kernel density plot is a variation of histogram that uses kernel smoothing to plot analysed values finally allows smoother distribution by minimize the noise these smoothed density plot shows an average trend for the scatter plot in a contour plane the sophisticated plotting was prepared in origin 2018 originlab corporation usa all other statistical and graphical presentations were performed on microsoft excel 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluoride contamination in water fluoride concentration and ph level in groundwater from the studied villages of bankey bazar and rajauli block have been shown in table 1 the groundwater in this area is alkaline in nature with ph ranges between 7 36 and 8 18 fig 2 a shows the distribution of fluoride concentration in groundwater from the studied areas fluoride concentration in the groundwater samples n 104 collected from bankey bazar ranges between 0 38 and 8 56 mg l table 1 presence of elevated level of fluoride concentration in groundwater range 0 6 7 2 mg l n 77 was reported from the study area ranjan and yasmin 2019 approximately 52 of the water samples in bankey bazar fig 2a were found within the permissible range of fluoride in drinking water i e 1 5 mg l bis 1996 who 2011 about 4 08 and 48 of the water samples were found to be 0 5 mg l and 0 5 1 5 mg l of fluoride concentration respectively it was evident that fluoride concentrations 0 5 mg l found to develop dental carries and 0 5 1 5 mg l helped in bone and teeth development dissanayake 1991 moreover 34 9 water samples were in the range of 1 5 4 mg l of fluoride concentration fig 2a which might cause several adverse health effects on the population including the children in the studied areas bhaktuari bhoktadih and chandpur were the worst affected villages with respect to fluoride contamination level in groundwater compared to other villages in bankey bazar table 1 the condition was severe in bhaktuari village with fluoride concentration range of 1 48 8 56 mg l mean 3 82 2 03 mg l approximately 11 3 and 1 88 of the water samples were found to be fluoride contaminated in the range 4 8 mg l and 8 mg l respectively presence of such high level of fluoride in drinking water might lead to develop skeletal fluorosis in the living population yasmin et al 2011 confirmed the presence of high fluoride concentration in groundwater from that region however the situation remains same as no preventive measures were taken to provide safe drinking water to the people in those areas the scenario of fluoride contamination in the studied areas of rajauli block was comparatively more dreadful than bankey bazar the concentration of fluoride in the collected water samples n 88 from rajauli block was found within the range of 0 75 8 3 mg l table 1 only 9 of the samples were in the range 0 5 1 5 mg l fig 2a i e below than the safety limit of fluoride in drinking water fluoride concentration in 65 9 of the water samples was found within the range 1 5 4 mg l table 1 and fig 2a which makes the population more vulnerable to fluoride toxicity as it brings consequences like fluorosis on growing children villages like bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih were the worst affected areas in the sampling sites table 1 khandare et al 2005 also reported the presence of high fluoride concentration in groundwater from kachhariadih village groundwater in bhaur has the highest fluoride concentration mean 3 75 1 85 mg l range 1 87 8 3 mg l n 19 among all the 6 villages in rajauli block table 1 only groundwater in ghasiadih village has lowest fluoride concentration 0 822 mg l n 1 and it is below than the permissible limit of fluoride approximately 25 1 of the groundwater samples from different hand pumps of rajauli block were found with fluoride concentration 4 mg l up to 8 3 mg l the fluoride concentration in the range of 4 8 mg l present in drinking water from this study area is worst for human consumption as it leads to the development of skeletal fluorosis it has been reported that when drinking water contains fluoride in the range of 3 6 mg l the skeletal fluorosis with adverse changes in bone structure may be observed ipcs 1984 and a concentration of 4 mg l can be said to be protective against crippling skeletal fluorosis usepa 1985b 3 1 1 spatial distribution of fluoride the spatial variation of groundwater fluoride concentration in bankey bazar and rajouli is shown in fig 2b and c respectively idw method section 2 9 is used to represent the distribution of toxic pollutant s collected from an unknown sampling location with proper gis aided geo reference and spatial interpolation in the studied areas the lowest concentration of fluoride in bankey bazar block was found to be 0 38 mg l in sherghati town lat 24 32 558 and long 84 42 910 fig 2b at a depth of 16 8 m and this hand pump tube well installed by local government water was used by local public nearly 35 persons in the area at community level and on daily basis the maximum concentration of fluoride 8 56 mg l in bankey bazar block was found at bhaktauri village lat 24 33 148 and long 84 38 930 at a depth of 16 8 m this hand pump tube well water was used by a family consisted of 5 members at domestic level the existed maximum fluoride concentration was approx 5 7 times higher than the who recommended value of fluoride in drinking water interestingly both the lowest and highest fluoride concentrations were found at the same depth zone this indicates that two groundwater might be originated from different aquifer source as shown in fig 2b the lowest concentration of fluoride in rajauli block was found to be 0 751 mg l at rajauli bypass near patna ranchi road lat 24 36 650 and long 85 30 617 fig 2c at a depth of 21 3 m and this hand pump tube well water was catered for the need of local people the maximum concentration of fluoride 8 3 mg l in rajauli block was found at bhaunr village lat 24 36 149 and long 85 29 877 at a depth of 33 5 m and this hand pump tube well water was used by a family consisted of 6 members 3 1 2 distribution of fluoride in different depth kernel density graph of fluoride with depth in the studied areas has been shown in fig 3 all the groundwater samples collected from bankey bazar were available at a depth range of 9 14 36 6 m fig 3a though the major presence of fluoride was basically confined at a depth range of 12 2 18 3 m and a concentration of 0 5 8 0 mg l of fluoride was scattered in that depth zone according to the density plot 15 2 18 3 m was the highest density zone of fluoride and beyond the layer of 18 3 m no major fluoridate zone was observed compared to bankey bazar the fluoride contamination scenario in groundwater of rajauli was totally different in rajauli fluoride was present at a depth range of 18 3 36 6 m fig 3b fluoride was more or less evenly scattered in each depth level of underground water column compared to bankey bazar where fluoride was densely present in few depth layers though at a depth of 33 5 35 1 m fluoride was more frequently present with high concentration 1 5 8 0 mg l which indicates that the particular layer might be the hotspot territory for fluoride in that region of nawada district previous study by alabdulaaly et al 2013 reported the same pattern of fluoride distribution in different layers of groundwater aquifers in saudi arabia and the occurrence of high fluoride concentration was observed at a depth range of 15 2 30 5 m 3 2 amount of fluoride in cereal grains the fluoride concentration in the cereals grains collected from different households and markets of bankey bazar and rajauli were presented in fig 4 the fluoride concentration in rice was accounted more than in wheat the mean fluoride concentration in rice was 1 153 0 818 mg kg range 0 226 4 11 mg kg n 63 and 1 374 0 667 mg kg range 0 4 4 46 mg kg n 47 at bankey bazar and rajauli respectively the mean fluoride concentration in wheat was 0 855 0 226 mg kg range 0 52 1 16 mg kg n 54 and 0 84 0 186 mg kg range 0 68 1 32 mg kg n 35 in the collected samples of bankey bazar and rajauli respectively although the fluoride concentration in rice and wheat grain were much lower compared to water fluoride however in broader scenario these two cereals grains are the important dietary sources to the rural population in the studied areas the rice and wheat samples collected from bhoktadih bhaktuari thapran and chandpur village of bankey bazar have higher fluoride concentration as compared to other studied villages of bankey bazar block table 2 whereas the rice and wheat samples collected from bhaunr phulwariya kachhariadih of rajauli block have higher fluoride concentration in grains as compared to rest of the studied villages table 2 the presence of fluoride in the cereal grains was due to the fact that fluoride contaminated groundwater was used for cultivation in the studied areas and finally it entered in plant body system plant can only accumulate fluoride from soil when it is available in soluble form jha et al 2011 the contribution of dietary fluoride from rice wheat pulses and their impacts in exposure dose due to regular consumption were also discussed by other authors bhattacharya et al 2017 gupta and banerjee 2011 jha et al 2011 saini et al 2013 leafy vegetables like spinach and coriander showed higher accumulation of fluoride ranging from 9 88 to 12 9 mg kg and 23 1 25 7 mg kg respectively from an endemic area of gaya district bihar ranjan and yasmin 2015 higher fluoride content in rice was reported due to the use of more fluoridated groundwater for irrigation practices tegegne et al 2013 3 3 daily dietary intake of fluoride the survey on daily consumption habit of water rice and wheat among the population of three different age groups including children 3 10 years teenagers 11 19 years and adults 20 70 years was conducted in this study the mean volume amount of water rice and wheat intake by the studied population was 1 l 55 g 40 g 1 85 l 80 g 65 g and 3 l 185 g 140 g respectively the consumption pattern among the different age groups was being varied due to their difference in physiological and metabolic need a wide variation in dietary intake of fluoride among the studied population was observed table 3 fluoride intake per day by the residing population was categorized based on institute of medicine iom and national health and medical research council nhmrc guidelines iom 1997 nhmrc 2017 it was observed that 52 children from the entire surveyed areas have adequate level of fluoride intake ai i e 0 2 mg day and 48 of the children were characterized as tolerable however 78 of teenagers have fluoride intake with tolerable limits and 21 of adult population have fluoride intake above the ul limit i e 10 mg day the people residing in villages like bhoktiari in bankey bazar and bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih in rajauli have high fluoride intake per day mainly due to the higher mean fluoride concentration in water water contributed approximately 95 of total dietary intakes of fluoride for both the populations from the studied areas based on the data from dietary intakes further calculation of daily exposure dose edi of fluoride and health risk assessment was carried out in this study 3 4 urine fluoride concentration and its relationship with water fluoride the urine samples were collected from the inhabitants as a biomarker to study the recent fluoride exposure through the daily consumption of water and cereals other than plasma serum blood and saliva etc urine is considered as contemporary biomarker to study fluoride exposure on human villa et al 2000 a good correlation could be established between consumed water fluoride and urinary fluoride collected between different time intervals in 24 h cycle opydo szymaczek and borysewicz lewicka 2005 villa et al 2000 so to maintain a constant monitoring of fluoride exposure urine can serve as potential biomarker on this regard the mean urine fluoride concentration in children n 20 teenagers n 15 and adults n 28 of bankey bazar were 2 29 1 45 mg l range 1 15 6 73 mg l 3 05 1 90 mg l range 1 49 8 08 mg l and 3 42 2 35 mg l range 0 66 10 mg l respectively in the case of rajauli the mean urine fluoride in children n 20 teenagers n 17 and adults n 24 were 7 73 3 13 mg l range 3 32 15 2 mg l 6 15 3 11 mg l range 3 18 13 8 mg l and 8 08 4 77 mg l range 3 08 23 6 mg l respectively the urinary fluoride concentration for the rajauli population mean 10 4 4 72 mg l range 3 08 23 6 mg l n 61 has been found higher compared to the bankey bazar population mean 3 004 1 97 mg l range 0 66 10 mg l n 63 this is due to the fact that the rajauli population was exposed to higher concentration of fluoride through mainly drinking water mean 3 2 1 64 mg l range 0 75 8 13 mg l n 88 compared to bankey bazar population mean 2 15 1 78 mg l range 0 38 8 56 mg l n 104 table 1 the regression analysis p 0 05 between water and urine fluoride concentrations among the three studied age groups has been shown in fig 5 the r2 value in each case showed a good correlation between water and urine fluoride concentration among the two studied populations in most of the cases from our study results the urinary fluoride concentration was increased with increase of fluoride concentration in drinking water which was supported by other studies idowu et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 rugg gunn et al 2011 the urine fluoride concentration was increased with age of the studied population compared to children and teenagers fluoride excretion through urine was higher in adults this might be due to the saturation of fluoride absorption in the calcified tissues for adults that resulted rapid excretion of ingested fluoride through urine on later stage myers 1978 however during developmental phase at young ages fluoride gets rapidly absorbed into calcified tissues e g bones and teeth in children and teenagers compare to adults whitford 1996 1999 on the other hand the higher absorption rate of fluoride in the calcified tissues leads to the reduction in fluoride excretion through urine for children and teenagers body system rango et al 2014 the different rate of urinary excretion of fluoride among the different population from same age groups were also influenced by the diet habits protein and nutrient rich supplements water and other food intake genetic variation among population urinary flow rate and urinary ph usnrc 2006 yoder et al 1998 3 5 health risk assessment for fluoride exposure through consumption of water and cereal grains assessment of health risk due to fluoride exposure is a necessary tool to evaluate the potential damage caused by its consumption on daily basis the health risk assessment for fluoride was based on the ingestion of fluoride through different exposure routes i e water rice and wheat the health risk assessment for three different age groups in this study was evaluated based on central tendency exposure cte scenario and reasonable maximum exposure rme scenario by using 90th percentile value of the obtained fluoride concentration in water rice and wheat bhattacharya et al 2017 the detailed edi values for cte and rme scenario of the two studied areas have been presented in table 4 for three different age groups of the studied populations the institute of medicine iom us provided the tolerable upper intake level ul of fluoride ingestion considering all sources iom 1997 the recommended ul value of fluoride for infants toddlers and children up to 8 years is 0 1 mg kg bw day and for children 8 years old and adults is 0 15 0 2 mg kg bw day irrespective of their body weights based on cte and rme scenarios in most of the cases the cumulative edi values for children of bhoktidah bhaktuari goitha dhakanchuan chandpur and balasot village of bankey bazar block and tilaiya bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih village of rajauli block were found to have higher fluoride intake compared to the recommended ul limit specially the children of bhaktuari bhaunr and kachhariadih were exposed to 2 folds higher in fluoride uptake than the ul limit the children in the age group of 8 10 years bw 40 kg nhmrc 2017 had ul value less than iom limit of 0 15 0 2 mg kg bw day for both cte 0 011 0 106 mg kg bw day and rme 0 014 0 14 mg kg bw day scenarios the similar kind of observation was also reported from fluoride endemic areas of uttar pradesh india tiwari et al 2017 the intake of fluoride by teenagers were below the ul limit about 28 7 of the population in this study was children below 8 years of old and much vulnerable due to high ul value in both cte 0 017 0 161 mg kg bw day and rme 0 022 0 215 mg kg bw day however the rest of the population in the age group of 8 70 years had ul value less than iom limit except the adults of bhaktuari bhaunr and kachhariadih had fluoride intake level of 0 15 mg kg bw day the cumulative cte and rme edi calculated for children of rajauli block was found much higher than suggested ul value for fluoride compared to the children of bankey bazar the cumulative edi value in this study for cte and rme scenario in bankey bazar and rajauli showed that children in these two study areas were exposed to more fluoride as compared to other two age groups teenagers and adults the similar trend of observations were supported earlier by other studies bhattacharya et al 2017 jha et al 2011 keshavarz et al 2015 the cumulative fluoride exposure doses for children were 1 49 and 1 22 folds higher in bankey bazar and 1 62 and 1 21 folds higher in rajauli compared to the teenagers and adults in the studied populations respectively in the present study where fluoride concentration was relatively high in groundwater drinking water becomes increasingly important source of fluoride exposure who 2006 drinking water fluoride contributed on an average 95 9 and 96 in bankey bazar and 96 2 and 96 7 in rajauli to the studied populations considering all age groups with respect to their edicumulative for cte and rme respectively bo et al 2003 reported similar kind of observation in their study in jilin province china other than drinking water water used for cooking different food items also contributed significantly to the cumulative daily fluoride consumption for all age groups compared to the contributions from rice and wheat grain chavoshi et al 2011 erdal and buchanan 2005 keshavarz et al 2015 3 6 evolution of health risk associated to fluoride exposure in different age groups the hazard index hi values have been studied to measure the non carcinogenic risk in children teenagers and adults due to the consumption of fluoride contaminated groundwater and cereal grains according to the standard recommendation from usepa for health risk assessment the allowable limit for any hazard index is up to 1 usepa 2004 for non carcinogenic risk assessment hi 1 indicates high risk of fluorosis among the exposed population and hi 1 indicates a tolerable limit of non carcinogenic risk among population the hazard index values of fluoride for cte and rme scenario for three different age groups from the studied areas has been shown in fig 6 for fluoride the hazard index should be 1 is acceptable otherwise a detail risk assessment is required to evaluate the threat canada health act annual report 2004 till now there is no specific rfd value available in india to evaluate hi the hi is generally estimated by comparing the obtained edi with the recommended rfd value 0 06 mg kg bw day by usepa which includes fluoride dose intake from water 0 05 mg kg bw day and dietary sources 0 01 mg kg bw day usepa 1987 in most of the cases in this study the hi values for both cte fig 6a and rme fig 6b scenario for the three different studied age groups were 1 and moreover the children were exposed more from fluoride toxicity compared to teenagers and children specially the studied populations residing in bhaktuari village in bankey bazar block and bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih villages of rajauli block were found to have very high hi values all these health risk assessment studies on different age groups clearly indicate that the studied populations were in a greater risk of fluorosis which was supported by the previous study in this region jha et al 2011 as a micronutrient fluoride plays a crucial role in the development of bones and teeth at young age however a study in iran reported that 0 5 mg l dose of fluoride impacts the human thyroid hormones activity kheradpisheh et al 2018 in shanyin county shanxi province china children s intelligence and growth were affected by high concentration of fluoride in drinking water wang et al 2007 therefore all these study reports support our findings that children in bankey bazar and rajauli were more threatened due to fluoride toxicity the difference in hi values for three different age groups of bankey bazar and rajauli were mainly due to the variation in the fluoride concentration in water rice and wheat chavoshi et al 2011 erdal and buchanan 2005 the life of most individuals from all age groups in this study is at the brink of non cancerous risk of fluorosis due to the high hi values for both rme and cte scenario usepa 2003 3 6 1 contribution of water and cereals in non cancerous health risk index the contribution percentage of individual fluoride exposure pathway through water rice and wheat grain to hazard index hi has been shown in fig 7 approximately 95 and 96 of the hi was derived from water for each age group in bankey bazar and rajauli respectively the high contribution of water in hi is mainly due to the increasing consumption of water due the prevalence of hot climatic condition in this region of india it was reported that the estimated exposure dose of fluoride through water was much higher in hi compared to other foodstuffs in the populations of bushehr and dayyer iran battaleb looie et al 2013 keshavarz et al 2015 bo et al 2003 reported that approximately 90 of the calculated hi was derived from water in a study conducted in jilin province china hi value was directly estimated from edi and water was the principal source of fluoride intake among each age group chavoshi et al 2011 thus water was the main contributor to the calculated hi and might possess different health issues upon exposure 3 6 2 comparative evaluation of hi with previous studies the comparative evaluation of hi with previous findings has been presented in fig 8 the findings in this study clearly indicate that the children teenagers and adults have high health risk due to the exposure of fluoride from both bankey bazar and rajauli a fluoride exposure and health risk study by yousefi et al 2018 in poldasht iran reported that the mean hi of the exposed population was 1 and children were highly exposed to fluoride toxicity as compared to teenagers and adults a previous study by guissouma et al 2017 among different age groups in tunisia also confirmed that the vulnerability among young population was more than adults due to fluoride exposure a similar study by jha et al 2009 in unnao district uttar pradesh india observed that infants were at higher risk of vulnerability due to fluoride exposure similarly a seasonal study on fluoride exposure and related health risk conducted by rahman et al 2020 in bangladesh reported that mean hi value of the children were 1 81 and 2 22 folds higher than teenagers and adults respectively the hi value of infants and children in northwest of china was much higher upon fluoride exposure as 72 and 60 of the infants and children had mean hi 1 than adults who had relatively lower proportion of affection chen et al 2017 the adverse effect of fluoride exposure on children was revealed in an earlier study from birbhum district west bengal india mukherjee et al 2019 where mean hi value of children was increased by 2 32 and 11 29 folds as compared to teenagers and adults respectively whereas the magnitude of severity from fluoride exposure was not up to that extent in agra ali et al 2017 as compared to birbhum however the children were still have high hi value than adult population it was observed that mean hi values of children teenagers and adults were exceeded the safe limit hi 1 in the present study like other findings discussed above though like this study all the previous studies agreed that children had highest possible risk from fluoride toxicity as their hi values were much higher than the acceptable limit hi 1 3 7 assessment of life time non cancerous risk and present scenario of fluoride affected people the hiltnr is an estimate of cumulative life time non cancer risk due to the continuous inhalation of fluoride for life long period for each individual bhattacharya et al 2017 gržetić et al 2008 total life time non cancerous risk ltnr of fluoride toxicity for ages between 3 and 70 years is presented in fig 9 the greater hiltnr value the greater is the risk of developing severe chronic toxicity of fluoride among people the ltnr evaluated for cte and rme scenarios of bhaktuari villages of bankey bazar were found 6 5 and 8 67 respectively the opposite scenario was observed in raksi and sherghati villages of bankey bazar as the ltnr value for cte and rme scenario of raksi were 1 09 and 1 45 respectively and in sherghati 0 71 and 0 94 respectively in rajauli the estimated ltnr value for cte and rme scenario were found very high for bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih and the trend was totally opposite for ghasiadih village with low score of ltnr value the ltnr value for the studied population residing in areas like bhoktuari bhaunr khachhariadih was increased by 4 7 9 2 folds as compared to the areas like raksi sherghati and ghasiadih the similar kind of observations was reported from endemic fluoride affected regions in bankura and purulia districts of west bengal india bhattacharya et al 2017 altogether the life time non cancerous risk ltnr from fluoride exposure among the sensitive populations starting from childhood to adulthood residing in bankey bazar and rajauli were much higher and these high values of hiltnr may bring serious life threating consequences to the people a good number of populations in this survey were suffering from several adverse health effects of fluoride with special reference to dental skeletal fluorosis fig 10 altogether 9 out of 19 villages in bankey bazar and rajauli have been identified with fluoride affected patients approximately 20 3 and 33 of the surveyed populations have been suffering from fluorosis from dhaneta bhaktuari chandpur bhaluhar bhoktidah villages of bankey bazar n 637 and tilaiya bhaur phulwaria and kachhariadih villages of rajauli block n 803 respectively in bankey bazar the condition was quite severe in the case of bhaktuari bhoktidah and chandpur where maximum numbers of fluorosis patients 40 4 33 3 and 27 5 respectively have been identified fig 11 in rajauli the situation in bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih was worst as 42 33 7 and 32 3 of the population have been identified with different types of fluorosis among the six studied villages fig 11 therefore there is an urgent need to take special measures to reduce the undesirable health effects on the local populations 3 8 probabilistic health risk assessment for fluoride contaminated foodstuffs ingestion of drinking water is not only the elevated source of fluoride the foodstuffs contribute a small amount to dietary intakes and pose threat to human health in the case of consumption of highest brand of fluoride through foodstuffs like rice and wheat for the studied population the calculated edicumulative hi and hiltnr values become much lower compared to the threshold level of potential life risk for both cte and rme scenarios fig 12 the similar trend has been observed in the case for lowest brand of fluoride consumption for both cte and rme scenarios fig 12 however the consumption of other foodstuffs like pulses leafy and non leafy vegetables fruits tea milk meat fish etc from the studied areas was not considered in the risk analysis which might contribute additional amount of fluoride as reported in other studies from fluoride endemic areas bhattacharya and samal 2018 bhattacharya et al 2017 3 9 probabilistic risk characterization from fluoride exposure the current scenario of fluoride affected people in bankey bazar and rajauli block was very much accountable to discuss potential health risk from fluoride exposure table 5 among the population in near future 3 9 1 tooth cavities in bankey bazar block only 4 water samples fig 2a were below than the who recommended limit of fluoride i e class i 0 5 mg l which indicates the risk of dental caries among the population who 1996 however the fluoride concentration in groundwater samples of rajauli block was observed 0 5 mg l about 48 and 9 of the water samples from bankey bazar and rajauli block were in the range 0 5 1 5 mg l class ii respectively table 5 which promotes the development of tooth and bones 3 9 2 dental fluorosis the children from 14 out of 19 villages 73 in the studied areas table 4 had fluoride intake more than the usepa recommended dose of fluoride per day i e 60 μg kg bw day usepa 2001 which demonstrate the risk of dental fluorosis among the children the fluoride concentration of these 14 villages bhaktuari dhakanchuan chandpur balasot kamalpur bhoktadih goitha baluhar banhagaw of bankey bazar and tilaiya rajauli bypass bhaunr phulwariya kachhariadih of rajauli were 1 5 mg l which is categorized under class iii level and this amount of fluoride concentration was responsible for the dental fluorosis among the populations acute to chronic dental fluorosis results through consumption of water fluoride 1 5 mg l where the tooth become coloured from yellow to brown brindha and elango 2011 about 35 and 66 of the water samples from bankey bazar and rajauli block were in the range 1 5 4 0 mg l respectively table 5 the risk characterization based on the estimation of hi also found that the calculated hi value for three age groups were exceeded the unitary value hi 1 doornaert and pichard 2006 3 9 3 skeletal fluorosis the results from this study table 4 observed that the children from bhaktuari village of bankey bazar and bhaunr and kachhariadih villages of rajauli had high fluoride intake than the recommended limit of 200 μg kg bw day anses 2007 the fluoride concentration in groundwater samples collected from these villages was 4 0 mg l which might cause skeletal fluorosis long term consumption of higher level of fluoride through drinking water results in skeletal fluorosis which causes weakness and bending of the bones brindha and elango 2011 about 13 and 25 of the water samples from bankey bazar and rajauli block were in the range 4 0 10 mg l respectively table 5 the hi values of these 3 villages were observed 2 3 times higher than permissible limit and the high hi values indicate the possible threat of skeletal fluorosis among the populations previous studies in west azerbaijan iran brazil and india reported intake of elevated level of fluoride through drinking water ultimately leads to the development of skeletal fluorosis among the inhabitants asawa et al 2015 catani et al 2007 mohammadi et al 2017 3 9 4 crippling fluorosis in this exposure and risk assessment study no concentration or intake of fluoride was found 10 mg l which results in crippling fluorosis brindha and elango 2011 so the surveyed population might not be facing the threat of skeletal fluorosis upon fluoride exposure 3 10 classification of health risk based on fluoride exposure rate based on cumulative estimated daily intake edicumulative of fluoride for rme table 4 and probabilistic risk characterization from fluoride exposure table 5 classification of health risk class i v based on fluoride exposure rate among different age groups through intake of water and foodstuffs from the two studied areas has been shown in fig 13 approximately 58 9 and 61 1 of the studied populations from all age groups and 7 6 and 33 3 of the children might be at risk of suffering from dental fluorosis class iii and skeletal fluorosis class iv in bankey bazar and rajauli respectively no risk of suffering has been observed from crippling fluorosis class v in the studied populations 4 conclusion a detailed assessment of health risk was carried out in this study in relation to fluoride exposure through drinking water and cultivated crops in three different age groups of the studied populations from two exposed areas of bihar approximately 48 1 and 91 of the groundwater samples were found to contain more than recommended limit of fluoride in drinking water i e 1 5 mg l in bankey bazar and rajauli respectively the 2d kernel density plot showed that fluoride was scattered in groundwater in the depth range of 12 2 18 3 m in bankey bazar whereas in rajauli it was restricted to a depth range of 18 3 36 6 m the local grown cereal grains consumed by the studied populations were also contaminated with fluoride the daily exposure dose from water and cereal grains for the three different age groups of the study areas had high cumulative edi value than the rfd value of 0 06 mg kg bw day the ul value for children of bhaktuari bhaunr and khachhariadih was found higher by 2 folds than the threshold limit prescribed by iom the hi value for both cte and rme scenario suggested that all the three age groups in this study were in vulnerable stage due to fluoride toxicity especially the children water was appeared as main factor as compared to cereals to elevate the potential risk by contributing significantly in cumulative hi the cumulative hi hilntr values were calculated for rme and cte scenario to address the life time non cancer risk and found very high than the threshold limit for the populations living in bhaktuari bhaunr phulwariya and kachhariadih villages from the studied areas the probabilistic risk assessment was also discussed for the potential threat of dental caries dental fluorosis and skeletal fluorosis among the inhabitants in bankey bazar and rajauli so based on the health risk assessment studies this public health issue in the selected parts of gaya and nawada districts are needed to be addressed by providing safe drinking water the rain water harvesting and treated water for irrigation practice may reduce the fluoride accumulation in cereal grains finally a constant monitoring and exposure programme will be needed to carry out the further risk assessment due to fluoride toxicity in this region as well the other parts of these two districts this cohort study can be served as niche to the planners and policymakers to identify fluoride hotspots areas in this region and will be useful to develop proper watershed management for supply clean and safe drinking water to the populations in the fluoride endemic zones this assessment study also can provide a similar

11939,severe drought conditions have affected ever increasing demand of water in godavari middle sub basin of india thus assessment of drought and its impact on groundwater potential zones is essential for effective management of water resource in the sub basin we utilized site specific factors for ascertaining the groundwater potential zones analytical hierarchy process ahp was used for assigning weights to the factors and preparing map of groundwater potential zones one month meteorological three and six months agricultural and twelve months hydrological droughts were determined using standardized precipitation index spi during 1979 2013 vulnerable drought zones were identified using weighted sum overlay analysis random forest rf algorithm was utilized for assessing the impact of drought conditions on groundwater potential zones validation of random forest was carried out by dividing groundwater potential and drought maps into training 80 and testing 20 datasets in jupyter notebook python ide integrated development environment findings revealed that nearly half of the area of the sub basin experienced low and very low groundwater potential rf analysis revealed that the groundwater potential in the northern and southern parts of the sub basin was severely affected by drought during the study period random forest regression r2 being 0 858 indicated high accuracy of the model thus rf model has proved to be an effective tool for analyzing relationship between drought and groundwater potential zones the other drought prone areas interested to attempt

or impact of climate change on groundwater however analysis of relationship between drought and groundwater potential is scent in literature this study makes an embryonic attempt to assess the impact of drought on groundwater potential zones using random forest machine learning algorithm the study intends to assess drought and its impact on groundwater potential in godavari middle sub basin 2 study area godavari middle sub basin gmsb is located between 18 21 41 and 20 34 6 north latitudes and 75 9 15 and 78 22 17 east longitudes fig 1 it spreads over maharashtra and telangana states of india and encompasses marathwada drought prone region the sub basin lying in leeward side of western ghats mountain pass covers eleven districts in maharashtra and one district in telangana the geographical area of sub basin is 4 million hectares nearly 13 million population resides in the sub basin the study area experiences arid and semi arid climate with high temperature and low rainfall the average rainfall in the sub basin is 750 mm while the average temperature is 27 5 c the sub basin receives most of its rainfall during summer season through south west monsoon the geological structure having mostly hard rocks resist infiltration of water and most of the rainfall drains as run off the sub basin is drained by the godavari and its tributaries the soil of the sub basin is mostly chromic vertisol vc and suitable for cotton cultivation it has been observed that the sub basin witnessed two severe droughts per decade during 1901 1998 gore and ray 2002 it is typically dominated by hard rock formations which make groundwater storage in aquifer low poor permeability in aquifers limits their recharging capacity of water through rainfall this implies that water in these aquifers has very low replenishing potential and may eventually be exhausted due to continuous use of groundwater suhag 2019 agriculture is the main economy of the study area and most of its farmers still depend on rainfall for growing crops 3 database and methodology in this section database and methodology is discussed first we prepared one month three months six months and twelve months drought maps using precipitation data of 40 grid points obtained during 1979 2013 from global weather data for soil water assessment tool swat portal 2018 ten site specific factors were chosen

of 1004 of random points throughout the study area were extracted from the layers of groundwater potential zones and overlaid layers of one month three months six months and twelve months the data was then divided into training 80 and testing 20 sets fig 6 random forest model was run in jupyter notebook an ide of python 3 7 using equation 5 4 result 4 1 groundwater potential zones five classes of groundwater potential were identified from the analysis namely very high high medium low and very low fig 7 very high groundwater potential zone gwpz was found in the south eastern and middle eastern part of the sub basin where slope gradient ranged between 0 and 5 and covers 6 2 per cent of the total area high rainfall and relatively low elevation and high drainage density are the prime factors making this zone very highly potential denudation and fluvial origin geomorphology are associated with high gwpz while structural origin geomorphology has less influence on it high lineament density was also found in this zone which had a major implication on groundwater recharge waterbodies and vegetation have a direct relation with gwpz while barren land and agriculture have an inverse relationship pellic vertisols and planosols regosols soils are associated with high gwpz in these parts of the sub basin high gwpzs were found in the central part of sub basin and covered 17 per cent area these zones are characterized by medium to high elevation and low slope ranging from 0 to 5 however some undulating topography has a high slope gradient drainage density is also higher in high gwpzs denudation and structural origin geomorphology contributed to high percolation and infiltration rate lineament density in this zone is moderate chromic vertisols and chromic luvisols are the main soil in this zone high rainfall is found in this zone medium gwpzs are mainly concentrated in north western part of sub basin and covered 25 per cent area these areas are characterized by medium elevation 500 700 m high elevation steeper slope medium to low drainage density structural and denudation origin geomorphology medium and low lineament density barren land medium to low rainfall 700 900 mm combisols vertisols and chromic vertisols soil types low and medium groundwater table depth low gwpzs are mostly found in the north west south west and western part of sub basin and cover 34 4 per cent area this zone is characterized by high elevation 600 800 m with moderately steep slopes moderately steep slope low lineament density barren land and agriculture classes of land use lower rainfall zone 700 800 mm combisols vertisols and water depth up to 18 m though drainage density is higher in these zones due to high steep slope and high elevation but water does not infiltrate beneath the surface mostly structural origin geomorphology here does not allow water to move surface to subsurface due to non permeable rocks very low gwpz are mostly found in the periphery of sub basin in the north west south west and western part and cover 16 7 per cent area highest elevation and steep slope characterize these zones lowest drainage density and rainfall are recorded in these zones these zones are barren land due to undulating topography denudation origin geomorphology and combisols vertisols soils the unfavorable conditions are further aggravated by low water table result of correlation revealed a strong and negative linear correlation r 0 751 between gwpzs map and borewell depth fig 8 4 2 drought analysis one month three months six months and twelve months drought maps were overlaid to identify drought vulnerable areas most of the north and north eastern parts of the sub basin are vulnerable to the drought 4 2 1 one month drought very high drought prone areas for one month are found in the northern part of the sub basin covering 12 7 per cent area fig 9 followed by high drought prone areas in the north western part of the sub basin covering 18 4 per cent area medium drought prone areas are mostly found in the south western part of the study area covering 25 3 per cent area low drought prone areas are located in the middle and southern parts of the study area covering 34 8 per cent area while very low drought prone areas are found in the south eastern part of the sub basin covering only 8 8 per cent area 4 2 2 three months drought very high and high drought prone areas for three months are found in the north eastern part of the sub basin covering 6 6 and 19 2 per cent area respectively fig 9 the moderately drought prone areas cover 37 5 per cent area in the middle part of the sub basin low drought prone areas are located in the north west southwest and central part of study area covering 19 1 per cent area very low drought prone area mostly found in the eastern part of sub basin covering 17 6 4 2 3 six months drought very high drought prone areas for six months are identified in the north west and southern part of the sub basin covering 20 3 per cent area while high prone areas are mostly situated in the western and central part of the sub basin covering 32 5 per cent area fig 9 medium prone areas are also located in the central part and northern part of the sub basin covering 29 3 per cent area low and very low drought prone areas are located in the south east and eastern part of the sub basin covering 8 7 and 9 per cent area respectively 4 2 4 twelve months drought very high and high drought prone area for twelve months are recorded in the southern and north eastern parts of the sub basin covering 8 9 and 20 4 per cent area respectively fig 9 the medium drought prone area found in the central part of the sub basin covering 31 2 per cent area low and very low drought prone areas are located in north west and eastern part of the sub basin covering 22 4 and 17 1 per cent area respectively 4 3 impact of drought on groundwater potential zones results of random forest analysis revealed that there is a direct relation between dependent variable gwpzs and one month three months six months and twelve months drought affected areas random forest regression analysis clearly shows the impact of drought conditions on groundwater potential areas it is envisaged from fig 10 a and fig 10b that drought affected the groundwater potential in the study area the model predicted that if drought occurs the potential of groundwater would likely to be decreased random forest regression r2 being 0 858 indicating high accuracy of the model root mean square error rmse value 1 06 for the random forest is also very less which signifies less fluctuation and high sustainability in the model fig 10 a and b 5 discussion the hydrogeological setting of the godavari middle sub basin showed that groundwater potential zones occur in an unconfined aquifer of the sub basin especially denudation and fluvial geomorphology this topography allowed water percolation deep in the surface the finding is in line with the study of ivara ejemot esu 2010 which showed penetration of water through chromic vertisols due to its argilli pedoturbation nature of soil high groundwater potential zones are found in those areas where the rainfall is high drainage density also controlled the gwpzs of the sub basin direct relationship was found between drainage density and groundwater potential zones low elevation and low slope caused major implication on gwpzs however aspect was found least affecting factor to it waterbodies and vegetation emerged the major controlling factors for very high and high gwpzs the overall analysis revealed that the eastern and middle parts of the sub basin have high potential for groundwater of all the droughts six months drought was found to be the most prominent drought making the sub basin vulnerable however the north eastern parts of the sub basin was found to be vulnerable to all types of droughts groundwater potential in the study area was found highly dependent on recharge from infiltration of precipitation type of soil geomorphology elevation slope aspect and drainage density thus occurrence of droughts affected the water level in the study area the aquifers especially those which do not receive much water for recharging the groundwater accentuate drought conditions in the sub basin further pumping of water for irrigation purpose in the agricultural sector results in the decline of groundwater in the study area random forest rf method has helped in providing some clear evidence of the drought impact on the groundwater potential in the sub basin rf analysis indicated that drought has a direct impact on the groundwater in the study area areas having drought conditions were found under low gwpz many boreholes have been deepened as a result of pumping out of water for irrigating sugarcane crop consequently many wells have dried up clarke 2013 thus efficacious measures may seamlessly be beneficial for combating the problem of groundwater and drought conditions in the study area 6 conclusion the present study assesses the impact of drought conditions on gwpzs in the godavari middle sub basin india spi was used for analyzing the drought conditions during 1979 2013 for forty grid points ahp derived weights of 10 site specific factors were used for preparing groundwater potential zone map the implication of all drought conditions was examined using random forest machine learning algorithm findings revealed marked variations in gwpzs the north eastern part of the sub basin experienced very low and low gwpzs this part of the sub basin was highly affected by the droughts the eastern and middle eastern parts enjoyed very high and high gwpzs a negative relationship occurred between groundwater potential zone and depth of water this validated the groundwater potential zones map result of random forest analysis revealed decline in the groundwater potential with the occurrence of droughts six months drought was more prevalent in the study area and affected the agricultural sector the north eastern part of the sub basin was affected by all duration droughts thus this part accords higher priority for recharging the groundwater rainwater harvesting should be encouraged in the study area changes in cropping pattern by growing long dry tolerant crops assume significance for sustainable groundwater and sustainable

of drought on groundwater potential zones using random forest machine learning algorithm the study intends to assess drought and its impact on groundwater potential in godavari middle sub basin 2 study area godavari middle sub basin gmsb is located between 18 21 41 and 20 34 6 north latitudes and 75 9 15 and 78 22 17 east longitudes fig 1 it spreads over maharashtra and telangana states of india and encompasses marathwada drought prone region the sub basin lying in leeward side of western ghats mountain pass covers eleven districts in maharashtra and one district in telangana the geographical area of sub basin is 4 million hectares nearly 13 million population resides in the sub basin the study area experiences arid and semi arid climate with high temperature and low rainfall the average rainfall in the sub basin is 750 mm while the average temperature is 27 5 c the sub basin receives most of its rainfall during summer season through south west monsoon the geological structure having mostly hard rocks resist infiltration of water and most of the rainfall drains as run off the sub basin is drained by the godavari and its tributaries the soil of the sub basin is mostly chromic vertisol vc and suitable for cotton cultivation it has been observed that the sub basin witnessed two severe droughts per decade during 1901 1998 gore and ray 2002 it is typically dominated by hard rock formations which make groundwater storage in aquifer low poor permeability in aquifers limits their recharging capacity of water through rainfall this implies that water in these aquifers has very low replenishing potential and may eventually be exhausted due to continuous use of groundwater suhag 2019 agriculture is the main economy of the study area and most of its farmers still depend on rainfall for growing crops 3 database and methodology in this section database and methodology is discussed first we prepared one month three months six months and twelve

of 1004 of random points throughout the study area were extracted from the layers of groundwater potential zones and overlaid layers of one month three months six months and twelve months the data was then divided into training 80 and testing 20 sets fig 6 random forest model was run in jupyter notebook an ide of python 3 7 using equation 5 4 result 4 1 groundwater potential zones five classes of groundwater potential were identified from the analysis namely very high high medium low and very low fig 7 very high groundwater potential zone gwpz was found in the south eastern and middle eastern part of the sub basin where slope gradient ranged between 0 and 5 and covers 6 2 per cent of the total area high rainfall and relatively low elevation and high drainage density are the prime factors making this zone very highly potential denudation and fluvial origin geomorphology are associated with high gwpz while structural origin geomorphology has less influence on it high lineament density was also found in this zone which had a major implication on groundwater recharge waterbodies and vegetation have a direct relation with gwpz while barren land and agriculture have an inverse relationship pellic vertisols and planosols regosols soils are associated with high gwpz in these parts of the sub basin high gwpzs were found in the central part of sub basin and covered 17 per cent area these zones are characterized by medium to high elevation and low slope ranging from 0 to 5 however some undulating topography has a high slope gradient drainage density is also higher in high gwpzs denudation and structural origin geomorphology contributed to high percolation and infiltration rate lineament density in this zone is moderate chromic vertisols and chromic luvisols are the main soil in this zone high rainfall is found in this zone medium gwpzs are mainly concentrated in north western part of sub basin and covered 25 per cent area these areas are characterized by medium elevation 500 700 m high elevation steeper slope medium to low drainage density structural and denudation origin geomorphology medium and low lineament density barren land medium to low rainfall 700 900 mm combisols vertisols and chromic vertisols soil types low and medium groundwater table depth low gwpzs are mostly found in the north west south west and western part of sub basin and cover 34 4 per cent area this zone is characterized by high elevation 600 800 m with moderately steep slopes moderately steep slope low lineament density barren land and agriculture classes of land use lower rainfall zone 700 800 mm combisols vertisols and water depth up to 18 m though drainage density is higher in these zones due to high steep slope and high elevation but water does not infiltrate beneath the surface mostly structural origin geomorphology here does not allow water to move surface to subsurface due to non permeable rocks very low gwpz are mostly found in the periphery of sub basin in the north west south west and western part and cover 16 7 per cent area highest elevation and steep slope characterize these zones lowest drainage density and rainfall are recorded in these zones these zones are barren land due to undulating topography denudation origin geomorphology and combisols vertisols soils the unfavorable conditions are further aggravated by low water table result of correlation revealed a strong and negative linear correlation r 0 751 between gwpzs map and borewell depth fig 8 4 2 drought analysis one month three months six months and twelve months drought maps were overlaid to identify drought vulnerable areas most of the north and north eastern parts of the sub basin are vulnerable to the drought 4 2 1 one month drought very high drought prone areas for one month are found in the northern part of the sub basin covering 12 7 per cent area fig 9 followed by high drought prone areas in the north western part of the sub basin covering 18 4 per cent area medium drought prone areas are mostly found in the south western part of the study area covering 25 3 per cent area low drought prone areas are located in the middle and southern parts of the study area covering 34 8 per cent area while very low drought prone areas are found in the south eastern part of the sub basin covering only 8 8 per cent area 4 2 2 three months drought very high and high drought prone areas for three months are found in the north eastern part of the sub basin covering 6 6 and 19 2 per cent area respectively fig 9 the moderately drought prone areas cover 37 5 per cent area in the middle part of the sub basin low drought prone areas are located in the north west southwest and central part of study area covering 19 1 per cent area very low drought prone area mostly found in the eastern part of sub basin covering 17 6 4 2 3 six months drought very high drought prone areas for six months are identified in the north west and southern part of the sub basin covering 20 3 per cent area while high prone areas are mostly situated in the western and central part of the sub basin covering 32 5 per cent area fig 9 medium prone areas are also located in the central part and northern part of the sub basin covering 29 3 per cent area low and very low drought prone areas are located in the south east and eastern part of the sub basin covering 8 7 and 9 per cent area respectively 4 2 4 twelve months drought very high and high drought prone area for twelve months are recorded in the southern and north eastern parts of the sub basin covering 8 9 and 20 4 per cent area respectively fig 9 the medium drought prone area found in the central part of the sub basin covering 31 2 per cent area low and very low drought prone areas are located in north west and eastern part of the sub basin covering 22 4 and 17 1 per cent area respectively 4 3 impact of drought on groundwater potential zones results of random forest analysis revealed that there is a direct relation between dependent variable gwpzs and one month three months six months and twelve months drought affected areas random forest regression analysis clearly shows the impact of drought conditions on groundwater potential areas it is envisaged from fig 10 a and fig 10b that drought affected the groundwater potential in the study area the model predicted that if drought occurs the potential of groundwater would likely to be decreased random forest regression r2 being 0 858 indicating high accuracy of the model root mean square error rmse value 1 06 for the random forest is also very less which signifies less fluctuation and high sustainability in the model fig 10 a and b 5 discussion the hydrogeological setting of the godavari middle sub basin showed that groundwater potential zones occur in an unconfined aquifer of the sub basin especially denudation and fluvial geomorphology this topography allowed water percolation deep in the surface the finding is in line with the study of ivara ejemot esu 2010 which showed penetration of water through chromic vertisols due to its argilli pedoturbation nature of soil high groundwater potential zones are found in those areas where the rainfall is high drainage density also controlled the gwpzs of the sub basin direct relationship was found between drainage density and groundwater potential zones low elevation and low slope caused major implication on gwpzs however aspect was found least affecting factor to it waterbodies and vegetation emerged the major controlling factors for very high and high gwpzs the overall analysis revealed that the eastern and middle parts of the sub basin have high potential for groundwater of all the droughts six months drought was found to be the most prominent drought making the sub basin vulnerable however the north eastern parts of the sub basin was found to be vulnerable to all types of droughts groundwater potential in the study area was found highly dependent on recharge from infiltration of precipitation type of soil geomorphology elevation slope aspect and drainage density thus occurrence of droughts affected the water level in the study area the aquifers especially those which do not receive much water for recharging the groundwater accentuate drought conditions in the sub basin further pumping of water for irrigation purpose in the agricultural sector results in the decline of groundwater in the study area random forest rf method has helped in providing some clear evidence of the drought impact on the groundwater potential in the sub basin rf analysis indicated that drought has a direct impact on the groundwater in the study area areas having drought conditions were found under low gwpz many boreholes have been deepened as a result of pumping out of water for irrigating sugarcane crop consequently many wells have dried up clarke 2013 thus efficacious measures may seamlessly be beneficial for combating the problem of groundwater and drought conditions in the study area 6 conclusion the present study assesses the impact of drought conditions on gwpzs in the godavari middle sub basin india spi was used for analyzing the drought conditions during 1979 2013 for forty grid points ahp derived weights of 10 site specific factors were used for preparing groundwater potential zone map the implication of all drought conditions was examined using random forest machine learning algorithm findings revealed marked variations in gwpzs the north eastern part of the sub basin experienced very low and low gwpzs this part of the sub basin was highly affected by the droughts the eastern and middle eastern parts enjoyed very high and high gwpzs a negative relationship occurred between groundwater potential zone and depth of water this validated the groundwater potential zones map result of random forest analysis revealed decline in the groundwater potential with the occurrence of droughts six months drought was more prevalent in the study area and affected the agricultural sector the north eastern part of the sub basin was affected by all duration droughts thus this part accords higher priority for recharging the groundwater rainwater harvesting should be encouraged in the study area changes in cropping pattern by growing long dry tolerant crops assume significance for sustainable groundwater and sustainable agriculture random forest algorithm has proved to be the effective method of analyzing implication of drought on groundwater potential zones the arid and semi arid regions interested in analyzing drought relation with groundwater potential may find ahp and rf methods useful declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
