20005,karst aquifers have distinctive hydrology and supply 25 of the world s population with drinking water making them a critical geological setting for understanding and managing microbial water pollution rainfall causes elevated concentrations and loading of faecal microorganisms e g e coli in catchment surface and groundwater systems increasing the risk of human exposure to faecally contaminated water however effective management of microbial water quality in complex karst catchments is constrained by limited understanding of e coli discharge responses to rainfall we analysed how rainfall events of varying magnitude 2 4 100 mm control e coli discharge dynamics at increasing spatial scales in a mixed land use karst catchment in southwest china during the wet season hourly water sampling was undertaken throughout five storm events to characterise in high detail e coli emergence with resulting flow across multiple sites of varying catchment area stream order and land use e coli concentration was found to increase by 1 3 orders of magnitude following rainfall events maximum e coli concentration and speed of e coli recession were influenced by rainfall amount intensity timing of agricultural activities and position in the hydrological system for high intensity events 90 of the cumulative e coli export occurred within 48 h e coli concentration increased with increasing discharge at all sites e coli concentration at low discharge was higher in the headwaters than at the catchment outlet while the rate of increase in e coli concentration with increasing discharge appears to follow the opposite trend being higher at the catchment outlet than the headwaters this was attributed to the decreasing flow path gradient and increasing degree of development of the fissure network but further event monitoring at varying catchment scales is required to confirm this relationship the results provide novel insight into how rainfall characteristics combine with land use and catchment hydrology to control e coli export in karst landscapes graphical abstract image 1 keywords catchment hydrology faecal indicator organism faecal pollution storm event water quality 1 introduction karst aquifers provide 25 of the global population with drinking water hartmann et al 2014 understanding and managing microbial water pollution in karst environments is therefore key for protecting the health of those reliant on this source of drinking water karst catchments respond differently to rainfall than granular aquifers due to the extreme anisotropy in hydrological properties such as hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity and direct connectivity between the surface and groundwater systems bakalowicz 2005 fu et al 2016 effective hydraulic conductivity can vary by 10 12 orders of magnitude within a karst aquifer due to the high velocity pathways provided by dissolution developed conduits and the very low porosity of the primary rock matrix white 2018 following rainfall contaminants carried in runoff can bypass the soil profile and be flushed directly into karst aquifers through sinkholes and depressions faecal microbes stored in the fracture matrix or deposited in stream bed sediment during low flow conditions can survive for long periods and be remobilised during storm events padilla and vesper 2018 pronk et al 2007 hydrological transfer via the karst conduit structure to drinking water bores and springs thus presents a significant pathway for human exposure to microbial pollutants such as e coli the most commonly used indicator microorganism for inferring faecal contamination epting et al 2018 rainfall runoff processes can facilitate the mobilisation transfer and delivery of pollutants from land to receiving waters vanwormer et al 2016 in situ monitoring capability for nutrients has demonstrated how high resolution datasets are invaluable in understanding how rainfall variables interact with karst hydrology and source availability yue et al 2019 however microbial water quality response to different combinations of faecal inputs and hydrological drivers such as rainfall is poorly understood particularly in karst terrain vermeulen et al 2015 this is partly because unlike with nutrient pollution in situ high resolution sampling combined with on site analysis has not yet translated into a standard operating procedure for the quantification of e coli other faecal indicator organisms fios or human pathogens monitoring of fio discharge q relationships through storm events is therefore challenging it is further compounded by regulatory requirements to monitor microbial pollution at end point receptors and locations of likely human exposure risk such as bathing or shellfish harvesting waters rather than quantifying fios distributed across catchment drainage networks oliver et al 2016 catchments can comprise a mosaic of land use types containing a suite of diffuse and point sources of fios diffuse fio pollution dominates in rural catchments with leaking septic tanks and slurry pits representing largely unquantified fio loading sowah et al 2017 in se asia paddy farming dominates large areas of karst land the health impact of using wastewater to irrigate paddy crops is starting to receive research attention e g barna 2019 but relative to grassland research data are scarce buckerfield et al 2019 in urban areas failure and flooding of point sources e g sewage treatment plants are the leading sources of microbial contamination during rainfall events sauer et al 2011 however hydrological connectivity controls the delivery of fios from land to water and even in non karst catchments the role of hydrological connectivity in driving the dynamics of fios in streams remains poorly characterised neill et al 2018 despite their complexity catchments remain a fundamental unit for framing water management decisions cho et al 2016 however those management decisions are constrained by data availability and limited modelling of fio flux from catchments under low and high flow conditions vermeulen et al 2015 such modelling also requires better appreciation of responses in microbial water quality across different spatial and temporal scales muirhead and meenken 2018 some studies have quantified fio emergence with storm hydrographs e g murphy et al 2015 oliver et al 2015 ridley et al 2014 but how rainfall events of varying magnitude and successive rainfall events impact on fio q dynamics at different spatial scales within catchments is poorly documented buckerfield et al 2019 comparable research in karst terrain is scarcer yet and requires investigation due to the unique hydrology and risk factors that can influence drinking water contamination this form of dataset is required to inform on the risk presented by different sources under varying rainfall conditions and it will provide the evidence base to inform where mitigation is best targeted the aim of this study therefore was to investigate the impact of rainfall events of varying magnitude on e coli q dynamics at increasing spatial scales in a typical mixed land use karst catchment specifically the objectives of our multi site multi scale approach were to i characterise e coli q dynamics following rainfall and determine the influence of different rainfall characteristics and antecedent conditions and timing of agricultural activities on this relationship and ii assess how rainfall driven concentration and load of e coli in receiving waters varies across land use composition variation in hydrological structure and increasing scale of the contributing catchment area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study catchment the houzhai hz catchment drains a land area of 73 5 km2 and is located at the centre of the southwest china karst region fig 1 a which is one of the most extensive karst regions in the world this region has the highest national poverty rates and experiences high intensity rainfall events during the wet season cao et al 2015 a number of sub catchments in the hz catchment were instrumented with in situ hydrochemistry probes and pressure transducers for monitoring water levels the locations of the four sites used in this study are shown in fig 1 sites were selected to represent examples of contrasting land use increasing contributing catchment area and to capitalise on existing monitoring infrastructure the topography of the catchment ranges from mountainous karst cone depression landforms in the east maximum elevation 1565 m to dominantly flat plains in the west minimum elevation 1218 m fig 1 b the headwater sub catchments are characterised by steep topography and thin soils 50 cm and fast infiltration and vertical recharge of groundwater through sink holes and shafts resulting in rapid responses in discharge and return to base flow zhang et al 2017 further downstream the topographic and hydraulic gradients diminish soil cover becomes thicker and the fissure network becomes well developed resulting in attenuation and storage of recharge liu et al 2010 one well developed continuous conduit running along the southerly boundary fig 1 c acts as the primary drainage of the underground water system and a fissure controlled conduit network in the central and western area of the catchment is well connected with the primary conduit zhang et al 2017 the drainage system for the northerly sub catchments including chenqi cqi changchong cc dengzahne dz and qingshan qs reservoir fig 1 c is a modified series of transitions between the surface and groundwater systems the headwater catchments cqi and cc drain primarily through springs which are artificially channelled into concrete surface water channels that discharge into qingshan reservoir reservoir outflow continues as a surface river to the outlet of the hz catchment the catchment is a typical mixed land use paddy farming region with approximately half of the land used for cropping major crops being rice rapeseed and maize with additional crops including soybeans vegetable and fruit fig 1 d cqi is an entirely agricultural headwater catchment with dominant crops being rice rapeseed corn and soybeans cc contains paddy fields and urban land in the upper reaches of the catchment 3 km from the outlet with land closer to the outlet accommodating dry land cropping similar to cqi but also significant fruit crops and forested hillslopes dz catchment contains a higher percentage of urban land table 1 including land directly adjacent to the sampling location the hz groundwater outlet is located within a village at the outlet of hz watershed the primary southern conduit discharging at hz runs through agricultural land and several villages connectivity between the outlets of dengzhanhe and hz catchments is highly fragmented with possible hydrological flow paths through the qs reservoir and the conduit system the majority of steep hillsides are forested and much of the remaining flat land is urban distributed as small towns and villages population 53 500 statistics from puding county government the lithology comprises five stratigraphic units of the middle triassic guanling formation generally decreasing in age from east to west figure e 2 2 e coli discharge and turbidity data collection 2 2 1 in situ hydrological monitoring weirs at the designated monitoring points provided infrastructure for continuous q measurements and sampling of water quality parameters each gauging station was equipped with a water level logger gb t3091 2008 pressure transducer and an aqua troll 600 multiparameter sonde which continuously logged in stream turbidity and temperature pressure transducers were built into a stilling well and provided water depth measurements at a 5 min interval for later conversion to stream q using an established rating curve for each site zhang et al 2017 rainfall data was obtained from a rain gauge at lahoetain in the southern region of the catchment fig 1 standard aseptic grab sampling was not possible due to the remoteness of sites and therefore automatic water samplers qingdao suyuan environmental protection equipment co ltd china were used for capture of storm related water samples deploying autosamplers in this study was further justified on the basis that i the e coli q patterns were being compared and ii relative rather than absolute differences between e coli values were considered important for comparing across sites given that concentrations were not being assessed against regulatory standards the auto samplers were housed within concrete infrastructure adjacent to the weirs which helped to keep the samples cooler than ambient temperature reducing potential for temperature induced e coli die off before analysis pope et al 2003 all samples were retrieved returned to the laboratory in a cool box and analysed within 20 h of sampling 2 2 2 storm monitoring to determine the concentration of in stream e coli in response to rainfall and resulting q five rainfall events were sampled at one or more of the four monitoring sites over a two month period from the beginning of the wet season for the purposes of this study rainfall events are defined by the amount and intensity of rainfall as this is constant across all sites while the discharge response varies to minimise contamination auto sampler bottles were triple sterilised with ultra pure boiling water autoclaving was not possible and sealed with aluminium foil until deployed in the field prior to all storm events as per oliver et al 2015 sample collection began a minimum of 2 h prior to the commencement of rainfall samples were collected at an hourly interval for 24 h then at two hourly intervals from 24 to 48 h and at diminishing frequency typically every 6 h from 48 to 96 h simultaneous sampling at three monitoring sites was carried out over two events at i cqi cc and dz and ii cqi dz and hz an additional two events were monitored at cqi only and one further event at hz only 2 2 3 microbiological analysis e coli were enumerated using the standard uk environment agency method of membrane filtration ea 2009 each water sample was vacuum filtered through a sterile 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane sartorius stedim biotech goettingen germany and analysed in duplicate using a sterilised filtration unit rocker scientific co taiwan the membrane was then aseptically transferred to a plate containing membrane lactose glucuronide agar mlga cm1031 oxoid basingstoke uk and incubated at 37oc for 24 h for the determination of presumptive e coli colonies sample volumes ranging between 1 and 100 ml were filtered to capture between 20 and 200 e coli colony forming units cfu with further 1 10 serial dilutions in phosphate buffered saline pbs filtered where appropriate method blanks were regularly used to assess aseptic technique and to evaluate sterilisation efficiency between samples all data are reported as cfu 100 ml 1 2 3 data analysis all statistical analysis and modelling were performed using r v 3 6 0 r core team 2019 all e coli counts underwent log10 transformation prior to statistical analysis linear regression modelling of the e coli q and e coli turbidity relationships was performed investigating different combinations of site and event as categorical predictors interacting with discharge and turbidity as the continuous predictors the goodness of fit of models was ranked using akaike s information criterion aic values with a threshold delta aic value of 7 used to select candidate models fabozzi et al 2014 due to turbidity data only being available for two sites and only one shared event at both sites separate models were developed for the two sites cqi and hz the f statistic was used as a measure of the significance of candidate models and the significance of the effect of predictors on the response variable was assessed using t values both at p 0 05 significance level adherence to the assumptions of regression was checked by inspection of the normality of residuals and model diagnostics relationships between maximum q e coli concentration and flux event export and rainfall characteristics were also assessed following the same methodology analysis of e coli q hysteresis was undertaken on those events where a hydrological response to rainfall resulted in a well defined q peak comprised of a rising and falling limb all storm event e coli q responses were examined visually for the presence and direction of hysteretic loops discharge and e coli concentration data were linearly interpolated and discretised into units of seconds total event export was calculated by linear interpolation and trapezoidal integration of the derived e coli flux at 1 s intervals mckergow and davies colley 2010 the duration of the event was taken as the duration of monitoring 3 results the events monitored during the study varied spatially with respect to their rainfall runoff signatures and associated fio export table 2 an explanation of how each parameter was derived is given in supplementary information table 5 events are referred to by their assigned number all blanks yielded zero colony forming units the average water temperature was lowest in the headwater catchments cqi and cc 16 6 c 18 3 at hz c and 19 8 c at dz supplementary information table 6 3 1 long term profiles of e coli concentration and discharge over successive events four events were sampled at cqi between 19th april and 27th june 2017 fig 2 a capturing two major 10 mm d 1 rainfall events at the commencement of the wet season a simultaneous rise of e coli concentration and q was evident during events 2 and 4 while there was minimal q response for events 1 and 3 but a distinct increase in e coli concentration the range of e coli concentration increase was 0 6 2 4 orders of magnitude for all four events increase of 8 0 x 102 2 0 104 cfu 100 ml 1 events 3 and 4 2 4 and 78 mm total rainfall were sampled at dz fig 2 b no increase in water level and therefore q was recorded for event 3 but the concentration of e coli increased by almost 2 orders of magnitude however a similar concentration to the maximum recorded after event 3 was measured in a grab sample on the 20 4 and in the samples taken a few hours prior to event 4 rainfall events 3 and 5 2 4 mm and 102 mm total rainfall were monitored at hz groundwater outlet fig 2 c an increase in q occurred for event 3 but increases and decreases in q of a similar order of magnitude occurred during dry periods e coli concentrations remained low for event 3 pre event 1 2 101 cfu 100 ml 1 event maximum 3 4 101 cfu 100 ml 1 but an increase in flux of 0 5 orders of magnitude was observed translating to an increase in export of 1 3 x 105 cfu s 1 pre event e coli concentration for event 5 was also low 1 2 101 cfu 100 ml 1 but increased 1 6 orders of magnitude from pre event to peak event e coli concentration an increase in flux of two orders of magnitude was observed equivalent to an increase in export of 1 3 x 108 cfu s 1 additional grab samples taken in april the day after two small moderate rainfall events 20 mm and 2 0 mm had comparable e coli concentrations than those taken during event 3 3 2 comparison events monitored simultaneously at multiple sites rainfall event 3 was monitored simultaneously at cqi dz and hz fig 3 a while event 4 was monitored simultaneously at cqi cc and dz fig 3b no response in q was seen for event 3 at cqi or dz while almost a 50 increase was observed at hz an increase in e coli concentration was observed at all three sites following rainfall and an increase in flux at cqi and hz but not dz as q was zero immediately prior to the event q at hz had receded and stabilised at 60 of the relatively constant level observed over the previous month within 2 h e coli concentration increased by an order of magnitude at cqi and doubled at hz discharge at both cqi and hz fluctuated significantly before the event e coli concentration in a grab sample taken at hz two days prior was higher but the same order of magnitude as event samples and grab samples taken at cqi in the two days prior were also the same order of magnitude as pre event samples for event 4 cqi and cc followed similar q responses primarily responding to the main rainfall event while dz exhibited additional q peaks both before and after the main event responding to the minor rainfall events in the 24 h prior to and following the main event maximum q at cqi was lower 4 6 10 2 m3 s 1 than cc 5 2 10 1 m3 s 1 but peak e coli concentration was an order of magnitude higher 2 2 x 104 and 1 8 103 cfu 100 ml 1 respectively resulting in comparable maximum flux 6 0 106 and 9 0 106 cfu s 1 and export 1 8 1011 and 2 1 1011 cfu during the monitoring period the recession of e coli concentration and flux was faster at cqi after nearly 4 days 88 h e coli concentration at cqi dropped by 2 orders of magnitude to 1 of peak concentration while e coli concentration at cc dropped less than one order of magnitude remaining an order of magnitude higher than pre event concentration at 20 of peak concentration dz exhibited a peak e coli concentration almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than cc and one order higher than cqi the maximum e coli flux at dz was 2 2 5 orders of magnitude higher as peak q was 2 0 times that at cc and 2 6 times that at cqi however discharge returned to zero more rapidly at dz than cc and after 88 h e coli concentration was the same order of magnitude within 10 of pre event levels at dz 3 3 linear regression modelling table 3 summarises simple correlation analysis which provides support for the linear regression analysis 3 3 1 e coli concentration and discharge linear regression of log log transformed e coli concentration and q identified that a single model was inadequate for all site data combined r2 0 01 p 0 05 aic 819 the best performing models models 1 2 and 3 table 4 all incorporated both site and event as predictors allowing the slope to vary by site event or both produced similar model performance as was the case for intercepts removal of site as a predictor produced the largest increase in delta aic 158 2 followed by 82 7 for the removal of event the parameters for the model with the highest number of significant predictors model 3 are given in supplementary information table 7 and displayed in fig 4 with the data using model 3 also considered to be the most conceptually plausible e coli concentration at low discharge represented by the model intercepts was significantly different at all sites p 0 001 supplementary information table 7 the rate of increase of e coli concentration with q was higher at hz than at the other sites which were not significantly different fig 4 and the e coli concentration following events 2 and 5 both high intensity and total rainfall amount was significantly higher than during other events at the sites where they were sampled cqi and hz respectively 3 3 2 e coli concentration and turbidity the relationship between e coli concentration and turbidity was dependent on event characteristics as well as site characteristics a stronger correlation existed at both cqi and hz for events of higher rainfall intensity and amount table 3 linear regression of log log transformed e coli concentration and turbidity showed that significantly different relationships exist at cqi and hz regardless of event and that significantly different relationships exist between events at each site supplementary information tables 8 and 9 at hz e coli concentration increased significantly with increasing turbidity for event 5 while there was no significant change in the relationship for event 3 at cqi the rate of change was not significantly different between events but the intercept and maximum turbidity and e coli concentration were both higher for event 4 which also showed a stronger correlation table 3 assessment of the site dependency of the relationships is limited by the number of sites for which turbidity data is available two but the available data suggests a higher concentration per unit turbidity at cqi than at hz 3 4 rainfall runoff event typologies from hysteresis rising falling limb characteristics and flow duration curves five of the rainfall event site combinations resulted in a defined q peak and therefore a well defined hydrograph comprised of a rising and falling limb the mean e coli concentration was significantly higher on the falling limb rather than the rising limb for event 2 at cqi and event 4 at cc suggesting a delay in peak e coli relative to peak q and e coli flux was similarly higher on the falling limb for one of these events fig 5 otherwise no significant differences in concentrations were observed there were insufficient samples for event 4 at dengzhanhe on the rising limb to test for significant difference with the falling limb highly variable e coli q hysteresis patterns were observed across the range of event intensities and sample site locations fig 6 event 2 at cqi and event 4 at cc 45 and 78 mm demonstrated clear anti clockwise hysteresis while the remaining events cannot be clearly categorised as clockwise or anti clockwise event 4 at cqi exhibits weak anti clockwise and clockwise sections in the hystersis curve event 5 at hz is complex it could be categorised as clockwise but comprises only a few samples on the rising limb and the superposition of a second q peak associated with a second smaller rainfall event the cumulative q and e coli export curves fig 7 illustrate the short time period over which most event associated e coli export occurs for the high intensity events 2 and 4 at cqi cc and dz 90 of e coli export occurred within 48 h and within 24 h at dz t90 in fig 7 for the lower intensity events 1 and 3 and event 5 at hz the time for 90 export was 3 days for events with a distinctive q peak 2 4 and 5 cumulative q began to diminish before cumulative e coli export but both discharge and e coli concentration show similar asymptotic behaviour 24 48 h after the event event 3 low rainfall intensity and amount showed a linear increase in cumulative q at both cqi and hz but cqi showed an increase in e coli export while export at hz remained linear cumulative q and e coli export followed a different evolution to other events and sites at hz for event 5 partially as a result of two distinct discharge peaks due to rain the day after the main event 4 discussion high resolution characterisation of in stream e coli concentration in response to storm events is challenging this study addresses this challenge and reports on a series of novel datasets of e coli q relationships observed across a karst catchment over successive rainfall events events ranging from 5 0 mm to 100 mm rainfall over the study period were found to cause microbial water quality impairment at a range of spatial scales for 1 4 days following rainfall in mixed land use paddy farming karst regions 4 1 interactions and relative importance of event characteristics antecedent conditions and source availability understanding of diffuse pollution has highlighted the importance of critical source areas csas defined as zones in the landscape where high sources of pollutants coincide with high potential for hydrological transfer heathwaite et al 2005 the e coli concentration and q dynamics at the outlet of cqi indicate e coli export from agricultural catchments following rainfall is strongly moderated by source availability and hydrological connectivity of sources to receiving waters indicative of csa influences and consistent with nitrate contamination patterns in this catchment yue et al 2019 the increase in e coli concentration was comparable for events 1 2 and 3 spanning late april to late may despite 1 2 orders of magnitude difference in rainfall and q this suggests that the timing of agricultural activities combined with seasonal rainfall patterns are likely to be the key controls on source availability and hydrological connectivity respectively april represents a transitional period from the dry to the wet season in sw china and also the period in the agricultural calendar where rapeseed is harvested and fields are tilled and fertilised with livestock manure for paddy crops yue et al 2018 therefore relatively low rainfall may cause potentially large sources of fios e g manure heaps prepared for land application to become hydrologically connected to the groundwater system via transfer from fresh manure heaps to sink holes or irrigation ditches evidence of increased fio loading of watercourses in mixed land use or agricultural catchments during growing seasons and associated organic fertiliser application further supports this sinclair et al 2009 thilakarathne et al 2018 the presence of impervious surfaces e g roads and nearby ditches can enhance connectivity between agricultural contaminant sources such as fios and nutrients and receiving waters in agricultural areas buchanan et al 2012 murphy et al 2015 furthermore bare rock in karst areas is known to have a high runoff ratio li et al 2011 which is particularly relevant to this region where karst rocky desertification results in extensive bare rock exposure and thus increased likelihood of overland flow pathways connecting fio and sediment sources to streams and sinkholes dai et al 2017 for local residents dependent on catchment water supplies the commencement of the monsoon and paddy seasons presents a period of increased risk where particular care should be taken to treat water or use an alternative supply for 2 3 days following rainfall measures to reduce the potential for hydrological transfer from sources such as careful placement and containment of manure heaps may also reduce risk the anti clockwise hysteresis observed for event 2 45 mm at cqi and mixture of weak anti clockwise and clockwise hysteresis for event 4 78 mm suggest proximal sources potentially contribute more to export for event 4 which resulted in an order of magnitude higher concentration flux and total export than event 2 a threshold of 80 mm for activation of overland flow has been suggested in this karst area zhang et al 2011 consistent with the magnitude of event 4 thus activation of additional hydrological pathways such as overland flow could further contribute to the delivery of nearby fio sources to receiving waters during high intensity rainfall lloyd et al 2016 antecedent catchment conditions can influence e coli transfer to receiving waters by increasing or decreasing the activation of overland and subsurface flow mechanisms hathaway et al 2010 the timing of successive events in our study allows for the role of different antecedent conditions to be considered although there are too few events across a suite of antecedent conditions and sites to enable analysis beyond preliminary empirical observation events were monitored both during the onset of the wet season dry antecedent conditions e g event 1 and after numerous events had occurred e g event 4 when soil moisture is likely to have increased zhang et al 2011 low soil moisture due to dry antecedent conditions has been found to result in higher surface runoff generation and suspended sediment transport due to infiltration excess overland flow mcdowell and sharpley 2002 puntenney et al 2016 the moderate but significant correlation between e coli concentration and turbidity for event 1 would be consistent with this process combined with the availability of sources at this time rapidly induced overland flow could be a further explanatory factor behind the high e coli concentration observed following events early in the season increased soil moisture prior to rainfall is generally associated with a more rapid generation of saturation excess overland flow and increased river discharge for a given rainfall amount relative to dry conditions penna et al 2011 in this karst region increased soil moisture has been found to decrease the amount of rainfall required before preferential subsurface flow along the soil epikarst boundary is generated fu et al 2015 the groundwater level in this region also increases during the wet season yue et al 2015 potentially increasing activation of subsurface flow with successive rainfall events this is a process that has been observed to cause increased nitrate transfer to agricultural streams outram et al 2016 and could contribute to the elevated e coli concentrations recorded later in the wet season to attain an in depth process scale understanding of how rainfall events of varying magnitude impact e coli transfer in catchments a combination of approaches would be required controlled hillslope scale studies quantifying the flux of fios through overland and subsurface pathways under varying land use scenarios quantification of sediment driven remobilisation during events and high resolution monitoring at the catchment outlet scale 4 2 the role of catchment size stream order flow path length variation in hydrological properties and land use distribution in moderating the e coli discharge response at catchment outlets the response of e coli and q to rainfall was more rapid in the headwater catchments and there appears to be minimal q response at the basin outlet scale hz spring for events less than 20 40 mm catchment scale transport and residence time of water in catchments can be determined primarily by flow path gradient and length mcguire et al 2005 in karst terrain there is also inherent uncertainty in the delineation and characterisation of catchment boundaries and aquifers due to their spatial heterogeneity and leakiness introducing a degree of uncertainty in attribution to spatial characteristics such as catchment size or source distribution adinehvand et al 2017 both the surface and groundwater systems that contribute to the outlet at hz flow through the flat agricultural land in the dolomitic unit t2g3 fig 1 d and can result in long residence times est average of 493 days for some hydrological pathways zhang et al 2019 hz has 37 of land area with 5º slope compared with 12 2 and 21 for cqi cc and dz respectively in addition to the lower gradient in the lower reaches of the catchment hydrological properties change as a result of differences in lithology a highly developed fissure network and clay cover in the western plains where the dolomite unit t2g3 outcrops prevents rapid infiltration while the interbedded limestone shale units in the headwaters show peak cluster karst landforms with poorly developed fissure networks and rapid infiltration of overland flow generated during rainfall through karstic features such as vertical pipes and sinkholes zhang et al 2016 thus during low flow conditions or for small rainfall events transport of e coli to the outlets of headwater catchments may still be significant contributing to the higher concentrations at low discharge for the headwater catchments spatial heterogeneity in rainfall could also be a contributing factor to differences in discharge responses and e coli emergence patterns observed between sub catchment outlets ideally each sampling location would be instrumented with a rain gauge to assess this deposition with sediments storage in the fissure network or die off in the water column is likely to prevent e coli reaching hz from long flow paths due to the slow flow velocity and well developed fissure network liu et al 2010 during high flow conditions q may be sufficient for e coli flushed into the hydrological system from surface sources to remain suspended along long flow paths for smaller events e g event 3 5 0 mm the lack of response in e coli concentration with increasing scale above the headwater catchments could be due to a lack of proximal hydrologically connected sources but also attenuation of e coli by processes such as attachment to sediment particles and settling in stream bed sediments as the hydraulic gradient and hence stream flow velocity decreases schiperski et al 2016 wyness et al 2018 the higher peak e coli concentration and faster recession in e coli flux observed at cqi compared with cc indicates greater availability and connectivity of proximal sources at cqi compared with cc this is supported by the strong anti clockwise hysteresis observed at cc and lack of discernible hysteresis at cqi as well as the distribution of e coli concentration and flux values on the rising and falling limbs for cc catchment shape distribution of potential sources and hydrology are suspected to be important cqi is smaller than cc but the catchment outlet is located at the centre of the continuously cultivated valley depression and the majority of paddy and agricultural land is located within 1 km of the catchment outlet with no breaks in cultivated land this distribution of paddy land primarily in the discharge area of cqi can influence pco2 and other hydrogeochemical properties of water at the outlet zhao et al 2010 which indicates its connectivity and influence on downstream water quality the majority of agricultural land in cc in contrast is located 1 5 km from the catchment outlet connected to the outlet via an underground conduit and surface flow during high flow conditions in cc catchment several villages in the headwaters 3 km from the outlet contain point sources the slower recession of e coli concentration and consequently e coli flux at cc compared to cqi despite similar recession in discharge could be a result of lack of source depletion due to e coli persistence combined with the underground conduit system providing high connectivity between the villages and the sampling location the maximum e coli concentration at dz was one order of magnitude higher than that at cqi comparable to the increase in catchment area however the maximum e coli flux corresponding with timing of peak discharge was three orders of magnitude higher and occurred within an hour of the commencement of rainfall given the urban character of the dz sampling site this demonstrates the potential potency of urban point sources the presence and proportion of urban land have been found to represent important causes of elevated fio concentrations in many mixed land use catchment studies kay et al 2005 mcgrane et al 2014 neill et al 2018 paule mercado et al 2016 the average temperature at dz sampling location was also significantly higher than at cqi or cc during the sampling months 19 8 compared with 16 6 for both cqi and cc although increasing temperature is typically associated with increased mortality of e coli higher water temperatures have also been associated with higher e coli loads in catchments attributed to more favourable conditions for regrowth badgley et al 2019 chen and chang 2014 the flashy discharge response at dz and shorter time for 90 of total e coli export to have occurred relative to the cqi and cc tributaries 19 h versus 2 days also suggests rapid input from proximal sources probably resulting from the dominance of overland flow transport pathways due to impervious surfaces in the urban surrounds du et al 2015 the dominantly impervious concrete drains that modify the surface water system delivering water from feeder tributaries such as cqi are also likely to exacerbate the flashy nature of the q response though this requires further research 4 3 mechanisms of e coli transport inferences from over arching relationships between e coli and q and e coli and turbidity collectively the results suggest e coli transport is more strongly associated with discharge than sediment assuming turbidity as a proxy for suspended sediment but that sediment associated transport is more significant for high intensity rainfall high discharge events the trend in the rate of increase of e coli concentration with increasing discharge for the preferred model model 3 follows catchment scale trends in flow path gradient and hydrological properties however the presence of site and event as predictors in all candidate models for the relationship between e coli and discharge and their similar performance in terms of model fit illustrates that further event data at a range of catchment scales is needed to elucidate with greater confidence how event characteristics interact with catchment hydrology and source availability to influence site specific e coli discharge dynamics ideally sufficient events and sites would be sampled to include event characteristics e g rainfall intensity and amount and hydrological catchment properties e g contributing area infiltration rates flow path length as continuous predictors in modelling the event dependency of the association between e coli concentration and turbidity with the strength of correlation increasing with rainfall amount and discharge is consistent with other studies in karst where e coli has often correlated with suspended sediment concentration under high discharge conditions mahler et al 2000 pronk et al 2006 the activation of overland flow during higher intensity events may contribute to the higher sediment loads observed during events and is likely to be more significant than in non karst catchments buckerfield et al 2019 the resuspension of streambed fissure or conduit sediment stores may also contribute to the increasing strength of correlation with increasing discharge indeed the potential for survival of e coli in karst conduits for several months has been demonstrated bradshaw et al 2016 thilakarathne et al 2018 5 conclusions the houzhai catchment represents a typical landscape in the southwest china karst region this study identified rainfall characteristics land use and karstic hydrology to be fundamental controls on e coli q dynamics and export in mixed land use karst catchments typical of this terrain comparison of e coli q dynamics at different catchment outlets showed that both urban e g in dz and agricultural land e g in cqi can contribute high e coli loadings to receiving waters but that the distribution of these land use categories and associated faecal sources relative to hydrological pathways is equally as important in determining maximum e coli concentration and subsequent recession rates as has been observed elsewhere neill et al 2018 the portion of the population relying on catchment water resources as a drinking water supply and for domestic use are at higher risk and represent a significant proportion of the rural population in southwest china there is a heightened risk of exposure to faecally contaminated water for 2 3 days after rainfall events particularly during key periods in the agricultural calendar when high source availability and connectivity to receiving waters coincide in urban areas investment in waste containment and treatment infrastructure is necessary but in agricultural areas microbial water quality could be improved by identifying managing and raising awareness of critical source areas of fios to do this effectively will first require a better understanding of the uncertainties associated with complex hydrogeological pathways and the spatial and temporal trends in fio burden delivered to land from agricultural practices that occur across headwater to catchment

20005,karst aquifers have distinctive hydrology and supply 25 of the world s population with drinking water making them a critical geological setting for understanding and managing microbial water pollution rainfall causes elevated concentrations and loading of faecal microorganisms e g e coli in catchment surface and groundwater systems increasing the risk of human exposure to faecally contaminated water however effective management of microbial water quality in complex karst catchments is constrained by limited understanding of e coli discharge responses to rainfall we analysed how rainfall events of varying magnitude 2 4 100 mm control e coli discharge dynamics at increasing spatial scales in a mixed land use karst catchment in southwest china during the wet season hourly water sampling was undertaken throughout five storm events to characterise in high detail e coli emergence with resulting flow across multiple sites of varying catchment area stream order and land use e coli concentration was found to increase by 1 3 orders of magnitude following rainfall events maximum e coli concentration and speed of e coli recession were influenced by rainfall amount intensity timing of agricultural activities and position in the hydrological system for high intensity events 90 of the cumulative e coli export occurred within 48 h e coli concentration increased with increasing discharge at all sites e coli concentration at low discharge was higher in the headwaters than at the catchment outlet while the rate of increase in e coli concentration with increasing discharge appears to follow the opposite trend being higher at the catchment outlet than the headwaters this was attributed to the decreasing flow path gradient and increasing degree of development of the fissure network but further event monitoring at varying catchment scales is required to confirm this relationship the results provide novel insight into how rainfall characteristics combine with land use and catchment hydrology to control e coli export in karst landscapes graphical abstract image 1 keywords catchment hydrology faecal indicator organism faecal pollution storm event water quality 1 introduction karst aquifers provide 25 of the global population with drinking water hartmann et al 2014 understanding and managing microbial water pollution in karst environments is therefore key for protecting the health of those reliant on this source of drinking water karst catchments respond differently to rainfall than granular aquifers due to the extreme anisotropy in hydrological properties such as hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity and direct connectivity between the surface and groundwater systems bakalowicz 2005 fu et al 2016 effective hydraulic conductivity can vary by 10 12 orders of magnitude within a karst aquifer due to the high velocity pathways provided by dissolution developed conduits and the very low porosity of the primary rock matrix white 2018 following rainfall contaminants carried in runoff can bypass the soil profile and be flushed directly into karst aquifers through sinkholes and depressions faecal microbes stored in the fracture matrix or deposited in stream bed sediment during low flow conditions can survive for long periods and be remobilised during storm events padilla and vesper 2018 pronk et al 2007 hydrological transfer via the karst conduit structure to drinking water bores and springs thus presents a significant pathway for human exposure to microbial pollutants such as e coli the most commonly used indicator microorganism for inferring faecal contamination epting et al 2018 rainfall runoff processes can facilitate the mobilisation transfer and delivery of pollutants from land to receiving waters vanwormer et al 2016 in situ monitoring capability for nutrients has demonstrated how high resolution datasets are invaluable in understanding how rainfall variables interact with karst hydrology and source availability yue et al 2019 however microbial water quality response to different combinations of faecal inputs and hydrological drivers such as rainfall is poorly understood particularly in karst terrain vermeulen et al 2015 this is partly because unlike with nutrient pollution in situ high resolution sampling combined with on site analysis has not yet translated into a standard operating procedure for the quantification of e coli other faecal indicator organisms fios or human pathogens monitoring of fio discharge q relationships through storm events is therefore challenging it is further compounded by regulatory requirements to monitor microbial pollution at end point receptors and locations of likely human exposure risk such as bathing or shellfish harvesting waters rather than quantifying fios distributed across catchment drainage networks oliver et al 2016 catchments can comprise a mosaic of land use types containing a suite of diffuse and point sources of fios diffuse fio pollution dominates in rural catchments with leaking septic tanks and slurry pits representing largely unquantified fio loading sowah et al 2017 in se asia paddy farming dominates large areas of karst land the health impact of using wastewater to irrigate paddy crops is starting to receive research attention e g barna 2019 but relative to grassland research data are scarce buckerfield et al 2019 in urban areas failure and flooding of point sources e g sewage treatment plants are the leading sources of microbial contamination during rainfall events sauer et al 2011 however hydrological connectivity controls the delivery of fios from land to water and even in non karst catchments the role of hydrological connectivity in driving the dynamics of fios in streams remains poorly characterised neill et al 2018 despite their complexity catchments remain a fundamental unit for framing water management decisions cho et al 2016 however those management decisions are constrained by data availability and limited modelling of fio flux from catchments under low and high flow conditions vermeulen et al 2015 such modelling also requires better appreciation of responses in microbial water quality across different spatial and temporal scales muirhead and meenken 2018 some studies have quantified fio emergence with storm hydrographs e g murphy et al 2015 oliver et al 2015 ridley et al 2014 but how rainfall events of varying magnitude and successive rainfall events impact on fio q dynamics at different spatial scales within catchments is poorly documented buckerfield et al 2019 comparable research in karst terrain is scarcer yet and requires investigation due to the unique hydrology and risk factors that can influence drinking water contamination this form of dataset is required to inform on the risk presented by different sources under varying rainfall conditions and it will provide the evidence base to inform where mitigation is best targeted the aim of this study therefore was to investigate the impact of rainfall events of varying magnitude on e coli q dynamics at increasing spatial scales in a typical mixed land use karst catchment specifically the objectives of our multi site multi scale approach were to i characterise e coli q dynamics following rainfall and determine the influence of different rainfall characteristics and antecedent conditions and timing of agricultural activities on this relationship and ii assess how rainfall driven concentration and load of e coli in receiving waters varies across land use composition variation in hydrological structure and increasing scale of the contributing catchment area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study catchment the houzhai hz catchment drains a land area of 73 5 km2 and is located at the centre of the southwest china karst region fig 1 a which is one of the most extensive karst regions in the world this region has the highest national poverty rates and experiences high intensity rainfall events during the wet season cao et al 2015 a number of sub catchments in the hz catchment were instrumented with in situ hydrochemistry probes and pressure transducers for monitoring water levels the locations of the four sites used in this study are shown in fig 1 sites were selected to represent examples of contrasting land use increasing contributing catchment area and to capitalise on existing monitoring infrastructure the topography of the catchment ranges from mountainous karst cone depression landforms in the east maximum elevation 1565 m to dominantly flat plains in the west minimum elevation 1218 m fig 1 b the headwater sub catchments are characterised by steep topography and thin soils 50 cm and fast infiltration and vertical recharge of groundwater through sink holes and shafts resulting in rapid responses in discharge and return to base flow zhang et al 2017 further downstream the topographic and hydraulic gradients diminish soil cover becomes thicker and the fissure network becomes well developed resulting in attenuation and storage of recharge liu et al 2010 one well developed continuous conduit running along the southerly boundary fig 1 c acts as the primary drainage of the underground water system and a fissure controlled conduit network in the central and western area of the catchment is well connected with the primary conduit zhang et al 2017 the drainage system for the northerly sub catchments including chenqi cqi changchong cc dengzahne dz and qingshan qs reservoir fig 1 c is a modified series of transitions between the surface and groundwater systems the headwater catchments cqi and cc drain primarily through springs which are artificially channelled into concrete surface water channels that discharge into qingshan reservoir reservoir outflow continues as a surface river to the outlet of the hz catchment the catchment is a typical mixed land use paddy farming region with approximately half of the land used for cropping major crops being rice rapeseed and maize with additional crops including soybeans vegetable and fruit fig 1 d cqi is an entirely agricultural headwater catchment with dominant crops being rice rapeseed corn and soybeans cc contains paddy fields and urban land in the upper reaches of the catchment 3 km from the outlet with land closer to the outlet accommodating dry land cropping similar to cqi but also significant fruit crops and forested hillslopes dz catchment contains a higher percentage of urban land table 1 including land directly adjacent to the sampling location the hz groundwater outlet is located within a village at the outlet of hz watershed the primary southern conduit discharging at hz runs through agricultural land and several villages connectivity between the outlets of dengzhanhe and hz catchments is highly fragmented with possible hydrological flow paths through the qs reservoir and the conduit system the majority of steep hillsides are forested and much of the remaining flat land is urban distributed as small towns and villages population 53 500 statistics from puding county government the lithology comprises five stratigraphic units of the middle triassic guanling formation generally decreasing in age from east to west figure e 2 2 e coli discharge and turbidity data collection 2 2 1 in situ hydrological monitoring weirs at the designated monitoring points provided infrastructure for continuous q measurements and sampling of water quality parameters each gauging station was equipped with a water level logger gb t3091 2008 pressure transducer and an aqua troll 600 multiparameter sonde which continuously logged in stream turbidity and temperature pressure transducers were built into a stilling well and provided water depth measurements at a 5 min interval for later conversion to stream q using an established rating curve for each site zhang et al 2017 rainfall data was obtained from a rain gauge at lahoetain in the southern region of the catchment fig 1 standard aseptic grab sampling was not possible due to the remoteness of sites and therefore automatic water samplers qingdao suyuan environmental protection equipment co ltd china were used for capture of storm related water samples deploying autosamplers in this study was further justified on the basis that i the e coli q patterns were being compared and ii relative rather than absolute differences between e coli values were considered important for comparing across sites given that concentrations were not being assessed against regulatory standards the auto samplers were housed within concrete infrastructure adjacent to the weirs which helped to keep the samples cooler than ambient temperature reducing potential for temperature induced e coli die off before analysis pope et al 2003 all samples were retrieved returned to the laboratory in a cool box and analysed within 20 h of sampling 2 2 2 storm monitoring to determine the concentration of in stream e coli in response to rainfall and resulting q five rainfall events were sampled at one or more of the four monitoring sites over a two month period from the beginning of the wet season for the purposes of this study rainfall events are defined by the amount and intensity of rainfall as this is constant across all sites while the discharge response varies to minimise contamination auto sampler bottles were triple sterilised with ultra pure boiling water autoclaving was not possible and sealed with aluminium foil until deployed in the field prior to all storm events as per oliver et al 2015 sample collection began a minimum of 2 h prior to the commencement of rainfall samples were collected at an hourly interval for 24 h then at two hourly intervals from 24 to 48 h and at diminishing frequency typically every 6 h from 48 to 96 h simultaneous sampling at three monitoring sites was carried out over two events at i cqi cc and dz and ii cqi dz and hz an additional two events were monitored at cqi only and one further event at hz only 2 2 3 microbiological analysis e coli were enumerated using the standard uk environment agency method of membrane filtration ea 2009 each water sample was vacuum filtered through a sterile 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane sartorius stedim biotech goettingen germany and analysed in duplicate using a sterilised filtration unit rocker scientific co taiwan the membrane was then aseptically transferred to a plate containing membrane lactose glucuronide agar mlga cm1031 oxoid basingstoke uk and incubated at 37oc for 24 h for the determination of presumptive e coli colonies sample volumes ranging between 1 and 100 ml were filtered to capture between 20 and 200 e coli colony forming units cfu with further 1 10 serial dilutions in phosphate buffered saline pbs filtered where appropriate method blanks were regularly used to assess aseptic technique and to evaluate sterilisation efficiency between samples all data are reported as cfu 100 ml 1 2 3 data analysis all statistical analysis and modelling were performed using r v 3 6 0 r core team 2019 all e coli counts underwent log10 transformation prior to statistical analysis linear regression modelling of the e coli q and e coli turbidity relationships was performed investigating different combinations of site and event as categorical predictors interacting with discharge and turbidity as the continuous predictors the goodness of fit of models was ranked using akaike s information criterion aic values with a threshold delta aic value of 7 used to select candidate models fabozzi et al 2014 due to turbidity data only being available for two sites and only one shared event at both sites separate models were developed for the two sites cqi and hz the f statistic was used as a measure of the significance of candidate models and the significance of the effect of predictors on the response variable was assessed using t values both at p 0 05 significance level adherence to the assumptions of regression was checked by inspection of the normality of residuals and model diagnostics relationships between maximum q e coli concentration and flux event export and rainfall characteristics were also assessed following the same methodology analysis of e coli q hysteresis was undertaken on those events where a hydrological response to rainfall resulted in a well defined q peak comprised of a rising and falling limb all storm event e coli q responses were examined visually for the presence and direction of hysteretic loops discharge and e coli concentration data were linearly interpolated and discretised into units of seconds total event export was calculated by linear interpolation and trapezoidal integration of the derived e coli flux at 1 s intervals mckergow and davies colley 2010 the duration of the event was taken as the duration of monitoring 3 results the

between 19th april and 27th june 2017 fig 2 a capturing two major 10 mm d 1 rainfall events at the commencement of the wet season a simultaneous rise of e coli concentration and q was evident during events 2 and 4 while there was minimal q response for events 1 and 3 but a distinct increase in e coli concentration the range of e coli concentration increase was 0 6 2 4 orders of magnitude for all four events increase of 8 0 x 102 2 0 104 cfu 100 ml 1 events 3 and 4 2 4 and 78 mm total rainfall were sampled at dz fig 2 b no increase in water level and therefore q was recorded for event 3 but the concentration of e coli increased by almost 2 orders of magnitude however a similar concentration to the maximum recorded after event 3 was measured in a grab sample on the 20 4 and in the samples taken a few hours prior to event 4 rainfall events 3 and 5 2 4 mm and 102 mm total rainfall were monitored at hz groundwater outlet fig 2 c an increase in q occurred for event 3 but increases and decreases in q of a similar order of magnitude occurred during dry periods e coli concentrations remained low for event 3 pre event 1 2 101 cfu 100 ml 1 event maximum 3 4 101 cfu 100 ml 1 but an increase in flux of 0 5 orders of magnitude was observed translating to an increase in export of 1 3 x 105 cfu s 1 pre event e coli concentration for event 5 was also low 1 2 101 cfu 100 ml 1 but increased 1 6 orders of magnitude from pre event to peak event e coli concentration an increase in flux of two orders of magnitude was observed equivalent to an increase in export of 1 3 x 108 cfu s 1 additional grab samples taken in april the day after two small moderate rainfall events 20 mm and 2 0 mm had comparable e coli concentrations than those taken during event 3 3 2 comparison events monitored simultaneously at multiple sites rainfall event 3 was monitored simultaneously at cqi dz and hz fig 3 a while event 4 was monitored simultaneously at cqi cc and dz fig 3b no response in q was seen for event 3 at cqi or dz while almost a 50 increase was observed at hz an increase in e coli concentration was observed at all three sites following rainfall and an increase in flux at cqi and hz but not dz as q was zero immediately prior to the event q at hz had receded and stabilised at 60 of the relatively constant level observed over the previous month within 2 h e coli concentration increased by an order of magnitude at cqi and doubled at hz discharge at both cqi and hz fluctuated significantly before the event e coli concentration in a grab sample taken at hz two days prior was higher but the same order of magnitude as event samples and grab samples taken at cqi in the two days prior were also the same order of magnitude as pre event samples for event 4 cqi and cc followed similar q responses primarily responding to the main rainfall event while dz exhibited additional q peaks both before and after the main event responding to the minor rainfall events in the 24 h prior to and following the main event maximum q at cqi was lower 4 6 10 2 m3 s 1 than cc 5 2 10 1 m3 s 1 but peak e coli concentration was an order of magnitude higher 2 2 x 104 and 1 8 103 cfu 100 ml 1 respectively resulting in comparable maximum flux 6 0 106 and 9 0 106 cfu s 1 and export 1 8 1011 and 2 1 1011 cfu during the monitoring period the recession of e coli concentration and flux was faster at cqi after nearly 4 days 88 h e coli concentration at cqi dropped by 2 orders of magnitude to 1 of peak concentration while e coli concentration at cc dropped less than one order of magnitude remaining an order of magnitude higher than pre event concentration at 20 of peak concentration dz exhibited a peak e coli concentration almost 2 orders of magnitude higher than cc and one order higher than cqi the maximum e coli flux at dz was 2 2 5 orders of magnitude higher as peak q was 2 0 times that at cc and 2 6 times that at cqi however discharge returned to zero more rapidly at dz than cc and after 88 h e coli concentration was the same order of magnitude within 10 of pre event levels at dz 3 3 linear regression modelling table 3 summarises simple correlation analysis which provides support for the linear regression analysis 3 3 1 e coli concentration and discharge linear regression of log log transformed e coli concentration and q identified that a single model was inadequate for all site data combined r2 0 01 p 0 05 aic 819 the best performing models models 1 2 and 3 table 4 all incorporated both site and event as predictors allowing the slope to vary by site event or both produced similar model performance as was the case for intercepts removal of site as a predictor produced the largest increase in delta aic 158 2 followed by 82 7 for the removal of event the parameters for the model with the highest number of significant predictors model 3 are given in supplementary information table 7 and displayed in fig 4 with the data using model 3 also considered to be the most conceptually plausible e coli concentration at low discharge represented by the model intercepts was significantly different at all sites p 0 001 supplementary information table 7 the rate of increase of e coli concentration with q was higher at hz than at the other sites which were not significantly different fig 4 and the e coli concentration following events 2 and 5 both high intensity and total rainfall amount was significantly higher than during other events at the sites where they were sampled cqi and hz respectively 3 3 2 e coli concentration and turbidity the relationship between e coli concentration and turbidity was dependent on event characteristics as well as site characteristics a stronger correlation existed at both cqi and hz for events of higher rainfall intensity and amount table 3 linear regression of log log transformed e coli concentration and turbidity showed that significantly different relationships exist at cqi and hz regardless of event and that significantly different relationships exist between events at each site supplementary information tables 8 and 9 at hz e coli concentration increased significantly with increasing turbidity for event 5 while there was no significant change in the relationship for event 3 at cqi the rate of change was not significantly different between events but the intercept and maximum turbidity and e coli concentration were both higher for event 4 which also showed a stronger correlation table 3 assessment of the site dependency of the relationships is limited by the number of sites for which turbidity data is available two but the available data suggests a higher concentration per unit turbidity at cqi than at hz 3 4 rainfall runoff event typologies from hysteresis rising falling limb characteristics and flow duration curves five of the rainfall event site combinations resulted in a defined q peak and therefore a well defined hydrograph comprised of a rising and falling limb the mean e coli concentration was significantly higher on the falling limb rather than the rising limb for event 2 at cqi and event 4 at cc suggesting a delay in peak e coli relative to peak q and e coli flux was similarly higher on the falling limb for one of these events fig 5 otherwise no significant differences in concentrations were observed there were insufficient samples for event 4 at dengzhanhe on the rising limb to test for significant difference with the falling limb highly variable e coli q hysteresis patterns were observed across the range of event intensities and sample site locations fig 6 event 2 at cqi and event 4 at cc 45 and 78 mm demonstrated clear anti clockwise hysteresis while the remaining events cannot be clearly categorised as clockwise or anti clockwise event 4 at cqi exhibits weak anti clockwise and clockwise sections in the hystersis curve event 5 at hz is complex it could be categorised as clockwise but comprises only a few samples on the rising limb and the superposition of a second q peak associated with a second smaller rainfall event the cumulative q and e coli export curves fig 7 illustrate the short time period over which most event associated e coli export occurs for the high intensity events 2 and 4 at cqi cc and dz 90 of e coli export occurred within 48 h and within 24 h at dz t90 in fig 7 for the lower intensity events 1 and 3 and event 5 at hz the time for 90 export was 3 days for events with a distinctive q peak 2 4 and 5 cumulative q began to diminish before cumulative e coli export but both discharge and e coli concentration show similar asymptotic behaviour 24 48 h after the event event 3 low rainfall intensity and amount showed a linear increase in cumulative q at both cqi and hz but cqi showed an increase in e coli export while export at hz remained linear cumulative q and e coli export followed a different evolution to other events and sites at hz for event 5 partially as a result of two distinct discharge peaks due to rain the day after the main event 4 discussion high resolution characterisation of in stream e coli concentration in response to storm events is challenging this study addresses this challenge and reports on a series of novel datasets of e coli q relationships observed across a karst catchment over successive rainfall events events ranging from 5 0 mm to 100 mm rainfall over the study period were found to cause microbial water quality impairment at a range of spatial scales for 1 4 days following rainfall in mixed land use paddy farming karst regions 4 1 interactions and relative importance of event characteristics antecedent conditions and source availability understanding of diffuse pollution has highlighted the importance of critical source areas csas defined as zones in the landscape where high sources of pollutants coincide with high potential for hydrological transfer heathwaite et al 2005 the e coli concentration and q dynamics at the outlet of cqi indicate e coli export from agricultural catchments following rainfall is strongly moderated by source availability and hydrological connectivity of sources to receiving waters indicative of csa influences and consistent with nitrate contamination patterns in this catchment yue et al 2019 the increase in e coli concentration was comparable for events 1 2 and 3 spanning late april to late may despite 1 2 orders of magnitude difference in rainfall and q this suggests that the timing of agricultural activities combined with seasonal rainfall patterns are likely to be the key controls on source availability and hydrological connectivity respectively april represents a transitional period from the dry to the wet season in sw china and also the period in the agricultural calendar where rapeseed is harvested and fields are tilled and fertilised with livestock manure for paddy crops yue et al 2018 therefore relatively low rainfall may cause potentially large sources of fios e g manure heaps prepared for land application to become hydrologically connected to the groundwater system via transfer from fresh manure heaps to sink holes or irrigation ditches evidence of increased fio loading of watercourses in mixed land use or agricultural catchments during growing seasons and associated organic fertiliser application further supports this sinclair et al 2009 thilakarathne et al 2018 the presence of impervious surfaces e g roads and nearby ditches can enhance connectivity between agricultural contaminant sources such as fios and nutrients and receiving waters in agricultural areas buchanan et al 2012 murphy et al 2015 furthermore bare rock in karst areas is known to have a high runoff ratio li et al 2011 which is particularly relevant to this region where karst rocky desertification results in extensive bare rock exposure and thus increased likelihood of overland flow pathways connecting fio and sediment sources to streams and sinkholes dai et al 2017 for local residents dependent on catchment water supplies the commencement of the monsoon and paddy seasons presents a period of increased risk where particular care should be taken to treat water or use an alternative supply for 2 3 days following rainfall measures to reduce the potential for hydrological transfer from sources such as careful placement and containment of manure heaps may also reduce risk the anti clockwise hysteresis observed for event 2 45 mm at cqi and mixture of weak anti clockwise and clockwise hysteresis for event 4 78 mm suggest proximal sources potentially contribute more to export for event 4 which resulted in an order of magnitude higher concentration flux and total export than event 2 a threshold of 80 mm for activation of overland flow has been suggested in this karst area zhang et al 2011 consistent with the magnitude of event 4 thus activation of additional hydrological pathways such as overland flow could further contribute to the delivery of nearby fio sources to receiving waters during high intensity rainfall lloyd et al 2016 antecedent catchment conditions can influence e coli transfer to receiving waters by increasing or decreasing the activation of overland and subsurface flow mechanisms hathaway et al 2010 the timing of successive events in our study allows for the role of different antecedent conditions to be considered although there are too few events across a suite of antecedent conditions and sites to enable analysis beyond preliminary empirical observation events were monitored both during the onset of the wet season dry antecedent conditions e g event 1 and after numerous events had occurred e g event 4 when soil moisture is likely to have increased zhang et al 2011 low soil moisture due to dry antecedent conditions has been found to result in higher surface runoff generation and suspended sediment transport due to infiltration excess overland flow mcdowell and sharpley 2002 puntenney et al 2016 the moderate but significant correlation between e coli concentration and turbidity for event 1 would be consistent with this process combined with the availability of sources at this time rapidly induced overland flow could be a further explanatory factor behind the high e coli concentration observed following events early in the season increased soil moisture prior to rainfall is generally associated with a more rapid generation of saturation excess overland flow and increased river discharge for a given rainfall amount relative to dry conditions penna et al 2011 in this karst region increased soil moisture has been found to decrease the amount of rainfall required before preferential subsurface flow along the soil epikarst boundary is generated fu et al 2015 the groundwater level in this region also increases during the wet season yue et al 2015 potentially increasing activation of subsurface flow with successive rainfall events this is a process that has been observed to cause increased nitrate transfer to agricultural streams outram et al 2016 and could contribute to the elevated e coli concentrations recorded later in the wet season to attain an in depth process scale understanding of how rainfall events of varying magnitude impact e coli transfer in catchments a combination of approaches would be required controlled hillslope scale studies quantifying the flux of fios through overland and subsurface pathways under varying land use scenarios quantification of sediment driven remobilisation during events and high resolution monitoring at the catchment outlet scale 4 2 the role of catchment size stream order flow path length variation in hydrological properties and land use distribution in moderating the e coli discharge response at catchment outlets the response of e coli and q to rainfall was more rapid in the headwater catchments and there appears to be minimal q response at the basin outlet scale hz spring for events less than 20 40 mm catchment scale transport and residence time of water in catchments can be determined primarily by flow path gradient and length mcguire et al 2005 in karst terrain there is also inherent uncertainty in the delineation and characterisation of catchment boundaries and aquifers due to their spatial heterogeneity and leakiness introducing a degree of uncertainty in attribution to spatial characteristics such as catchment size or source distribution adinehvand et al 2017 both the surface and groundwater systems that contribute to the outlet at hz flow through the flat agricultural land in the dolomitic unit t2g3 fig 1 d and can result in long residence times est average of 493 days for some hydrological pathways zhang et al 2019 hz has 37 of land area with 5º slope compared with 12 2 and 21 for cqi cc and dz respectively in addition to the lower gradient in the lower reaches of the catchment hydrological properties change as a result of differences in lithology a highly developed fissure network and clay cover in the western plains where the dolomite unit t2g3 outcrops prevents rapid infiltration while the interbedded limestone shale units in the headwaters show peak cluster karst landforms with poorly developed fissure networks and rapid infiltration of overland flow generated during rainfall through karstic features such as vertical pipes and sinkholes zhang et al 2016 thus during low flow conditions or for small rainfall events transport of e coli to the outlets of headwater catchments may still be significant contributing to the higher concentrations at low discharge for the headwater catchments spatial heterogeneity in rainfall could also be a contributing factor to differences in discharge responses and e coli emergence patterns observed between sub catchment outlets ideally each sampling location would be instrumented with a rain gauge to assess this deposition with sediments storage in the fissure network or die off in the water column is likely to prevent e coli reaching hz from long flow paths due to the slow flow velocity and well developed fissure network liu et al 2010 during high flow conditions q may be sufficient for e coli flushed into the hydrological system from surface sources to remain suspended along long flow paths for smaller events e g event 3 5 0 mm the lack of response in e coli concentration with increasing scale above the headwater catchments could be due to a lack of proximal hydrologically connected sources but also attenuation of e coli by processes such as attachment to sediment particles and settling in stream bed sediments as the hydraulic gradient and hence stream flow velocity decreases schiperski et al 2016 wyness et al 2018 the higher peak e coli concentration and faster recession in e coli flux observed at cqi compared with cc indicates greater availability and connectivity of proximal sources at cqi compared with cc this is supported by the strong anti clockwise hysteresis observed at cc and lack of discernible hysteresis at cqi as well as the distribution of e coli concentration and flux values on the rising and falling limbs for cc catchment shape distribution of potential sources and hydrology are suspected to be important cqi is smaller than cc but the catchment outlet is located at the centre of the continuously cultivated valley depression and the majority of paddy and agricultural land is located within 1 km of the catchment outlet with no breaks in cultivated land this distribution of paddy land primarily in the discharge area of cqi can influence pco2 and other hydrogeochemical properties of water at the outlet zhao et al 2010 which indicates its connectivity and influence on downstream water quality the majority of agricultural land in cc in contrast is located 1 5 km from the catchment outlet connected to the outlet via an underground conduit and surface flow during high flow conditions in cc catchment several villages in the headwaters 3 km from the outlet contain point sources the slower recession of e coli concentration and consequently e coli flux at cc compared to cqi despite similar recession in discharge could be a result of lack of source depletion due to e coli persistence combined with the underground conduit system providing high connectivity between the villages and the sampling location the maximum e coli concentration at dz was one order of magnitude higher than that at cqi comparable to the increase in catchment area however the maximum e coli flux corresponding with timing of peak discharge was three orders of magnitude higher and occurred within an hour of the commencement of rainfall given the urban character of the dz sampling site this demonstrates the potential potency of urban point sources the presence and proportion of urban land have been found to represent important causes of elevated fio concentrations in many mixed land use catchment studies kay et al 2005 mcgrane et al 2014 neill et al 2018 paule mercado et al 2016 the average temperature at dz sampling location was also significantly higher than at cqi or cc during the sampling months 19 8 compared with 16 6 for both cqi and cc although increasing temperature is typically associated with increased mortality of e coli higher water temperatures have also been associated with higher e coli loads in catchments attributed to more favourable conditions for regrowth badgley et al 2019 chen and chang 2014 the flashy discharge response at dz and shorter time for 90 of total e coli export to have occurred relative to the cqi and cc tributaries 19 h versus 2 days also suggests rapid input from proximal sources probably resulting from the dominance of overland flow transport pathways due to impervious surfaces in the urban surrounds du et al 2015 the dominantly impervious concrete drains that modify the surface water system delivering water from feeder tributaries such as cqi are also likely to exacerbate the flashy nature of the q response though this requires further research 4 3 mechanisms of e coli transport inferences from over arching relationships between e coli and q and e coli and turbidity collectively the results suggest e coli transport is more strongly associated with discharge than sediment assuming turbidity as a proxy for suspended sediment but that sediment associated transport is more significant for high intensity rainfall high discharge events the trend in the rate of increase of e coli concentration with increasing discharge for the preferred model model 3 follows catchment scale trends in flow path gradient and hydrological properties however the presence of site and event as predictors in all candidate models for the relationship between e coli and discharge and their similar performance in terms of model fit illustrates that further event data at a range of catchment scales is needed to elucidate with greater confidence how event characteristics interact with catchment hydrology and source availability to influence site specific e coli discharge dynamics ideally sufficient events and sites would be sampled to include event characteristics e g rainfall intensity and amount and hydrological catchment properties e g contributing area infiltration rates flow path length as continuous predictors in modelling the event dependency of the association between e coli concentration and turbidity with the strength of correlation increasing with rainfall amount and discharge is consistent with other studies in karst where e coli has often correlated with suspended sediment concentration under high discharge conditions mahler et al 2000 pronk et al 2006 the activation of overland flow during higher intensity events may contribute to the higher sediment loads observed during events and is likely to be more significant than in non karst catchments buckerfield et al 2019 the resuspension of streambed fissure or conduit sediment stores may also contribute to the increasing strength of correlation with increasing discharge indeed the potential for survival of e coli in karst conduits for several months has been demonstrated bradshaw et al 2016 thilakarathne et al 2018 5 conclusions the houzhai catchment represents a typical landscape in the southwest china karst region this study identified rainfall characteristics land use and karstic hydrology to be fundamental controls on e coli q dynamics and export in mixed land use karst catchments typical of this terrain comparison of e coli q dynamics at different catchment outlets showed that both urban e g in dz and agricultural land e g in cqi can contribute high e coli loadings to receiving waters but that the distribution of these land use categories and associated faecal sources relative to hydrological pathways is equally as important in determining maximum e coli concentration and subsequent recession rates as has been observed elsewhere neill et al 2018 the portion of the population relying on catchment water resources as a drinking water supply and for domestic use are at higher risk and represent a significant proportion of the rural population in southwest china there is a heightened risk of exposure to faecally contaminated water for 2 3 days after rainfall events particularly during key periods in the agricultural calendar when high source availability and connectivity to receiving waters coincide in urban areas investment in waste containment and treatment infrastructure is necessary but in agricultural areas microbial water quality could be improved by identifying managing and raising awareness of critical source areas of fios to do this effectively will first require a better understanding of the uncertainties associated with complex hydrogeological pathways and the spatial and temporal trends in fio burden delivered to land from agricultural practices that occur across headwater to catchment

removal in this study we developed a multispecies biofilm model to study chromate reduction and its interaction with nitrate reduction in a ch4 based mbfr the model simulated results were consistent with the experimental data reported in the literature the model showed that the presence of nitrate in the influent promoted the growth of heterotrophs while suppressing methanotrophs and chromate reducers moreover it indicated that a biofilm thickness of 150 μm and an influent dissolved oxygen concentration of 0 5 mg o2 l could improve the reactor performance by increasing the chromate removal efficiency under the simulated conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane biofilm reactor chromate reduction nitrate effect aerobic methane oxidation model analysis 1 introduction chromium is an important raw metal material and is used in various industries such as metallurgy moreover it can be used as refractories or for leather tanning discharge of inadequately treated wastewater from these industrial sites leads to the presence of excess chromium in water and soil chromium mainly occurs in the cr vi and cr iii states uptake of cr vi can alter the germination and root growth processes of plants and jeopardize their physiological processes shanker et al 2005 furthermore inhalation of cr vi leads to nasal septum perforation asthma pneumonitis and bronchogenic carcinoma in mammals the maximum contaminant level mcl for cr was set at 100 μg l for drinking water by the us epa 2009 on the other hand cr iii is an essential element for humans srivastava et al 1999 the recommended intake for chromium is 20 35 μg day for adults floch 2013 furthermore cr iii is less soluble and more easily removed from liquid phases thus the reduction of cr vi to cr iii represents a promising method to solve the chromium contamination problem previous studies have shown that cr vi can be reduced to cr iii by different microorganisms camargo et al 2003 pattanapipitpaisal et al 2001 zhai et al 2017 recently lai et al 2016a reported successful cr vi reduction in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr in which methane diffused through the non porous membrane serving as the sole electron donor for the biofilm meanwhile cr vi diffused from the bulk liquid into the biofilm where microbial mediated chromate reduction took place the counter diffusion biofilm

of cr vi lai et al 2016b long et al 2017 luo et al 2015 lv et al 2019 modin et al 2008 the performance of the mbfr can be affected by operational conditions such as inoculum gas pressure biofilm thickness management strategies and the loading of co existing electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen and nitrate nerenberg et al 2002 tang et al 2010 it is unclear how these conditions interact and affect the removal of chromate moreover answering this question requires tremendous experimental efforts in contrast multispecies biofilm modeling can be a powerful and convenient tool for quantitative analysis and reactor optimization lackner et al 2008 tang et al 2013 therefore the first objective of this study was to develop a multispecies biofilm model to analyze the chromate removal efficiency of the ch4 based mbfr due to the countercurrent diffusion at the biofilm in the mbfr the biofilm thickness profoundly influences the performance of the mbfr therefore the second objective of this study was to understand the effect of dissolved oxygen do which significantly affects the thickness of the biofilm on mbfr performance zhong et al 2017 found that nitrate and chromate interacted with each other in the mbfr with nitrate greatly reducing the rate of chromate reduction nitrate is a common contaminant in wastewater which may affect chromate reduction through the following interactions i the competition between nitrate and chromate for the same resources e g methane ii the competition for space in the biofilm between different kinds of microorganisms iii the promotion of growth of chromate reducing microorganisms through their utilization of nitrate tang et al 2012 the extent to which nitrate influences chromate reduction depends on the loading rates of both nitrate and chromate therefore the third objective of this study was to explore the performance of the ch4 based mbfr under various combinations of chromate and nitrate loading rates 2 model development and evaluation 2 1 model development cr vi and nitrate reduction coupled to methane oxidation has been reported to occur mainly via an indirect pathway in which methane is firstly oxidized by methanotrophs into intermediates which are then utilized by other microorganisms to reduce electron acceptors such as chromate nitrate and oxygen in the model developed by modin et al 2018 aerobic methanotrophs utilized methane and expelled methanol which was used by heterotrophs to reduce oxygen and nitrate long et al 2017 identified methanotrophs denitrifiers and cr vi reducers in a methane and oxygen based mbfr moreover our group lai et al 2016a also found methanotrophs chromate reducers and denitrifiers in the ch4 based mbfr therefore we proposed the following model the model contains 5 solid species and 6 soluble species the solids species are methane oxidizing bacteria xamo heterotrophic bacteria xhb chromate reducing bacteria xcrb inert biomass xib and extracellular polymeric substances xeps the soluble species are methane sch4 methanol sch3oh oxygen so2 chromate scro4 nitrate sno3 substrate utilization associated products suap and biomass associated products sbap specific information is listed in table s1 in the si the critical biological processes considered in the model are displayed in fig 1 in the biofilm ch4 is consumed by the amo by reducing o2 in the inflow the oxidation product methanol then serves as the electron donor for the reduction of chromate by crb and nitrate by crb and hb uap and eps are produced during the growth process of the microorganisms eps is then hydrolyzed to biomass associated products bap while uap and bap serve as electron donors for hb all microorganisms are subject to endogenous respiration in which they are oxidized by corresponding electron acceptors and partially converted to inert biomass laspidou and rittmann 2002 methane diffuses into the biofilm from the hollow fiber membrane wall while other soluble species diffuse into the biofilm from the bulk liquid in contrast the solid products become part of the biofilm the soluble products first diffuse into the pore water in the biofilm then into the bulk liquid and finally leave the system together with the effluent 2 2 model assumptions and simplifications for further biofilm modeling several simplification and assumptions were made 1 the mbfr biofilm model was based on the one dimension biofilm model developed by wanner and reichert 1996 the biofilm was modeled as a continuum with the components changing only in the direction perpendicular to the membrane surface the biomass was described as quantity per volume wanner and gujer 1986 the one dimension biofilm assumption was widely used to predict the overall reactor performance chen and ni 2016 chen et al 2016 sun et al 2017 2 the kinetics of the biological reactions was described using dual substrate monod kinetics the inhibition observed in the experiment was modeled as a noncompetitive form according to activated sludge model henze et al 2000 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 peng et al 2016 moreover the substrate diffusion was simulated according to fick s law the specific rate of expression and the stoichiometry are listed in tables s2 and s3 1 3 5 in the si 3 the methane flux from the fiber lumen to the biofilm base was depicted as a diffusive process driven by the concentration gradient the flux was described as follows i c h 4 q e x c h 4 s c h 4 1 h c h 4 s c h 4 2 where s c h 4 1 and s c h 4 2 are gas concentrations of methane in the fiber lumen and biofilm membrane interface kg cod m3 q e x c h 4 is the overall mass exchange coefficient of methane m2 day and h c h 4 is henry s coefficient for methane kg cod m 3 gas kg cod m 3 liquid the methane pressure in the lumen is converted to cod concentration by using the ideal gas equation 4 the thickness of the diffusion layer was 100 μm with the biofilm having a porosity of 0 6 and a density of 100000 g cod m3 horn and lackner 2014 5 the contribution of the suspended solids was ignored in the system moreover the ph of the system was maintained at 7 0 7 5 thus the effect of ph was not considered sun et al 2017 the detachment occurred on the biofilm bulk liquid interface the composition of the detached biomass was consistent with that of the biofilm interface no attachment or reattachment occurred in the reactor ni and yuan 2013 ni et al 2013 tang et al 2012 6 the steady state was obtained by controlling the global detachment velocity which is a second order function of the biofilm thickness ni et al 2013 the ch4 based mbfr was modeled using two compartments of the aquasim 2 1g a software designed for the modeling of aquatic systems reichert 1994 the biofilm and bulk liquid were modeled as a biofilm system while the hollow fiber lumen was modeled as a mixed reactor system for laboratory configurations the membrane fiber length was generally less than 35 cm moreover the reactor was in completely mixed condition as it had limited volume and recirculation was used as such the mixed reactor assumption was adequate for modeling ahmed and semmens 1992 martin and nerenberg 2012 the methane flux through hollow fiber membrane wall was modeled by diffusion between the two systems reichert 1998 2 3 model calibration and validation the developed biofilm model consists of 17 microbial processes and 35 kinetic stochiometric parameters the values of the major parameters are adapted from previous studies see si specific parameter values and references are listed in table s4 1 in si the kinetic and stoichiometry parameters maximum growth rates and yield coefficients were calculated using methods previously described by rittmann and mccarty 2002 and summarized in table s4 2 three unavailable parameters k x c r b c r o 4 μ x h b s η c r o 4 were estimated by fitting the experimental data sensitivity analysis results are shown in figs s1 and s2 according to the results the amo related parameters y μ and crb μ kcro4 ycro4 related parameters are the most sensitive both the parameter estimation and model validation were carried out using the aquasim 2 1g software 2 4 experimental data used for evaluating the developed model the experimental data used for model validation was adapted from lai et al 2016a and zhong et al 2017 briefly the mbfr consisted of a 65 ml tube and a 58 cm2 composite hollow fiber membrane the mbfr was operated at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min hrt 130 min and various ch4 pressures five operation conditions were used to explore the chromate removal capacity of the reactor in a similar experiment six other stages were carried out to investigate the effect of nitrate on chromate reduction in a ch4 based mbfr for each stage the mbfr reached a steady state according to the effluent concentrations of cro4 2 and no3 we selected 5 steady effluent stages to calibrate the model specific effluent concentration values are listed in table s5 more details can be found in lai et al 2016a and zhong et al 2017 we used stages 1 2 3 and 5 to calibrate the model and stages 4 and 6 to validate the model 2 5 model based analysis of the microbial community in the biofilm the performance of the mbfr changed significantly following the introduction of nitrate in the system we chose 3 experimental stages 4 5 and 6 to study the microbial distribution in the biofilm moreover the distribution of each species along the vertical direction was simulated using the aquasim 2 0g software then the model output was used to analyze how nitrate affected the distribution of solid species in the biofilm 2 6 the impact of key operational parameters on chromate removal efficiency the validated model was then used to investigate the effect of biofilm thickness and influent do concentration on chromate nitrate removal in the ch4 based mbfr furthermore the effect of loading rates of cro4 2 and no3 were also investigated with the model the simulated mbfr had a reactor volume of 5 l and a membrane surface area of 0 5 m2 the reactor area to volume ratio a v was typical for mbfr systems sun et al 2017 to evaluate the effect of biofilm thickness the mbfr was simulated with a biofilm thickness ranging from 50 to 800 μm to evaluate the effect of influent do concentration the mbfr was simulated with do ranging from 0 to 2 0 mg o2 l to evaluate the effect of nitrate on chromate reduction the mbfr was simulated with various combinations of chromate and nitrate loading rates the specific simulation scenarios are shown in table s6 scenario 1 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of model calibration and validation the experimental data summarized in table s5 were used to carry out parameter estimation and model validation the effluent concentrations and removal fluxes from the experiments and the model were compared in fig 2 a d fig 2a b show the influent and effluent concentrations of chromate and nitrate from the experiments and the model the model results and the experimental results were found to be generally consistent in stages 1 4 the chromate in the influent was almost completely reduced resulting in a high removal efficiency higher than 97 in both the experiments and the model the cr vi removal flux simulated by the model in stages 1 4 was 116 228 370 and 493 mg cr l d respectively these results are also comparable to the experimental results 117 231 367 and 494 mg cr l d respectively however the experimental data show that chromate reduction was strongly inhibited in stage 5 compared to the same chromate loading in stage 4 when 2 2 mg n l 24 mg n l d of nitrate was introduced in the influent the effluent cr vi concentration increased from approximately 0 8 mg l to 3 48 mg l resulting in a decrease in removal efficiency from 98 to less than 10 the cr vi reduction percentage was recovered to 62 8 after the nitrate concentration decreased to 0 66 mg l 7 3 mg l d in stage 6 the model shows very similar results 62 8 of cr vi removal in stage 6 and 11 5 in stage 5 by using previously well established parameters for methanotrophs heterotrophs sun et al 2017 lin et al 2009 and the proposed metabolic pathways chen and ni 2016 tang et al 2013 the model developed in this study satisfactorily predicted the experimental performance 3 2 microbial distribution in the biofilm the experimental studies have shown that high nitrate loading 24 mg n l d strongly inhibited chromate removal zhong et al 2017 to understand how nitrate affected chromate removal in the mbfr we used the validated model to investigate the microbial compositions at stages 4 5 and 6 fig 3 a c show the simulated microbial distribution along the direction perpendicular to the substratum at stage 4 0 mg n l 5 24 mg n l d and 6 7 3 mg n l d respectively fig 3 d f show the overall distribution of biomass in the three stages respectively the model calibrated abundance of microorganisms generally captured the trends of the experimental data as shown in figure s3 1 3 3 as shown in fig 3a and d in the absence of nitrate the biomass was mainly composed of amo 46 and crb 33 sun et al 2017 developed a model for perchlorate reduction in the ch4 based mbfr and found that methanotrophs were more likely situated close to the membrane our model indicated that the amo were almost uniformly distributed across the biofilm this was probably caused by the high efficiency of methane transfer of the membrane and the high methane concentrations across the biofilm when 24 mg n l d of nitrate was added to the influent in stage 5 the steady state microbial composition changed significantly the abundance of hb increased from less than 3 to 51 4 in the steady state making hb the dominant functional group in the biofilm meanwhile the eps decreased from 17 to 12 there might be two explanations for this phenomenon first hb had an advantage over crb due to the hb s ability to utilize nitrate second hb could utilize bap and uap generated by eps hydrolysis laspidou and rittmann 2002 with the increase of hb crb was outcompeted for growth space methanol and possibly reductase enzymes as a result the steady state fraction of crb decreased accordingly the chromate reduction was strongly decreased and the competition for electrons between chromate and nitrate became fiercer as shown in fig 3c and f a lower concentration of nitrate of 0 66 mg l increased the eps percentage from 12 to 33 similarly lai et al 2018 reported that the amount of eps decreased after a higher loading of vanadate 10 mg l in influent since eps didn t act as a straight electron donor for chromate reduction the increase of eps did not contribute to the reduction of chromate liu et al 2017 it can be inferred that the high concentration of nitrate inhibited chromate reduction possibly by promoting the competition for electrons between nitrate and chromate which restricted the electron flow to the chromate moreover low concentrations of nitrate inhibited chromate reduction possibly via the promotion of eps secretion the increase of eps not only intensified the competition for space but also reduced the rate of chromate diffusion into the biofilm 3 3 effect of biofilm thickness and influent do on chromate removal experimental results showed that the mbfr reactor could completely remove up to 44 mg cr l d of chromate when nitrate was not present without testing a higher loading of cr vi the maximum chromate removal capacity of the reactor remained unknown since the biofilm thickness could be managed by flow velocity and shear stress we investigated the reactor performance under various biofilm thicknesses using the developed model fig 4 a shows that the fluxes of cr vi and nitrate were more severely affected when the biofilm thickness ranged between 50 and 100 μm and less affected when the biofilm thickness exceeded 100 μm this can be explained by substrate diffusion and biomass retention when the biofilm was thin less than 100 μm in this case the reduction was limited by the biomass quantity thus the overall reduction capacity increased with the increase in biofilm thickness when the biofilm was thicker more than 150 μm in this case the reduction was restrained at substrate diffusion skowlund 1990 presented a numerical simulation for the biofilm and found that the active biofilm would finally reach a constant value in spite of the increase in biofilm thickness this might also explain why the efficiency of chromate removal did not continue to increase after the biofilm thickness reached 100 μm methane and oxygen were supplied separately from two sides of the biofilm the dual substrates limitation more likely occurred when the methane supply was not sufficient limiting the growth of amo in addition it was less likely that the substrate cr vi from the liquid side would be able to penetrate the biofilm which resulted in waste of the interior biomass fig 4b and c show the simulated biomass distribution for the two biofilm thicknesses 100 μm for b and 500 μm for c the thicker biofilm promoted the growth of amo and inert biomass which outcompeted other microorganisms for space oxygen had dual effects on the reactor efficiency on the one hand o2 is an essential substrate for methane oxidation generating methanol for chromate and nitrate reduction on the other hand oxygen may negatively affect the reactor performance by competing with chromate and nitrate for methanol the common electron donor according to lai et al 2016b methane wasn t a limiting factor for methane oxidation in the experiments as shown in fig 5 a the removal of chromate and nitrate kept increasing along with the increase of influent do fig 5b and c show the simulated biomass distribution at two do concentrations 0 5 mg l for b and 1 mg l for c the higher do promoted the growth of amo and hb substantially similarly crb growth was also slightly promoted by the introduction of oxygen this could be due to higher methanol production due to a higher do although high concentrations of oxygen might compete as an electron acceptor its adverse effects were not apparent in the simulations in the experiments oxygen could only enter the system through the influent i e 0 7 mg o2 l corresponding to a loading rate of 0 504 mg o2 d which could oxidize methane into 0 756 mg cod d of methanol this was far away from meeting the needs for chromate and nitrate reduction in the system following that we calculated the potential oxygen intrusion by using reactor part connectors as described by alrashed et al 2018 the results showed that the total do could reach 3 6 mg o2 d thereby generating 5 1 mg cod d which can meet the demands for the actual chromate and nitrate fluxes in the experiments the calculation step is detailed in the si 3 4 mbfr performance under various combinations of chromate and nitrate loading rates nitrate co exists with chromate in many bodies of water chen and strous 2013 the experimental results suggested that nitrate affected the reduction of chromate in the ch4 based mbfr system conversely chromate was also shown to have some impact on nitrate removal zhong et al 2017 thus the influence of chromate and nitrate loading on chromate reduction in the ch4 based mbfr was simulated using the developed model fig 6 a shows the efficiency of chromate removal under various combinations of nitrate and chromate loading rates the white dotted lines separated the chromate efficiency into three parts under low nitrate loading 0 0 04 mg n m2 d the nitrate had limited inhibition effects on chromate removal efficiency which remained higher than 80 under moderate nitrate loading 0 04 0 10 mg n m2 d the effect of nitrate become stronger and the chromate removal efficiency declined rapidly with the increase in nitrate levels this phenomenon was clearly observed even at a low chromate loading the chromate removal efficiency reached zero in the third part probably due to the fact that the ability of chromate to compete for electrons was further weakened fig 6b shows the efficiency of nitrate removal under various combinations of nitrate and chromate loading rates when chromate was not present in the influent the nitrate removal efficiency was between 70 97 unlike the chromate removal nitrate removal was more likely affected by its own loading under low nitrate loadings 0 0 06 mg n m2 d the nitrate removal efficiency was generally higher than 85 when the nitrate loading increased to more than 0 06 mg n m2 d the nitrate removal efficiency dropped rapidly from 85 to 67 however the introduction of chromate 0 0 30 mg cr m2 d led to little inhibition less than 5 efficiency decrease of nitrate removal generally the chromate removal flux in the ch4 based mbfr was very sensitive to nitrate loading probably because of the advantage of nitrate on the affinity coefficient as such the effect of nitrate should be considered in the reactor design moreover a cro4 2 no3 ratio may be used as an index for reactor design similarly to the no2 nh4 ration for designing the mbfr carrying out denitrification coupled to anaerobic methane oxidation chen et al 2016 3 5 practical implication excessive chromate in bodies of water can pose potential risks both to the environment and public health as chromate and nitrate often co occur in wastewater and the standards for nitrate are usually a few magnitudes higher than those for chromate knowledge about alleviating the effect of nitrate on chromate removal is of practical importance removal of chromate from water based on the ch4 based mbfr has been demonstrated by previous experiments this study systematically investigated the effect of nitrate on chromate removal it is expected that the developed model and the simulated results could be a reference for the reactor design further evaluation of the model using a wider range of operation conditions is needed some mechanical factors such as fluid dynamics and shear stress should also be taken into account when the model is applied in pilot or bigger scale tests 4 conclusion in this study we developed a biofilm model for chromate and nitrate reduction in the ch4 based mbfr the model simulated results fitted the experimental data satisfactorily the model was then used to analyze the effect of nitrate on chromate removal in mbfr the model analysis revealed that nitrate exacerbated the competition among amos hbs and chromate reducers moreover hbs were promoted while amo and chromate reducers crb were outcompeted with 2 2 mg l no3 n in the influent water the fraction of hb increased from less than 3 to 23 85 however the fraction of amo and crb decreased from 46 and 33 to less than 15 and 5 respectively the decrease of chromate reducers in our system is mainly due to their slow kinetics of nitrate utilization subsequent model analysis showed that chromate removal efficiency can be strengthened by biofilm thickness control and do management a biofilm thickness of 150 μm and an influent do concentration of 0 5 mg o2 l could enhance the performance of the mbfr under the simulated

of cr vi lai et al 2016b long et al 2017 luo et al 2015 lv et al 2019 modin et al 2008 the performance of the mbfr can be affected by operational conditions such as inoculum gas pressure biofilm thickness management strategies and the loading of co existing electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen and nitrate nerenberg et al 2002 tang et al 2010 it is unclear how these conditions interact and affect the removal of chromate moreover answering this question requires tremendous experimental efforts in contrast multispecies biofilm modeling can be a powerful and convenient tool for quantitative analysis and reactor optimization lackner et al 2008 tang et al 2013 therefore the first objective of this study was to develop a multispecies biofilm model to analyze the chromate removal efficiency of the ch4 based mbfr due to the countercurrent diffusion at the biofilm in the mbfr the biofilm thickness profoundly influences the performance of the mbfr therefore the second objective of this study was to understand the effect of dissolved oxygen do which significantly affects the thickness of the biofilm on mbfr performance zhong et al 2017 found that nitrate and chromate interacted with each other in the mbfr with nitrate greatly reducing the rate of chromate reduction nitrate is a common contaminant in wastewater which may affect chromate reduction through the following interactions i the competition between nitrate and chromate for the same resources e g methane ii the competition for space in the biofilm between different kinds of microorganisms iii the promotion of growth of chromate reducing microorganisms through their utilization of nitrate tang et al 2012 the extent to which nitrate influences chromate reduction depends on the loading rates of both nitrate and chromate therefore the third objective of this study was to explore the performance of the ch4 based mbfr under various combinations of chromate and nitrate loading rates 2 model development and evaluation 2 1 model development cr vi and nitrate reduction coupled to methane oxidation has been reported to occur mainly via an indirect pathway in which methane is firstly oxidized by methanotrophs into intermediates which are then utilized by other microorganisms to reduce electron acceptors such as chromate nitrate and oxygen in the model developed by modin et al 2018 aerobic methanotrophs utilized methane and expelled methanol which was used by heterotrophs to reduce oxygen and nitrate long et al 2017 identified methanotrophs denitrifiers and cr vi reducers in a methane and oxygen based mbfr moreover our group lai et al 2016a also found methanotrophs chromate reducers and denitrifiers in the ch4 based mbfr therefore we proposed the following model the model contains 5 solid species and 6 soluble species the solids species are methane oxidizing bacteria xamo heterotrophic bacteria xhb chromate reducing bacteria xcrb inert biomass xib and extracellular polymeric substances xeps the soluble species are methane sch4 methanol sch3oh oxygen so2 chromate scro4 nitrate sno3 substrate utilization associated products suap and biomass associated products sbap specific information is listed in table s1 in the si the critical biological processes considered in the model are displayed in fig 1 in the biofilm ch4 is consumed by the amo by reducing o2 in the inflow the oxidation product methanol then serves as the electron donor for the reduction of chromate by crb and nitrate by crb and hb uap and eps are produced during the growth process of the microorganisms eps is then hydrolyzed to biomass associated products bap while uap and bap serve as electron donors for hb all microorganisms are subject to endogenous respiration in which they are oxidized by corresponding electron acceptors and partially converted to inert biomass laspidou and rittmann 2002 methane diffuses into the biofilm from the hollow fiber membrane wall while other soluble species diffuse into the biofilm from the bulk liquid in contrast the solid products become part of the biofilm the soluble products first diffuse into the pore water in the biofilm then into the bulk liquid and finally leave the system together with the effluent 2 2 model assumptions and simplifications for further biofilm modeling several simplification and assumptions were made 1 the mbfr biofilm model was based on the one dimension biofilm model developed by wanner and reichert 1996 the biofilm was modeled as a continuum with the components changing only in the direction perpendicular to the membrane surface the biomass was described as quantity per volume wanner and gujer 1986 the one dimension biofilm assumption was widely used to predict the overall reactor performance chen and ni 2016 chen et al 2016 sun et al 2017 2 the kinetics of the biological reactions was described using dual substrate monod kinetics the inhibition observed in the experiment was modeled as a noncompetitive form according to activated sludge model henze et al 2000 tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 peng et al 2016 moreover the substrate diffusion was simulated according to fick s law the specific rate of expression and the stoichiometry are listed in tables s2 and s3 1 3 5 in the si 3 the methane flux from the fiber lumen to the biofilm base was depicted as a diffusive process driven by the concentration gradient the flux was described as follows i c h 4 q e x c h 4 s c h 4 1 h c h 4 s c h 4 2 where s c h 4 1 and s c h 4 2 are gas concentrations of methane in the fiber lumen and biofilm membrane interface kg cod m3 q e x c h 4 is the overall mass exchange coefficient of methane m2 day and h c h 4 is henry s coefficient for methane kg cod m 3 gas kg cod m 3 liquid the methane pressure in the lumen is converted to cod concentration by using the ideal gas equation 4 the thickness of the diffusion layer was 100 μm with the biofilm having a porosity of 0 6 and a density of 100000 g cod m3 horn and lackner 2014 5 the contribution of the suspended solids was ignored in the system moreover the ph of the system was maintained at 7 0 7 5 thus the effect of ph was not considered sun et al 2017 the detachment occurred on the biofilm bulk liquid interface the composition of the detached biomass was consistent with that of the biofilm interface no attachment or reattachment occurred in the reactor ni and yuan 2013 ni et al 2013 tang et al 2012 6 the steady state was obtained by controlling the global detachment velocity which is a second order function of the biofilm thickness ni et al 2013 the ch4 based mbfr was modeled using two compartments of the aquasim 2 1g a software designed for the modeling of aquatic systems reichert 1994 the biofilm and bulk liquid were modeled as a biofilm system while the hollow fiber lumen was modeled as a mixed reactor system for laboratory configurations the membrane fiber length was generally less than 35 cm moreover the reactor was in completely mixed condition as it had limited volume and recirculation was used as such the mixed reactor assumption was adequate for modeling ahmed and semmens 1992 martin and nerenberg 2012 the methane flux through hollow fiber membrane wall was modeled by diffusion between the two systems reichert 1998 2 3 model calibration and validation the developed biofilm model consists of 17 microbial processes and 35 kinetic stochiometric parameters the values of the major parameters are adapted from previous studies see si specific parameter values and references are listed in table s4 1 in si the kinetic and stoichiometry parameters maximum growth rates and yield coefficients were calculated using methods previously described by rittmann and mccarty 2002 and summarized in table s4 2 three unavailable parameters k x c r b c r o 4 μ x h b s η c r o 4 were estimated by fitting the experimental data sensitivity analysis results are shown in figs s1 and s2 according to the results the amo related parameters y μ and crb μ kcro4 ycro4 related parameters are the most sensitive both the parameter estimation and model validation were carried out using the aquasim 2 1g software 2 4 experimental data used for evaluating the developed model the experimental data used for model validation was adapted from lai et al 2016a and zhong et al 2017 briefly the mbfr consisted of a 65 ml tube and a 58 cm2 composite hollow fiber membrane the mbfr was operated at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min hrt 130 min and various ch4 pressures five operation conditions were used to explore the chromate removal capacity of the reactor in a similar experiment six other stages were carried out to investigate the effect of nitrate on chromate reduction in a ch4 based mbfr for each stage the mbfr reached a steady state according to the effluent concentrations of cro4 2 and no3 we selected 5 steady effluent stages to calibrate the model specific effluent concentration values are listed in table s5 more details can be found in lai et al 2016a and zhong et al 2017 we used stages 1 2 3 and 5 to calibrate the model and stages 4 and 6 to validate the model 2 5 model based analysis of the microbial community in the biofilm the performance of the mbfr changed significantly following the introduction of nitrate in the system we chose 3 experimental stages 4 5 and 6 to study the microbial distribution in the biofilm moreover the distribution of each species along the vertical direction was simulated using the aquasim 2 0g software then the model output was used to analyze how nitrate affected the distribution of solid species in the biofilm 2 6 the impact of key operational parameters on chromate removal efficiency the validated model was then used to investigate the effect of biofilm thickness and influent do concentration on chromate nitrate removal in the ch4 based mbfr furthermore the effect of loading rates of cro4 2 and no3 were also investigated with the model the simulated mbfr had a reactor volume of 5 l and a membrane surface area of 0 5 m2 the reactor area to volume ratio a v was typical for mbfr systems sun et al 2017 to evaluate the effect of biofilm thickness the mbfr was simulated with a biofilm thickness ranging from 50 to 800 μm to evaluate the effect of influent do concentration the mbfr was simulated with do ranging from 0 to 2 0 mg o2 l to evaluate the effect of nitrate on chromate reduction the mbfr was simulated with various combinations of chromate and nitrate loading rates the specific simulation scenarios are shown in table s6 scenario 1 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of model calibration and validation the experimental data summarized in table s5 were used to carry out parameter estimation and model validation the effluent concentrations and removal fluxes from the experiments and the model were compared in fig 2 a d fig 2a b show the influent and effluent concentrations of chromate and nitrate from the experiments and the model the model results and the experimental results were found to be generally consistent in stages 1 4 the chromate in the influent was almost completely reduced resulting in a high removal efficiency higher than 97 in both the experiments and the model the cr vi removal flux simulated by the model in stages 1 4 was 116 228 370 and 493 mg cr l d respectively these results are also comparable to the experimental results 117 231 367 and 494 mg cr l d respectively however the experimental data show that chromate reduction was strongly inhibited in stage 5 compared to the same chromate loading in stage 4 when 2 2 mg n l 24 mg n l d of nitrate was introduced in the influent the effluent cr vi concentration increased from approximately 0 8 mg l to 3 48 mg l resulting in a decrease in removal efficiency from 98 to less than 10 the cr vi reduction percentage was recovered to 62 8 after the nitrate concentration decreased to 0 66 mg l 7 3 mg l d in stage 6 the model shows very similar results 62 8 of cr vi removal in stage 6 and 11 5 in stage 5 by using previously well established parameters for methanotrophs heterotrophs sun et al 2017 lin et al 2009 and the proposed metabolic pathways chen and ni 2016 tang et al 2013 the model developed in this study satisfactorily predicted the experimental performance 3 2 microbial distribution in the biofilm the experimental studies have shown that high nitrate loading 24 mg n l d strongly inhibited chromate removal zhong et al 2017 to understand how nitrate affected chromate removal in the mbfr we used the validated model to investigate the microbial compositions at stages 4 5 and 6 fig 3 a c show the simulated microbial distribution along the direction perpendicular to the substratum at stage 4 0 mg n l 5 24 mg n l d and 6 7 3 mg n l d respectively fig 3 d f show the overall distribution of biomass in the three stages respectively the model calibrated abundance of microorganisms generally captured the trends of the experimental data as shown in figure s3 1 3 3 as shown in fig 3a and d in the absence of nitrate the biomass was mainly composed of amo 46 and crb 33 sun et al 2017 developed a model for perchlorate reduction in the ch4 based mbfr and found that methanotrophs were more likely situated close to the membrane our model indicated that the amo were almost uniformly distributed across the biofilm this was probably caused by the high efficiency of methane transfer of the membrane and the high methane concentrations across the biofilm when 24 mg n l d of nitrate was added to the influent in stage 5 the steady state microbial composition changed significantly the abundance of hb increased from less than 3 to 51 4 in the steady state making hb the dominant functional group in the biofilm meanwhile the eps decreased from 17 to 12 there might be two explanations for this phenomenon first hb had an advantage over crb due to the hb s ability to utilize nitrate second hb could utilize bap and uap generated by eps hydrolysis laspidou and rittmann 2002 with the increase of hb crb was outcompeted for growth space methanol and possibly reductase enzymes as a result the steady state fraction of crb decreased accordingly the chromate reduction was strongly decreased and the competition for electrons between chromate and nitrate became fiercer as shown in fig 3c and f a lower concentration of nitrate of 0 66 mg l increased the eps percentage from 12 to 33 similarly lai et al 2018 reported that the amount of eps decreased after a higher loading of vanadate 10 mg l in influent since eps didn t act as a straight electron donor for chromate reduction the increase of eps did not contribute to the reduction of chromate liu et al 2017 it can be inferred that the high concentration of nitrate inhibited chromate reduction possibly by promoting the competition for electrons between nitrate and chromate which restricted the electron flow to the chromate moreover low concentrations of nitrate inhibited chromate reduction possibly via the promotion of eps secretion the increase of eps not only intensified the competition for space but also reduced the rate of chromate diffusion into the biofilm 3 3 effect of biofilm thickness and influent do on chromate removal experimental results showed that the mbfr reactor could completely remove up to 44 mg cr l d of chromate when nitrate was not present without testing a higher loading of cr vi the maximum chromate removal capacity of the reactor remained unknown since the biofilm thickness could be managed by flow velocity and shear stress we investigated the reactor performance under various biofilm thicknesses using the developed model fig 4 a shows that the fluxes of cr vi and nitrate were more severely affected when the biofilm thickness ranged between 50 and 100 μm and less affected when the biofilm thickness exceeded 100 μm this can be explained by substrate diffusion and biomass retention when the biofilm was thin less than 100 μm in this case the reduction was limited by the biomass quantity thus the overall reduction capacity increased with the increase in biofilm thickness when the biofilm was thicker more than 150 μm in this case the reduction was restrained at substrate diffusion skowlund 1990 presented a numerical simulation for the biofilm and found that the active biofilm would finally reach a constant value in spite of the increase in biofilm thickness this might also explain why the efficiency of chromate removal did not continue to increase after the biofilm thickness reached 100 μm methane and oxygen were supplied separately from two sides of the biofilm the dual substrates limitation more likely occurred when the methane supply was not sufficient limiting the growth of amo in addition it was less likely that the substrate cr vi from the liquid side would be able to penetrate the biofilm which resulted in waste of the interior biomass fig 4b and c show the simulated biomass distribution for the two biofilm thicknesses 100 μm for b and 500 μm for c the thicker biofilm promoted the growth of amo and inert biomass which outcompeted other microorganisms for space oxygen had dual effects on the reactor efficiency on the one hand o2 is an essential substrate for methane oxidation generating methanol for chromate and nitrate reduction on the other hand oxygen may negatively affect the reactor performance by competing with chromate and nitrate for methanol the common electron donor according to lai et al 2016b methane wasn t a limiting factor for methane oxidation in the experiments as shown in fig 5 a the removal of chromate and nitrate kept increasing along with the increase of influent do fig 5b and c show the simulated biomass distribution at two do concentrations 0 5 mg l for b and 1 mg l for c the higher do promoted the growth of amo and hb substantially similarly crb growth was also slightly promoted by the introduction of oxygen this could be due to higher methanol production due to a higher do although high concentrations of oxygen might compete as an electron acceptor its adverse effects were not apparent in the simulations in the experiments oxygen could only enter the system through the influent i e 0 7 mg o2 l corresponding to a loading rate of 0 504 mg o2 d which could oxidize methane into 0 756 mg cod d of methanol this was far away from meeting the needs for chromate and nitrate reduction in the system following that we calculated the potential oxygen intrusion by using reactor part connectors as described by alrashed et al 2018 the results showed that the total do could reach 3 6 mg o2 d thereby generating 5 1 mg cod d which can meet the demands for the actual chromate and nitrate fluxes in the experiments the calculation step is detailed in the si 3 4 mbfr performance under various combinations of chromate and nitrate loading rates nitrate co exists with chromate in many bodies of water chen and strous 2013 the experimental results suggested that nitrate affected the reduction of chromate in the ch4 based mbfr system conversely chromate was also shown to have some impact on nitrate removal zhong et al 2017 thus the influence of chromate and nitrate loading on chromate reduction in the ch4 based mbfr was simulated using the developed model fig 6 a shows the efficiency of chromate removal under various combinations of nitrate and chromate loading rates the white dotted lines separated the chromate efficiency into three parts under low nitrate loading 0 0 04 mg n m2 d the nitrate had limited inhibition effects on chromate removal efficiency which remained higher than 80 under moderate nitrate loading 0 04 0 10 mg n m2 d the effect of nitrate become stronger and the chromate removal efficiency declined rapidly with the increase in nitrate levels this phenomenon was clearly observed even at a low chromate loading the chromate removal efficiency reached zero in the third part probably due to the fact that the ability of chromate to compete for electrons was further weakened fig 6b shows the efficiency of nitrate removal under various combinations of nitrate and chromate loading rates when chromate was not present in the influent the nitrate removal efficiency was between 70 97 unlike the chromate removal nitrate removal was more likely affected by its own loading under low nitrate loadings 0 0 06 mg n m2 d the nitrate removal efficiency was generally higher than 85 when the nitrate loading increased to more than 0 06 mg n m2 d the nitrate removal efficiency dropped rapidly from 85 to 67 however the introduction of chromate 0 0 30 mg cr m2 d led to little inhibition less than 5 efficiency decrease of nitrate removal generally the chromate removal flux in the ch4 based mbfr was very sensitive to nitrate loading probably because of the advantage of nitrate on the affinity coefficient as such the effect of nitrate should be considered in the reactor design moreover a cro4 2 no3 ratio may be used as an index for reactor design similarly to the no2 nh4 ration for designing the mbfr carrying out denitrification coupled to anaerobic methane oxidation chen et al 2016 3 5 practical implication excessive chromate in bodies of water can pose potential risks both to the environment and public health as chromate and nitrate often co occur in wastewater and the standards for nitrate are usually a few magnitudes higher than those for chromate knowledge about alleviating the effect of nitrate on chromate removal is of practical importance removal of chromate from water based on the ch4 based mbfr has been demonstrated by previous experiments this study systematically investigated the effect of nitrate on chromate removal it is expected that the developed model and the simulated results could be a reference for the reactor design further evaluation of the model using a wider range of operation conditions is needed some mechanical factors such as fluid dynamics and shear stress should also be taken into account when the model is applied in pilot or bigger scale tests 4 conclusion in this study we developed a biofilm model for chromate and nitrate reduction in the ch4 based mbfr the model simulated results fitted the experimental data satisfactorily the model was then used to analyze the effect of nitrate on chromate removal in mbfr the model analysis revealed that nitrate exacerbated the competition among amos hbs and chromate reducers moreover hbs were promoted while amo and chromate reducers crb were outcompeted with 2 2 mg l no3 n in the influent water the fraction of hb increased from less than 3 to 23 85 however the fraction of amo and crb decreased from 46 and 33 to less than 15 and 5 respectively the decrease of chromate reducers in our system is mainly due to their slow kinetics of nitrate utilization subsequent model analysis showed that chromate removal efficiency can be strengthened by biofilm thickness control and do management a biofilm thickness of 150 μm and an influent do concentration of 0 5 mg o2 l could enhance the performance of the mbfr under the simulated

20007,eutrophication and the resulting formation of harmful algal blooms hab causes huge economic and environmental damages phosphorus p from sewage effluent and agricultural run off has been identified as a major cause for eutrophication phosphorous concentrations greater than 100 μg p l are usually considered high enough to cause eutrophication the strictest regulations however aim to restrict the concentration below 10 μg p l orthophosphate or phosphate is the bioavailable form of phosphorus adsorption is often suggested as technology to reduce phosphate to concentrations less than 100 and even 10 μg p l with the advantages of a low footprint minimal waste generation and the option to recover the phosphate although many studies report on phosphate adsorption there is insufficient information regarding parameters that are necessary to evaluate its application on a large scale this review discusses the main parameters that affect the economics of phosphate adsorption and highlights the research gaps a scenario and sensitivity analysis shows the importance of adsorbent regeneration and reuse the cost of phosphate adsorption using reusable porous metal oxide is in the range of 100 to 200 kg p for reducing the phosphate to ultra low concentrations future research needs to focus on adsorption capacity at low phosphate concentrations regeneration and reuse of both the adsorbent and the regeneration liquid graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphate adsorption economic analysis eutrophication ultra low concentration regeneration 1 introduction 1 1 need to achieve very low concentrations of phosphorous eutrophication is the process wherein water bodies receive excessive supply of nutrients in its most excessive form this leads to formation of harmful algal blooms habs anderson et al 2002 smith et al 1999 this has been recognized as a global concern for several decades nixon 1995 and has led to huge economic and environmental damages dodds et al 2009 hoagland et al 2002 pretty et al 2003 smith et al 1999 apart from posing health risks for humans and other organisms in the ecosystem eutrophication causes economic losses by affecting industries such as fishing water treatment housing recreation and tourism ingrid chorus 2000 pretty et al 2003 usepa 2015 wu 1999 the annual damage costs due to freshwater eutrophication was estimated to be between 105 to 160 million in england and wales pretty et al 2003 the overall annual costs incurred as a result of eutrophication in us freshwaters was estimated at 2 2 billion dodds et al 2009 a loss of 6 5 billion was estimated in the lake tai catchment area in china due to algal bloom le et al 2010 the degradation of water quality due to eutrophication has been acknowledged to cause economic impacts in many countries worldwide oecd 2012 the reduction of phosphorous p concentrations in the water bodies has been a dominant theme to combat freshwater eutrophication l correll 1998 schindler et al 2016 orthophosphate o p also called soluble reactive phosphorous srp is the only form of p that can be assimilated by autotrophs and the microbes present in the water correll 1999 but factors such as varying redox conditions mineralization of organic matter and an equilibration with dissolved p can cause release of o p from the settled as well as suspended particulates boström et al 1988 froelich philip 1988 hupfer and lewandowski 2008 this has led to total phosphorous tp which includes dissolved and particulate p to be used as an assessment for controlling eutrophication there is no clear consensus yet on the concentration of tp that is acceptable for preventing eutrophication although most studies consider a concentration above 100 μg p l to be too high vollenweider ra 1980 dodds et al 1998 richardson et al 2007 lurling and oosterhout 2013 carvalho et al 2013 the united states environmental protection agency suggested a mean tp concentration of 10 μg p l in its nutrient criteria guidelines for lakes and reservoirs usepa 2000 this value has often been promoted as the lowest concentration of tp to be reached to keep clear of eutrophication this value is however well above the analytical limit of detection for measuring p concentrations in solutions and hence can be monitored patey et al 2008 sewage effluent and agricultural run offs are chief sources for p loading in surface waters white and hammond 2009 hendriks and langeveld 2017 management of p from diffuse sources like agricultural run off includes practices that monitor fertilizer usage livestock numbers and p input from manure knowlton et al 2004 sharpley 2016 regulation of non point diffuse sources can nonetheless be difficult since they arise due to activities distributed over wide areas and are more variable over time due to changes in weather carpenter et al 1998 point sources of p like sewage effluent are easier to monitor and regulate dodds and whiles 2010 moreover p loads from sewage effluent have been shown to have a higher fraction of srp bioavailable p compared to nonpoint sources gerdes and kunst 1998 maccoux et al 2016 given the risk of p pollution from sewage effluent regulations regarding the p discharge limits are getting stricter the national pollution discharge elimination system npdes regulates the discharge of pollutants from point sources in the united states the npdes permit limitation for p has already been stringent in different municipalities with required values often ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mg p l usepa 2007 in the european union the standard for quality of water bodies is set by the water framework directive wfd and an effluent value of 0 15 mg p l is sometimes taken to be in line with the wfd p m j janssen 2006 it must be noted that these effluent values serve rather as a guideline because the total p load discharged into the environment will not only depend on the effluent concentration but also on the size of the receiving water body the current effluent regulations of individual eu member states need to meet either 1 or 2 mg p l depending on the population equivalence with the more stringent value for facilities with higher population equivalence and sensitive areas jan oleszkiewicz 2015 european commission 2017 china has municipal domestic wastewater discharge limits ranging from 0 5 to 1 mg p l li et al 2012 liu 2005 on the other hand brazil does not have discharge standards for phosphorous in every state and the noted effluent concentrations from domestic sewage are generally higher than 4 mg p l sperling 2016 this shows there is discrepancy between the allowed effluent p discharge levels between different countries but the rising concern over eutrophication could pose stricter values of 0 1 mg p l or lower for wwtp effluents in the future ashekuzzaman and jiang 2017 canadianwaternetwork 2018 1 2 technologies to achieve ultra low p concentrations the terms ultra low level advanced removal of p have often been used to denote achieving very low p concentrations but they do not refer to an established value yet and can imply p concentrations lower than those achieved by conventional treatment methods such terms usually refer to a concentration range between 0 01 and 0 15 mg p l bolton and menk 2016 genz et al 2004 langer et al 2017 usepa 2007 whalley 2013 p removal techniques can broadly be classified as physical chemical and biological physical methods include separation of the p based on size exclusion and include sand filtration or membrane filtration erickson et al 2007 leo et al 2011 wathugala et al 1987 yildiz 2004 chemical methods that have been used for p removal include precipitation flocculation or adsorption clark et al 1997 drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 langer et al 2017 laridi et al 2005 precipitation involves the usage of metal salts to react with dissolved p to result in insoluble precipitates sedlak 1991 flocculation uses metals or organic polymers to destabilize colloidal particles and to result in aggregates jiang and graham 1998 ngo and guo 2009 adsorption is the removal of dissolved p via a surface reaction on a solid material called the adsorbent loganathan et al 2014 biological methods involve p uptake assimilation by plants microorganisms this involves using halophytes in wetlands polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao for enhanced biological p removal ebpr and the use of microalgae boelee et al 2011 buhmann and papenbrock 2013 oehmen et al 2007 the use of a single method is often ineffective to reach ultra low p concentrations and several studies use a combination of these methods to achieve the desired p concentration bolton and menk 2016 kim et al 2008 mitchell and ullman 2016 p m j janssen 2006 for instance conventional treatments in wwtp s include chemical precipitation with metal salts and can generally achieve p levels between 0 5 and 1 mg p l in the effluent depending on the salt dosage clark et al 1997 sedlak 1991 reducing the p concentrations further by increasing the salt dosing can lead to significant increase in sludge production sedlak 1991 but a study using a combination of chemical precipitation along with a series of sand filtration and ultra filtration units was able to achieve tp values of less than 0 015 mg p l mitchell and ullman 2016 another study used a reactive filter where iron salts were dosed along with sands to form a hydrous iron oxide coated sand newcombe et al 2008 the soluble p was removed by co precipitation with iron or adsorption onto the iron coated sand whereas particulate p was removed by a moving bed sand filter an average effluent concentration of 0 011 mg p l was observed phoslock is a lanthanum modified bentonite that removes srp by forming lanthanum phosphate precipitates lürling et al 2014 even though phoslock has been used for p remediation in lakes a high solid dosage of 200 1 phoslock p weight ratio has been shown necessary to bring down concentrations to less than 0 01 mg p l reitzel et al 2013 moreover the presence of humic substances can release the lanthanum from phoslock which would cause ecotoxicity issues in the surface water herrmann et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 the use of ebpr can lead to effluent p concentrations lower than 0 5 mg p l depending on the extent of readily biodegradable organics present gu et al 2008 a pilot study used a combination of ebpr with membrane bioreactor to reach average effluent values of 0 3 mg p l smith et al 2014 it has been suggested that ebpr can reduce effluent tp concentrations to 0 1 0 2 mg p l under ideal conditions blackall et al 2002 ebpr is however sensitive to several factors like the extent of organics dosing of metal salts nitrate ammonium and heavy metal content that can inhibit the process zheng et al 2014 this makes the ideal conditions rather narrow microalgae based biofilm reactors have been used to reach p concentrations less than 0 15 mg p l boelee et al 2011 sukačová et al 2015 the optimal performance of microalgae however depended on parameters like the nutrient loading and illumination condition immobilized thermophilic bacteria grown in a photobioreactor decreased phosphate concentrations from 0 75 mg p l to 0 05 mg p l sawayama et al 1998 but they required a residence time of 12 h which caused secondary organic pollution due to excretion of organic compounds from the cyanobacterial cells wetlands offer another way of removing p by using a combination of different processes plants and microbes can uptake p whereas some fractions of p can also bind to minerals buhmann and papenbrock 2013 lüderitz and gerlach 2002 vohla et al 2011 the use of submerged aquatic based vegetation wetlands was shown to reduce mean inflow tp concentration of 107 μg p l to as low as 23 μg p l dierberg et al 2002 a limitation of wetlands though is the need for very high areas and hence they can be land intensive r kadlec 1996 although constructed wetlands can be considered as an alternative solution their natural capacity to remove p is limited and chemically enriched media have been suggested for improving p binding arias 2005 in such a case adsorption will be the dominant mechanism thus even though certain technologies or combinations can achieve very low p concentrations each has its own limits based on the above observations this could be a high dependence on physicochemical conditions the need for membranes which can potentially lead to fouling issues production of chemical precipitates which might not be recoverable requirement for large areas hence there is a need for technology that can reduce p consistently to ultra low levels with less reliance on having ideal conditions a high throughput without fouling issues with a low footprint minimum waste generation and where the p is recoverable 1 3 adsorption as a polishing technology adsorption is a technology that has often been reported for achieving very low concentrations of o p several studies in literature report on consistently reaching o p concentrations less than 0 1 mg p l and even lower than 0 01 mg p l awual et al 2014 genz et al 2004 luo et al 2016 midorikawa et al 2008 sengupta and pandit 2011 zhu and jyo 2005 one of the limitations of adsorption is its ability to only remove dissolved p this usually implies o p henceforth referred to as phosphate however studies also show the removal of organic phosphates like phosphonates using adsorption boels et al 2012 kumar et al 2010 rott et al 2018 pretreatment by advanced oxidation processes can also be an option to convert organic forms of p into phosphate which can then be targeted by adsorption mayer et al 2013 the limitation of removing only soluble p can further be overcome by combining adsorption with another step that can target particulate p for instance with flocculation and filtration langer et al 2017 apart from removing soluble p to very low concentrations adsorption also offers the possibility to recover the p by regeneration of the adsorbent drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 kalaitzidou et al 2016b kuzawa et al 2006 fitzpatrick et al 2009 this contributes to a circular economy despite several existing literature sources showcasing the potential of adsorption to reach low p concentrations there is little information regarding their implementation at larger scales a major reason could be that the process is not economical yet or there is a lack of understanding regarding the parameters affecting the economics the objective of the following sections is hence to highlight what are the main parameters that affect the economics of phosphate adsorption the existing research gaps for understanding these parameters and to give a sensitivity analysis of how these parameters affect the cost moreover the need for adsorbent regeneration is also considered by making a scenario analysis this analysis includes low cost adsorbents that cannot be regenerated along with more expensive adsorbents that can be regenerated several times although this review primarily focuses on effluent polishing from sewage municipal wastewater the findings can be equally relevant for reducing phosphate concentrations in any aqueous stream for e g adsorption can have applications in surface water remediation treating membrane feed water for biofouling prevention vrouwenvelder et al 2010 2 factors governing the chemical costs of phosphate adsorption the chemical costs of phosphate adsorption are governed by three important parameters namely the adsorbent cost the practical loading and the costs during regeneration seen in fig 1 the following sections will discuss the research gaps for these parameters 2 1 adsorbent cost a wide variety of phosphate adsorbents have been synthesized or studied regularly these range from using waste materials or byproducts like food residue or slag to using engineered adsorbents based on for instance metal organic frameworks or layered nanosheets abbas 2015 fang et al 2015 sellner et al 2017 xie et al 2017 it is important to note that both waste materials and engineered adsorbents can have inorganic for e g metal oxides as well as organic components for e g biomass or organic backbone therefore the classification of adsorbents as waste byproducts or engineered adsorbents would be reflected more by their source and cost however information on the cost of these adsorbents is seldom provided and is often difficult to deduce without providing an estimate on the adsorbent cost it is not possible to have an economic evaluation of these adsorbents a way to classify the adsorbents into different cost categories would be to consider the number of steps chemicals required to produce modify the adsorbent for example despite no information on costs being provided adsorbents are reported as low cost due to the usage of waste materials or byproducts with or without further modification mezenner and bensmaili 2009 xue et al 2009 yuan et al 2015 zeng et al 2004 in a similar way composite adsorbents having active sites immobilized impregnated on a backbone involve more chemicals steps to produce or modify the adsorbent hence these approaches can be associated with more expensive adsorbents fang et al 2017b ge et al 2016 huang et al 2015 synthesized adsorbents comprising chiefly of metal oxides with no additional backbones can be considered in the intermediate cost category and include granular iron oxide based adsorbents genz et al 2004 kunaschk et al 2015 based on the above rationale we classified adsorbents into 3 cost categories i low cost these include waste biomass and cost significantly lower than 1 per kg ii intermediate cost these include granular porous metal oxides which generally cost between 3 to 6 per kg based on the information provided for the granular ferric hydroxide geh and ferrosorp iii high cost these include hybrid ion exchange resins like biophree which cost between 15 to 20 per kg classifying adsorbents into these different categories helps in cost analysis with respect to different scenarios as will be discussed later studies reporting synthesis of novel adsorbents must estimate the cost regarding chemicals consumed which would indicate which of these 3 cost categories it will be closer to 2 2 practical loading adsorption capacity denotes the removal capacity of an adsorbent and is expressed as the amount of phosphate that can be removed per mass of adsorbent even though it is the most studied property of adsorbents it is also the property that is most variable phosphate adsorption capacity is a function of the adsorbent properties like the surface area surface charge surface functionality as well as the physicochemical properties of the solution like phosphate concentration temperature ph presence of other ions molecules mia et al 2017 weng et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 since different studies are conducted under varying conditions it makes it very difficult to compare the adsorption capacities between different adsorbents to simply state adsorption capacity could be confusing and misleading since it can imply the maximum adsorption capacity or the adsorption capacity at equilibrium the term practical loading is used here to denote the phosphate adsorption capacity that will be realized in practice for a given set of conditions for instance this term can be used to differentiate the adsorption capacity realized at short contact times from the adsorption capacity under equilibrium conditions or at different phosphate concentrations 2 2 1 affinity phosphate adsorption capacity varies as a function of the equilibrium phosphate concentration and this relationship is given by an adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm is a very valuable characterization because modelling it allows to estimate the adsorption capacity at different concentrations foo and hameed 2010 langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are most commonly used for describing adsorption the langmuir adsorption model is based on the assumption of chemisorption which is often the case with phosphate adsorption onto metal hydr oxides moreover the langmuir model allows the comparison of maximum adsorption capacity with adsorption capacity at specific phosphate concentrations for instance the langmuir equation is given by the following expression langmuir 1918 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e where qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity and kl is the langmuir isotherm constant foo and hameed 2010 in the context of effluent polishing it is desirable to have a high equilibrium adsorption capacity qe even at lower equilibrium phosphate concentrations ce this property is referred to as the affinity of the adsorbent tran et al 2017 volesky 2007 this depends both on the maximum adsorption capacity as well as the langmuir isotherm constant suresh kumar et al 2017 however studies usually focus only on the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent such capacities are often observed at equilibrium concentrations much greater than 10 mg p l which are rather unrealistic when applying in the context of effluent polishing fig 2 uses data of langmuir modelling from adsorption studies over the past 5 years references in table s1 in supporting information and predicts the qe at an equilibrium concentration of 0 1 mg p l denoted as q0 1 example shown in supporting information the ratio between qmax and q0 1 is shown to point out the wide range of discrepancy between the maximum adsorption capacity and the adsorption capacity that will be achieved at lower phosphate concentrations the ratio of qmax q0 1 shows that the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity can decrease even by a factor of more than 100 times at equilibrium concentrations of 0 1 mg p l fig 2 also shows there is no correlation with the qmax value this suggests that for the application of effluent polishing the maximum adsorption capacity is irrelevant instead it is more important to consider the affinity for instance expressed as the constant kl in the langmuir equation when developing phosphate adsorbents for this application the affinity of adsorbents varies with the type of metal oxides lanthanum based adsorbents often show high affinity towards phosphate wang et al 2016 wu et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 this is attributed to lanthanum s hard lewis acidic property which promotes its lewis acid base interaction with phosphate iron oxides also show good affinity towards phosphate although the adsorption properties vary between the different types of iron oxides cornell 2004 mc et al 1981 parfitt et al 1975 a study comparing different iron oxides found that ferrihydrite had a higher maximum adsorption capacity per unit area than hematite and goethite wang et al 2013 however goethite had a much higher value for the affinity constant and this amounted to a higher adsorption capacity at lower phosphate concentrations this is in line with another study that reports similar trends with ferrihydrite and goethite borggaard et al 2005 this reiterates the need to focus on the adsorption capacity at the relevant concentrations rather than the maximum adsorption capacity 2 2 2 kinetics the phosphate adsorption capacities estimated from adsorption isotherms are based on equilibrium conditions however the time taken to reach equilibrium can range from some minutes to several days with some adsorbents even taking a timescale of weeks he et al 2017 j torrent 1992 wan et al 2016 the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic model is a commonly used model that has been used in a wide range of adsorbent studies ho and mckay 1999 it is given by the following expression q t k q e 2 t 1 k q e t where qt is the adsorption capacity mg p g at time t k is the rate constant of adsorption g mg min qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium the value of value of k and qe can be estimated by modelling the adsorption kinetic data this in turn allows to calculate the time taken for qt to reach a given fraction of the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe fig 3 shows the time taken to reach 90 t90 of equilibrium adsorption capacity based on the pseudo second order model for adsorption studies over the past 5 years references to the data points shown in table s2 of supporting information the value of t90 is considered because most of these experiments are also only done for this duration likely due to the fact that experimentally any change in adsorption is very slow after this time this can also be understood from the mathematical expression of the pseudo second order model that it takes 11 times longer to reach 99 of equilibrium adsorption capacity t99 as compared to t90 example shown in supporting information even if t90 is considered as the indicator of adsorption kinetics fig 3 shows that in several cases it is in the timescale of several hours to days from a practical point of view time is money and hence an adsorbent with superior kinetics is highly preferable especially when run in a column mode the contact times measured as empty bed contact time or space velocity are usually in the order of several minutes to less than an hour kalaitzidou et al 2016a midorikawa et al 2008 yamashita et al 2013 porous adsorbents offer a high surface area in combination with a particle size big enough to avoid pressure drop problems while using them in column mode for instance granular activated carbon provides a very high surface area in excess of 1000 m2 g and has been used for coating with iron oxide nanoparticles to enhance phosphate adsorption zach maor et al 2011b however a majority of its surface area comes from micropores pore width 2 nm and phosphate adsorption in such adsorbents via pore diffusion takes place in the order of several days suresh kumar et al 2017 zach maor et al 2011b on the other hand 96 of phosphate removal was achieved within 30 min in a macroporous pore size 50 nm adsorbent yang et al 2012 in a study comparing phosphate adsorption onto different porous metal oxides it was determined that pores bigger than 10 nm are required to enhance phosphate adsorption kinetics suresh kumar et al 2019 this shows the need to characterize the pore structure of the adsorbents along with their surface area to ensure good phosphate adsorption kinetics 2 2 3 selectivity the ability of an adsorbent to remove phosphate preferentially amidst the competing ions is called its selectivity the adsorbent selectivity depends on the type of interaction formed by the competing ion with the adsorbent surface in general ions like chloride nitrate show little or no competition whereas ions like arsenate and silicate show high competition ge et al 2016 lǚ et al 2013 xie et al 2014a zhang et al 2016 arsenate phosphate and silicate are all tetrahedral ions that form innersphere complexes with metal hydr oxides like iron oxides parfitt 1979 su and puls 2001 tuutijärvi et al 2012 nitrate and chloride form outersphere complexes which are weaker interactions parfitt 1979 sulphate and carbonate on the other hand vary in competing effects although carbonate often has a higher competing effect ge et al 2016 he et al 2017 rashid et al 2017 xie et al 2014a sulphate can exist as both inner or outersphere complexes on metal oxide surfaces wijnja and schulthess 2000 carbonate can bind via electrostatic attraction but can also form calcium carbonate surface precipitates chitrakar et al 2006 kunaschk et al 2015 dissolved organic matter like humic acids and fulvic acids can also compete with phosphate adsorption via direct competition with the active sites as well as steric hindrance fu et al 2013 antelo et al 2007 weng et al 2012 apart from ions and molecules that directly compete for active sites certain cations like calcium and magnesium can also influence phosphate adsorption the binding of these ions can enhance phosphate adsorption by making the surface more electropositive or by forming intermediate ternary complexes antelo et al 2015 han et al 2017 lin et al 2017 talebi atouei et al 2016 thus depending on the type of ions present in the water matrix the adsorption of phosphate can get enhanced or reduced suresh kumar et al 2018 adsorbent selectivity is often tested in the presence of separate competing ions with varying concentrations antelo et al 2007 gu et al 2018 sengupta and pandit 2011 but in realistic conditions several competing ions will exist together and can interact to form different complexes or precipitates to test the selectivity it is hence ideal to have conditions that are representative of realistic solutions alternatively surface complex models can be used to predict interaction of different components on the adsorbent surface rietra et al 2001 2 2 4 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on an adsorbent s performance is governed by its thermodynamic properties an endothermic process will lead to improved adsorption at higher temperatures while an exothermic process will lead vice versa huang et al 2014 jung et al 2017 the extent of effect of temperature also varies with adsorbents phosphate adsorption on an adsorbent formed by thermal decomposition of alunite and potassium chloride mixture was found to be endothermic akar et al 2010 but the maximum adsorption capacity only increased by 5 when the temperature increased from 20 to 40 c on the other hand a magnesium ferrite biochar composite which also had an endothermic adsorption showed a 66 increase in maximum adsorption capacity when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c jung et al 2017 similar variations also exist between adsorbents showcasing exothermic property huang et al 2014 qian et al 2017 although some of these studies use temperatures higher than normally encountered in realistic applications these are used as an example to showcase the possible differences in thermodynamic properties of these adsorbents it is also important to consider the effect of temperature on adsorption kinetics this is especially relevant for performance in continuous modes where contact times are short kinetic constants for different adsorbents mostly increased with an increasing temperature table s3 in supporting information this could be due to improved phosphate diffusion at higher temperatures indicating practical loading will decrease at lower temperatures for such adsorbents 2 2 5 effect of ph phosphate has pka values of 2 15 7 2 and 12 33 and depending on the solution ph it can thus exist in the form of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 or po4 3 xiong et al 2017 phosphate adsorption usually reaches an optimum when the ph favours its electrostatic attraction with the adsorbent this happens when the ph of the solution is less than the adsorbent pzc so that the adsorbent is electropositive and the phosphate is in its anionic form since several adsorbents have their point of zero charge close to neutral ph the phosphate adsorption optimum is often in the acidic range fang et al 2017b he et al 2017 wen et al 2014 while the effect of ph on phosphate adsorption is well documented the effect of competing ions must also be considered for example it was reported that for similar concentrations of humic acid phosphate adsorption on goethite reduced by 45 at ph 4 5 compared to a 25 reduction at ph 7 antelo et al 2007 sibanda h and young s 1986 observed similar effects of higher humic acid adsorption on goethite and gibbsite at lower ph similarly even though phosphate adsorption is enhanced at ph pzc of the adsorbent calcium adsorption happens at ph pzc which would in turn enhance phosphate adsorption antelo et al 2015 observed this while monitoring calcium and phosphate adsorption on ferrihydrite nanoparticles even though phosphate adsorption decreased significantly at higher ph in the absence of calcium increasing the concentrations of calcium increased the phosphate adsorption at the same ph 2 3 cost for regeneration regeneration is the process by which the molecules bound on the loaded adsorbent are released this might include phosphate as well as other competing ions regeneration is done for two reasons i to recover the separated molecule of interest i e phosphate ii to replenish the active sites of the adsorbent so that the adsorbent can be reused the reuse of the adsorbent as well as any excess chemicals from the regeneration makes the overall process economic and environmental friendly the sections below discuss the factors associated with the chemical costs for regeneration 2 3 1 for replenishing adsorbent active sites 2 3 1 1 releasing adsorbed complexes phosphate binds to metal hydr oxides by a ligand exchange mechanism innersphere complex with the surface hydroxyl groups this includes a range of metal oxides that include metals like aluminium iron lanthanum zirconium and sometimes even a mixture of different metal oxides awual et al 2011 fang et al 2017a liu and hesterberg 2011 sibanda h and young s 1986 zhang et al 2009 schneider et al 2017 in such a case desorption of phosphate is done by an alkaline solution like sodium hydroxide naoh since the hydroxide ions acts as a hard lewis base awual et al 2011 from an economic point of view it is important to know how much chemical is consumed for the desorption of phosphate phosphate adsorption as innersphere complex happens as a monodentate or bidentate complex abdala et al 2015 connor and mcquillan 1999 fang et al 2017a this means stoichiometrically only one or two molecules of hydroxide ion should be consumed for desorption of each phosphate molecule however an excess amount of hydroxide ions are required to provide a driving force thus high concentrations of naoh solutions are used for phosphate desorption often ranging from 0 1 to 1 m drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 fang et al 2017b genz et al 2004 sun et al 2014 but the actual amount of hydroxide ions consumed will be less and the excess of the hydroxide ions in the regenerate solution can be reused for instance the naoh solution was replenished and reused for desorption of phosphate for 60 cycles in a pilot study drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 when the adsorbent is used in a water matrix consisting of several competing ions the actual consumption of hydroxide ion during desorption will also depend on the other ions that bind via the same mechanism having a selective adsorbent will decrease the overall consumption of hydroxide ions per mole of phosphate desorbed however having a highly selective adsorbent also implies that it will have a high affinity to phosphate and the binding could be too strong to facilitate easy desorption for example although lanthanum based adsorbents are known for their strong affinity towards phosphate the recovery of phosphate from these adsorbents is not always discussed wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 xie et al 2014c showed that very high concentrations of up to 12 5 m naoh along with temperatures in excess of 100 c are required for optimum desorption of phosphate from lanthanum hydroxide similar requirements of high concentrations of naoh or a combination with thermal steps are reported for desorbing phosphate from other adsorbents based on rare earths like lanthanum and yittrium dong et al 2017 xie et al 2014b kim et al 2017 2 3 1 2 releasing surface precipitates while naoh can be used to release molecules adsorbed on the surface adsorption is not the only interaction that can happen on the adsorbent depending on the adsorbent properties and physicochemical properties of the solution sometimes surface precipitation might also occur surface precipitation leads to formation of multilayered structures three dimensional molecular arrangement as opposed to the monolayer coverage during chemisorption sparks 2003 sposito 1987 in such a case the precipitate can bury the adsorbed phosphate and hence prevent it from getting desorbed li and stanforth 2000 surface precipitation can form either from the dissolution and re precipitation of ions from the adsorbent or due to the binding of competing ions from the solution for instance the dissolution of iron from goethite has been reported to contribute to surface precipitation li and stanforth 2000 kunaschk et al 2015 studied phosphate adsorption from a drinking water matrix where calcium based surface precipitates were reported to block effective desorption of phosphate in such a case an acid treatment with a hcl solution of ph 2 5 was recommended to release the surface precipitates and effectively regenerate the adsorbent similarly calcium carbonate precipitation was observed while using adsorbents in a wastewater matrix and an acidic treatment was required to improve the adsorbent reusability suresh kumar et al 2018 the chemical consumption of acid needs to be monitored in such scenarios 2 3 1 3 neutralization of excess naoh in the adsorbent in the case of porous adsorbents some of the naoh used during desorption will be retained in the pores the removal of such naoh will be necessary prior to a subsequent reuse cycle to allow for efficient adsorption and to prevent unwanted precipitation inside the pores during the next adsorption cycle while the excess naoh can be rinsed by water an acid neutralization step can be used to speed up the process suresh kumar et al 2018 zach maor et al 2011a neutralizing such columns purely with water could result in high consumption of water and result in large amounts of waste stream suresh kumar et al 2018 in case of using an acid neutralization step the acid consumption needs to be considered 2 3 2 for phosphate recovery phosphate concentrated in the regenerate stream naoh can be recovered as a form of calcium phosphate or magnesium ammonium phosphate struvite drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 kalaitzidou et al 2016b kuzawa et al 2006 midorikawa et al 2008 recovery as struvite needs addition of magnesium and ammonium and a ph around 9 was suggested as the optimum ph for obtaining compact structures and maximum yield drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 ye et al 2014 recovery as calcium phosphate only needs the addition of a calcium source and has been suggested as the better choice due to the high ph of the regenerate solution kuzawa et al 2006 the composition of the regenerate stream will affect the consumption of the chemicals used for precipitation of phosphate for example after phosphate adsorption from secondary wastewater effluent the molar ratio of magnesium ammonium phosphate required to form struvite in the regenerate stream was 1 5 1 5 1 drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 this was higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 1 1 1 and was attributed due to competing parallel reactions similarly a molar ratio of ca to p between 2 and 2 5 was required for optimum calcium phosphate formation kuzawa et al 2006 kalaitzidou et al 2016b midorikawa et al 2008 this is higher than the stoichiometric molar ratio of 1 5 and 1 67 required for forming tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite respectively song et al 2002b excess requirement of calcium could be due to the presence of carbonates in the regenerate solution which will lead to the formation of calcium carbonate song et al 2002a a pilot study recovering calcium phosphate from the regenerate found that about 40 of their recovered product consisted of calcium carbonate kalaitzidou et al 2016b this was attributed to co2 adsorption from the atmosphere since the regeneration solution was maintained in an open tank thus the amount of chemicals consumed for phosphate recovery will be dependent on the conditions during regeneration as well as the selectivity of the adsorbent moreover more studies are needed to show the potential for reusing the regenerate solution especially the effect on desorption due to the accumulation of phosphate in the regenerate this will give essential information on when and how often the phosphate needs to be recovered to enable effective reuse of the regenerate solution 2 4 adsorbent lifetime the adsorbent lifetime is increased by reusing it multiple times many studies test the adsorbent reusability between 5 and 10 cycles fang et al 2017b ju et al 2016 jung et al 2017 kim et al 2017 luo et al 2017 wan et al 2016 adsorbent attrition during the adsorption or regeneration process is the common reason for reusability getting affected for example zirconium oxide particles confined in mesoporous carbon showed a drop in adsorption capacity from 17 to 13 mg p g over the first 4 cycles whereas the capacity remained stable over the next 3 cycles ju et al 2016 this was attributed to the leaching of zirconium oxide particles located on the external surface or pore mouth region of the adsorbent composite adsorption capacity of calcined ldh decreased by about 50 over 5 cycles which was attributed to destruction of the layered structure sun et al 2014 the structure or active sites of amino functionalized clay adsorbent composites was considered damaged during regeneration with naoh unuabonah et al 2017 this led to a decrease in adsorption performance over every consecutive adsorption cycle drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 tested nanocomposite magnetic particles in wastewater effluent over 20 adsorption desorption cycles effluent concentrations less than 0 05 mg p l could only be achieved for the first few runs after which the adsorption efficiency decreased this was attributed to a consistent loss of adsorbent particles at a rate of about 5 per cycle furthermore attrition of adsorbent can form very small particles fines which can get released into the effluent if such particles are loaded with phosphate they can be an additional source of pollution incomplete desorption of phosphate has also been found to decrease the reusability for instance kunaschk et al 2015 reasoned that calcium based surface precipitation blocked adsorbed phosphate this would lead to a decrease in available active sites during the next adsorption cycle and thus affect the reusability presence of phosphate into micropores of iron oxides has also been reported to affect desorption cabrera et al 1981 additionally the adsorbent crystallinity or type of metal oxides can change during regeneration which would affect their surface functional groups for instance the crystallinity of goethite was observed to increase after regeneration with naoh and was correlated to a decrease in adsorption capacity after the very first cycle chitrakar et al 2006 in contrast the crystallinity of akaganeite did not change even after 10 cycles and the reusability was also intact suresh kumar et al 2018 monitored the adsorbent characteristics such as change in surface area crystallinity as well mass balance of competing ions for 3 adsorption regeneration cycles in a real wastewater effluent amongst all the other parameters calcium based surface precipitation was shown to have the highest influence on adsorbent reusability however the surface precipitates were not found to affect phosphate desorption but rather affect calcium adsorption which in turn affects phosphate adsorption understanding the mechanism of surface precipitation was suggested as important step to enhance adsorbent reusability there are also studies where the reusability is intact for the studied duration fang et al 2017b wan et al 2016 wu et al 2017 zong et al 2013 this could be related to the stability of the adsorbent but it could also be due to the fact that not enough regeneration cycles were done for instance nanocomposites based on lanthanum hydroxide and iron oxide showed stable adsorption capacities during 5 adsorption cycles wu et al 2017 however the phosphate desorption efficiency varied between 70 and 80 during each regeneration cycle this incomplete desorption could affect the reusability on the long run from a practical viewpoint the adsorbent lifetime needs to be much higher than 5 to 10 reuse times but rather than performing endless regeneration cycles studies should focus on developing a better understanding of the parameters that affect reusability in that way optimal regeneration methods can be developed if with such methods it can be shown that the adsorbent characteristics do not change over a certain number of reuse cycles then the adsorbent lifetime can be extrapolated to longer reuse cycles with more certainty 3 economic analysis for phosphate adsorption the economics of the adsorption process can be divided in the operating costs and the capital costs the operating costs mainly include the chemical costs as well as the costs due to energy consumption the following sections describe the sensitivity and scenario analysis for the chemical costs followed by a brief overview on the energy and capital costs 3 1 scenario and sensitivity analysis for chemical costs the chemical costs are the costs that can be addressed by phosphate adsorption studies a simple schematic of the adsorption process applied in a column mode is shown below fig 4 however the evaluation used for these chemical costs will also apply for a batch mode based on the scheme shown in fig 4 the chemical cost for phosphate adsorption can be expressed as follows c h e m i c a l c o s t o f a d s o r p t i o n m o l e p a b n n 1 where a cost for 1st adsorption cycle mole p b cost per regeneration cycle mole p cycle n number of regeneration cycles the denominator in the formula denotes the total number of cycles and is n 1 since the regeneration begins after the 1st cycle the term a is a function of the adsorbent cost and adsorption capacity it can be expressed as a a 1 a 2 where a1 adsorbent cost kg adsorbent a2 practical loading moles p kg adsorbent the cost per regeneration cycle can be further split as b c d e a 2 where c cost per cycle of desorption kg adsorbent cycle d cost per cycle of acid wash kg adsorbent cycle e cost per cycle of p recovery kg adsorbent cycle table 1 shows the split up of the variables used in calculating cost of each of these steps certain assumptions have been made to arrive at these derivations the following points discuss these assumptions and their limitations the adsorption capacity stays same throughout the n regeneration reuse cycles in reality the adsorption capacity will vary depending on the change in the physicochemical characteristics of the incoming solution as well as the amount of wear and tear the adsorbent undergoes the excess of chemicals used during regeneration can be reused hence only the cost for the chemicals actually consumed per cycle is considered studies show the possibility to reuse the regenerate solution by replenishing only the spent chemicals kalaitzidou et al 2016a kuzawa et al 2006 the phosphate recovery from the regenerate stream allows to reuse the regenerate stream effectively complete desorption of phosphate is achieved using naoh solution this assumption was necessary to relate the oh consumption to the phosphate adsorption capacity complete desorption might not be achieved in the first couple of cycles for porous adsorbents due to phosphate diffusion into inner pores but once such sites are saturated near complete desorption can be expected zach maor et al 2011a moreover the extent of desorption also depends on the affinity of the adsorbent surface precipitation happens primarily via calcium binding this allows to establish a relationship between calcium binding and amount of acid required to remove surface precipitates calcium based surface precipitation has been reported before on phosphate adsorbents kunaschk et al 2015 suresh kumar et al 2018 given its ubiquitous nature in surface and wastewaters it can be the chief component to cause a precipitate however precipitates based on adsorbent dissolution are also possible li and stanforth 2000 the overall formula for calculating the chemical cost can be used to show the importance of reusing the adsorbent several times fig 5 shows the variation in chemical cost as a function of the regeneration cycles the figure is plotted varying parameter n in the equation for chemical cost of adsorption as shown in table 1 to express the chemical cost in percentage the value of term a is taken as 100 and value of term b is varied to give rise to different ratios of b a i e the cost per regeneration cycle as compared to the cost of 1st adsorption cycle the chemical cost is both a function of the number of regeneration cycles as well as the ratio of cost per regeneration cycle to the cost of 1st adsorption cycle for scenarios where the cost per regeneration cycle is at least 5 times cheaper than the cost of 1st adsorption cycle about 80 or more of the reduction in chemical costs is reached by 30 regeneration cycles however the number of regeneration cycles that can be implemented relates to the adsorbent lifetime which in turn depends on the composition of the adsorbent this includes how stable the adsorbent material is to abrasion and structural modification over the adsorption and the regeneration cycles there are several studies which specify low cost phosphate adsorbent alternatives which are natural or modified products of industrial waste or biomass biswas et al 2008 ismail 2012 karthikeyan et al 2004 namasivayam and sangeetha 2004 mortula et al 2007 nawar et al 2015 however most of these adsorbents are either not resistant to the conditions used in regeneration alkaline or acidic ph or are suggested as direct application as fertilizers nguyen et al 2014 to compare how their adsorption costs fare with reversible adsorption i e reusable adsorbents we consider a scenario analysis for 3 different categories of adsorbent waste biomass based adsorbents porous metal oxides hybrid ion exchange resins the main criteria for categorizing this way is based on the adsorbent cost as discussed in section 2 1 but the other important differences to consider include the adsorption capacity and the lifetime of the adsorbents table 2 summarizes these aspects a monte carlo simulation was used to account for the uncertainty in calculating the chemical costs for the 3 categories of adsorbents a lower and upper range was provided for each parameter used in estimating the chemical cost and 10 000 random variables were generated using a uniform distribution the range for the main parameters used for calculating the chemical costs are shown in table 3 values for complete parameters shown in table s4 in supporting information these parameter values will of course depend on the operating conditions and the type of water matrix being treated but at least in the case of porous metal oxides and the ion exchange resin they have been estimated from adsorption in a wastewater effluent matrix suresh kumar et al 2018 hence these provide a more realistic value than phosphate solutions prepared using clean water the main assumption made is the lifetime number of regeneration cycles for porous metal oxides and the hybrid ion exchange resin rice husk was considered as the waste biomass and the adsorbent was considered for a one time use hence for this adsorbent regeneration costs were not considered for porous metal oxide ferrosorp fsp which is a granular iron oxide was used as the example the average lifetime was considered as 30 regeneration cycles since around 80 reduction in chemical costs is achieved by this lifetime in line with explanation provided by fig 5 for the hybrid ion exchange resin biophree which is an ion exchange resin impregnated with iron oxide was used as the example the lifetime of ion exchange resins depends on the process conditions and can vary between 7 and 15 years in our case we considered an average lifetime of 100 regeneration cycles the lower and upper range for the fsp and biophree were thus taken as 10 of 30 and 100 cycles respectively fig 6 shows the box plot for the chemical costs of these 3 categories of adsorbents as estimated by the monte carlo simulation the error bar shows the spread of possible chemical costs as per the range provided for the different parameters it can be seen from fig 6 that despite considering a very low cost for the waste biomass based adsorbents reversible adsorption with porous metal oxides and hybrid ion exchange resins are more cost effective due to their higher adsorption capacity and longer lifetime the median value for the chemical cost was around 100 kg p for both the porous metal oxide and the hybrid ion exchange resin some studies also suggest the use of naturally occurring calcium carbonate minerals like calcite and dolomite for phosphate adsorption karaca et al 2004 karageorgiou et al 2007 sø et al 2011 xu et al 2014 these adsorbents facilitate formation of calcium phosphate products and are suggested for direct application as fertilizers however the solubility of calcium phosphate and its subsequent application as fertilizer depends on the ph of the soil cabeza et al 2011 more information is also needed on the selectivity and practical binding capacity of these adsorbents at very low phosphate concentrations just like in the comparison with biomass engineered adsorbents with higher practical loading and lifetime can be more economical than one time use adsorbents fig 7 shows the sensitivity for different parameters towards the chemical cost for the porous metal oxide fig s2 in supporting info shows a similar graph for the ion exchange resin fig 7 shows that amongst all parameters the adsorbent cost the practical loading and number of regeneration cycles had the most significant effect an increase in practical loading and regeneration cycles reduced the chemical cost non linearly whereas a decrease in adsorbent cost reduced the chemical cost linearly at a higher slope than the other parameters thus optimization of these parameters would be essential for making the process economically feasible the chemical costs calculated here are for an effluent concentration of 0 1 mg p l for an effluent concentration of 0 01 mg p l these costs will be higher depending on how the adsorption capacity decreases corresponding to that concentration if an adsorbent has a high affinity this decrease in adsorption capacity will be minimal for the example for the porous metal oxide used the practical loading at an effluent concentration of 0 016 mg p l capacity was 60 of the loading observed at 0 1 mg p l assuming all other parameters to be constant the change in chemical cost can be deduced from the sensitivity analysis as shown in fig 7 in this case the chemical cost increased only by 50 even though the effluent concentration was reduced by a factor 6 moreover the practical loadings used in this analysis are based on a relatively short empty bed contact time ebct of 5 min depending on the adsorption kinetics increasing the ebct can significantly increase the practical loading this will hence lower the chemical costs 3 2 energy and capital costs energy consumption costs will vary based on the mode of operation stirred tank batch systems will consume energy primarily due to the stirring whereas fixed bed column studies will consume energy primarily due to pumping similarly adsorbents with magnetic properties would need a magnetic separator to facilitate their recovery drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 for the current scenario the energy and capital costs are based on fixed bed continuous mode of operation the regeneration would be simpler for the fixed adsorbent bed compared to a stirred tank reactor where the adsorbent needs to be first recovered after the adsorption process a continuous mode can also lead to a more efficient use of the adsorption capacity because the adsorbent is always exposed to the same influent concentration rather than the decreasing concentrations in batch mode loganathan et al 2014 the energy cost in terms of p removed can be given by the following formula e n e r g y c o s t k g p f g q c i n c o u t 10 3 where f hourly power consumption kwh h g electricity cost kwh q volumetric flow rate m3 h cin phosphate concentration at inlet mg p l cout phosphate concentration at outlet mg p l the power consumption is related to the pressure drop over the adsorbent column as follows f q δp 36 η where δp pressure drop bar η pump efficiency the pressure drop can be calculated by the ergun equation supporting information the capital costs will chiefly include the cost of the adsorbent column s the regeneration tanks one for desorption with alkaline solution and other for acid washing and a crystallizer for recovering the desorbed phosphate as calcium phosphate the process can use two adsorbent columns in series so that when one is getting regenerated the other adsorbent column can still be in operation an assumption is that any fouling of the adsorber bed will be cleaned during the regeneration process for instance inorganic fouling such as surface precipitation will be removed during acid wash suresh kumar 2017 phosphate limitation will control bioufouling vrouwenvelder et al 2010 but any biofouling formed will also be cleaned during the alkaline desorption step due to the high ph goode et al 2013 thus no separate operational or capital costs are considered for handling fouling of the adsorber bed a simplified way to estimate the capital cost would be to assume that the equipment will operate effectively for a fixed lifetime in which case the capital cost in terms of p will be c a p i t a l c o s t k g p h i q c i n c o u t 10 3 where h total investment cost i lifetime of equipment h it is difficult to establish the capital costs since the cost of equipment will vary with scale and the specific costs will usually reduce at bigger scales due to economy of scale in this case the costs were based on pilot scale experiments at a scale of 1 5 m3 h fig s1 and table s5 in supporting information show however these were scaled up to determine the costs for treating at a full scale flowrate of 500 m3 h this was done by using the scaling coefficient which relates the capacity increase in this case denoted by the increase in volumetric flowrate to the increase in equipment cost tribe and alpine 1986 a scaling coefficient value of 0 6 was used in this case which is in line with common practice tribe and alpine 1986 moreover to consider the installation charges the lang factor was considered in the calculation wain 2014 since adsorption is used for treating liquids a lang factor of 4 8 was used and multiplied with the full scale equipment cost wain 2014 thus the total investment cost denoted by the term h includes the installation cost as well the calculated value for the total investment cost for a capacity of handling 500 m3 h amounted to 970 000 considering the equipment has a lifetime of 10 years an influent concentration cin of 1 mg p l and the desired effluent concentration cout of 0 1 mg p l the capital cost expressed in terms of p amounts to about 25 kg p the energy cost for these conditions parameters used are listed in table s6 of supporting information amounts to about 10 kg p thus the overall cost including capital energy and chemical costs for reducing phosphate from 1 to 0 1 mg p l using reversible adsorption on porous iron oxides is about 120 kg p fig 8 shows the distribution of the different costs as can be seen from fig 8 chemical costs which includes the cost of the adsorbent contributed to more than 70 of the overall costs a similar cost distribution was obtained for the hybrid ion exchange resins although the percentage of chemical costs was slightly higher fig s3 in supporting information once the process is in operation the process does not require much manual maintenance except in the case of checking for the breakthrough once the effluent p concentration exceeds the required level and regenerating the adsorbent thus the labor costs for the process should ideally be minimal the other costs that are not considered in this calculation include the cost for waste generation one time use biomass based adsorbents can ideally be used directly as fertilizers provided they did not bind toxic materials like heavy metals and there is indeed a fertilizer value for reusable adsorbents although the excess chemicals in the regenerate stream are assumed to be completely reused there could be accumulation of other ions in this stream the accumulation of other ions depends on the adsorbent selectivity and could happen both in streams used for alkaline desorption as well as acid wash in that case occasionally a part of the regenerate stream would need to be bled this stream might need to be neutralized and further treated before being discarded studies are needed on understanding the composition of the regenerate stream after multiple reuse additionally even if highly selective engineered adsorbents are designed some of these adsorbents contain elements which can cause toxicity issues if released into the environment table s1 in supporting information hence it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the chemical leakage from such adsorbents before they can be applied 3 3 comparison with other technologies and defining the ideal conditions for adsorption the ideal conditions for adsorption can be underlined by comparison with chemical precipitation chemical precipitation with iron salts is a commonly used technique to lower the phosphate concentrations in municipal wastewater sedlak 1991 iron salts can be added near or slightly higher than stoichiometric fe p molar ratios to reduce phosphate concentrations to around 1 mg p l in practice a fe p molar ratio between 1 and 2 is generally used in wastewater plants to achieve phosphate concentrations around 1 mg p l paul et al 2001 but reducing the phosphate concentrations below 1 mg p l using chemical precipitation requires significant increase in metal salt dosing due to the limitation by solubility product which in turn leads to high sludge production as well as due to the formation of metal hydroxides neethling 2013 sedlak 1991 fig 9 a shows the relation between required fe p molar ratio and the residual phosphate concentration based on data from a wastewater plant sedlak 1991 at residual phosphate concentration around 1 mg p l the ratio is near the stoichiometric region and the majority of the p removal is via precipitation however as the residual phosphate concentration decreases the required ratio goes very high in this zone phosphate removal is mainly due to adsorption onto iron hydr oxide complexes sedlak 1991 to quantify the effects of this in terms of cost fig 9 b shows a comparison of p removal costs via reversible adsorption and chemical precipitation with iron at 3 different concentrations 10 to 1 mg p l 1 to 0 1 mg p l and 1 to 0 016 mg p l a lowest concentration of 0 016 mg p l was chosen since this allows us to use the adsorption capacity for porous iron oxides estimated at this concentration suresh kumar 2018 6 this does not include the capital costs but the chemical costs for adsorption and the chemical as well as disposal costs due to sludge formation via chemical precipitation for chemical precipitation with iron a fe p molar ratio of 2 20 and 100 are assumed for the concentration ranges of 10 to 1 1 to 0 1 and 1 to 0 016 mg p l table s7 in supporting information shows parameters used for the calculation the chemical cost for chemical precipitation to bring phosphate concentration from 10 to 1 mg p l was around 8 kg p this is in the same order of magnitude as estimated elsewhere paul et al 2001 for adsorption the chemical costs were calculated for porous metal oxide assuming that it is reused successfully for 30 cycles even if the equilibrium adsorption capacity for this adsorbent fsp at 1 mg p l is considered as the practical loading value suresh kumar et al 2019 the cost to reduce phosphate concentrations from 10 to 1 mg p l is around 35 kg p however as the phosphate concentration goes lower the costs for adsorption compete and eventually better those of precipitation see fig 9 b this shows that adsorption is better suited for treating lower concentrations of phosphate the overall costs for reversible adsorption estimated in this review was compared with the costs of other technologies that achieve ultra low p concentrations 0 15 mg p l the technologies compared here are as follows i reversible adsorption rad this includes the estimates made in this review for overall costs to reduce phosphate from 1 to 0 1 mg p l denoted rad 0 1 and from 1 to 0 016 mg p l denoted rad 0 016 using porous metal oxide ii acti flo in this approach soluble phosphorus is first removed by dosing iron salts the resulting flocs are ballasted with microsand in the presence of a polymer after providing sufficient time in a mixing tank the water is passed onto a clarifier which removes the microsand along with flocs bolton and menk 2016 an effluent concentration of 0 17 mg p l could be achieved by treatment using acti flo iii phoslock phoslock is a lanthanum modified bentonite that removes srp by forming lanthanum phosphate precipitates cost estimation for phoslock was based on the price of phoslock 2750 ton mackay et al 2014 and on an average adsorption capacity of 9 mg p g to reduce p concentrations to 0 05 mg p l in surface water reitzel et al 2013 this however does not include costs that might be incurred for dosing iv microalgae cost for p removal by microalgae was based on the p uptake by microalgae and reported cost for microalgae production in netherlands boelee 2013 de vree 2016 the estimated cost is to reduce p concentrations upto 0 15 mg p l fig 10 shows the cost comparison for p removal by these different methods this includes the operational as well as capital costs wherever provided as can be seen from fig 10 rad 0 1 along with acti flo provide the least expensive options there are other types of technologies like acti flo which include precipitation with metal salts aided by separation with sand newcombe et al 2008 stowa 2009 the metal salts dosed result in soluble phosphorus removal by precipitation as well as by forming metal hydr oxide complexes which adsorb the phosphorus newcombe et al 2008 however as discussed earlier in reference to fig 9 p removal to concentrations lower than 0 1 mg p l would require rather high dosing of these metal salts alternatively the use of adsorption will be more suited for reducing phosphate to even lower concentrations as can be seen from fig 10 the cost of using reversible adsorption to reach a concentration of 0 1 mg p l is about 120 kg p but a further reduction to a concentration 6 times lower i e 0 016 mg p l increases the overall cost only by a factor 1 6 i e about 190 kg p this is rather due to the high affinity of adsorbents which will imply a high adsorption capacity at lower p concentrations thus reversible adsorption has the potential to give better economics compared to other methods when it is required to reduce the p concentrations further lower there is no consensus currently in literature as to a decisive cost for preventing eutrophication however a report on restoring the grand lake st mary in ohio estimated the loss due to excess p loading to 102 million based on the amount of excess p loaded annually in this lake the loss was estimated as 708 lb p grand lake st marys restoration commission 2011 thus the cost of phosphate adsorption would be an economically viable option as per this estimate however a concrete assessment needs to be done by stakeholders and responsible organizations to establish a widely acceptable value to prevent eutrophication 4 conclusion p removal to ultra low concentrations is necessary to prevent eutrophication adsorption studies show a possibility to consistently reach such low concentrations of phosphate however despite an increasing interest in scientific literature a wide spread implementation of adsorption on commercial scale has not yet taken place this may indicate that there are still important economic aspects that are not yet being addressed by the scientific community therefore this study performed an economic analysis for different types of adsorbents a monte carlo simulation based scenario analysis showed that reusable adsorbents are more cost effective than one time use low cost adsorbents sensitivity analysis also showed that the most important parameters that govern chemical costs of adsorption are the adsorbent cost practical loading and the adsorbent reusability an expensive adsorbent can still be part of a cost effective process provided it has a high lifetime for e g the cost of adsorption by hybrid ion exchange resins is comparable with that of porous metal oxides even though the adsorbent cost was 3 5 times higher for the resins this was possible due to the assumption that the hybrid ion exchange resins could be reused about 100 times compared to the 30 times by the porous metal oxides literature review also showed the research gaps involved in determining the parameters that govern the economics fig 11 shows the key findings as well as future research potential in this direction for instance studies from the past 5 years show a big discrepancy between the adsorption capacity at 0 1 mg p l q0 1 and the maximum adsorption capacity qmax since adsorption is considered as a polishing step it is necessary to have a high q0 1 practical loading is also governed by the adsorbent kinetics adsorption studies in general need to be done in realistic conditions since competing ions can either increase or decrease the adsorbent performance studies should focus on understanding the factors affecting adsorbent reusability so that a better estimation can be made regarding the adsorbent lifetime additionally reusing the regenerate solution also needs more

20007,eutrophication and the resulting formation of harmful algal blooms hab causes huge economic and environmental damages phosphorus p from sewage effluent and agricultural run off has been identified as a major cause for eutrophication phosphorous concentrations greater than 100 μg p l are usually considered high enough to cause eutrophication the strictest regulations however aim to restrict the concentration below 10 μg p l orthophosphate or phosphate is the bioavailable form of phosphorus adsorption is often suggested as technology to reduce phosphate to concentrations less than 100 and even 10 μg p l with the advantages of a low footprint minimal waste generation and the option to recover the phosphate although many studies report on phosphate adsorption there is insufficient information regarding parameters that are necessary to evaluate its application on a large scale this review discusses the main parameters that affect the economics of phosphate adsorption and highlights the research gaps a scenario and sensitivity analysis shows the importance of adsorbent regeneration and reuse the cost of phosphate adsorption using reusable porous metal oxide is in the range of 100 to 200 kg p for reducing the phosphate to ultra low concentrations future research needs to focus on adsorption capacity at low phosphate concentrations regeneration and reuse of both the adsorbent and the regeneration liquid graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphate adsorption economic analysis eutrophication ultra low concentration regeneration 1 introduction 1 1 need to achieve very low concentrations of phosphorous eutrophication is the process wherein water bodies receive excessive supply of nutrients in its most excessive form this leads to formation of harmful algal blooms habs anderson et al 2002 smith et al 1999 this has been recognized as a global concern for several decades nixon 1995 and has led to huge economic and environmental damages dodds et al 2009 hoagland et al 2002 pretty et al 2003 smith et al 1999 apart from posing health risks for humans and other organisms in the ecosystem eutrophication causes economic losses by affecting industries such as fishing water treatment housing recreation and tourism ingrid chorus 2000 pretty et al 2003 usepa 2015 wu 1999 the annual damage costs due to freshwater eutrophication was estimated to be between 105 to 160 million in england and wales pretty et al 2003 the overall annual costs incurred as a result of eutrophication in us freshwaters was estimated at 2 2 billion dodds et al 2009 a loss of 6 5 billion was estimated in the lake tai catchment area in china due to algal bloom le et al 2010 the degradation of water quality due to eutrophication has been acknowledged to cause economic impacts in many countries worldwide oecd 2012 the reduction of phosphorous p concentrations in the water bodies has been a dominant theme to combat freshwater eutrophication l correll 1998 schindler et al 2016 orthophosphate o p also called soluble reactive phosphorous srp is the only form of p that can be assimilated by autotrophs and the microbes present in the water correll 1999 but factors such as varying redox conditions mineralization of organic matter and an equilibration with dissolved p can cause release of o p from the settled as well as suspended particulates boström et al 1988 froelich philip 1988 hupfer and lewandowski 2008 this has led to total phosphorous tp which includes dissolved and particulate p to be used as an assessment for controlling eutrophication there is no clear consensus yet on the concentration of tp that is acceptable for preventing eutrophication although most studies consider a concentration above 100 μg p l to be too high vollenweider ra 1980 dodds et al 1998 richardson et al 2007 lurling and oosterhout 2013 carvalho et al 2013 the united states environmental protection agency suggested a mean tp concentration of 10 μg p l in its nutrient criteria guidelines for lakes and reservoirs usepa 2000 this value has often been promoted as the lowest concentration of tp to be reached to keep clear of eutrophication this value is however well above the analytical limit of detection for measuring p concentrations in solutions and hence can be monitored patey et al 2008 sewage effluent and agricultural run offs are chief sources for p loading in surface waters white and hammond 2009 hendriks and langeveld 2017 management of p from diffuse sources like agricultural run off includes practices that monitor fertilizer usage livestock numbers and p input from manure knowlton et al 2004 sharpley 2016 regulation of non point diffuse sources can nonetheless be difficult since they arise due to activities distributed over wide areas and are more variable over time due to changes in weather carpenter et al 1998 point sources of p like sewage effluent are easier to monitor and regulate dodds and whiles 2010 moreover p loads from sewage effluent have been shown to have a higher fraction of srp bioavailable p compared to nonpoint sources gerdes and kunst 1998 maccoux et al 2016 given the risk of p pollution from sewage effluent regulations regarding the p discharge limits are getting stricter the national pollution discharge elimination system npdes regulates the discharge of pollutants from point sources in the united states the npdes permit limitation for p has already been stringent in different municipalities with required values often ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mg p l usepa 2007 in the european union the standard for quality of water bodies is set by the water framework directive wfd and an effluent value of 0 15 mg p l is sometimes taken to be in line with the wfd p m j janssen 2006 it must be noted that these effluent values serve rather as a guideline because the total p load discharged into the environment will not only depend on the effluent concentration but also on the size of the receiving water body the current effluent regulations of individual eu member states need to meet either 1 or 2 mg p l depending on the population equivalence with the more stringent value for facilities with higher population equivalence and sensitive areas jan oleszkiewicz 2015 european commission 2017 china has municipal domestic wastewater discharge limits ranging from 0 5 to 1 mg p l li et al 2012 liu 2005 on the other hand brazil does not have discharge standards for phosphorous in every state and the noted effluent concentrations from domestic sewage are generally higher than 4 mg p l sperling 2016 this shows there is discrepancy between the allowed effluent p discharge levels between different countries but the rising concern over eutrophication could pose stricter values of 0 1 mg p l or lower for wwtp effluents in the future ashekuzzaman and jiang 2017 canadianwaternetwork 2018 1 2 technologies to achieve ultra low p concentrations the terms ultra low level advanced removal of p have often been used to denote achieving very low p concentrations but they do not refer to an established value yet and can imply p concentrations lower than those achieved by conventional treatment methods such terms usually refer to a concentration range between 0 01 and 0 15 mg p l bolton and menk 2016 genz et al 2004 langer et al 2017 usepa 2007 whalley 2013 p removal techniques can broadly be classified as physical chemical and biological physical methods include separation of the p based on size exclusion and include sand filtration or membrane filtration erickson et al 2007 leo et al 2011 wathugala et al 1987 yildiz 2004 chemical methods that have been used for p removal include precipitation flocculation or adsorption clark et al 1997 drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 langer et al 2017 laridi et al 2005 precipitation involves the usage of metal salts to react with dissolved p to result in insoluble precipitates sedlak 1991 flocculation uses metals or organic polymers to destabilize colloidal particles and to result in aggregates jiang and graham 1998 ngo and guo 2009 adsorption is the removal of dissolved p via a surface reaction on a solid material called the adsorbent loganathan et al 2014 biological methods involve p uptake assimilation by plants microorganisms this involves using halophytes in wetlands polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao for enhanced biological p removal ebpr and the use of microalgae boelee et al 2011 buhmann and papenbrock 2013 oehmen et al 2007 the use of a single method is often ineffective to reach ultra low p concentrations and several studies use a combination of these methods to achieve the desired p concentration bolton and menk 2016 kim et al 2008 mitchell and ullman 2016 p m j janssen 2006 for instance conventional treatments in wwtp s include chemical precipitation with metal salts and can generally achieve p levels between 0 5 and 1 mg p l in the effluent depending on the salt dosage clark et al 1997 sedlak 1991 reducing the p concentrations further by increasing the salt dosing can lead to significant increase in sludge production sedlak 1991 but a study using a combination of chemical precipitation along with a series of sand filtration and ultra filtration units was able to achieve tp values of less than 0 015 mg p l mitchell and ullman 2016 another study used a reactive filter where iron salts were dosed along with sands to form a hydrous iron oxide coated sand newcombe et al 2008 the soluble p was removed by co precipitation with iron or adsorption onto the iron coated sand whereas particulate p was removed by a moving bed sand filter an average effluent concentration of 0 011 mg p l was observed phoslock is a lanthanum modified bentonite that removes srp by forming lanthanum phosphate precipitates lürling et al 2014 even though phoslock has been used for p remediation in lakes a high solid dosage of 200 1 phoslock p weight ratio has been shown necessary to bring down concentrations to less than 0 01 mg p l reitzel et al 2013 moreover the presence of humic substances can release the lanthanum from phoslock which would cause ecotoxicity issues in the surface water herrmann et al 2016 lürling et al 2014 the use of ebpr can lead to effluent p concentrations lower than 0 5 mg p l depending on the extent of readily biodegradable organics present gu et al 2008 a pilot study used a combination of ebpr with membrane bioreactor to reach average effluent values of 0 3 mg p l smith et al 2014 it has been suggested that ebpr can reduce effluent tp concentrations to 0 1 0 2 mg p l under ideal conditions blackall et al 2002 ebpr is however sensitive to several factors like the extent of organics dosing of metal salts nitrate ammonium and heavy metal content that can inhibit the process zheng et al 2014 this makes the ideal conditions rather narrow microalgae based biofilm reactors have been used to reach p concentrations less than 0 15 mg p l boelee et al 2011 sukačová et al 2015 the optimal performance of microalgae however depended on parameters like the nutrient loading and illumination condition immobilized thermophilic bacteria grown in a photobioreactor decreased phosphate concentrations from 0 75 mg p l to 0 05 mg p l sawayama et al 1998 but they required a residence time of 12 h which caused secondary organic pollution due to excretion of organic compounds from the cyanobacterial cells wetlands offer another way of removing p by using a combination of different processes plants and microbes can uptake p whereas some fractions of p can also bind to minerals buhmann and papenbrock 2013 lüderitz and gerlach 2002 vohla et al 2011 the use of submerged aquatic based vegetation wetlands was shown to reduce mean inflow tp concentration of 107 μg p l to as low as 23 μg p l dierberg et al 2002 a limitation of wetlands though is the need for very high areas and hence they can be land intensive r kadlec 1996 although constructed wetlands can be considered as an alternative solution their natural capacity to remove p is limited and chemically enriched media have been suggested for improving p binding arias 2005 in such a case adsorption will be the dominant mechanism thus even though certain technologies or combinations can achieve very low p concentrations each has its own limits based on the above observations this could be a high dependence on physicochemical conditions the need for membranes which can potentially lead to fouling issues production of chemical precipitates which might not be recoverable requirement for large areas hence there is a need for technology that can reduce p consistently to ultra low levels with less reliance on having ideal conditions a high throughput without fouling issues with a low footprint minimum waste generation and where the p is recoverable 1 3 adsorption as a polishing technology adsorption is a technology that has often been reported for achieving very low concentrations of o p several studies in literature report on consistently reaching o p concentrations less than 0 1 mg p l and even lower than 0 01 mg p l awual et al 2014 genz et al 2004 luo et al 2016 midorikawa et al 2008 sengupta and pandit 2011 zhu and jyo 2005 one of the limitations of adsorption is its ability to only remove dissolved p this usually implies o p henceforth referred to as phosphate however studies also show the removal of organic phosphates like phosphonates using adsorption boels et al 2012 kumar et al 2010 rott et al 2018 pretreatment by advanced oxidation processes can also be an option to convert organic forms of p into phosphate which can then be targeted by adsorption mayer et al 2013 the limitation of removing only soluble p can further be overcome by combining adsorption with another step that can target particulate p for instance with flocculation and filtration langer et al 2017 apart from removing soluble p to very low concentrations adsorption also offers the possibility to recover the p by regeneration of the adsorbent drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 kalaitzidou et al 2016b kuzawa et al 2006 fitzpatrick et al 2009 this contributes to a circular economy despite several existing literature sources showcasing the potential of adsorption to reach low p concentrations there is little information regarding their implementation at larger scales a major reason could be that the process is not economical yet or there is a lack of understanding regarding the parameters affecting the economics the objective of the following sections is hence to highlight what are the main parameters that affect the economics of phosphate adsorption the existing research gaps for understanding these parameters and to give a sensitivity analysis of how these parameters affect the cost moreover the need for adsorbent regeneration is also considered by making a scenario analysis this analysis includes low cost adsorbents that cannot be regenerated along with more expensive adsorbents that can be regenerated several times although this review primarily focuses on effluent polishing from sewage municipal wastewater the findings can be equally relevant for reducing phosphate concentrations in any aqueous stream for e g adsorption can have applications in surface water remediation treating membrane feed water for biofouling prevention vrouwenvelder et al 2010 2 factors governing the chemical costs of phosphate adsorption the chemical costs of phosphate adsorption are governed by three important parameters namely the adsorbent cost the practical loading and the costs during regeneration seen in fig 1 the following sections will discuss the research gaps for these parameters 2 1 adsorbent cost a wide variety of phosphate adsorbents have been synthesized or studied regularly these range from using waste materials or byproducts like food residue or slag to using engineered adsorbents based on for instance metal organic frameworks or layered nanosheets abbas 2015 fang et al 2015 sellner et al 2017 xie et al 2017 it is important to note that both waste materials and engineered adsorbents can have inorganic for e g metal oxides as well as organic components for e g biomass or organic backbone therefore the classification of adsorbents as waste byproducts or engineered adsorbents would be reflected more by their source and cost however information on the cost of these adsorbents is seldom provided and is often difficult to deduce without providing an estimate on the adsorbent cost it is not possible to have an economic evaluation of these adsorbents a way to classify the adsorbents into different cost categories would be to consider the number of steps chemicals required to produce modify the adsorbent for example despite no information on costs being provided adsorbents are reported as low cost due to the usage of waste materials or byproducts with or without further modification mezenner and bensmaili 2009 xue et al 2009 yuan et al 2015 zeng et al 2004 in a similar way composite adsorbents having active sites immobilized impregnated on a backbone involve more chemicals steps to produce or modify the adsorbent hence these approaches can be associated with more expensive adsorbents fang et al 2017b ge et al 2016 huang et al 2015 synthesized adsorbents comprising chiefly of metal oxides with no additional backbones can be considered in the intermediate cost category and include granular iron oxide based adsorbents genz et al 2004 kunaschk et al 2015 based on the above rationale we classified adsorbents into 3 cost categories i low cost these include waste biomass and cost significantly lower than 1 per kg ii intermediate cost these include granular porous metal oxides which generally cost between 3 to 6 per kg based on the information provided for the granular ferric hydroxide geh and ferrosorp iii high cost these include hybrid ion exchange resins like biophree which cost between 15 to 20 per kg classifying adsorbents into these different categories helps in cost analysis with respect to different scenarios as will be discussed later studies reporting synthesis of novel adsorbents must estimate the cost regarding chemicals consumed which would indicate which of these 3 cost categories it will be closer to 2 2 practical loading adsorption capacity denotes the removal capacity of an adsorbent and is expressed as the amount of phosphate that can be removed per mass of adsorbent even though it is the most studied property of adsorbents it is also the property that is most variable phosphate adsorption capacity is a function of the adsorbent properties like the surface area surface charge surface functionality as well as the physicochemical properties of the solution like phosphate concentration temperature ph presence of other ions molecules mia et al 2017 weng et al 2012 zhu et al 2013 since different studies are conducted under varying conditions it makes it very difficult to compare the adsorption capacities between different adsorbents to simply state adsorption capacity could be confusing and misleading since it can imply the maximum adsorption capacity or the adsorption capacity at equilibrium the term practical loading is used here to denote the phosphate adsorption capacity that will be realized in practice for a given set of conditions for instance this term can be used to differentiate the adsorption capacity realized at short contact times from the adsorption capacity under equilibrium conditions or at different phosphate concentrations 2 2 1 affinity phosphate adsorption capacity varies as a function of the equilibrium phosphate concentration and this relationship is given by an adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm is a very valuable characterization because modelling it allows to estimate the adsorption capacity at different concentrations foo and hameed 2010 langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are most commonly used for describing adsorption the langmuir adsorption model is based on the assumption of chemisorption which is often the case with phosphate adsorption onto metal hydr oxides moreover the langmuir model allows the comparison of maximum adsorption capacity with adsorption capacity at specific phosphate concentrations for instance the langmuir equation is given by the following expression langmuir 1918 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e where qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity and kl is the langmuir isotherm constant foo and hameed 2010 in the context of effluent polishing it is desirable to have a high equilibrium adsorption capacity qe even at lower equilibrium phosphate concentrations ce this property is referred to as the affinity of the adsorbent tran et al 2017 volesky 2007 this depends both on the maximum adsorption capacity as well as the langmuir isotherm constant suresh kumar et al 2017 however studies usually focus only on the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent such capacities are often observed at equilibrium concentrations much greater than 10 mg p l which are rather unrealistic when applying in the context of effluent polishing fig 2 uses data of langmuir modelling from adsorption studies over the past 5 years references in table s1 in supporting information and predicts the qe at an equilibrium concentration of 0 1 mg p l denoted as q0 1 example shown in supporting information the ratio between qmax and q0 1 is shown to point out the wide range of discrepancy between the maximum adsorption capacity and the adsorption capacity that will be achieved at lower phosphate concentrations the ratio of qmax q0 1 shows that the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity can decrease even by a factor of more than 100 times at equilibrium concentrations of 0 1 mg p l fig 2 also shows there is no correlation with the qmax value this suggests that for the application of effluent polishing the maximum adsorption capacity is irrelevant instead it is more important to consider the affinity for instance expressed as the constant kl in the langmuir equation when developing phosphate adsorbents for this application the affinity of adsorbents varies with the type of metal oxides lanthanum based adsorbents often show high affinity towards phosphate wang et al 2016 wu et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 this is attributed to lanthanum s hard lewis acidic property which promotes its lewis acid base interaction with phosphate iron oxides also show good affinity towards phosphate although the adsorption properties vary between the different types of iron oxides cornell 2004 mc et al 1981 parfitt et al 1975 a study comparing different iron oxides found that ferrihydrite had a higher maximum adsorption capacity per unit area than hematite and goethite wang et al 2013 however goethite had a much higher value for the affinity constant and this amounted to a higher adsorption capacity at lower phosphate concentrations this is in line with another study that reports similar trends with ferrihydrite and goethite borggaard et al 2005 this reiterates the need to focus on the adsorption capacity at the relevant concentrations rather than the maximum adsorption capacity 2 2 2 kinetics the phosphate adsorption capacities estimated from adsorption isotherms are based on equilibrium conditions however the time taken to reach equilibrium can range from some minutes to several days with some adsorbents even taking a timescale of weeks he et al 2017 j torrent 1992 wan et al 2016 the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic model is a commonly used model that has been used in a wide range of adsorbent studies ho and mckay 1999 it is given by the following expression q t k q e 2 t 1 k q e t where qt is the adsorption capacity mg p g at time t k is the rate constant of adsorption g mg min qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium the value of value of k and qe can be estimated by modelling the adsorption kinetic data this in turn allows to calculate the time taken for qt to reach a given fraction of the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe fig 3 shows the time taken to reach 90 t90 of equilibrium adsorption capacity based on the pseudo second order model for adsorption studies over the past 5 years references to the data points shown in table s2 of supporting information the value of t90 is considered because most of these experiments are also only done for this duration likely due to the fact that experimentally any change in adsorption is very slow after this time this can also be understood from the mathematical expression of the pseudo second order model that it takes 11 times longer to reach 99 of equilibrium adsorption capacity t99 as compared to t90 example shown in supporting information even if t90 is considered as the indicator of adsorption kinetics fig 3 shows that in several cases it is in the timescale of several hours to days from a practical point of view time is money and hence an adsorbent with superior kinetics is highly preferable especially when run in a column mode the contact times measured as empty bed contact time or space velocity are usually in the order of several minutes to less than an hour kalaitzidou et al 2016a midorikawa et al 2008 yamashita et al 2013 porous adsorbents offer a high surface area in combination with a particle size big enough to avoid pressure drop problems while using them in column mode for instance granular activated carbon provides a very high surface area in excess of 1000 m2 g and has been used for coating with iron oxide nanoparticles to enhance phosphate adsorption zach maor et al 2011b however a majority of its surface area comes from micropores pore width 2 nm and phosphate adsorption in such adsorbents via pore diffusion takes place in the order of several days suresh kumar et al 2017 zach maor et al 2011b on the other hand 96 of phosphate removal was achieved within 30 min in a macroporous pore size 50 nm adsorbent yang et al 2012 in a study comparing phosphate adsorption onto different porous metal oxides it was determined that pores bigger than 10 nm are required to enhance phosphate adsorption kinetics suresh kumar et al 2019 this shows the need to characterize the pore structure of the adsorbents along with their surface area to ensure good phosphate adsorption kinetics 2 2 3 selectivity the ability of an adsorbent to remove phosphate preferentially amidst the competing ions is called its selectivity the adsorbent selectivity depends on the type of interaction formed by the competing ion with the adsorbent surface in general ions like chloride nitrate show little or no competition whereas ions like arsenate and silicate show high competition ge et al 2016 lǚ et al 2013 xie et al 2014a zhang et al 2016 arsenate phosphate and silicate are all tetrahedral ions that form innersphere complexes with metal hydr oxides like iron oxides parfitt 1979 su and puls 2001 tuutijärvi et al 2012 nitrate and chloride form outersphere complexes which are weaker interactions parfitt 1979 sulphate and carbonate on the other hand vary in competing effects although carbonate often has a higher competing effect ge et al 2016 he et al 2017 rashid et al 2017 xie et al 2014a sulphate can exist as both inner or outersphere complexes on metal oxide surfaces wijnja and schulthess 2000 carbonate can bind via electrostatic attraction but can also form calcium carbonate surface precipitates chitrakar et al 2006 kunaschk et al 2015 dissolved organic matter like humic acids and fulvic acids can also compete with phosphate adsorption via direct competition with the active sites as well as steric hindrance fu et al 2013 antelo et al 2007 weng et al 2012 apart from ions and molecules that directly compete for active sites certain cations like calcium and magnesium can also influence phosphate adsorption the binding of these ions can enhance phosphate adsorption by making the surface more electropositive or by forming intermediate ternary complexes antelo et al 2015 han et al 2017 lin et al 2017 talebi atouei et al 2016 thus depending on the type of ions present in the water matrix the adsorption of phosphate can get enhanced or reduced suresh kumar et al 2018 adsorbent selectivity is often tested in the presence of separate competing ions with varying concentrations antelo et al 2007 gu et al 2018 sengupta and pandit 2011 but in realistic conditions several competing ions will exist together and can interact to form different complexes or precipitates to test the selectivity it is hence ideal to have conditions that are representative of realistic solutions alternatively surface complex models can be used to predict interaction of different components on the adsorbent surface rietra et al 2001 2 2 4 effect of temperature the effect of temperature on an adsorbent s performance is governed by its thermodynamic properties an endothermic process will lead to improved adsorption at higher temperatures while an exothermic process will lead vice versa huang et al 2014 jung et al 2017 the extent of effect of temperature also varies with adsorbents phosphate adsorption on an adsorbent formed by thermal decomposition of alunite and potassium chloride mixture was found to be endothermic akar et al 2010 but the maximum adsorption capacity only increased by 5 when the temperature increased from 20 to 40 c on the other hand a magnesium ferrite biochar composite which also had an endothermic adsorption showed a 66 increase in maximum adsorption capacity when the temperature increased from 15 to 35 c jung et al 2017 similar variations also exist between adsorbents showcasing exothermic property huang et al 2014 qian et al 2017 although some of these studies use temperatures higher than normally encountered in realistic applications these are used as an example to showcase the possible differences in thermodynamic properties of these adsorbents it is also important to consider the effect of temperature on adsorption kinetics this is especially relevant for performance in continuous modes where contact times are short kinetic constants for different adsorbents mostly increased with an increasing temperature table s3 in supporting information this could be due to improved phosphate diffusion at higher temperatures indicating practical loading will decrease at lower temperatures for such adsorbents 2 2 5 effect of ph phosphate has pka values of 2 15 7 2 and 12 33 and depending on the solution ph it can thus exist in the form of h3po4 h2po4 hpo4 2 or po4 3 xiong et al 2017 phosphate adsorption usually reaches an optimum when the ph favours its electrostatic attraction with the adsorbent this happens when the ph of the solution is less than the adsorbent pzc so that the adsorbent is electropositive and the phosphate is in its anionic form since several adsorbents have their point of zero charge close to neutral ph the phosphate adsorption optimum is often in the acidic range fang et al 2017b he et al 2017 wen et al 2014 while the effect of ph on phosphate adsorption is well documented the effect of competing ions must also be considered for example it was reported that for similar concentrations of humic acid phosphate adsorption on goethite reduced by 45 at ph 4 5 compared to a 25 reduction at ph 7 antelo et al 2007 sibanda h and young s 1986 observed similar effects of higher humic acid adsorption on goethite and gibbsite at lower ph similarly even though phosphate adsorption is enhanced at ph pzc of the adsorbent calcium adsorption happens at ph pzc which would in turn enhance phosphate adsorption antelo et al 2015 observed this while monitoring calcium and phosphate adsorption on ferrihydrite nanoparticles even though phosphate adsorption decreased significantly at higher ph in the absence of calcium increasing the concentrations of calcium increased the phosphate adsorption at the same ph 2 3 cost for regeneration regeneration is the process by which the molecules bound on the loaded adsorbent are released this might include phosphate as well as other competing ions regeneration is done for two reasons i to recover the separated molecule of interest i e phosphate ii to replenish the active sites of the adsorbent so that the adsorbent can be reused the reuse of the adsorbent as well as any excess chemicals from the regeneration makes the overall process economic and environmental friendly the sections below discuss the factors associated with the chemical costs for regeneration 2 3 1 for replenishing adsorbent active sites 2 3 1 1 releasing adsorbed complexes phosphate binds to metal hydr oxides by a ligand exchange mechanism innersphere complex with the surface hydroxyl groups this includes a range of metal oxides that include metals like aluminium iron lanthanum zirconium and sometimes even a mixture of different metal oxides awual et al 2011 fang et al 2017a liu and hesterberg 2011 sibanda h and young s 1986 zhang et al 2009 schneider et al 2017 in such a case desorption of phosphate is done by an alkaline solution like sodium hydroxide naoh since the hydroxide ions acts as a hard lewis base awual et al 2011 from an economic point of view it is important to know how much chemical is consumed for the desorption of phosphate phosphate adsorption as innersphere complex happens as a monodentate or bidentate complex abdala et al 2015 connor and mcquillan 1999 fang et al 2017a this means stoichiometrically only one or two molecules of hydroxide ion should be consumed for desorption of each phosphate molecule however an excess amount of hydroxide ions are required to provide a driving force thus high concentrations of naoh solutions are used for phosphate desorption often ranging from 0 1 to 1 m drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 fang et al 2017b genz et al 2004 sun et al 2014 but the actual amount of hydroxide ions consumed will be less and the excess of the hydroxide ions in the regenerate solution can be reused for instance the naoh solution was replenished and reused for desorption of phosphate for 60 cycles in a pilot study drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 when the adsorbent is used in a water matrix consisting of several competing ions the actual consumption of hydroxide ion during desorption will also depend on the other ions that bind via the same mechanism having a selective adsorbent will decrease the overall consumption of hydroxide ions per mole of phosphate desorbed however having a highly selective adsorbent also implies that it will have a high affinity to phosphate and the binding could be too strong to facilitate easy desorption for example although lanthanum based adsorbents are known for their strong affinity towards phosphate the recovery of phosphate from these adsorbents is not always discussed wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 xie et al 2014c showed that very high concentrations of up to 12 5 m naoh along with temperatures in excess of 100 c are required for optimum desorption of phosphate from lanthanum hydroxide similar requirements of high concentrations of naoh or a combination with thermal steps are reported for desorbing phosphate from other adsorbents based on rare earths like lanthanum and yittrium dong et al 2017 xie et al 2014b kim et al 2017 2 3 1 2 releasing surface precipitates while naoh can be used to release molecules adsorbed on the surface adsorption is not the only interaction that can happen on the adsorbent depending on the adsorbent properties and physicochemical properties of the solution sometimes surface precipitation might also occur surface precipitation leads to formation of multilayered structures three dimensional molecular arrangement as opposed to the monolayer coverage during chemisorption sparks 2003 sposito 1987 in such a case the precipitate can bury the adsorbed phosphate and hence prevent it from getting desorbed li and stanforth 2000 surface precipitation can form either from the dissolution and re precipitation of ions from the adsorbent or due to the binding of competing ions from the solution for instance the dissolution of iron from goethite has been reported to contribute to surface precipitation li and stanforth 2000 kunaschk et al 2015 studied phosphate adsorption from a drinking water matrix where calcium based surface precipitates were reported to block effective desorption of phosphate in such a case an acid treatment with a hcl solution of ph 2 5 was recommended to release the surface precipitates and effectively regenerate the adsorbent similarly calcium carbonate precipitation was observed while using adsorbents in a wastewater matrix and an acidic treatment was required to improve the adsorbent reusability suresh kumar et al 2018 the chemical consumption of acid needs to be monitored in such scenarios 2 3 1 3 neutralization of excess naoh in the adsorbent in the case of porous adsorbents some of the naoh used during desorption will be retained in the pores the removal of such naoh will be necessary prior to a subsequent reuse cycle to allow for efficient adsorption and to prevent unwanted precipitation inside the pores during the next adsorption cycle while the excess naoh can be rinsed by water an acid neutralization step can be used to speed up the process suresh kumar et al 2018 zach maor et al 2011a neutralizing such columns purely with water could result in high consumption of water and result in large amounts of waste stream suresh kumar et al 2018 in case of using an acid neutralization step the acid consumption needs to be considered 2 3 2 for phosphate recovery phosphate concentrated in the regenerate stream naoh can be recovered as a form of calcium phosphate or magnesium ammonium phosphate struvite drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 kalaitzidou et al 2016b kuzawa et al 2006 midorikawa et al 2008 recovery as struvite needs addition of magnesium and ammonium and a ph around 9 was suggested as the optimum ph for obtaining compact structures and maximum yield drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 ye et al 2014 recovery as calcium phosphate only needs the addition of a calcium source and has been suggested as the better choice due to the high ph of the regenerate solution kuzawa et al 2006 the composition of the regenerate stream will affect the consumption of the chemicals used for precipitation of phosphate for example after phosphate adsorption from secondary wastewater effluent the molar ratio of magnesium ammonium phosphate required to form struvite in the regenerate stream was 1 5 1 5 1 drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 this was higher than the stoichiometric ratio of 1 1 1 and was attributed due to competing parallel reactions similarly a molar ratio of ca to p between 2 and 2 5 was required for optimum calcium phosphate formation kuzawa et al 2006 kalaitzidou et al 2016b midorikawa et al 2008 this is higher than the stoichiometric molar ratio of 1 5 and 1 67 required for forming tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite respectively song et al 2002b excess requirement of calcium could be due to the presence of carbonates in the regenerate solution which will lead to the formation of calcium carbonate song et al 2002a a pilot study recovering calcium phosphate from the regenerate found that about 40 of their recovered product consisted of calcium carbonate kalaitzidou et al 2016b this was attributed to co2 adsorption from the atmosphere since the regeneration solution was maintained in an open tank thus the amount of chemicals consumed for phosphate recovery will be dependent on the conditions during regeneration as well as the selectivity of the adsorbent moreover more studies are needed to show the potential for reusing the regenerate solution especially the effect on desorption due to the accumulation of phosphate in the regenerate this will give essential information on when and how often the phosphate needs to be recovered to enable effective reuse of the regenerate solution 2 4 adsorbent lifetime the adsorbent lifetime is increased by reusing it multiple times many studies test the adsorbent reusability between 5 and 10 cycles fang et al 2017b ju et al 2016 jung et al 2017 kim et al 2017 luo et al 2017 wan et al 2016 adsorbent attrition during the adsorption or regeneration process is the common reason for reusability getting affected for example zirconium oxide particles confined in mesoporous carbon showed a drop in adsorption capacity from 17 to 13 mg p g over the first 4 cycles whereas the capacity remained stable over the next 3 cycles ju et al 2016 this was attributed to the leaching of zirconium oxide particles located on the external surface or pore mouth region of the adsorbent composite adsorption capacity of calcined ldh decreased by about 50 over 5 cycles which was attributed to destruction of the layered structure sun et al 2014 the structure or active sites of amino functionalized clay adsorbent composites was considered damaged during regeneration with naoh unuabonah et al 2017 this led to a decrease in adsorption performance over every consecutive adsorption cycle drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 tested nanocomposite magnetic particles in wastewater effluent over 20 adsorption desorption cycles effluent concentrations less than 0 05 mg p l could only be achieved for the first few runs after which the adsorption efficiency decreased this was attributed to a consistent loss of adsorbent particles at a rate of about 5 per cycle furthermore attrition of adsorbent can form very small particles fines which can get released into the effluent if such particles are loaded with phosphate they can be an additional source of pollution incomplete desorption of phosphate has also been found to decrease the reusability for instance kunaschk et al 2015 reasoned that calcium based surface precipitation blocked adsorbed phosphate this would lead to a decrease in available active sites during the next adsorption cycle and thus affect the reusability presence of phosphate into micropores of iron oxides has also been reported to affect desorption cabrera et al 1981 additionally the adsorbent crystallinity or type of metal oxides can change during regeneration which would affect their surface functional groups for instance the crystallinity of goethite was observed to increase after regeneration with naoh and was correlated to a decrease in adsorption capacity after the very first cycle chitrakar et al 2006 in contrast the crystallinity of akaganeite did not change even after 10 cycles and the reusability was also intact suresh kumar et al 2018 monitored the adsorbent characteristics such as change in surface area crystallinity as well mass balance of competing ions for 3 adsorption regeneration cycles in a real wastewater effluent amongst all the other parameters calcium based surface precipitation was shown to have the highest influence on adsorbent reusability however the surface precipitates were not found to affect phosphate desorption but rather affect calcium adsorption which in turn affects phosphate adsorption understanding the mechanism of surface precipitation was suggested as important step to enhance adsorbent reusability there are also studies where the reusability is intact for the studied duration fang et al 2017b wan et al 2016 wu et al 2017 zong et al 2013 this could be related to the stability of the adsorbent but it could also be due to the fact that not enough regeneration cycles were done for instance nanocomposites based on lanthanum hydroxide and iron oxide showed stable adsorption capacities during 5 adsorption cycles wu et al 2017 however the phosphate desorption efficiency varied between 70 and 80 during each regeneration cycle this incomplete desorption could affect the reusability on the long run from a practical viewpoint the adsorbent lifetime needs to be much higher than 5 to 10 reuse times but rather than performing endless regeneration cycles studies should focus on developing a better understanding of the parameters that affect reusability in that way optimal regeneration methods can be developed if with such methods it can be shown that the adsorbent characteristics do not change over a certain number of reuse cycles then the adsorbent lifetime can be extrapolated to longer reuse cycles with more certainty 3 economic analysis for phosphate adsorption the economics of the adsorption process can be divided in the operating costs and the capital costs the operating costs mainly include the chemical costs as well as the costs due to energy consumption the following sections describe the sensitivity and scenario analysis for the chemical costs followed by a brief overview on the energy and capital costs 3 1 scenario and sensitivity analysis for chemical costs the chemical costs are the costs that can be addressed by phosphate adsorption studies a simple schematic of the adsorption process applied in a column mode is shown below fig 4 however the evaluation used for these chemical costs will also apply for a batch mode based on the scheme shown in fig 4 the chemical cost for phosphate adsorption can be expressed as follows c h e m i c a l c o s t o f a d s o r p t i o n m o l e p a b n n 1 where a cost for 1st adsorption cycle mole p b cost per regeneration cycle mole p cycle n number of regeneration cycles the denominator in the formula denotes the total number of cycles and is n 1 since the regeneration begins after the 1st cycle the term a is a function of the adsorbent cost and adsorption capacity it can be expressed as a a 1 a 2 where a1 adsorbent cost kg adsorbent a2 practical loading moles p kg adsorbent the cost per regeneration cycle can be further split as b c d e a 2 where c cost per cycle of desorption kg adsorbent cycle d cost per cycle of acid wash kg adsorbent cycle e cost per cycle of p recovery kg adsorbent cycle table 1 shows the split up of the variables used in calculating cost of each of these steps certain assumptions have been made to arrive at these derivations the following points discuss these assumptions and their limitations the adsorption capacity stays same throughout the n regeneration reuse cycles in reality the adsorption capacity will vary depending on the change in the physicochemical characteristics of the incoming solution as well as the amount of wear and tear the adsorbent undergoes the excess of chemicals used during regeneration can be reused hence only the cost for the chemicals actually consumed per cycle is considered studies show the possibility to reuse the regenerate solution by replenishing only the spent chemicals kalaitzidou et al 2016a kuzawa et al 2006 the phosphate recovery from the regenerate stream allows to reuse the regenerate stream effectively complete desorption of phosphate is achieved using naoh solution this assumption was necessary to relate the oh consumption to the phosphate adsorption capacity complete desorption might not be achieved in the first couple of cycles for porous adsorbents due to phosphate diffusion into inner pores but once such sites are saturated near complete desorption can be expected zach maor et al 2011a moreover the extent of desorption also depends on the affinity of the adsorbent surface precipitation happens primarily via calcium binding this allows to establish a relationship between calcium binding and amount of acid required to remove surface precipitates calcium based surface precipitation has been reported before on phosphate adsorbents kunaschk et al 2015 suresh kumar et al 2018 given its ubiquitous nature in surface and wastewaters it can be the chief component to cause a precipitate however precipitates based on adsorbent dissolution are also possible li and stanforth 2000 the overall formula for calculating the chemical cost can be used to show the importance of reusing the adsorbent several times fig 5 shows the variation in chemical cost as a function of the regeneration cycles the figure is plotted varying parameter n in the equation for chemical cost of adsorption as shown in table 1 to express the chemical cost in percentage the value of term a is taken as 100 and value of term b is varied to give rise to different ratios of b a i e the cost per regeneration cycle as compared to the cost of 1st adsorption cycle the chemical cost is both a function of the number of regeneration cycles as well as the ratio of cost per regeneration cycle to the cost of 1st adsorption cycle for scenarios where the cost per regeneration cycle is at least 5 times cheaper than the cost of 1st adsorption cycle about 80 or more of the reduction in chemical costs is reached by 30 regeneration cycles however the number of regeneration cycles that can be implemented relates to the adsorbent lifetime which in turn depends on the composition of the adsorbent this includes how stable the adsorbent material is to abrasion and structural modification over the adsorption and the regeneration cycles there are several studies which specify low cost phosphate adsorbent alternatives which are natural or modified products of industrial waste or biomass biswas et al 2008 ismail 2012 karthikeyan et al 2004 namasivayam and sangeetha 2004 mortula et al 2007 nawar et al 2015 however most of these adsorbents are either not resistant to the conditions used in regeneration alkaline or acidic ph or are suggested as direct application as fertilizers nguyen et al 2014 to compare how their adsorption costs fare with reversible adsorption i e reusable adsorbents we consider a scenario analysis for 3 different categories of adsorbent waste biomass based adsorbents porous metal oxides hybrid ion exchange resins the main criteria for categorizing this way is based on the adsorbent cost as discussed in section 2 1 but the other important differences to consider include the adsorption capacity and the lifetime of the adsorbents table 2 summarizes these aspects a monte carlo simulation was used to account for the uncertainty in calculating the chemical costs for the 3 categories of adsorbents a lower and upper range was provided for each parameter used in estimating the chemical cost and 10 000 random variables were generated using a uniform distribution the range for the main parameters used for calculating the chemical costs are shown in table 3 values for complete parameters shown in table s4 in supporting information these parameter values will of course depend on the operating conditions and the type of water matrix being treated but at least in the case of porous metal oxides and the ion exchange resin they have been estimated from adsorption in a wastewater effluent matrix suresh kumar et al 2018 hence these provide a more realistic value than phosphate solutions prepared using clean water the main assumption made is the lifetime number of regeneration cycles for porous metal oxides and the hybrid ion exchange resin rice husk was considered as the waste biomass and the adsorbent was considered for a one time use hence for this adsorbent regeneration costs were not considered for porous metal oxide ferrosorp fsp which is a granular iron oxide was used as the example the average lifetime was considered as 30 regeneration cycles since around 80 reduction in chemical costs is achieved by this lifetime in line with explanation provided by fig 5 for the hybrid ion exchange resin biophree which is an ion exchange resin impregnated with iron oxide was used as the example the lifetime of ion exchange resins depends on the process conditions and can vary between 7 and 15 years in our case we considered an average lifetime of 100 regeneration cycles the lower and upper range for the fsp and biophree were thus taken as 10 of 30 and 100 cycles respectively fig 6 shows the box plot for the chemical costs of these 3 categories of adsorbents as estimated by the monte carlo simulation the error bar shows the spread of possible chemical costs as per the range provided for the different parameters it can be seen from fig 6 that despite considering a very low cost for the waste biomass based adsorbents reversible adsorption with porous metal oxides and hybrid ion exchange resins are more cost effective due to their higher adsorption capacity and longer lifetime the median value for the chemical cost was around 100 kg p for both the porous metal oxide and the hybrid ion exchange resin some studies also suggest the use of naturally occurring calcium carbonate minerals like calcite and dolomite for phosphate adsorption karaca et al 2004 karageorgiou et al 2007 sø et al 2011 xu et al 2014 these adsorbents facilitate formation of calcium phosphate products and are suggested for direct application as fertilizers however the solubility of calcium phosphate and its subsequent application as fertilizer depends on the ph of the soil cabeza et al 2011 more information is also needed on the selectivity and practical binding capacity of these adsorbents at very low phosphate concentrations just like in the comparison with biomass engineered adsorbents with higher practical loading and lifetime can be more economical than one time use adsorbents fig 7 shows the sensitivity for different parameters towards the chemical cost for the porous metal oxide fig s2 in supporting info shows a similar graph for the ion exchange resin fig 7 shows that amongst all parameters the adsorbent cost the practical loading and number of regeneration cycles had the most significant effect an increase in practical loading and regeneration cycles reduced the chemical cost non linearly whereas a decrease in adsorbent cost reduced the chemical cost linearly at a higher slope than the other parameters thus optimization of these parameters would be essential for making the process economically feasible the chemical costs calculated here are for an effluent concentration of 0 1 mg p l for an effluent concentration of 0 01 mg p l these costs will be higher depending on how the adsorption capacity decreases corresponding to that concentration if an adsorbent has a high affinity this decrease in adsorption capacity will be minimal for the example for the porous metal oxide used the practical loading at an effluent concentration of 0 016 mg p l capacity was 60 of the loading observed at 0 1 mg p l assuming all other parameters to be constant the change in chemical cost can be deduced from the sensitivity analysis as shown in fig 7 in this case the chemical cost increased only by 50 even though the effluent concentration was reduced by a factor 6 moreover the practical loadings used in this analysis are based on a relatively short empty bed contact time ebct of 5 min depending on the adsorption kinetics increasing the ebct can significantly increase the practical loading this will hence lower the chemical costs 3 2 energy and capital costs energy consumption costs will vary based on the mode of operation stirred tank batch systems will consume energy primarily due to the stirring whereas fixed bed column studies will consume energy primarily due to pumping similarly adsorbents with magnetic properties would need a magnetic separator to facilitate their recovery drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 for the current scenario the energy and capital costs are based on fixed bed continuous mode of operation the regeneration would be simpler for the fixed adsorbent bed compared to a stirred tank reactor where the adsorbent needs to be first recovered after the adsorption process a continuous mode can also lead to a more efficient use of the adsorption capacity because the adsorbent is always exposed to the same influent concentration rather than the decreasing concentrations in batch mode loganathan et al 2014 the energy cost in terms of p removed can be given by the following formula e n e r g y c o s t k g p f g q c i n c o u t 10 3 where f hourly power consumption kwh h g electricity cost kwh q volumetric flow rate m3 h cin phosphate concentration at inlet mg p l cout phosphate concentration at outlet mg p l the power consumption is related to the pressure drop over the adsorbent column as follows f q δp 36 η where δp pressure drop bar η pump efficiency the pressure drop can be calculated by the ergun equation supporting information the capital costs will chiefly include the cost of the adsorbent column s the regeneration tanks one for desorption with alkaline solution and other for acid washing and a crystallizer for recovering the desorbed phosphate as calcium phosphate the process can use two adsorbent columns in series so that when one is getting regenerated the other adsorbent column can still be in operation an assumption is that any fouling of the adsorber bed will be cleaned during the regeneration process for instance inorganic fouling such as surface precipitation will be removed during acid wash suresh kumar 2017 phosphate limitation will control bioufouling vrouwenvelder et al 2010 but any biofouling formed will also be cleaned during the alkaline desorption step due to the high ph goode et al 2013 thus no separate operational or capital costs are considered for handling fouling of the adsorber bed a simplified way to estimate the capital cost would be to assume that the equipment will operate effectively for a fixed lifetime in which case the capital cost in terms of p will be c a p i t a l c o s t k g p h i q c i n c o u t 10 3 where h total investment cost i lifetime of equipment h it is difficult to establish the capital costs since the cost of equipment will vary with scale and the specific costs will usually reduce at bigger scales due to economy of scale in this case the costs were based on pilot scale experiments at a scale of 1 5 m3 h fig s1 and table s5 in supporting information show however these were scaled up to determine the costs for treating at a full scale flowrate of 500 m3 h this was done by using the scaling coefficient which relates the capacity increase in this case denoted by the increase in volumetric flowrate to the increase in equipment cost tribe and alpine 1986 a scaling coefficient value of 0 6 was used in this case which is in line with common practice tribe and alpine 1986 moreover to consider the installation charges the lang factor was considered in the calculation wain 2014 since adsorption is used for treating liquids a lang factor of 4 8 was used and multiplied with the full scale equipment cost wain 2014 thus the total investment cost denoted by the term h includes the installation cost as well the calculated value for the total investment cost for a capacity of handling 500 m3 h amounted to 970 000 considering the equipment has a lifetime of 10 years an influent concentration cin of 1 mg p l and the desired effluent concentration cout of 0 1 mg p l the capital cost expressed in terms of p amounts to about 25 kg p the energy cost for these conditions parameters used are listed in table s6 of supporting information amounts to about 10 kg p thus the overall cost including capital energy and chemical costs for reducing phosphate from 1 to 0 1 mg p l using reversible adsorption on porous iron oxides is about 120 kg p fig 8 shows the distribution of the different costs as can be seen from fig 8 chemical costs which includes the cost of the adsorbent contributed to more than 70 of the overall costs a similar cost distribution was obtained for the hybrid ion exchange resins although the percentage of chemical costs was slightly higher fig s3 in supporting information once the process is in operation the process does not require much manual maintenance except in the case of checking for the breakthrough once the effluent p concentration exceeds the required level and regenerating the adsorbent thus the labor costs for the process should ideally be minimal the other costs that are not considered in this calculation include the cost for waste generation one time use biomass based adsorbents can ideally be used directly as fertilizers provided they did not bind toxic materials like heavy metals and there is indeed a fertilizer value for reusable adsorbents although the excess chemicals in the regenerate stream are assumed to be completely reused there could be accumulation of other ions in this stream the accumulation of other ions depends on the adsorbent selectivity and could happen both in streams used for alkaline desorption as well as acid wash in that case occasionally a part of the regenerate stream would need to be bled this stream might need to be neutralized and further treated before being discarded studies are needed on understanding the composition of the regenerate stream after multiple reuse additionally even if highly selective engineered adsorbents are designed some of these adsorbents contain elements which can cause toxicity issues if released into the environment table s1 in supporting information hence it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the chemical leakage from such adsorbents before they can be applied 3 3 comparison with other technologies and defining the ideal conditions for adsorption the ideal conditions for adsorption can be underlined by comparison with chemical precipitation chemical precipitation with iron salts is a commonly used technique to lower the phosphate concentrations in municipal wastewater sedlak 1991 iron salts can be added near or slightly higher than stoichiometric fe p molar ratios to reduce phosphate concentrations to around 1 mg p l in practice a fe p molar ratio between 1 and 2 is generally used in wastewater plants to achieve phosphate concentrations around 1 mg p l paul et al 2001 but reducing the phosphate concentrations below 1 mg p l using chemical precipitation requires significant increase in metal salt dosing due to the limitation by solubility product which in turn leads to high sludge production as well as due to the formation of metal hydroxides neethling 2013 sedlak 1991 fig 9 a shows the relation between required fe p molar ratio and the residual phosphate concentration based on data from a wastewater plant sedlak 1991 at residual phosphate concentration around 1 mg p l the ratio is near the stoichiometric region and the majority of the p removal is via precipitation however as the residual phosphate concentration decreases the required ratio goes very high in this zone phosphate removal is mainly due to adsorption onto iron hydr oxide complexes sedlak 1991 to quantify the effects of this in terms of cost fig 9 b shows a comparison of p removal costs via reversible adsorption and chemical precipitation with iron at 3 different concentrations 10 to 1 mg p l 1 to 0 1 mg p l and 1 to 0 016 mg p l a lowest concentration of 0 016 mg p l was chosen since this allows us to use the adsorption capacity for porous iron oxides estimated at this concentration suresh kumar 2018 6 this does not include the capital costs but the chemical costs for adsorption and the chemical as well as disposal costs due to sludge formation via chemical precipitation for chemical precipitation with iron a fe p molar ratio of 2 20 and 100 are assumed for the concentration ranges of 10 to 1 1 to 0 1 and 1 to 0 016 mg p l table s7 in supporting information shows parameters used for the calculation the chemical cost for chemical precipitation to bring phosphate concentration from 10 to 1 mg p l was around 8 kg p this is in the same order of magnitude as estimated elsewhere paul et al 2001 for adsorption the chemical costs were calculated for porous metal oxide assuming that it is reused successfully for 30 cycles even if the equilibrium adsorption capacity for this adsorbent fsp at 1 mg p l is considered as the practical loading value suresh kumar et al 2019 the cost to reduce phosphate concentrations from 10 to 1 mg p l is around 35 kg p however as the phosphate concentration goes lower the costs for adsorption compete and eventually better those of precipitation see fig 9 b this shows that adsorption is better suited for treating lower concentrations of phosphate the overall costs for reversible adsorption estimated in this review was compared with the costs of other technologies that achieve ultra low p concentrations 0 15 mg p l the technologies compared here are as follows i reversible adsorption rad this includes the estimates made in this review for overall costs to reduce phosphate from 1 to 0 1 mg p l denoted rad 0 1 and from 1 to 0 016 mg p l denoted rad 0 016 using porous metal oxide ii acti flo in this approach soluble phosphorus is first removed by dosing iron salts the resulting flocs are ballasted with microsand in the presence of a polymer after providing sufficient time in a mixing tank the water is passed onto a clarifier which removes the microsand along with flocs bolton and menk 2016 an effluent concentration of 0 17 mg p l could be achieved by treatment using acti flo iii phoslock phoslock is a lanthanum modified bentonite that removes srp by forming lanthanum phosphate precipitates cost estimation for phoslock was based on the price of phoslock 2750 ton mackay et al 2014 and on an average adsorption capacity of 9 mg p g to reduce p concentrations to 0 05 mg p l in surface water reitzel et al 2013 this however does not include costs that might be incurred for dosing iv microalgae cost for p removal by microalgae was based on the p uptake by microalgae and reported cost for microalgae production in netherlands boelee 2013 de vree 2016 the estimated cost is to reduce p concentrations upto 0 15 mg p l fig 10 shows the cost comparison for p removal by these different methods this includes the operational as well as capital costs wherever provided as can be seen from fig 10 rad 0 1 along with acti flo provide the least expensive options there are other types of technologies like acti flo which include precipitation with metal salts aided by separation with sand newcombe et al 2008 stowa 2009 the metal salts dosed result in soluble phosphorus removal by precipitation as well as by forming metal hydr oxide complexes which adsorb the phosphorus newcombe et al 2008 however as discussed earlier in reference to fig 9 p removal to concentrations lower than 0 1 mg p l would require rather high dosing of these metal salts alternatively the use of adsorption will be more suited for reducing phosphate to even lower concentrations as can be seen from fig 10 the cost of using reversible adsorption to reach a concentration of 0 1 mg p l is about 120 kg p but a further reduction to a concentration 6 times lower i e 0 016 mg p l increases the overall cost only by a factor 1 6 i e about 190 kg p this is rather due to the high affinity of adsorbents which will imply a high adsorption capacity at lower p concentrations thus reversible adsorption has the potential to give better economics compared to other methods when it is required to reduce the p concentrations further lower there is no consensus currently in literature as to a decisive cost for preventing eutrophication however a report on restoring the grand lake st mary in ohio estimated the loss due to excess p loading to 102 million based on the amount of excess p loaded annually in this lake the loss was estimated as 708 lb p grand lake st marys restoration commission 2011 thus the cost of phosphate adsorption would be an economically viable option as per this estimate however a concrete assessment needs to be done by stakeholders and responsible organizations to establish a widely acceptable value to prevent eutrophication 4 conclusion p removal to ultra low concentrations is necessary to prevent eutrophication adsorption studies show a possibility to consistently reach such low concentrations of phosphate however despite an increasing interest in scientific literature a wide spread implementation of adsorption on commercial scale has not yet taken place this may indicate that there are still important economic aspects that are not yet being addressed by the scientific community therefore this study performed an economic analysis for different types of adsorbents a monte carlo simulation based scenario analysis showed that reusable adsorbents are more cost effective than one time use low cost adsorbents sensitivity analysis also showed that the most important parameters that govern chemical costs of adsorption are the adsorbent cost practical loading and the adsorbent reusability an expensive adsorbent can still be part of a cost effective process provided it has a high lifetime for e g the cost of adsorption by hybrid ion exchange resins is comparable with that of porous metal oxides even though the adsorbent cost was 3 5 times higher for the resins this was possible due to the assumption that the hybrid ion exchange resins could be reused about 100 times compared to the 30 times by the porous metal oxides literature review also showed the research gaps involved in determining the parameters that govern the economics fig 11 shows the key findings as well as future research potential in this direction for instance studies from the past 5 years show a big discrepancy between the adsorption capacity at 0 1 mg p l q0 1 and the maximum adsorption capacity qmax since adsorption is considered as a polishing step it is necessary to have a high q0 1 practical loading is also governed by the adsorbent kinetics adsorption studies in general need to be done in realistic conditions since competing ions can either increase or decrease the adsorbent performance studies should focus on understanding the factors affecting adsorbent reusability so that a better estimation can be made regarding the adsorbent lifetime additionally reusing the regenerate solution also needs more

20008,aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food production industry now producing 50 of all food fish however aquaculture feeds remain dependent on fishmeal derived from capture fisheries which must be reduced for continued sustainable growth purple phototrophic bacteria ppb efficiently yield biomass from wastewater with high product homogeneity a relatively high protein fraction and potential added value as an ingredient for fish feeds here we test bulk replacement of fishmeal with ppb microbial biomass in diets for asian sea bass lates calcarifer a high value carnivorous fish with high protein to energy requirement mixed culture ppb were grown in a novel 1 m3 attached photo biofilm process using synthetic and real wastewater four experimental diets were formulated to commercial specifications but with the fishmeal substituted 0 33 66 and 100 with the synthetic grown ppb biomass and fed to a cohort of 540 juvenile fish divided amongst 12 tanks over 47 days weight and standard length were taken from individual fish at 18 28 and 47d no significant difference in survival was observed due to diet or other factors 94 100 there was a negative correlation between ppb inclusion level and final weight p 5 94 10 5 with diet accounting for 4 1 of the variance over the trial general linear model r2 0 96 p 1 10 6 feed conversion ratio was also significantly influenced by diet p 6 10 7 with this factor accounting for 89 of variance specifically feed conversion ratio fcr rose to 1 5 for the 100 replacement diet during the last sample period approximately 1 0 for the partial replacement and 0 8 for the nil replacement diet however this study demonstrates that bulk replacement of fishmeal by ppb is feasible and commercially viable at 33 and 66 replacement graphical abstract image 1 keywords fishmeal photobioreactor purple phototrophic bacteria single cell protein 1 introduction for over five decades aquaculture has been the fastest growing animal food production industry with production expanding on average by 8 0 per year since 1961 and 47 of all food fish are now derived from aquaculture fao 2018 however there is heavy reliance on fishmeal and fish oil derived from capture fisheries to manufacture feeds for aquaculture species however this is a limited resource with very strict quotas naylor et al 2009 to reduce this pressure the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations have charged the scientific community with the investigation of alternative protein sources that are simultaneously more environmentally friendly low cost and may promote extra nutritional health benefits fao 2016 consequently there has been an acceleration of research into alternative and sustainable protein sources for use in aquaculture feeds including proteins derived from plants hardy 2010 insects stamer 2015 and microbial biomass gamboa delgado and márquez reyes 2016 microbial biomass also referred to as single cell protein scp has a range of advantages as a feed ingredient matassa et al 2016 conversion of organics nitrogen and phosphorous to proteins is highly efficient compared to for example plant based alternatives matassa et al 2016 secondly whereas plant and insect proteins are generally well digested certain fractions may contain less digestible and anti nutritional factors such as cellulose chitin and phytate microbial proteins are generally well utilised by fish and crustaceans and comprise a protein content and amino acid profiles similar to fishmeal gamboa delgado and márquez reyes 2016 whilst there has been substantial interest in proteins from algae and yeasts as ingredients for animal feeds matassa et al 2015 øverland and skrede 2017 yaakob et al 2014 microbial biomass from bacteria is regarded as one of the most promising vectors pikaar et al 2017 bacterial biomass is generally characterised by a protein content between 50 and 65 anupama and ravindra 2000 which is an important consideration when formulating feeds for popular aquaculture species such as salmon trout and barramundi where final dietary requirement may exceed 50 protein gamboa delgado and márquez reyes 2018 glencross 2006 however the majority of microbial scp production relies on aerobic heterotrophs which dissipate a substantial fraction of the energy during catabolism matassa et al 2015 limiting biological yields and conversion ratios to below 50 purple phototrophic bacteria ppb including rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp are a phylogenetically diverse group of phototrophic anoxygenic microbes that avoid this dissipation through phototrophic growth and yields close to unity hülsen et al 2018 they have been isolated from a vast variety of sources including soil fresh and marine water and wastewaters zhang et al 2003 and can be readily selected with infrared radiation ir ir is utilised as catabolic driver and enables direct and non destructive assimilative uptake of organics nitrogen and phosphorous hülsen et al 2014 at the same time ppbs exhibit high growth rates and contain 60 crude protein with additional potentially beneficial compounds such as carotenoid pigments polyhydroxyalkanoates and readily digestible cell walls kobayashi and kobayashi 1995 this makes ppb an ideal mediator for resource recovery from wastewater where ir allows for selective enrichment with little or no competition with other bacteria or algae that are unable to absorb wavelengths above 750 nm bidigare et al 1990 as a result ppb can dominate non sterile systems in a mixed culture context which enables consistent product quality this offers the ability to generate ppb as a product stream e g as feed or feed additive from industrial and potentially domestic wastewaters with health controls or phase separation pikaar et al 2017 whilst there are no studies on use of ppb as a bulk ingredient there are a number of studies investigating ppb as feed supplement at very low inclusion rates in economically important species such as nile tilapia marble goby barramundi and tor tambroides banerjee et al 2000 chowdhury et al 2016 loo et al 2015 shapawi et al 2012 these studies utilised axenic cultures rhodovulum marichromatium or rhodospeudomonas sp grown on artificial media in the formulation of their diets all studies except shapawi et al 2012 reported significantly better survival and or improved growth during the early life stages of the animals with some studies indicating unbalanced formulation for lipids or proteins banerjee et al 2000 chowdhury et al 2016 shapawi et al 2012 only reported trends of increased growth improved survival rate and better feed conversation ratio when fish were fed with 0 3 bacterial biomass loo et al 2015 fed ppb directly to marble goby fries by mixing it with tank water or by feeding it to fish via rotifer and artemia with both methods resulting in improved survival this effect was confirmed in crucian carp at ppb addition rates of 0 1 1 10 000 of the total food intake kobayashi and tchan 1973 as well as in fry of loach goldfish carp ark shell and sweetfish that prey on phototrophic bacteria soon after hatching kobayashi and kobayashi 1995 these studies have demonstrated positive impacts of ppbs as a food supplement at rather low inclusion rates utilising axenic cultures they therefore represent more probiotic studies rather than a bulk feed substitute for fishmeal whole or partial and do not address the overall objective of fishmeal replacement with microbial protein in contrast the present study aims to evaluate the potential of a mixed ppb culture as a substitute for fishmeal in commercial aqua feeds for this purpose ppb grown on synthetic wastewater serve as proxy for ppb biomass generated on non sterile sources the main objectives were a characterisation of the ppb product produced in a 1 m3 wastewater pilot fed with synthetic wastewater and the comparison with ppb grown on real wastewater b determination of the effects of 33 66 and 100 fishmeal replacement with this product on performance of the fish barramundi lates calcarifer in terms of growth mortality feed conversion and whole body composition relative

explanatory variable ppb inclusion was continuous rather than categorical and hence mixed mode categorical continuous linear modelling was used to assess its impact this allowed for assessment of its impact vs other factors tank number initial fish size age of fish etc effect of ppb inclusion on feed intake daily gain fcr growth rate and mortality between diets were examined using a generalized linear mixed regression model limits for all critical ranges were set at p 0 05 95 confidence interval from three replicate tanks an anovan n way analysis of variance anova was used to test the effects of multiple factors on each tank and sample point using the anovan function in matlab mathworks r2016b also see sm1 for more details linear non interaction and interaction models were tested with the non interaction model generally being used as more parsimonious where outcomes were comparable tank number was treated as categorical factor age of fish time start initial size medium or large and ppb fraction diet type were treated as primary continuous factors residual normality noting n 36 and heteroscedasticity against explanatory variables were tested and are given in the scripts while linear modelling was used as the main statistical method for overall impact comparison between pairs was done using an appropriate t test 3 results 3 1 ppb biofilm harvesting and ppb biomass characteristics a ppb biofilm was formed after 7 d post inoculation 20 l and harvesting was subsequently carried out every 3 d reusing 10 v v of the reactor liquid as inoculum the biofilm was up to 3 0 mm thick visual estimate completely covered the irradiated surface fig 1b and c and was easy to remove from the tubes non irradiated regions due to non functional leds were immediately evident as no growth occurred fig 1d approximately 1000 g wet biomass with 80 120 g l 1 dry solid was harvested per event with a peak sustained areal productivity attached of 6 0 g m2 illuminated d 1 or 22 tonnes ha 1 year 1 at 22 kwh kg 1 although the primary purpose of the ppb reactor in this study was the production of ppb rather than optimising the cod n and p removal and uptake efficiencies the potential of simultaneous uptake of resources from artificial and wastewater sources has been shown representative time series of the artificial and the domestic wastewater reactor operation over 40 d of the 135 d and over 71 d respectively are shown fig s1 the cod and nh4 n removal for the synthetic medium and the domestic wastewater were similar both around 300 mgscod l 1 and 14 mgnh4 n l 1 per batch table s2 although the tcod nh4 n and po4 p removal rates of max 120 8 0 and 1 0 mg l 1 d 1 were rather low which was likely caused by diffusion limitations this is unfavourable for high rate systems but we also note that this will ultimately depend on an optimised illuminated surface to volume ratio which would further affect the mixing and likely increase the removal rates nevertheless we consider the attached ppb growth as a successful proof of concept which requires optimisation especially with focus on the energy input the results further show the effect of attached ppb growth on the product consistency protein amino acid total carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll contents in ppb biomass grown on synthetic and domestic wastewater were almost identical with slight variations in the fat and carbohydrate contents table 1 this indicates a degree of compositional independence from the feed matrix which is crucial for product consistency on different growth media or wastewaters this is further confirmed by the sequence based analysis of the total harvested biomass in both biofilms grown on artificial and domestic wastewater ppb were dominant 70 of sequences bradyrhizobiaceae rhodobacteraceae with rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp accounting for up to up to 32 and 15 artificial medium and 44 and 39 in domestic wastewater fig s2 table 1 also contains amino acid profiles of suspended ppb grown on pork flush poultry and red meat processing wastewater hülsen et al 2018 and we hypothesise the general feasibility of attached ppb growth for these wastewaters and similar biomass compositions 3 2 description of feed processing and diet preparation moisture crude lipid crude protein and crude ash ranged from 3 0 to 5 2 11 8 13 3 55 5 57 3 and 8 0 9 4 respectively table 2c diets 3 and 4 containing the two highest inclusions of ppb had a notable smell and were much darker in colour fig s3 the 2 mm fraction collected after the blending and sieving steps represented 93 of all gradients size pellets regardless of the diet retained structural stability after 10 min immersion in water water from tanks receiving diet 4 and 3 were slightly more turbid than from diet 1 and 2 and this usually occurred for 10 15 min following feeding the amino acid profiles of all feeds were determined and are provided in table 2c with no significant correlation to ppb fraction in diet for all 17 amino acids p 0 05 tested in matlab but not reported here 3 3 fish growth performance a summary of growth performance outcomes daily growth rate feed intake feed conversion ratio fcr weight length gain and survival for the four treatments are shown in fig 2 and table 3 feed intake was not significantly impacted by ppb inclusion suggesting that replacement of fishmeal with ppb protein did not affect palatability of the diets survival of barramundi fingerlings after 47 days was high 94 100 with no significant differences between diets or any other factors p 0 05 three fish died in one tank in the initial period but following this only one further fish died in a different tank over the trial all fish that died were abnormally small below average weight of the cohort and presented signs of aggression by others fish in all tanks increased in weight over time fig s4 during the 47 days of the trial fish grew more than five fold table 3 with fish fed control diet 1 increasing by 7 1 0 9 fold those fed diet 2 30 fm replacement by 6 1 0 6 fold fish fed diet 3 66 fm replacement increasing 5 8 0 3 fold and fish fed diet 4 100 fm replacement growing 5 4 0 8 fold table 3 to predict weight a simple linear model with explanatory factors age initial size and diet was as effective as a more complex interaction model r2 0 96 vs r2 0 98 and the simpler model was used average weight was primarily driven by the age of fish p 5 10 23 80 of variance secondarily by initial size p 8 10 12 12 of variance and finally by diet p 1 10 06 4 1 of variance the model r2 was 0 96 indicating very little residual variance probably due to the fact that each observation was averaged from 50 individual fish weight and length gain at the end of the trial were negatively correlated with increasing level of ppb with p values of 0 0037 and 0 0003 respectively table 3 daily gain effectively removes the cumulative weight effect of time i e fish get bigger over time leaving analysis of the possibility that bigger or older fish grow faster or slower there was no significant tank effect on the daily individual live weight gain instead daily gain was impacted positively by time older fish grow faster p 4 10 5 positively by initial size p 0 0029 big initial size results in higher daily gain and negatively by ppb inclusion rate p 0 0001 r2 for the linear model was 0 62 vs interaction model r2 0 7 slight improvement an r2 of 0 62 indicates that the main factors were highly explanatory even with the cumulative growth effect of time removed for the first 28 d of the trial there was no effect of ppb on daily weight gain p 0 3 fig 2a from day 28 until day 47 ppb inclusion rate had a negative correlation with daily gain p 0 008 and 5 94 10 5 respectively fig 2a fish fed diet 4 100 fm replacement had the lowest gain at both sample times as fish grew older from day 18 to day 28 the daily gain significantly increased in all diet treatments p 0 0001 at the end of the feed trial daily weight gain slightly increased in fish fed diet 1 0 fm replacement but remained unchanged for fish fed diet 2 and 3 and decreased for fish fed diet 4 fig 2a feed conversion ratio varied substantially with time p 6 10 9 and diet p 6 10 7 fig 2b but tank allocation and initial size had no impact on fcr comparison of linear models and interaction models and removing non significant factors resulted in two candidate models each involving only time and diet the best model was a two factor model diet and time diet r2 0 89 which was better than the two parameter linear model time and diet r2 0 75 and not worse than the full 3 parameter interaction r2 0 90 time alone not significant this optimal model predicted ppb fraction in diet negatively affecting fcr p 4 10 7 fraction of variance 0 12 with a highly significant interaction between time diet type p 7 10 15 fraction of variance 0 6 the primary linear factor indicates a slight decrease in fcr with increased ppb inclusion rate i e beneficial impact but the latter dominates and is a detrimental impact overall at an earlier time point diet is less important to fcr while at later times diet has a strong impact in increasing fcr detrimental this can be effectively seen in fig 2b also where only at later periods and at higher dietary ppb inclusion rate does the fcr rise substantially above 1 daily feed intake was not impacted by tanks or diet however it was slightly impacted by the initial size and naturally time p 4 10 15 of the fish p 6 10 6 with larger animals consuming more feed than smaller ones there were no interactions between primary factors and as expected no differences observed in feed intakes between diets at any given time restrictive pair fed feeding strategy further analysis regressing daily intake vs fish weight at tend vs ppb fraction found that apart from the strong correlation with fish weight p 1 10 18 there was a significant positive correlation with ppb inclusion 0 005 r2 0 9 3 4 carcass composition fish carcass compositions are presented in table s3 three samples were analysed per diet treatment one for each replicate tank each sample was composed of five representative animals per tank differences in moisture protein lipid ash and carbohydrate were analysed by linear regression increasing level of ppb in the diets had a negative correlation with protein content in fish carcasses p 0 0220 with carcasses of fish fed diet 4 having the lowest protein content increasing level of ppb had a positive correlation on ash content of the carcass p 0 0032 with ash content maximum in carcasses of fish fed diet 4 carcasses of fish fed diet 3 formulated with 66 ppb as fishmeal replacement had the highest level of lipid among all diets including control though no statistically significant correlation was detected by regression ppb concentration in diet had no effect on moisture or carbohydrate content in carcasses of animals fed the diets p 0 05 elemental analyses in diets and carcasses of fish fed the diets are presented in table s1 potassium phosphorous magnesium and calcium increased by 7 21 12 and 27 respectively from reference to complete fishmeal replacement while sulphur and sodium decreased by 12 and 22 levels of calcium between diets did not show a particular trend but its levels in fish carcasses composition increased significantly p 1 20 10 4 iron levels in diets increased by 37 in diets with 66 and 100 ppb inclusion but remained constant in fish carcasses potassium levels were fairly constant in diets and no differences in body compositions observed magnesium levels increased gradually in experimental diets up to 48 in diet 4 so as its levels in fish carcasses p 7 06 10 3 sodium increased in diets up to 43 in diet 4 but decreased significantly in fish fed experimental diets p 6 88 10 4 phosphorous level was maximum in diet 3 23 higher than control diet 1 and increased significantly in carcases of fish fed increasing level of ppb p 1 61 10 4 as expected sulphur levels increased along with fm replacement up to 33 in diet 4 but its levels decreased significantly in carcasses of fish p 5 25 10 5 concentrations of copper iron lead and zinc remained constant in all fish carcasses tested 4 discussion fishmeal for aquaculture feed production in 2013 used 73 of total forage fish derived from the capture fisheries shepherd and jackson 2013 and recent data suggest that most of this fish is suitable for human food use cashion et al 2017 consequently replacement or reduction of fishmeal as protein source in aquaculture feeds is critical to continued growth of fish farming as a foundation for future food security naylor et al 2009 troell et al 2014 microbial derived proteins are of particular interest as they can be readily produced on inexpensive carbon sources and as byproducts of other processes such as brewing and waste treatment matassa et al 2016 øverland and skrede 2017 here we show that bacterial biomass derived from synthetic or domestic wastewater using photoactive bioreactors can be substituted for fishmeal in diets for the popular tropical aquaculture fish barramundi asian sea bass l calcarifer with moderate impact on main indicators fish growth rate fcr and with commercially viable outcomes given this is a proof of concept study with feed formulation not yet optimised for differences between ppb and fishmeal as primary protein source there remains substantial scope to further improve these outcomes these aspects are discussed further in this section 4 1 ppb from water treatment is a consistent quality ingredient ppb produced using synthetic or domestic wastewater in photoactive bioreactors was consistent in terms of bacterial community protein lipid and carbohydrate content in agreement with previous research where biomass derived from bioreactors operating on wastewater streams from pork dairy and poultry processing were compared hülsen et al 2018 consistent ingredient quality is critical for commercial feed production and is a common problem for formulation tangendjaja 2015 so the product consistency across synthetic wastewater domestic wastewater this study and disparate waste streams hülsen et al 2018 is an advantage of the ppb biomass protein content of the ppb biomass was reasonably high 57 making it possible to substitute at quite high rates in feeds for carnivorous fish where dietary protein requirement may be between 40 and 55 this compares favourably with other microbial protein sources such as yeast fungi and microalgae where protein content is substantially less than 50 gong et al 2018 øverland and skrede 2017 vidakovic et al 2016 4 2 ppb is effective as a partial fishmeal substitute in aqua feeds for farmed barramundi growth performance outcomes demonstrated progressive but fractional losses in fish performance indicators as ppb fraction or protein input increased generally significant across all treatments but not between neighbouring treatments the main effect was on performance indicators growth daily weight gain and fcr rather than mortality and carcass composition in terms of commercial viability up to 66 of the fishmeal could be substituted with purple phototrophic bacteria without a major impact on the fish performance parameters for the first 28 d of the trial noting that the impact is progressive after 28 d it is important to consider that the diet 4 in the present study contained zero fishmeal and the results are consistent with other studies where complete substitution was considered for example replacement of fishmeal with soybean and poultry meal in barramundi diets resulted reduced weight gain and increased feed conversion that was significant when replacement was 66 or 100 glencross et al 2016 indeed over the duration of the trial fcr remained at around 1 for diets with 33 and 66 of fm replaced by ppb the reason for the increased fcr and decreased daily weight gain at high replacement levels need to be further investigated similar impact on growth and feed conversion was noted in arctic charr fed on diets with 40 fm replaced by intact baker s yeast s cerevisiae or filamentous fungal biomass rhizopus oryzae vidakovic et al 2016 the negative effect of yeast inclusion on fcr and final weight was abrogated in arctic charr by pre lysing the yeast cells vidakovic et al 2016 resulting in improved apparent digestibility of the protein and amino acids in the diet langeland et al 2016 it is therefore possible that pre lysis of ppb biomass may increase the performance at higher substitution rates and is worthy of further study albeit that there would be additional processing cost other potential factors impacting final weight and fcr may include the presence of nucleic acids in the ppb biomass as high levels would increase the energy cost for barramundi to metabolise them while nucleotides are semi essential nutrients in many animals including fish and shrimp burrells et al 2001 carver and walker 1995 do et al 2012 hoang do et al 2013 nucleic acids need first to be processed via the salvage pathway prior to supplying to new genetic material during growth moreover excess nucleotides need to be excreted and accrue a metabolic cost as a consequence levels must be optimised for each species and age as requirement decreases in older animals do et al 2012 li and gatlin 2006 similar considerations apply to complex carbohydrates that could lead to gut irritation and lower digestibility these will be tested in future digestibility experiments we demonstrated successfully that the inclusion up to 33 fm replacement with ppb would have little or no impact on barramundi growth performance therefore we can recover resources from wastewater transform them into ppb biomass and convert it to a useful feed ingredient reducing the reliance on wild caught fishmeal in contrast deleterious effects on growth feed intake and feed conversion have been reported when microalgae were used at concentrations as low as 12 total inclusion 14 2 fm substitution with phaeodactylum tricornutum sorensen et al 2016 and 20 total inclusion for defatted nannochloropsis biomass sorensen et al 2017 while the bulk properties amino acid profile metals profile etc were comparable across the four diets ppb has a number of additional active compounds vitamins biopolymers phas carotenoids and bacteriochlorophylls which are important to commercial fish rearing ppb contain a range of vitamins e g b2 b12 e and niacin sasaki et al 1991 which are important for fish growth and are routinely added to commercial feed vitamin premix including in the current study if substantially substituted by native compounds in ppb this would allow reduction of premix from commercial feed formulations with associated cost saving the same applies for carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll which in this study were present in the ppb product used to formulate the diets at 6 8 g kg 1 and 11 3 g kg 1 respectively interestingly pigments were stable after the steaming and overnight drying steps of the pellets their levels of detection in the diets were in accordance with the concentration of ppb biomass used in the formulation of the diets fig s5 these pigments serve as anti oxidants and play an important role on the coloration of fish skin flesh sasaki et al 1991 and are consequently added to diets for salmonids and marine shrimp as astaxanthin to improve meat colour torrissen and christiansen 1995 wade et al 2017 4 3 significance and application to wastewater treatment industry the application of ppb biomass for fishmeal substitution adds value to the ppb biomass this primarily but not limited to concerns the value of bulk protein where fishmeal fluctuates in price according to grades and availability in the last 5 years prices have ranged from 1 919 us metric ton 1 01 2013 to 1 296 00 us metric ton 1 04 2017 and last recorded at 1 604 us metric ton 1 03 2018 or 2 5 3 us per kg crude protein assuming 65 cp www indexmundi com commodities commodity fish meal months 120 future prices are expected to increase due to overfishing and catch quota tveteras and asche 2008 moreover supply restriction during climatic events for example fishery closure during el niño events are likely to increase in frequency and duration forcing prices higher ubilava 2014 for the wastewater treatment industry preferably agri industry sources e g food processors abattoirs or comparable industries this means the production of ppb from their wastewaters will add an additional income stream the ppb technology has the potential to remove organics nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater lowering the discharge costs while simultaneously transforming these constituents into protein rich biomass at yields around 0 8 gcod 1 hülsen et al 2018 general ppb applicability has been demonstrated in dairy red meat poultry processing wastewaters and pork flush with a characteristic profile of mixed culture ppb extensively discussed with respect to those protein sources hülsen et al 2018 ppb from different sources has been found to be very consistent almost independent from the wastewater source as indicated with the comparison of ppb composition grown on synthetic and domestic wastewater table 1 this can provide feed manufacturers with a valuable ingredient stream largely independent from seasonal variations the areal productivity of 6 g m 2 d 1 is rather high compared to e g immobilised attached algae biofilm productivities e g 0 71 ozkan et al 2012 and 0 58 2 57 g m 2 d 1 johnson and wen 2010 6 g m 2 d 1 is rather high compared to e g immobilised attached algae biofilm productivities e g 0 71 ozkan et al 2012 and 0 58 2 57 g m 2 d 1 johnson and wen 2010 the growth of ppb is naturally coupled with removal of carbon and nutrients through assimilative growth myung et al 2004 tadesse et al 2003 although the attached reactor concept utilised to grow the ppb had low removal rates and required a high energy input mainly for illumination the concept of attached biofilms on ir illuminated submerged tubes for consistent biomass quality seems technically feasible the tubes are by no means the final design and significantly higher illuminated surface to volume ratios can be easily achieved e g with smaller tube diameters or in a flat plate reactors e g 67 m2 m 3 norsker et al 2011 this can further improve the mixing and the removal rates which might also lead to increased attached areal productivities e g due to faster growth and more frequent harvesting rather than increased density the logical step would be the use of outdoor cultures which would harvest natural light drastically increasing illumination intensity and reducing illumination costs to zero while sacrificing 12 h of illuminated operation due to night day cycles 4 4 ppb as aquaculture input further research needs our results suggest that ppb up to 33 10 could offer an alternative to fishmeal with little or no detrimental effect on fish performance in barramundi a tropical species with high dietary protein requirement it may be possible to address the penalties in fcr and growth at higher inclusion levels by relatively inexpensive and simple ingredient pre treatment eg hydrolysis as this improved digestibility and performance of baker s yeast in arctic charr vidakovic et al 2016 a fish which also has dietary protein requirement in addition the potential beneficial impact of vitamins and other compounds including carotenoids chlorophylls and biopolymers such as phb needs to be assessed to change the overall optimal formulation for commercial utilisation it is noted that this study focused on manual preparation of relatively small amounts of feed though still with a large number of individual animals the encouraging results of the present study justify a larger trial involving preparation of larger volumes of feed with a commercial extruder given the relatively high carotenoid content in ppb and its stability through feed processing demonstrated in this study assessment of performance in feeds for high value crustaceans such as tiger prawns p monodon that can utilise these carotenoids wade et al 2017 to improve product quality should be a priority there is clear potential here for added value beyond replacement of fishmeal with a sustainable waste treatment by product here we tested full and partial replacement of fishmeal with ppb in fast growing carnivorous species the asian sea bass or barramundi alternative species such as shrimp and prawns that are largely detritivorous bailey brock and moss 1992 and tilapia that are omnivorous grazers may well thrive on microbial biomass and should be priorities for further study additionally potential benefits of using ppb as whole feed either directly in culture water or fed to rotifer or artemia to survival and growth during early life stages of these animals should be considered additionally and most importantly the ppb production costs need to be lowered as discussed above outdoor cultures and increased illuminated surface ratio are suitable approaches 5 conclusions this represents proof of concept for the replacement of fishmeal using a mixed population ppb biofilm generated in a photo anaerobic bioreactor panb bulk characteristics and population were consistent on synthetic and actual wastewater we encountered no significant increase in mortality associated with the use of ppb as a feed ingredient and demonstrated that up to 66 replacement of fishmeal with ppb has no significant adverse effects on fish performance for the first 28 days however full fishmeal replacement with bacterial biomass reduced growth and increased feed conversion ratio nevertheless our study strongly supports further research to identify optimal opportunities for microbial protein substitutes for fishmeal

20008,aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food production industry now producing 50 of all food fish however aquaculture feeds remain dependent on fishmeal derived from capture fisheries which must be reduced for continued sustainable growth purple phototrophic bacteria ppb efficiently yield biomass from wastewater with high product homogeneity a relatively high protein fraction and potential added value as an ingredient for fish feeds here we test bulk replacement of fishmeal with ppb microbial biomass in diets for asian sea bass lates calcarifer a high value carnivorous fish with high protein to energy requirement mixed culture ppb were grown in a novel 1 m3 attached photo biofilm process using synthetic and real wastewater four experimental diets were formulated to commercial specifications but with the fishmeal substituted 0 33 66 and 100 with the synthetic grown ppb biomass and fed to a cohort of 540 juvenile fish divided amongst 12 tanks over 47 days weight and standard length were taken from individual fish at 18 28 and 47d no significant difference in survival was observed due to diet or other factors 94 100 there was a negative correlation between ppb inclusion level and final weight p 5 94 10 5 with diet accounting for 4 1 of the variance over the trial general linear model r2 0 96 p 1 10 6 feed conversion ratio was also significantly influenced by diet p 6 10 7 with this factor accounting for 89 of variance specifically feed conversion ratio fcr rose to 1 5 for the 100 replacement diet during the last sample period approximately 1 0 for the partial replacement and 0 8 for the nil replacement diet however this study demonstrates that bulk replacement of fishmeal by ppb is feasible and commercially viable at 33 and 66 replacement graphical abstract image 1 keywords fishmeal photobioreactor purple phototrophic bacteria single cell protein 1 introduction for over five decades aquaculture has been the fastest growing animal food production industry with production expanding on average by 8 0 per year since 1961 and 47 of all food fish are now derived from aquaculture fao 2018 however there is heavy reliance on fishmeal and fish oil derived from capture fisheries to manufacture feeds for aquaculture species however this is a limited resource with very strict quotas naylor et al 2009 to reduce this pressure the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations have charged the scientific community with the investigation of alternative protein sources that are simultaneously more environmentally friendly low cost and may promote extra nutritional health benefits fao 2016 consequently there has been an acceleration of research into alternative and sustainable protein sources for use in aquaculture feeds including proteins derived from plants hardy 2010 insects stamer 2015 and microbial biomass gamboa delgado and márquez reyes 2016 microbial biomass also referred to as single cell protein scp has a range of advantages as a feed ingredient matassa et al 2016 conversion of organics nitrogen and phosphorous to proteins is highly efficient compared to for example plant based alternatives matassa et al 2016 secondly whereas plant and insect proteins are generally well digested certain fractions may contain less digestible and anti nutritional factors such as cellulose chitin and phytate microbial proteins are generally well utilised by fish and crustaceans and comprise a protein content and amino acid profiles similar to fishmeal gamboa delgado and márquez reyes 2016 whilst there has been substantial interest in proteins from algae and yeasts as ingredients for animal feeds matassa et al 2015 øverland and skrede 2017 yaakob et al 2014 microbial biomass from bacteria is regarded as one of the most promising vectors pikaar et al 2017 bacterial biomass is generally characterised by a protein content between 50 and 65 anupama and ravindra 2000 which is an important consideration when formulating feeds for popular aquaculture species such as salmon trout and barramundi where final dietary requirement may exceed 50 protein gamboa delgado and márquez reyes 2018 glencross 2006 however the majority of microbial scp production relies on aerobic heterotrophs which dissipate a substantial fraction of the energy during catabolism matassa et al 2015 limiting biological yields and conversion ratios to below 50 purple phototrophic bacteria ppb including rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp are a phylogenetically diverse group of phototrophic anoxygenic microbes that avoid this dissipation through phototrophic growth and yields close to unity hülsen et al 2018 they have been isolated from a vast variety of sources including soil fresh and marine water and wastewaters zhang et al 2003 and can be readily selected with infrared radiation ir ir is utilised as catabolic driver and enables direct and non destructive assimilative uptake of organics nitrogen and phosphorous hülsen et al 2014 at the same time ppbs exhibit high growth rates and contain 60 crude protein with additional potentially beneficial compounds such as carotenoid pigments polyhydroxyalkanoates and readily digestible cell walls kobayashi and kobayashi 1995 this makes ppb an ideal mediator for resource recovery from wastewater where ir allows for selective enrichment with little or no competition with other bacteria or algae that are unable to absorb wavelengths above 750 nm bidigare et al 1990 as a result ppb can dominate non sterile systems in a mixed culture context which enables consistent product quality this offers the ability to generate ppb as a product stream e g as feed or feed additive from industrial and potentially domestic wastewaters with health controls or phase separation pikaar et al 2017 whilst there are no studies on use of ppb as a bulk ingredient there are a number of studies investigating ppb as feed supplement at very low inclusion rates in economically important species such as nile tilapia marble goby barramundi and tor tambroides banerjee et al 2000 chowdhury et al 2016 loo et al 2015 shapawi et al 2012 these studies utilised axenic cultures rhodovulum marichromatium or rhodospeudomonas sp grown on artificial media in the formulation of their diets all studies except shapawi et al 2012 reported significantly better survival and or improved growth during the early life stages of the animals with some studies indicating unbalanced formulation for lipids or proteins banerjee et al 2000 chowdhury et al 2016 shapawi et al 2012 only reported trends of increased growth improved survival rate and better feed conversation ratio when fish were fed with 0 3 bacterial biomass loo et al 2015 fed ppb directly to marble goby fries by mixing it with tank water or by feeding it to fish via rotifer and artemia with both methods resulting in improved survival this effect was confirmed in crucian carp at ppb addition rates of 0 1 1 10

1995 these studies have demonstrated positive impacts of ppbs as a food supplement at rather low inclusion rates utilising axenic cultures they therefore represent more probiotic studies rather than a bulk feed substitute for fishmeal whole or partial and do not address the overall objective of fishmeal replacement with microbial protein in contrast the present study aims to evaluate the potential of a mixed ppb culture as a substitute for fishmeal in commercial aqua feeds for this purpose ppb grown on synthetic wastewater serve as proxy for ppb biomass generated on non sterile sources the main objectives were a characterisation of the ppb product produced in a 1 m3 wastewater pilot fed with synthetic wastewater and the comparison with ppb grown on real wastewater b determination of the effects of 33 66 and 100 fishmeal replacement with this product on performance of the fish barramundi lates calcarifer in terms of growth mortality feed conversion and whole body composition relative to a fishmeal feed control and c to determine the potential value of the ppb product in aquaculture and the potential impacts on the ppb technology as a whole 2 material and methods 2 1 purple

culture medium ppb were grown with modified ormerod medium ormerod et al 1961 with the following modifications biotin nh4 2so4 and malic acid were substituted with yeast extract 0 015 mg l 1 nh4cl 50 mg l 1 and acetic acid 500 mgcod l 1 the ph was set to 6 5 while synthetic wastewater was used to grow ppb for the feed trials the system was further operated on site at a wastewater treatment plant luggage point queensland urban utilities using domestic primary clarified wastewater in order to compare nutrient removal efficiency by ppb and to characterise the composition of the biomass grown on different sources 2 1 4 panb operation the panb was inoculated with enriched ppb and operated for 135 days on synthetic artificial wastewater including 24 harvesting events approximately every 3 days followed by 70 days on domestic wastewater after an initial start up time of 1 week ppb biomass attached to the submerged surfaces of the acrylic tubes and was harvested via manual scraping see below

aeration water temperature controlled and filtered through a mechanical and biological filtration system 2 2 1 diet formulation and preparation ppb from synthetic wastewater was used to formulate nutritionally complete diets balanced on an equal protein and energy basis using standard raw materials used in commercial barramundi feeds ridley aquafeeds australia and with ingredient chemical composition described in table 2 a briefly experimental diets were prepared with 30 fishmeal control or with substitution rates of 33 66 or 100 of the fishmeal component substituted with ppb with adjustments in other components to maintain crude protein phosphorous and lipid levels table 2b and amino acid balance based on pre analysis of ingredients see 2 3 analytical methods each raw material

were expressed as percentage survival each diet was fed manually to each tank twice daily 08 00 and 16 00 using a restrictive pair fed feeding strategy glencross et al 2003 2004 as opposed to apparent satiation or fixed ration burel et al 1998 farhangi 2001 robaina et al 1995 limiting constraint feeding prevents confounding issue of unregulated feed intake due to nutrient limited diets and allows for the standardisation of nutrient and energy utilisation of new ingredients in protein replacement studies glencross et al 2007 all diets were formulated to equivalent protein and energy levels but feed was provided at a reduced proportion from the estimated requirements based on the diet with the lowest feed intake e g usually 100 ppb diet 4 this strategy allows for the isolation of any particular effects caused by ppb protein feed intake was recorded on a daily basis for each tank based on weight of feed provided g less uneaten feed collected dried and weighed g feed consumed was accounted for each diet and corrections applied to determine daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio fcr which is the ratio of the amount of feed consumed dry weight in g to fish biomass gain live weight gain in g weight gain was derived from final weight g minus initial weight g at the end of the feeding trial day 47 all fish were humanely killed by overdose with anaesthetic aqui s prior to weight and length measurements five fish from each tank were patted dry with paper towel to remove excess water and then frozen whole for total carcass composition analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3

explanatory variable ppb inclusion was continuous rather than categorical and hence mixed mode categorical continuous linear modelling was used to assess its impact this allowed for assessment of its impact vs other factors tank number initial fish size age of fish etc effect of ppb inclusion on feed intake daily gain fcr growth rate and mortality between diets were examined using a generalized linear mixed regression model limits for all critical ranges were set at p 0 05 95 confidence interval from three replicate tanks an anovan n way analysis of variance anova was used to test the effects of multiple factors on each tank and sample point using the anovan function in matlab mathworks r2016b also see sm1 for more details linear non interaction and interaction models were tested with the non interaction model generally being used as more parsimonious where outcomes were comparable tank number was treated as categorical factor age of fish time start initial size medium or large and ppb fraction diet type were treated as primary continuous factors residual normality noting n 36 and heteroscedasticity against explanatory variables were tested and are given in the scripts while linear modelling was used as the main statistical method for overall impact comparison between pairs was done using an appropriate t test 3 results 3 1 ppb biofilm harvesting and ppb biomass characteristics a ppb biofilm was formed after 7 d post inoculation 20 l and harvesting was subsequently carried out every 3 d reusing 10 v v of the reactor liquid as inoculum the biofilm was up to 3 0 mm thick visual estimate completely covered the irradiated surface fig 1b and c and was easy to remove from the tubes non irradiated regions due to non functional leds were immediately evident as no growth occurred fig 1d approximately 1000 g wet biomass with 80 120 g l 1 dry solid was harvested per event with a peak sustained areal productivity attached of 6 0 g m2 illuminated d 1 or 22 tonnes ha 1 year 1 at 22 kwh kg 1 although the primary purpose of the ppb reactor in this study was the production of ppb rather than optimising the cod n and p removal and uptake efficiencies the potential of simultaneous uptake of resources from artificial and wastewater sources has been shown representative time series of the artificial and the domestic wastewater reactor operation over 40 d of the 135 d and over 71 d respectively are shown fig s1 the cod and nh4 n removal for the synthetic medium and the domestic wastewater were similar both around 300 mgscod l 1 and 14 mgnh4 n l 1 per batch table s2 although the tcod nh4 n and po4 p removal rates of max 120 8 0 and 1 0 mg l 1 d 1 were rather low which was likely caused by diffusion limitations this is unfavourable for high rate systems but we also note that this will ultimately depend on an optimised illuminated surface to volume ratio which would further affect the mixing and likely increase the removal rates nevertheless we consider the attached ppb growth as a successful proof of concept which requires optimisation especially with focus on the energy input the results further show the effect of attached ppb growth on the product consistency protein amino acid total carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll contents in ppb biomass grown on synthetic and domestic wastewater were almost identical with slight variations in the fat and carbohydrate contents table 1 this indicates a degree of compositional independence from the feed matrix which is crucial for product consistency on different growth media or wastewaters this is further confirmed by the sequence based analysis of the total harvested biomass in both biofilms grown on artificial and domestic wastewater ppb were dominant 70 of sequences bradyrhizobiaceae rhodobacteraceae with rhodopseudomonas sp and rhodobacter sp accounting for up to up to 32 and 15 artificial medium and 44 and 39 in domestic wastewater fig s2 table 1 also contains amino acid profiles of suspended ppb grown on pork flush poultry and red meat processing wastewater hülsen et al 2018 and we hypothesise the general feasibility of attached ppb growth for these wastewaters and similar biomass compositions 3 2 description of feed processing and diet preparation moisture crude lipid crude protein and crude ash ranged from 3 0 to 5 2 11 8 13 3 55 5 57 3 and 8 0 9 4 respectively table 2c diets 3 and 4 containing the two highest inclusions of ppb had a notable smell and were much darker in colour fig s3 the 2 mm fraction collected after the blending and sieving steps represented 93 of all gradients size pellets regardless of the diet retained structural stability after 10 min immersion in water water from tanks receiving diet 4 and 3 were slightly more turbid than from diet 1 and 2 and this usually occurred for 10 15 min following feeding the amino acid profiles of all feeds were determined and are provided in table 2c with no significant correlation to ppb fraction in diet for all 17 amino acids p 0 05 tested in matlab but not reported here 3 3 fish growth performance a summary of growth performance outcomes daily growth rate feed intake feed conversion ratio fcr weight length gain and survival for the four treatments are shown in fig 2 and table 3 feed intake was not significantly impacted by ppb inclusion suggesting that replacement of fishmeal with ppb protein did not affect palatability of the diets survival of barramundi fingerlings after 47 days was high 94 100 with no significant differences between diets or any other factors p 0 05 three fish died in one tank in the initial period but following this only one further fish died in a different tank over the trial all fish that died were abnormally small below average weight of the cohort and presented signs of aggression by others fish in all tanks increased in weight over time fig s4 during the 47 days of the trial fish grew more than five fold table 3 with fish fed control diet 1 increasing by 7 1 0 9 fold those fed diet 2 30 fm replacement by 6 1 0 6 fold fish fed diet 3 66 fm replacement increasing 5 8 0 3 fold and fish fed diet 4 100 fm replacement growing 5 4 0 8 fold table 3 to predict weight a simple linear model with explanatory factors age initial size and diet was as effective as a more complex interaction model r2 0 96 vs r2 0 98 and the simpler model was used average weight was primarily driven by the age of fish p 5 10 23 80 of variance secondarily by initial size p 8 10 12 12 of variance and finally by diet p 1 10 06 4 1 of variance the model r2 was 0 96 indicating very little residual variance probably due to the fact that each observation was averaged from 50 individual fish weight and length gain at the end of the trial were negatively correlated with increasing level of ppb with p values of 0 0037 and 0 0003 respectively table 3 daily gain effectively removes the cumulative weight effect of time i e fish get bigger over time leaving analysis of the possibility that bigger or older fish grow faster or slower there was no significant tank effect on the daily individual live weight gain instead daily gain was impacted positively by time older fish grow faster p 4 10 5 positively by initial size p 0 0029 big initial size results in higher daily gain and negatively by ppb inclusion rate p 0 0001 r2 for the linear model was 0 62 vs interaction model r2 0 7 slight improvement an r2 of 0 62 indicates that the main factors were highly explanatory even with the cumulative growth effect of time removed for the first 28 d of the trial there was no effect of ppb on daily weight gain p 0 3 fig 2a from day 28 until day 47 ppb inclusion rate had a negative correlation with daily gain p 0 008 and 5 94 10 5 respectively fig 2a fish fed diet 4 100 fm replacement had the lowest gain at both sample times as fish grew older from day 18 to day 28 the daily gain significantly increased in all diet treatments p 0 0001 at the end of the feed trial daily weight gain slightly increased in fish fed diet 1 0 fm replacement but remained unchanged for fish fed diet 2 and 3 and decreased for fish fed diet 4 fig 2a feed conversion ratio varied substantially with time p 6 10 9 and diet p 6 10 7 fig 2b but tank allocation and initial size had no impact on fcr comparison of linear models and interaction models and removing non significant factors resulted in two candidate models each involving only time and diet the best model was a two factor model diet and time diet r2 0 89 which was better than the two parameter linear model time and diet r2 0 75 and not worse than the full 3 parameter interaction r2 0 90 time alone not significant this optimal model predicted ppb fraction in diet negatively affecting fcr p 4 10 7 fraction of variance 0 12 with a highly significant interaction between time diet type p 7 10 15 fraction of variance 0 6 the primary linear factor indicates a slight decrease in fcr with increased ppb inclusion rate i e beneficial impact but the latter dominates and is a detrimental impact overall at an earlier time point diet is less important to fcr while at later times diet has a strong impact in increasing fcr detrimental this can be effectively seen in fig 2b also where only at later periods and at higher dietary ppb inclusion rate does the fcr rise substantially above 1 daily feed intake was not impacted by tanks or diet however it was slightly impacted by the initial size and naturally time p 4 10 15 of the fish p 6 10 6 with larger animals consuming more feed than smaller ones there were no interactions between primary factors and as expected no differences observed in feed intakes between diets at any given time restrictive pair fed feeding strategy further analysis regressing daily intake vs fish weight at tend vs ppb fraction found that apart from the strong correlation with fish weight p 1 10 18 there was a significant positive correlation with ppb inclusion 0 005 r2 0 9 3 4 carcass composition fish carcass compositions are presented in table s3 three samples were analysed per diet treatment one for each replicate tank each sample was composed of five representative animals per tank differences in moisture protein lipid ash and carbohydrate were analysed by linear regression increasing level of ppb in the diets had a negative correlation with protein content in fish carcasses p 0 0220 with carcasses of fish fed diet 4 having the lowest protein content increasing level of ppb had a positive correlation on ash content of the carcass p 0 0032 with ash content maximum in carcasses of fish fed diet 4 carcasses of fish fed diet 3 formulated with 66 ppb as fishmeal replacement had the highest level of lipid among all diets including control though no statistically significant correlation was detected by regression ppb concentration in diet had no effect on moisture or carbohydrate content in carcasses of animals fed the diets p 0 05 elemental analyses in diets and carcasses of fish fed the diets are presented in table s1 potassium phosphorous magnesium and calcium increased by 7 21 12 and 27 respectively from reference to complete fishmeal replacement while sulphur and sodium decreased by 12 and 22 levels of calcium between diets did not show a particular trend but its levels in fish carcasses composition increased significantly p 1 20 10 4 iron levels in diets increased by 37 in diets with 66 and 100 ppb inclusion but remained constant in fish carcasses potassium levels were fairly constant in diets and no differences in body compositions observed magnesium levels increased gradually in experimental diets up to 48 in diet 4 so as its levels in fish carcasses p 7 06 10 3 sodium increased in diets up to 43 in diet 4 but decreased significantly in fish fed experimental diets p 6 88 10 4 phosphorous level was maximum in diet 3 23 higher than control diet 1 and increased significantly in carcases of fish fed increasing level of ppb p 1 61 10 4 as expected sulphur levels increased along with fm replacement up to 33 in diet 4 but its levels decreased significantly in carcasses of fish p 5 25 10 5 concentrations of copper iron lead and zinc remained constant in all fish carcasses tested 4 discussion fishmeal for aquaculture feed production in 2013 used 73 of total forage fish derived from the capture fisheries shepherd and jackson 2013 and recent data suggest that most of this fish is suitable for human food use cashion et al 2017 consequently replacement or reduction of fishmeal as protein source in aquaculture feeds is critical to continued growth of fish farming as a foundation for future food security naylor et al 2009 troell et al 2014 microbial derived proteins are of particular interest as they can be readily produced on inexpensive carbon sources and as byproducts of other processes such as brewing and waste treatment matassa et al 2016 øverland and skrede 2017 here we show that bacterial biomass derived from synthetic or domestic wastewater using photoactive bioreactors can be substituted for fishmeal in diets for the popular tropical aquaculture fish barramundi asian sea bass l calcarifer with moderate impact on main indicators fish growth rate fcr and with commercially viable outcomes given this is a proof of concept study with feed formulation not yet optimised for differences between ppb and fishmeal as primary protein source there remains substantial scope to further improve these outcomes these aspects are discussed further in this section 4 1 ppb from water treatment is a consistent quality ingredient ppb produced using synthetic or domestic wastewater in photoactive bioreactors was consistent in terms of bacterial community protein lipid and carbohydrate content in agreement with previous research where biomass derived from bioreactors operating on wastewater streams from pork dairy and poultry processing were compared hülsen et al 2018 consistent ingredient quality is critical for commercial feed production and is a common problem for formulation tangendjaja 2015 so the product consistency across synthetic wastewater domestic wastewater this study and disparate waste streams hülsen et al 2018 is an advantage of the ppb biomass protein content of the ppb biomass was reasonably high 57 making it possible to substitute at quite high rates in feeds for carnivorous fish where dietary protein requirement may be between 40 and 55 this compares favourably with other microbial protein sources such as yeast fungi and microalgae where protein content is substantially less than 50 gong et al 2018 øverland and skrede 2017 vidakovic et al 2016 4 2 ppb is effective as a partial fishmeal substitute in aqua feeds for farmed barramundi growth performance outcomes demonstrated progressive but fractional losses in fish performance indicators as ppb fraction or protein input increased generally significant across all treatments but not between neighbouring treatments the main effect was on performance indicators growth daily weight gain and fcr rather than mortality and carcass composition in terms of commercial viability up to 66 of the fishmeal could be substituted with purple phototrophic bacteria without a major impact on the fish performance parameters for the first 28 d of the trial noting that the impact is progressive after 28 d it is important to consider that the diet 4 in the present study contained zero fishmeal and the results are consistent with other studies where complete substitution was considered for example replacement of fishmeal with soybean and poultry meal in barramundi diets resulted reduced weight gain and increased feed conversion that was significant when replacement was 66 or 100 glencross et al 2016 indeed over the duration of the trial fcr remained at around 1 for diets with 33 and 66 of fm replaced by ppb the reason for the increased fcr and decreased daily weight gain at high replacement levels need to be further investigated similar impact on growth and feed conversion was noted in arctic charr fed on diets with 40 fm replaced by intact baker s yeast s cerevisiae or filamentous fungal biomass rhizopus oryzae vidakovic et al 2016 the negative effect of yeast inclusion on fcr and final weight was abrogated in arctic charr by pre lysing the yeast cells vidakovic et al 2016 resulting in improved apparent digestibility of the protein and amino acids in the diet langeland et al 2016 it is therefore possible that pre lysis of ppb biomass may increase the performance at higher substitution rates and is worthy of further study albeit that there would be additional processing cost other potential factors impacting final weight and fcr may include the presence of nucleic acids in the ppb biomass as high levels would increase the energy cost for barramundi to metabolise them while nucleotides are semi essential nutrients in many animals including fish and shrimp burrells et al 2001 carver and walker 1995 do et al 2012 hoang do et al 2013 nucleic acids need first to be processed via the salvage pathway prior to supplying to new genetic material during growth moreover excess nucleotides need to be excreted and accrue a metabolic cost as a consequence levels must be optimised for each species and age as requirement decreases in older animals do et al 2012 li and gatlin 2006 similar considerations apply to complex carbohydrates that could lead to gut irritation and lower digestibility these will be tested in future digestibility experiments we demonstrated successfully that the inclusion up to 33 fm replacement with ppb would have little or no impact on barramundi growth performance therefore we can recover resources from wastewater transform them into ppb biomass and convert it to a useful feed ingredient reducing the reliance on wild caught fishmeal in contrast deleterious effects on growth feed intake and feed conversion have been reported when microalgae were used at concentrations as low as 12 total inclusion 14 2 fm substitution with phaeodactylum tricornutum sorensen et al 2016 and 20 total inclusion for defatted nannochloropsis biomass sorensen et al 2017 while the bulk properties amino acid profile metals profile etc were comparable across the four diets ppb has a number of additional active compounds vitamins biopolymers phas carotenoids and bacteriochlorophylls which are important to commercial fish rearing ppb contain a range of vitamins e g b2 b12 e and niacin sasaki et al 1991 which are important for fish growth and are routinely added to commercial feed vitamin premix including in the current study if substantially substituted by native compounds in ppb this would allow reduction of premix from commercial feed formulations with associated cost saving the same applies for carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll which in this study were present in the ppb product used to formulate the diets at 6 8 g kg 1 and 11 3 g kg 1 respectively interestingly pigments were stable after the steaming and overnight drying steps of the pellets their levels of detection in the diets were in accordance with the concentration of ppb biomass used in the formulation of the diets fig s5 these pigments serve as anti oxidants and play an important role on the coloration of fish skin flesh sasaki et al 1991 and are consequently added to diets for salmonids and marine shrimp as astaxanthin to improve meat colour torrissen and christiansen 1995 wade et al 2017 4 3 significance and application to wastewater treatment industry the application of ppb biomass for fishmeal substitution adds value to the ppb biomass this primarily but not limited to concerns the value of bulk protein where fishmeal fluctuates in price according to grades and availability in the last 5 years prices have ranged from 1 919 us metric ton 1 01 2013 to 1 296 00 us metric ton 1 04 2017 and last recorded at 1 604 us metric ton 1 03 2018 or 2 5 3 us per kg crude protein assuming 65 cp www indexmundi com commodities commodity fish meal months 120 future prices are expected to increase due to overfishing and catch quota tveteras and asche 2008 moreover supply restriction during climatic events for example fishery closure during el niño events are likely to increase in frequency and duration forcing prices higher ubilava 2014 for the wastewater treatment industry preferably agri industry sources e g food processors abattoirs or comparable industries this means the production of ppb from their wastewaters will add an additional income stream the ppb technology has the potential to remove organics nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater lowering the discharge costs while simultaneously transforming these constituents into protein rich biomass at yields around 0 8 gcod 1 hülsen et al 2018 general ppb applicability has been demonstrated in dairy red meat poultry processing wastewaters and pork flush with a characteristic profile of mixed culture ppb extensively discussed with respect to those protein sources hülsen et al 2018 ppb from different sources has been found to be very consistent almost independent from the wastewater source as indicated with the comparison of ppb composition grown on synthetic and domestic wastewater table 1 this can provide feed manufacturers with a valuable ingredient stream largely independent from seasonal variations the areal productivity of 6 g m 2 d 1 is rather high compared to e g immobilised attached algae biofilm productivities e g 0 71 ozkan et al 2012 and 0 58 2 57 g m 2 d 1 johnson and wen 2010 6 g m 2 d 1 is rather high compared to e g immobilised attached algae biofilm productivities e g 0 71 ozkan et al 2012 and 0 58 2 57 g m 2 d 1 johnson and wen 2010 the growth of ppb is naturally coupled with removal of carbon and nutrients through assimilative growth myung et al 2004 tadesse et al 2003 although the attached reactor concept utilised to grow the ppb had low removal rates and required a high energy input mainly for illumination the concept of attached biofilms on ir illuminated submerged tubes for consistent biomass quality seems technically feasible the tubes are by no means the final design and significantly higher illuminated surface to volume ratios can be easily achieved e g with smaller tube diameters or in a flat plate reactors e g 67 m2 m 3 norsker et al 2011 this can further improve the mixing and the removal rates which might also lead to increased attached areal productivities e g due to faster growth and more frequent harvesting rather than increased density the logical step would be the use of outdoor cultures which would harvest natural light drastically increasing illumination intensity and reducing illumination costs to zero while sacrificing 12 h of illuminated operation due to night day cycles 4 4 ppb as aquaculture input further research needs our results suggest that ppb up to 33 10 could offer an alternative to fishmeal with little or no detrimental effect on fish performance in barramundi a tropical species with high dietary protein requirement it may be possible to address the penalties in fcr and growth at higher inclusion levels by relatively inexpensive and simple ingredient pre treatment eg hydrolysis as this improved digestibility and performance of baker s yeast in arctic charr vidakovic et al 2016 a fish which also has dietary protein requirement in addition the potential beneficial impact of vitamins and other compounds including carotenoids chlorophylls and biopolymers such as phb needs to be assessed to change the overall optimal formulation for commercial utilisation it is noted that this study focused on manual preparation of relatively small amounts of feed though still with a large number of individual animals the encouraging results of the present study justify a larger trial involving preparation of larger volumes of feed with a commercial extruder given the relatively high carotenoid content in ppb and its stability through feed processing demonstrated in this study assessment of performance in feeds for high value crustaceans such as tiger prawns p monodon that can utilise these carotenoids wade et al 2017 to improve product quality should be a priority there is clear potential here for added value beyond replacement of fishmeal with a sustainable waste treatment by product here we tested full and partial replacement of fishmeal with ppb in fast growing carnivorous species the asian sea bass or barramundi alternative species such as shrimp and prawns that are largely detritivorous bailey brock and moss 1992 and tilapia that are omnivorous grazers may well thrive on microbial biomass and should be priorities for further study additionally potential benefits of using ppb as whole feed either directly in culture water or fed to rotifer or artemia to survival and growth during early life stages of these animals should be considered additionally and most importantly the ppb production costs need to be lowered as discussed above outdoor cultures and increased illuminated surface ratio are suitable approaches 5 conclusions this represents proof of concept for the replacement of fishmeal using a mixed population ppb biofilm generated in a photo anaerobic bioreactor panb bulk characteristics and population were consistent on synthetic and actual wastewater we encountered no significant increase in mortality associated with the use of ppb as a feed ingredient and demonstrated that up to 66 replacement of fishmeal with ppb has no significant adverse effects on fish performance for the first 28 days however full fishmeal replacement with bacterial biomass reduced growth and increased feed conversion ratio nevertheless our study strongly supports further research to identify optimal opportunities for microbial protein substitutes for fishmeal

20009,novel flexible thin mm sized resistance typed sensor film mrsf fabricated using ink jet printing technology ipt was developed in this study to monitor water flow rate in pipelines in real time in situ mode the mechanism of mrsf is that the mm sized interdigitated electrodes made by printing silver nanoparticles on an elastic polyimide film bend under different flow rates leading to variation of the resistance of the sensor at different degrees of curvature continuous flow tests showed that mrsf possessed a high accuracy 0 2 m s and excellent sensitivity 0 1447 ms 1 a model of sensor resistance and flow velocity was established to unfold the correlation between the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and the mechanic flexibility of sensor materials an analytical model yielded a high coefficient of determination r2 0 93 for the relationship between the resistance increment of the mrsf and the square of the flow velocity at the velocity range of 0 25 2 m s furthermore a temperature correction model was developed to quantify the effect of water temperature on the sensor resistance readings mrsf exhibited a low temperature coefficient of resistance tcr 0 001 at the water temperature range of 20 60 c computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations using the finite element method were conducted and confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions high resolution monitoring of water flow rate using mrsf technology was expected to save at least 50 energy consumption for a given unit especially under flow fluctuation mrsf possesses a great potential to perform real time in situ monitoring at high accuracy with ultralow cost thus enabling the feedback control at high spatiotemporal resolution to reduce the overall energy consumption in water and wastewater systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords mm sized resistance type sensor film mrsf flow velocity

feedback control process analysis and energy consumption since it directly affects the operation and loading capacity of each treatment unit in water and wastewater treatment plants real time in situ accurate measurement can provide first hand information for the quantity of the inlet and outlet throughout each unit and the treatment plant as a whole evans et al 2004 for instance wastewater flow in a combined sewer system under shocks e g heavy rainfall or snowmelt can be 1 2 1 4 times or even twice as that in normal days müller and krauth 1998 leading to substantial fluctuation to wastewater

normal condition müller and krauth 1998 mines et al 2007 kim et al 2017 leading to the lack of nutrient and organic matters to microorganisms in activated sludge or biofilms schalk otte et al 2000 mohan et al 2007 unnecessary high aeration intensity and ultimately deteriorating the treatment efficiency thus it is critical to monitor the transient variations of water flow of diverse treatment units at a high spectral temporal resolution and enhance the resilience and robustness of wwtps at an energy saving mode traditional water flow sensors widely used include orifices flowmeters and turbine flowmeters morrison et al 2001 baker 2004 singh et al 2004 manshoor et al 2011 specifically orifice flowmeter measures the flow velocity by the liquid differential pressure through the flowmeter and normally has low accuracy error 2 4 of real flow rate due to the low contraction in the downstream mccabe et al 1985 flow 1995 seader et al 1997 baker 2005 digiacomo 2011 and imposes

yan et al 2011 2013 xu et al 2016 2017 for the flow sensor mm sized interdigitated silver nanoparticle ink lines can be printed onto an elastic polyimide film and then sliced into a pipeline vertically and perpendicularly facing to water flow the elastic film is expected to bend under different flow velocities and the resistance of the silver nanoparticles ink lines will consequently change with the bending deflection and associated curvature of the film through which the flow velocity can be monitored in a real time in situ mode the breakthrough of this study lies in the development of flat thin mm sized resistance type sensor film mrsf capable of monitoring flow velocities in situ at low fabrication cost and with minimal installation and maintenance needs and the development of a series of analytical and computational fluid dynamics cfd models using the finite element method to elucidate the impacts of flow velocity and temperature on the mrsf accuracy there were five tasks in this study first an analytical mathematical model was established to determine the correlation of mrsf material mechanic flexibility bending curvature and flow velocity second mrsfs with two film thicknesses were examined at different flow velocities in a lab scale continuous flow system and site by side compared with a commercial paddlewheel flow sensor using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technique hughes et al 1981 duarte et al 2004 the flow in the vicinity of the thin film sensor was simulated using cfd in the comsol modeling framework and the effected deformation of the sensor was analyzed third the impact of temperature on the resistance readings of mrsfs was examined in water solution at various temperatures a model considering the absolute error of sensor the actual flow velocity the temperature change temperature coefficient of resistance tcr and flexural rigidity was established fourth the long term stability of mrsfs was examined by submerging in wastewater for over 4 weeks with the resistance of mrsfs being measured and the surface property being observed before and after the immersion finally the energy saving in terms of aeration and chemical dosage through high resolution monitoring of water velocity using mrsfs was simulated in an anoxic aerobic wwtp under flow fluctuation 2 materials and methods 2 1 mechanisms of mm sized resistance type sensor film mrsf the fundamental mechanism of mm sized resistance type sensor film mrsf is the variation of the sensor resistance with the curvature degree of the interdigitated silver nanoparticle ink printed on the flexible thin polyimide kapton film at different water flow velocities specifically the kapton film is held fixed on one end and is free to bend on the free end in analogous fashion to a cantilever beam the kapton film remains completely vertical when the liquid in the pipeline is static and the resistance of mrsf at this position is recorded as the baseline then the kapton film is bent when the liquid flows through the pipeline and the curvature increases with the flow velocity fig 1 a there are two main assumptions to simplify the force analysis and calculation first the flow near the pipe wall moves very slowly due to the no slip boundary condition while the flow near the center of the pipe is the fastest munson et al 2014 however due to the small diameter of the pipe plastic pipe internal diameter id 10 cm the flow velocity of the liquid is assumed to be almost uniform across the pipeline section in this study to simplify the calculations munson et al 2014 this is a reasonable assumption particularly for turbulent flows and the associated flow velocity profile it was verified that this is indeed the case with high resolution cfd simulations which will be discussed in the results section second due to the slim thickness 150 μm of the sensor kapton film the whole film would be simplified as a one unit area e g from point a to point b in the force analysis fig 1b where point a is fixed on the pipeline wall and point b is free and deformed under the influence of the flow the deflection and the deflection angle of point b are yb and θ b respectively q is the load caused by the liquid flow and the quantity ei boresi et al 1993 is referred to as the flexural rigidity fig 1b 2 2 analytical model for the dependence of mrsf resistance on curvature at different flow velocities a series of models were integrated to establish the correlation between the mechanical flexibility of mrsf film bending curvature and water flow velocity fig 2 to start with the mrsf was essentially a resistance temperature detector rtd rosal et al 2010 blasdel et al 2015 with the resistance being linearly related to the length of the sensor eq 1 xu et al 2016 2017 1 r ρ s l a r where ρs is resistivity l is the length and a r is the cross sectional area the unique configuration of the flat flexible thin mrsf fig 1a made the resistance increase with the length of the resistor therefore the relative resistance increment of mrsf was proportionally related to the maximum deflection angle or curvature of the mrsf caused by the liquid flow pang et al 2012 as described in eq 2 2 δ r r r kθ max where k is the deflection coefficient rr is the static mrsf reference resistance at 20 c δ r is the difference between the resistance of the bending mrsf and the baseline resistance of the static mrsf at 20 c δ r r r is the relative resistance increment of the mrsf θ max is the maximum deflection angle of all the points on the mrsf which typically occurs at the free end for a cantilever beam the drag force experienced by an object immersed in a moving fluid is described in eq 3 munson et al 2014 3 f d 1 2 a f c d ρ v 2 where f d is the drag force which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity ρ is the mass density of the fluid v is the flow velocity a f is the film area perpendicular to the flow and c d is the drag coefficient which in general depends on the reynolds number the maximum deflection angle θ max occurred on the far end of the mrsf point b in fig 1b boresi et al 1993 ugural and fenster 2011 4 θ max ql 3 6 ei where q is the continuous load applied on the mrsf equals to the force on the unit area f d a f by substituting eq 3 into eq 4 the maximum deflection angle θ max is shown in eq 5 5 θ max c d ρl 3 12 ei v 2 substituting eq 5 into eq 2 the relationship between the relative change of the sensor resistance and the flow velocity could be described in eq 6 6 δ r r r k c d ρl 3 12 ei v 2 the liquid used for flow velocity tests in this study was tap water at 20 c and its density was stable around 1000 kg m3 tanaka et al 2001 the flexural rigidity ei and the film length l were kept the same after fabrication therefore the relationship between the mrsf resistance and the flow velocity is simplified in eq 7 7 δ r r r k v 2 where k is the adjusted deflection coefficient therefore a linear model between the relative resistance increment and the square of the flow velocity was established in this study the whole calculation process was simplified by substituting the force load into the mrsf moment equation fig 2 2 3 fabrication of mrsf a clean polyimide kapton film thickness 127 μm american durafilm was washed with deionized water di water and ethanol sigma aldrich co to remove any residual organic inorganic trace on the film surface the silver ink was prepared by mixing silver ag nanoparticles suntronic silver sigma aldrich co and ethylene glycol fisher scientific co at the ratio of 3 1 the silver ink on the kapton film was printed using a dimatix materials printer modeldmp 2800 fujifilm dimatix inc in which liquid crystal polymer printer cartridges model dmclcp 11610 fujifilm dimatix inc were used to house the silver ink the printing pattern was designed using the autocad program and transferred by the linkcad program the sensor was printed as the resistance temperature detector rtd fig 3 a which was designed as a 15 μm space between the ink drops by using a customized printing waveform with each pattern being printed using two jets for facile detection of any potential clog the printing process was performed as described in previous studies xu et al 2016 2017 after the printing the whole sensor on the film was coated with the silicon paste dow corning 732 multipurpose sealant using a small brush to protect the electrodes directly contacting the liquid solution and then air dried for 20 min for the single film mrsf there were three layers including the substrate layer electrode layer and protective layer fig 3b the size of the single film mrsf was 35 mm 18 mm 0 2 mm length by width by thickness e 2 5 gpa fig 3c the connect pad was printed on the top of the mrsf to connect with a multimeter mastech ms828 digital ac dc auto range digital multimeter through copper wires in addition two film mrsf size 35 mm 18 mm 0 3 mm length by width by thickness e 8 5 gpa was fabricated by sticking two kapton fpc flexible printed circuits films together using silicon glue clear window and door sealant ge fig 3b the single film mrsf and two film mrsf were compared to determine the impact of the bending stiffness on the correlation between the sensor resistance and the flow velocity since the increase in the mrsf resistance was expected to be correlated with the flexural rigidity of the film material the resistance of mrsfs was measured as around 535 ω after fabrication 2 4 tests in a lab scale continuous flow pipeline system and comparison with a commercial flow sensor the water flow velocity in sewage piping and pumping systems should exceed 0 6 m s epa office of water 2002 nayyar 1992 board 2004 jones et al 2006 to avoid the settling and deposition of solids on pipelines while the flow velocity should be lower than 2 0 m s epa office of water 2002 nayyar 1992 board 2004 jones et al 2006 to avoid potential wear and tear to pipelines in this study the flow rate range was applied from 0 25 m s to 2 m s which covered the normal range 0 6 m s 2 m s in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the low range 0 25 m s 0 6 m s at slow flow scenario the whole experiment setup consisted of a pump unimount 125 u s electronical motors with an adjustable butterfly valve spears co usa to control the flow rate of tap water conductivity 4 42 μs cm temperature 20 c from the university water supply system a commercial paddlewheel sensor fp 5300 flow sensor omega engineering inc for comparison a test pipeline i d 9 86 cm schedule 80 pvc pipe mcmaster carr company and two 4 pvc saddle fittings omega engineering inc for installing the commercial sensor and mrsf onto the pipeline before the tests the mrsf length 3 5 cm width 1 8 cm was inserted into the fitting screw cap i d 2 6 cm model 450 010 spears co and then glued onto the cap using an epoxy 5 m quick cure epoxy jsp fig 3d afterwards the fitting cap with the glued mrsf was vertically installed into the pipeline the two types mrsfs single film and double film were examined in the pipeline individually during the tests the valve for controlling the flow rate was gradually opened to increase the flow rate steadily from 0 25 m s the minimal value to 2 m s the maximum value the tests were replicated for three times at each velocity the mrsf would bend under different flow rates fig 3e leading to variation of the resistance of the sensor at different degrees of curvature the resistance of the mrsf was recorded using a digital multimeter mastech ms828 digital ac dc auto range digital multimeter and the value of the commercial flow sensor was recorded 1 min after adjusting the valve in order to obtain the readings at the stable flow status 2 5 model simulation of mrsf curvature at different flow rates using the comsol multiphysics using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technique hughes et al 1981 duarte et al 2004 the flow in the vicinity of the thin mrsf sensor was simulated and the effected deformation of the sensor was analyzed the flow simulation in the pipe mirrored the experimental conditions and was conducted in the comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa modeling framework water flows from left to right and in the middle of the channel it imposes drag force on the deformable sensor which is fixed at the bottom of the pipe the computational method handles the deformation bend of the sensor by the moving mesh technique navier stokes equations are solved for moving coordinates in order to calculate the velocity field and the strain stress and deformation experienced by the sensor as computed by the model the channel is assumed to be 0 5 m 0 1 m and the sensor has a height of 35 mm fig 3f the young s modulus of the sensor is set at 2 5 gpa and the film thickness was varied between 0 2 and 0 3 mm in order to account for possible imperfections using the equivalence of flexural rigidity the thickness and young s modulus of the sensor were modified to simulate a less computationally demanding model considering the size of the domain as well as the moving mesh technique a triangular mesh consisting of 19 014 domain elements and 398 boundary elements was used in all the simulations fig s1 2 6 temperature correction of mrsf because the mrsf is based on the variation of the resistance of the interdigitated electrodes under different flow velocities the influence of the variation of liquid temperature on the silver ink should be minimized to avoid the measurement error in this study mrsf was put into water with varied temperatures to examine the stability of the resistance readings briefly the working electrode and counter reference electrodes of the mrsf were individually connected to a potentiostat gamry reference 600 then the mrsf was immersed into the di water in a beaker on the heater thermolyne 1000 hotplate a commercial temperature sensor thermo scientific orion 3 star conductivity meter was put into the beaker near the mrsf the water solution was heated from 20 c to 60 c that simulated adversely low and high wastewater temperature lapara et al 2001 during which the mrsf was applied with the current time program at a setting potential 0 2 v and the resistance ohm of the mrsf was recorded every 100 s for the duration of 2300 s 2 7 long term stability of mrsf for 4 week operational period long term stability of the mrsf is important for flow velocity monitoring especially in wastewater pipelines electrode fouling caused by the attachment of inorganic and organic constituents is an inevitable phenomenon that would affect the monitoring accuracy and signal sensitivity in long run zhu et al 2009 pikaar et al 2011 the electrode fouling would increase the electrode resistance by destroying the electrode surface structure to minimize biofouling the whole electrode part silver particles of mrsfs was protected by a silicon glue layer which covered the whole electrode part the mrsf stability in wastewater was examined within 4 week operational period multiple pieces of mrsfs were immersed into static wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod 250 350 mg l 1 and biological oxygen demand bod 100 300 mg l 1 collected from the influent section of the university of connecticut wastewater treatment plant uconn wwtp a mrsf sample was taken from the wastewater every week and gently rinsed by di water for 5 s before the surface observation using a digital microscope nikon labophot the mrsf resistances were measured at the room temperature 20 c using a digital multimeter mastech ms828 digital ac dc auto range digital multimeter weekly throughout the 4 week period to determine the electrode fouling extent in addition bacterial attachment on a solid surface had been found to correlate with the surface hydrophilicity li and logan 2004 fraiwan et al 2013 thereby the static contact angles of the mrsf were examined in duplicate tests using a cam 101 optical surface tension meter before and after the immersion to elucidate the sensor surface hydrophilicity ksv instrument inc hua et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of mrsf at different flow velocities and validated by the commercial flow sensor considering the flow velocity was 0 25 2 m s in this study the diameter of the pipe was 0 0986 m ρ was 1000 kg m 3 and μ was 0 001 pa s at the 20 c the reynolds number re ranged from 2 4 104 to 1 97 105 indicating that the flow in this study is indeed turbulent ergas and rheinheimer 2004 the flow results are reasonable and clearly indicate the existence of a turbulent flow velocity profile with almost constant flow velocity over most of the pipe cross section fig 3g for the film dimensions and the flow conditions c d varies modestly between 1 1 and 1 9 because the flow in this study was turbulent and c d was approximately constant the model between the mrsf s resistance and the flow velocity as shown in fig 2 and eq 7 was considered acceptable the sensitivity k of the single film mrsf was 0 1447 ms 1 and the k of the double film mrsf is 0 0721 ms 1 fig 4 implying that the single film mrsf was more sensitive than double film mrsf the model previously reported wang et al 2007b zhang et al 2010 was built upon the absolute resistance change with the flow velocity which had a problem of the different original resistances caused by the fabrication process such as inkjet printing or the photolithography xu et al 2016 2017 in contrast the relative resistance change δ r r r deployed in this study minimized the influence caused by the different sensor fabrication processes previous studies had found that resistance change was 125 ω ms 1 at the original resistance of 17 000 ω meaning the sensitivity was 0 007 ms 1 based on the relative resistance change zhang et al 2010 the maximum sensitivity was 0 0284 ω ms 1 at the original resistance of 5 ω wang et al 2007b meaning that the sensitivity was 0 00568 ms 1 based on the relative resistance change sensor sensitivity ranging from 0 652 10 5 to 4 489 10 5 ms 1 had been reported su et al 2002 mrsf exhibited a much better sensitivity single film mrsf 0 1447 ms 1 double film mrsf 0 0721 ms 1 than these studies su et al 2002 kao et al 2007 wang et al 2007b 2009 zhang et al 2010 which was attributed to the flexible thin kapton film fig 3e and the excellent adhesion of silver nanoparticle ink onto the film while the sensors in previous studies were fabricated from piezo shaped silicon material siox or sinx using photolithography and resulted in a rigid structure that was less flexible under water flow su et al 2002 kao et al 2007 wang et al 2007b 2009 zhang et al 2010 such a high sensitivity offers mrsfs a distinct advantage to real time detect the transient variation of wastewater flow of each treatment unit across wwtps leading to a swift and proactive control strategy to save energy consumption and sustain good treatment efficiency in addition due to the same density and dimension of two types of sensors tested single film and double film eq 6 the sensitivity of sensors was only related to the flexural rigidity ei of the sensor material which was only affected by the film thickness boresi et al 1993 kao et al 2007 wang et al 2009 ugural and fenster 2011 based on e 2 5 gpa and i 1 2 10 14 m4 an estimation of flexural rigidity for the kapton film with a thickness of 0 2 mm resulted in 3 10 5 n m2 which was consistent with the experimental values reported for pet polyethylene terephthalate price 1966 the sensitivity of the single film mrsf was slightly higher than twice that of the double film mrsf fig 4 it should be noted that the double film mrsf was fabricated by gluing two pieces of single layer kapton film using silicon paste which increased the flexural rigidity and slightly reduced the sensitivity of the double film mrsf the r 2 values for the relative resistance increment of the mrsf as a function of the square of the flow velocity were 0 94 and 0 95 for single film and double film respectively fig 4 indicating a high sensor resolution precision similar to previous studies su et al 2002 kao et al 2007 wang et al 2007b 2009 zhang et al 2010 single film mrsf and double film mrsf exhibited an excellent correlation with the commercial paddlewheel flow sensor with a slope of 1 0298 and 1 0281 respectively fig 5 a both slopes were tested against the ideal slope of one according to the following hypotheses h 0 β 1 1 h 1 β 1 1 in both cases we cannot reject the hypothesis that the slope is equal to one with p 0 2079 and 0 3016 for single film and double film mrsf respectively the r2 values were above 0 90 indicating the good linearity between the flow velocity measured by the mrsf and the commercial sensor the flow velocity disparity between the mrsf and the commercial sensor would be recognized as the error accuracy 1 in this study the error of mrsfs was between 0 1 0 25 m s throughout all the tests and decreased with the flow velocity fig 5b in the flow velocity range 0 6 m s 2 m s that usually occurs in the wwtp operation the error of mrsfs was between 0 1 0 2 m s fig 5 which met the epa standard less than 10 of the flow rate baker 2005 at the low flow velocity 0 25 m s 0 6 m s the error of mrsfs was 0 1 0 25 m s which was beyond the permissible error by epa standards baker 2005 meaning that mrsf could not accurately measure the low flow velocity but could still be used as the warning indicator for the occurrence of low flow velocity specially to prevent the particle deposition in pipeline epa office of water 2002 nayyar 1992 board 2004 jones et al 2006 a small error 2 of the flow rate had been found in previous studies wang et al 2007b which was caused by the relative stable mechanical structure of the sensor cantilever beam structure in contrast a study using the similar structure as mrsf had found a high error 16 7 at the low flow velocity 0 2 m s zhang et al 2010 single film and double film mrsf exhibited the similar accuracy in this study implying that there was no significant relationship between the sensitivity and the accuracy fig 5 3 2 calibration result of mrsf validated by the cfd simulations in the cfd model the deflection angle and the flow velocity around the film of the sensor were investigated under three different inlet velocities 0 25 0 5 and 1 m s which were imposed on the left boundary of the channel and for two different film thicknesses 0 2 and 0 3 mm fig 6 in order to observe the deformation of the sensor in time a transient study was conducted until the cfd model reached a steady state condition typically in less than 10 s however all results were compared at 10 s for consistency fig 6 comparing the deflection angle at varied velocities for the mrsf with 0 2 mm thickness the deflection angle at the 0 5 m s velocity was almost twice that of 0 25 m s which was consistent with the linear relation implied by the experiment fig 4 when the velocity increased to 1 m s the deflection angle was a little bit less than two times that of 0 5 m s which was again considered consistent with what is shown in fig 4 this pattern held true at mrsf of 0 3 mm fig 6 which confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions comparing the deflection angle at different mrsf at the velocity of 0 25 m s the deflection angle at the 0 2 mm mrsf was twice of that at 0 3 mm which was consistent with the linear relation implied by the experiment shown in fig 4 when the velocity increased this ratio decreased fig 6 and reached a plateau at 1 3 for flow velocity of 1 475 m s data not shown here overall the cfd simulations showed a clear dependence of deflection angle on the square of flow velocity with r 2 0 93 and 0 98 for single film and double film mrsfs respectively the fact that cfd simulation results showed similar deformation behavior and flow dependence lends credence to the experimental protocols 3 3 temperature influence on mrsfs real time flow monitoring water flowmeters based on the electronic mechanism e g electromagnetic are normally affected by the temperature and require re calibration paulsen et al 2001 wang et al 2007a meter 2018 as the rtds resistance temperature detector the resistance of mrsfs was expected to decrease with temperature therefore temperature correction should be applied for mrsf calibration the relationship between mrsf resistance and temperature is described as below eq 8 xu et al 2016 2017 8 r r r r r r α δ t where r r is the static mrsf resistance at the actual temperature ω r r is the static mrsf resistance at 20 c ω α is the temperature coefficient of resistance tcr ω ω c which is regarded as the sensitivity of a temperature sensor lee and lee 2003 lee et al 2008 2011 δt is the difference between the actual temperature and the reference temperature 20 c c the test results of mrsf in different water temperatures 20 60 c showed that at the fixed potential set by the potentiostat program the resistance of mrsf r v i dropped with the temperature fig s2 since silver nanoparticles coated as the resistor on the sensor film had a positive temperature coefficient 0 001 xu et al 2016 2017 the temperature coefficient of resistance α 0 001 of mrsf fig s2 was half of that in the previous study 0 002 xu et al 2016 2017 indicating that the resistance hardly changed with temperature variation the sensitivity of the rtds was only affected by the mrsf material normally the temperature coefficient of pure metal material e g gold zinc and cooper was higher than 0 0035 while the temperature coefficient of the mixed metal material e g manganin was close to zero kasap 2006 some semiconductor materials e g carbon silicon and germanium typically have negative temperature coefficient of resistance kasap 2006 the temperature coefficient of pure metal would decrease when mixed with the material having the negative temperature coefficient the silver ink used for mrsf was the mixture of silver nanoparticles and ethylene glycol an organic carbon to dissolve silver nanoparticles and thus having a low temperature coefficient of resistance α in this model 0 001 than pure silver 0 0038 at 20 c kasap 2006 the flow velocity without the temperature correction termed as the apparent flow velocity was calculated from eq 9 9 v r r r k r r 2 where r is the resistance measured by the multimeter at the actual temperature when the temperature correction was executed the standard reference resistance r r at 20 c in eq 9 should be replaced by the reference resistance at actual temperature r r the absolute error was the difference between the apparent flow velocity v and the actual flow velocity v as shown in eq 10 10 absolute error v v r r r r r 2 r r r k r r 2 the error increased with the temperature at the same actual flow velocity fig 7 demonstrating that the temperature change δ t would cause the error only if the tcr temperature coefficient of resistance is not zero at the same δ t the error decreased with the actual flow velocity fig 7 the increase in the flow velocity and the temperature would increase the mrsf resistance so that when the flow velocity increases the temperature change δ t would generate less error and the effect of flow velocity on the increase of resistance would become dominant for mrsfs with the same ei flexural rigidity and different tcrs fig 7a 7c and fig 7 b 7 d the mrsf with lower tcr exhibited less error than the one with higher tcr at the same flow velocity and temperature change the mrsf with small tcr 0 001 caused less error than the milli electrode array mea printed on a single film in the previous study 0 002 xu et al 2016 2017 the comparison of the mrsfs with different eis fig 7a 7 b and fig 7c 7 d showed that the mrsf with higher ei double film mrsf had bigger error than that with lower ei single film mrsf at the same flow velocity and temperature change since the mrsf with lower ei single film mrsf was more sensitive than double film mrsf k 0 0721 the low flow velocity would cause more deflection of double film mrsf resulting in high resistance therefore to reduce the absolute error incurred by temperature change the tcr should be reduced by integrating the electrode material with lower ei materials e g thinner kapton films or more elastic films the temperature coefficient of resistance tcr 0 001 in this study was much smaller than that 0 0019 0 0039 in previous studies glatzl et al 2016 xu et al 2016 2017 shikida et al 2017 and the temperature had lower impact on the mrsf than other flat flow sensors the tcr of capacitance typed flow sensors nguyen et al 2014 2015 varied from 0 2 to 2 when the temperature changed however the error caused by the temperature has no a fixed pattern due to the relationship among the error and the actual flow velocity temperature change tcr and ei flexural rigidity in this study the temperature impact on the mrsf could be neglected by integrating the temperature mea xu et al 2016 2017 on the mrsf in addition the relationship among the absolute error and the actual flow velocity temperature change tcr and ei of the material was established in models eq 10 fig 7 that could be used to minimize the error of the flow monitoring in real time mode 3 4 long term stability test of mrsf in wastewater long term stability is of primary concern for monitoring wastewater flow velocity electrode surface fouling caused by the attachment of inorganic organic particles has been well known to cause the deterioration of the accuracy and stability of electronic sensors geise et al 1991 manica et al 2003 the 4 week immersion in wastewater showed that the mrsf surface did not have obvious change based on macroscopic observation fig s3 there was no significant change less than 0 04 of the mrsf resistance during 4 weeks of immersion in wastewater fig s3 there were two main reasons for the good long term stability of mrsf first the mrsf consisted of three layers from top to bottom the silicon glue layer the electrode layer silver ink and the substrate kapton film fig 3b the silicon layer and the kapton film isolate the electrode layer from the wastewater and thus preventing the direct attachment of inorganic organic particles on the electrode layer xu et al 2016 2017 second the silicon glue layer coated on the mrsf surface shown in fig 3b enhances the hydrophobic property of the kapton film and thus alleviating bacterial adhesion urbain et al 1993 stevik et al 2004 the contact angle increased after the kapton film was coated with silicon glue fig 8 indicating that the surface of the mrsf kapton film silicon layer became more hydrophobic and prevented the attachment of inorganic organic particles 3 5 towards energy saving wwtps through high resolution monitoring of flow rate using mrsfs flexible mrsfs fig 3e installed across a given wwtp consisting of anoxic aerobic units e g influent anoxic tank aeration tank effluent sludge pipeline and chemical dosage pipeline would detect the fluctuation of flow rate throughout each unit and facilitate precise and proactive control and thus sustaining the stable operational

sources could be diluted to 33 45 compared with normal flow condition müller and krauth 1998 mines et al 2007 kim et al 2017 accurate real time monitoring this sharp jump of the incoming flow and the drop of carbon source in a wwtp is expected to save 42 51 electric power for aeration and 53 64 chemical dosage mainly carbon source methanol cost for denitrification table s1 gernaey et al 2004 pai 2007 zeng et al 2010 therefore the mrsf developed exhibited high accuracy excellent signal stability over a broad range of water flow velocity good temperature resistance and long term robustness which poses a great potential to be mass deployed in water wastewater treatment plants for high precision monitoring and energy saving operation 4 conclusions novel mm sized resistance typed sensor

m s and excellent sensitivity single film mrsf 0 1447 ms 1 double film mrsf 0 0721 ms 1 which exceeded the commercial flow sensor and similar types sensors reported single film mrsf possessed twice the sensitivity of double film mrsf based on the ei the flexural rigidity of the sensor film material the sensor models were developed to establish the correlation between flow velocity temperature change tcr and ei the results showed that the mrsf with higher ei double film had bigger error than that with lower ei single film at the same flow velocity and temperature change four week tests in wastewater showed the surface of mrsf was still intact and exhibited a high stability for long term applications computational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted and confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions the novel monitoring system would consume at least 50 less energy compared

20009,novel flexible thin mm sized resistance typed sensor film mrsf fabricated using ink jet printing technology ipt was developed in this study to monitor water flow rate in pipelines in real time in situ mode the mechanism of mrsf is that the mm sized interdigitated electrodes made by printing silver nanoparticles on an elastic polyimide film bend under different flow rates leading to variation of the resistance of the sensor at different degrees of curvature continuous flow tests showed that mrsf possessed a high accuracy 0 2 m s and excellent sensitivity 0 1447 ms 1 a model of sensor resistance and flow velocity was established to unfold the correlation between the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and the mechanic flexibility of sensor materials an analytical model yielded a high coefficient of determination r2 0 93 for the relationship between the resistance increment of the mrsf and the square of the flow velocity at the velocity range of 0 25 2 m s furthermore a temperature correction model was developed to quantify the effect of water temperature on the sensor resistance readings mrsf exhibited a low temperature coefficient of resistance tcr 0 001 at the water temperature range of 20 60 c computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations using the finite element method were conducted and confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions high resolution monitoring of water flow rate using mrsf technology was expected to save at least 50 energy consumption for a given unit especially under flow fluctuation mrsf possesses a great potential to perform real time in situ monitoring at high accuracy with ultralow cost thus enabling the feedback control at high spatiotemporal resolution to reduce the overall energy consumption in water and wastewater systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords mm sized resistance type sensor film mrsf flow velocity computational fluid dynamics simulations temperature correction real time in situ monitoring kapton film flexibility 1 introduction water flow velocity measurement is critical for system monitoring feedback control process analysis and energy consumption since it directly affects the operation and loading capacity of each treatment unit in water and wastewater treatment plants real time in situ accurate measurement can provide first hand information for the quantity of the inlet and outlet throughout each unit and the treatment plant as a whole evans et al 2004 for instance wastewater flow in a combined sewer system under shocks e g heavy rainfall or snowmelt can be 1 2 1 4 times or even twice as that in normal days müller and krauth 1998 leading to substantial fluctuation to wastewater

normal condition müller and krauth 1998 mines et al 2007 kim et al 2017 leading to the lack of nutrient and organic matters to microorganisms in activated sludge or biofilms schalk otte et al 2000 mohan et al 2007 unnecessary high aeration intensity and ultimately deteriorating the treatment efficiency thus it is critical to monitor the transient variations of water flow of diverse treatment units at a high spectral temporal resolution and enhance the resilience and robustness of wwtps at an energy saving mode traditional water flow sensors widely used include orifices flowmeters and turbine flowmeters morrison et al 2001 baker 2004 singh et al 2004 manshoor et al 2011 specifically orifice flowmeter measures the flow velocity by the liquid differential pressure through the flowmeter and normally has low accuracy error 2 4 of real flow rate due to the low contraction in the downstream mccabe et al 1985 flow 1995 seader et al 1997 baker 2005 digiacomo 2011 and imposes

baker 2005 digiacomo 2011 similarly the turbine flowmeter has high installation requirements to remain accurate approximately 10 upstream pipe diameters yeh et al 1987 svedin et al 2003 the moving

yan et al 2011 2013 xu et al 2016 2017 for the flow sensor mm sized interdigitated silver nanoparticle ink lines can be printed onto an elastic polyimide film and then sliced into a pipeline vertically and perpendicularly facing to water flow the elastic film is expected to bend under different flow velocities and the resistance of the silver nanoparticles ink lines will consequently change with the bending deflection and associated curvature of the film through which the flow velocity can be monitored in a real time in situ mode the breakthrough of this study lies in the development of flat thin mm sized resistance type sensor film mrsf capable of monitoring flow velocities in situ at low fabrication cost and with minimal installation and maintenance needs and the development of a series of analytical and computational fluid dynamics cfd models using the finite element method to elucidate the impacts of flow velocity and temperature on the mrsf accuracy there were five tasks in this study first an analytical mathematical model was established to determine the correlation of mrsf material mechanic flexibility bending curvature and flow velocity second mrsfs with two film thicknesses were examined at different flow velocities in a lab scale continuous flow system and site by side compared with a commercial paddlewheel flow sensor using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technique hughes et al 1981 duarte et al 2004 the flow in the vicinity of the thin film sensor was simulated using cfd in the comsol modeling framework and the effected deformation of the sensor was analyzed third the impact of temperature on the resistance readings of mrsfs was examined in water solution at various temperatures a model considering the absolute error of sensor the actual flow velocity the temperature change temperature coefficient of resistance tcr and flexural rigidity was established fourth the long term stability of mrsfs was examined by submerging in wastewater for over 4 weeks with the resistance of mrsfs being measured and the surface property being observed before and after the immersion finally the energy saving in terms of aeration and chemical dosage through high resolution monitoring of water velocity using mrsfs was simulated in an anoxic aerobic wwtp under flow fluctuation 2 materials and methods 2 1 mechanisms of mm sized resistance type sensor film mrsf the fundamental mechanism of mm sized resistance type sensor film mrsf is the variation of the sensor resistance with the curvature degree of the interdigitated silver nanoparticle ink printed on the flexible thin polyimide kapton film at different water flow velocities specifically the kapton film is held fixed on one end and is free to bend on the free end in analogous fashion to a cantilever beam the kapton film remains completely vertical when the liquid in the pipeline is static and the resistance of mrsf at this position is recorded as the baseline then the kapton film is bent when the liquid flows through the pipeline and the curvature increases with the flow velocity fig 1 a there are two main assumptions to simplify the force analysis and calculation first the flow near the pipe wall moves very slowly due to the no slip boundary condition while the flow near the center of the pipe is the fastest munson et al 2014 however due to the small diameter of the pipe plastic pipe internal diameter id 10 cm the flow velocity of the liquid is assumed to be almost uniform across the pipeline section in this study to simplify the calculations munson et al 2014 this is a reasonable assumption particularly for turbulent flows and the associated flow velocity profile it was verified that this is indeed the case with high resolution cfd simulations which will be discussed in the results section second due to the slim thickness 150 μm of the sensor kapton film the whole film would be simplified as a one unit area e g from point a to point b in the force analysis fig 1b where point a is fixed on the pipeline wall and point b is free and deformed under the influence of the flow the deflection and the deflection angle of point b are yb and θ b respectively q is the load caused by the liquid flow and the quantity ei boresi et al 1993 is referred to as the flexural rigidity fig 1b 2 2 analytical model for the dependence of mrsf resistance on curvature at different flow velocities a series of models were integrated to establish the correlation between the mechanical flexibility of mrsf film bending curvature and water flow velocity fig 2 to start with the mrsf was essentially a resistance temperature detector rtd rosal et al 2010 blasdel et al 2015 with the resistance being linearly related to the length of the sensor eq 1 xu et al 2016 2017 1 r ρ s l a r where ρs is resistivity l is the length and a r is the cross sectional area the unique configuration of the flat flexible thin mrsf fig 1a made the resistance increase with the length of the resistor therefore the relative resistance increment of mrsf was proportionally related to the maximum deflection angle or curvature of the mrsf caused by the liquid flow pang et al 2012 as described in eq 2 2 δ r r r kθ max where k is the deflection coefficient rr is the static mrsf reference resistance at 20 c δ r is the difference between the resistance of the bending mrsf and the baseline resistance of the static mrsf at 20 c δ r r r is the relative resistance increment of the mrsf θ max is the maximum deflection angle of all the points on the mrsf which typically occurs at the free end for a cantilever beam the drag force experienced by an object immersed in a moving fluid is described in eq 3 munson et al 2014 3 f d 1 2 a f c d ρ v 2 where f d is the drag force which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity ρ is the mass density of the fluid v is the flow velocity a f is the film area perpendicular to the flow and c d is the drag coefficient which in general depends on the reynolds number the maximum deflection angle θ max occurred on the far end of the mrsf point b in fig 1b boresi et al 1993 ugural and fenster 2011 4 θ max ql 3 6 ei where q is the continuous load applied on the mrsf equals to the force on the unit area f d a f by substituting eq 3 into eq 4 the maximum deflection angle θ max is shown in eq 5 5 θ max c d ρl 3 12 ei v 2 substituting eq 5 into eq 2 the relationship between the relative change of the sensor resistance and the flow velocity could be described in eq 6 6 δ r r r k c d ρl 3 12 ei v 2 the liquid used for flow velocity tests in this study was tap water at 20 c and its density was stable around 1000 kg m3 tanaka et al 2001 the flexural rigidity ei and the film length l were kept the same after fabrication therefore the relationship between the mrsf resistance and the flow velocity is simplified in eq 7 7 δ r r r k v 2 where k is the adjusted deflection coefficient therefore a linear model between the relative resistance increment and the square of the flow velocity was established in this study the whole calculation process was simplified by substituting the force load into the mrsf moment equation fig 2 2 3 fabrication of mrsf a clean polyimide kapton film thickness 127 μm american durafilm was washed with deionized water di water and ethanol sigma aldrich co to remove any residual organic inorganic trace on the film surface the silver ink was prepared by mixing silver ag nanoparticles suntronic silver sigma aldrich co and ethylene glycol fisher scientific co at the ratio of 3 1 the silver ink on the kapton film was printed using a dimatix materials printer modeldmp 2800 fujifilm dimatix inc in which liquid crystal polymer printer cartridges model dmclcp 11610 fujifilm dimatix inc were used to house the silver ink the printing pattern was designed using the autocad program and transferred by the linkcad program the sensor was printed as the resistance temperature detector rtd fig 3 a which was designed as a 15 μm space between the ink drops by using a customized printing waveform with each pattern being printed using two jets for facile detection of any potential clog the printing process was performed as described in previous studies xu et al 2016 2017 after the printing the whole sensor on the film was coated with the silicon paste dow corning 732 multipurpose sealant using a small brush to protect the electrodes directly contacting the liquid solution and then air dried for 20 min for the single film mrsf there were three layers including the substrate layer electrode layer and protective layer fig 3b the size of the single film mrsf was 35 mm 18 mm 0 2 mm length by width by thickness e 2 5 gpa fig 3c the connect pad was printed on the top of the mrsf to connect with a multimeter mastech ms828 digital ac dc auto range digital multimeter through copper wires in addition two film mrsf size 35 mm 18 mm 0 3 mm length by width by thickness e 8 5 gpa was fabricated by sticking two kapton fpc flexible printed circuits films together using silicon glue clear window and door sealant ge fig 3b the single film mrsf and two film mrsf were compared to determine the impact of the bending stiffness on the correlation between the sensor resistance and the flow velocity since the increase in the mrsf resistance was expected to be correlated with the flexural rigidity of the film material the resistance of mrsfs was measured as around 535 ω after fabrication 2 4 tests in a lab

1992 board 2004 jones et al 2006 to avoid the settling and deposition of solids on pipelines while the flow velocity should be lower than 2 0 m s epa office of water 2002 nayyar 1992 board 2004 jones et al 2006 to avoid potential wear and tear to pipelines in this study the flow rate range was applied from 0 25 m s to 2 m s which covered the normal range 0 6 m s 2 m s in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the low range 0 25 m s 0 6 m s at slow flow scenario the whole experiment setup consisted of a pump unimount 125 u s electronical motors with an adjustable butterfly valve spears co

comparison a test pipeline i d 9 86 cm schedule 80 pvc pipe mcmaster carr company and two 4 pvc saddle fittings omega engineering inc for installing the commercial sensor and mrsf onto the pipeline before the tests the mrsf length 3 5 cm width 1 8 cm was inserted into the fitting screw cap i d 2 6 cm model 450 010 spears co and then glued onto the cap using an epoxy 5 m quick cure epoxy jsp fig 3d afterwards the fitting cap with the glued mrsf was vertically installed into the pipeline the two types mrsfs single film and double film were examined in the pipeline individually during the tests the valve for controlling the flow rate was gradually opened to increase the flow rate steadily from 0 25 m s the minimal value to 2 m s the maximum value the tests were replicated for three times at each velocity the mrsf would bend under different flow rates fig 3e leading to variation of the resistance of the sensor at different degrees of curvature the resistance of the mrsf was recorded using a digital multimeter mastech ms828 digital ac dc auto range digital multimeter and the value of the commercial flow sensor was recorded 1 min after adjusting the valve in order to obtain the readings at the stable flow status 2 5 model simulation of mrsf curvature at different flow rates using the comsol multiphysics using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale technique hughes et al 1981 duarte et al 2004 the flow in the vicinity of the thin mrsf sensor was simulated and the effected deformation of the sensor was analyzed the flow simulation in the pipe mirrored the experimental conditions and was conducted in the comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa modeling framework water flows from left to right and in the middle of the channel it imposes drag force on the deformable sensor which is fixed at the bottom of the pipe the computational method handles the deformation bend of the sensor by the moving mesh technique navier stokes equations are solved for moving coordinates in order to calculate the velocity field and the strain stress and deformation experienced by the sensor as computed by the model the channel is assumed to be 0 5 m 0 1 m and the sensor has a height of 35 mm fig 3f the young s modulus of the sensor is set at 2 5 gpa and the film thickness was varied between 0 2 and 0 3 mm in order to account for possible imperfections using the equivalence of flexural rigidity the thickness and young s modulus of the sensor were modified to simulate a less computationally demanding model considering the size of the domain as well as the moving mesh technique a triangular mesh consisting of 19 014 domain elements and 398 boundary elements was used in all the simulations fig s1 2 6 temperature correction of mrsf because the mrsf is based on the variation of the resistance of the interdigitated electrodes under different flow velocities the influence of the variation of liquid temperature on the silver ink should be minimized to avoid the measurement error in this study mrsf was put into water with varied temperatures to examine the stability of the resistance readings briefly the working electrode and counter reference electrodes of the mrsf were individually connected to a potentiostat gamry reference 600 then the mrsf was immersed into the di water in a beaker on the heater thermolyne 1000 hotplate a commercial temperature sensor thermo scientific orion 3 star conductivity meter was put into the beaker near the mrsf the water solution was heated from 20 c to 60 c that simulated adversely low and high wastewater temperature lapara et al 2001 during which the mrsf was applied with the current time program at a setting potential 0 2 v and the resistance ohm of the mrsf was recorded every 100 s for the duration of 2300 s 2 7 long term stability of mrsf for 4 week operational period long term stability of the mrsf is important for flow velocity monitoring especially in wastewater pipelines electrode fouling caused by the attachment of inorganic and organic constituents is an inevitable phenomenon that would affect the monitoring accuracy and signal sensitivity in long run zhu et al 2009 pikaar et al 2011 the electrode fouling would increase the electrode resistance by destroying the electrode surface structure to minimize biofouling the whole electrode part silver particles of mrsfs was protected by a silicon glue layer which covered the whole electrode part the mrsf stability in wastewater was examined within 4 week operational period multiple pieces of mrsfs were immersed into static wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod 250 350 mg l 1 and biological oxygen demand bod 100 300 mg l 1 collected from the influent section of the university of connecticut wastewater treatment plant uconn wwtp a mrsf sample was taken from the wastewater every week and gently rinsed by di water for 5 s before the surface observation using a digital microscope nikon labophot the mrsf resistances were measured at the room temperature 20 c using a digital multimeter mastech ms828 digital ac dc auto range digital multimeter weekly throughout the 4 week period to determine the electrode fouling extent in addition bacterial attachment on a solid surface had been found to correlate with the surface hydrophilicity li and logan 2004 fraiwan et al 2013 thereby the static contact angles of the mrsf were examined in duplicate tests using a cam 101 optical surface tension meter before and after the immersion to elucidate the sensor surface hydrophilicity ksv instrument inc hua et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration of mrsf at different flow velocities and validated by the commercial flow sensor considering the flow velocity was 0 25 2 m s in this study the diameter of the pipe was 0 0986 m ρ was 1000 kg m 3 and μ was 0 001 pa s at the 20 c the reynolds number re ranged from 2 4 104 to 1 97 105 indicating that the flow in this study is indeed turbulent ergas and rheinheimer 2004 the flow results are reasonable and clearly indicate the existence of a turbulent flow velocity profile with almost constant flow velocity over most of the pipe cross section fig 3g for the film dimensions and the flow conditions c d varies modestly between 1 1 and 1 9 because the flow in this study was turbulent and c d was approximately constant the model between the mrsf s resistance and the flow velocity as shown in fig 2 and eq 7 was considered acceptable the sensitivity k of the single film mrsf was 0 1447 ms 1 and the k of the double film mrsf is 0 0721 ms 1 fig 4 implying that the single film mrsf was more sensitive than double film mrsf the model previously reported wang et al 2007b zhang et al 2010 was built upon the absolute resistance change with the flow velocity which had a problem of the different original resistances caused by the fabrication process such as inkjet printing or the photolithography xu et al 2016 2017 in contrast the relative resistance change δ r r r deployed in this study minimized the influence caused by the different sensor fabrication processes previous studies had found that resistance change was 125 ω ms 1 at the original resistance of 17 000 ω meaning the sensitivity was 0 007 ms 1 based on the relative resistance change zhang et al 2010 the maximum sensitivity was 0 0284 ω ms 1 at the original resistance of 5 ω wang et al 2007b meaning that the sensitivity was 0 00568 ms 1 based on the relative resistance change sensor sensitivity ranging from 0 652 10 5 to 4 489 10 5 ms 1 had been reported su et al 2002 mrsf exhibited a much better sensitivity single film mrsf 0 1447 ms 1 double film mrsf 0 0721 ms 1 than these studies su et al 2002 kao et al 2007 wang et al 2007b 2009 zhang et al 2010 which was attributed to the flexible thin kapton film fig 3e and the excellent adhesion of silver nanoparticle ink onto the film while the sensors in previous studies were fabricated from piezo shaped silicon material siox or sinx using photolithography and resulted in a rigid structure that was less flexible under water flow su et al 2002 kao et al 2007 wang et al 2007b 2009 zhang et al 2010 such a high sensitivity offers mrsfs a distinct advantage to real time detect the transient variation of wastewater flow of each treatment unit across wwtps leading to a swift and proactive control strategy to save energy consumption and sustain good treatment efficiency in addition due to the same density and dimension of two types of sensors tested single film and double film eq 6 the sensitivity of sensors was only related to the flexural rigidity ei of the sensor material which was only affected by the film thickness boresi et al 1993 kao et al 2007 wang et al 2009 ugural and fenster 2011 based on e 2 5 gpa and i 1 2 10 14 m4 an estimation of flexural rigidity for the kapton film with a thickness of 0 2 mm resulted in 3 10 5 n m2 which was consistent with the experimental values reported for pet polyethylene terephthalate price 1966 the sensitivity of the single film mrsf was slightly higher than twice that of the double film mrsf fig 4 it should be noted that the double film mrsf was fabricated by gluing two pieces of single layer kapton film using silicon paste which increased the flexural rigidity and slightly reduced the sensitivity of the double film mrsf the r 2 values for the relative resistance increment of the mrsf as a function of the square of the flow velocity were 0 94 and 0 95 for single film and double film respectively fig 4 indicating a high sensor resolution precision similar to previous studies su et al 2002 kao et al 2007 wang et al 2007b 2009 zhang et al 2010 single film mrsf and double film mrsf exhibited an excellent correlation with the commercial paddlewheel flow sensor with a slope of 1 0298 and 1 0281 respectively fig 5 a both slopes were tested against the ideal slope of one according to the following hypotheses h 0 β 1 1 h 1 β 1 1 in both cases we cannot reject the hypothesis that the slope is equal to one with p 0 2079 and 0 3016 for single film and double film mrsf respectively the r2 values were above 0 90 indicating the good linearity between the flow velocity measured by the mrsf and the commercial sensor the flow velocity disparity between the mrsf and the commercial sensor would be recognized as the error accuracy 1 in this study the error of mrsfs was between 0 1 0 25 m s throughout all the tests and decreased with the flow velocity fig 5b in the flow velocity range 0 6 m s 2 m s that usually occurs in the wwtp operation the error of mrsfs was between 0 1 0 2 m s fig 5 which met the epa standard less than 10 of the flow rate baker 2005 at the low flow velocity 0 25 m s 0 6 m s the error of mrsfs was 0 1 0 25 m s which was beyond the permissible error by epa standards baker 2005 meaning that mrsf could not accurately measure the low flow velocity but could still be used as the warning indicator for the occurrence of low flow velocity specially to prevent the particle deposition in pipeline epa office of water 2002 nayyar 1992 board 2004 jones et al 2006 a small error 2 of the flow rate had been found in previous studies wang et al 2007b which was caused by the relative stable mechanical structure of the sensor cantilever beam structure in contrast a study using the similar structure as mrsf had found a high error 16 7 at the low flow velocity 0 2 m s zhang et al 2010 single film and double film mrsf exhibited the similar accuracy in this study implying that there was no significant relationship between the sensitivity and the accuracy fig 5 3 2 calibration result of mrsf validated by the cfd simulations in the cfd model the deflection angle and the flow velocity around the film of the sensor were investigated under three different inlet velocities 0 25 0 5 and 1 m s which were imposed on the left boundary of the channel and for two different film thicknesses 0 2 and 0 3 mm fig 6 in order to observe the deformation of the sensor in time a transient study was conducted until the cfd model reached a steady state condition typically in less than 10 s however all results were compared at 10 s for consistency fig 6 comparing the deflection angle at varied velocities for the mrsf with 0 2 mm thickness the deflection angle at the 0 5 m s velocity was almost twice that of 0 25 m s which was consistent with the linear relation implied by the experiment fig 4 when the velocity increased to 1 m s the deflection angle was a little bit less than two times that of 0 5 m s which was again considered consistent with what is shown in fig 4 this pattern held true at mrsf of 0 3 mm fig 6 which confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions comparing the deflection angle at different mrsf at the velocity of 0 25 m s the deflection angle at the 0 2 mm mrsf was twice of that at 0 3 mm which was consistent with the linear relation implied by the experiment shown in fig 4 when the velocity increased this ratio decreased fig 6 and reached a plateau at 1 3 for flow velocity of 1 475 m s data not shown here overall the cfd simulations showed a clear dependence of deflection angle on the square of flow velocity with r 2 0 93 and 0 98 for single film and double film mrsfs respectively the fact that cfd simulation results showed similar deformation behavior and flow dependence lends credence to the experimental protocols 3 3 temperature influence on mrsfs real time flow monitoring water flowmeters based on the electronic mechanism e g electromagnetic are normally affected by the temperature and require re calibration paulsen et al 2001 wang et al 2007a meter 2018 as the rtds resistance temperature detector the resistance of mrsfs was expected to decrease with temperature therefore temperature correction should be applied for mrsf calibration the relationship between mrsf resistance and temperature is described as below eq 8 xu et al 2016 2017 8 r r r r r r α δ t where r r is the static mrsf resistance at the actual temperature ω r r is the static mrsf resistance at 20 c ω α is the temperature coefficient of resistance tcr ω ω c which is regarded as the sensitivity of a temperature sensor lee and lee 2003 lee et al 2008 2011 δt is the difference between the actual temperature and the reference temperature 20 c c the test results of mrsf in different water temperatures 20 60 c showed that at the fixed potential set by the potentiostat program the resistance of mrsf r v i dropped with the temperature fig s2 since silver nanoparticles coated as the resistor on the sensor film had a positive temperature coefficient 0 001 xu et al 2016 2017 the temperature coefficient of resistance α 0 001 of mrsf fig s2 was half of that in the previous study 0 002 xu et al 2016 2017 indicating that the resistance hardly changed with temperature variation the sensitivity of the rtds was only affected by the mrsf material normally the temperature coefficient of pure metal material e g gold zinc and cooper was higher than 0 0035 while the temperature coefficient of the mixed metal material e g manganin was close to zero kasap 2006 some semiconductor materials e g carbon silicon and germanium typically have negative temperature coefficient of resistance kasap 2006 the temperature coefficient of pure metal would decrease when mixed with the material having the negative temperature coefficient the silver ink used for mrsf was the mixture of silver nanoparticles and ethylene glycol an organic carbon to dissolve silver nanoparticles and thus having a low temperature coefficient of resistance α in this model 0 001 than pure silver 0 0038 at 20 c kasap 2006 the flow velocity without the temperature correction termed as the apparent flow velocity was calculated from eq 9 9 v r r r k r r 2 where r is the resistance measured by the multimeter at the actual temperature when the temperature correction was executed the standard reference resistance r r at 20 c in eq 9 should be replaced by the reference resistance at actual temperature r r the absolute error was the difference between the apparent flow velocity v and the actual flow velocity v as shown in eq 10 10 absolute error v v r r r r r 2 r r r k r r 2 the error increased with the temperature at the same actual flow velocity fig 7 demonstrating that the temperature change δ t would cause the error only if the tcr temperature coefficient of resistance is not zero at the same δ t the error decreased with the actual flow velocity fig 7 the increase in the flow velocity and the temperature would increase the mrsf resistance so that when the flow velocity increases the temperature change δ t would generate less error and the effect of flow velocity on the increase of resistance would become dominant for mrsfs with the same ei flexural rigidity and different tcrs fig 7a 7c and fig 7 b 7 d the mrsf with lower tcr exhibited less error than the one with higher tcr at the same flow velocity and temperature change the mrsf with small tcr 0 001 caused less error than the milli electrode array mea printed on a single film in the previous study 0 002 xu et al 2016 2017 the comparison of the mrsfs with different eis fig 7a 7 b and fig 7c 7 d showed that the mrsf with higher ei double film mrsf had bigger error than that with lower ei single film mrsf at the same flow velocity and temperature change since the mrsf with lower ei single film mrsf was more sensitive than double film mrsf k 0 0721 the low flow velocity would cause more deflection of double film mrsf resulting in high resistance therefore to reduce the absolute error incurred by temperature change the tcr should be reduced by integrating the electrode material with lower ei materials e g thinner kapton films or more elastic films the temperature coefficient of resistance tcr 0 001 in this study was much smaller than that 0 0019 0 0039 in previous studies glatzl et al 2016 xu et al 2016 2017 shikida et al 2017 and the temperature had lower impact on the mrsf than other flat flow sensors the tcr of capacitance typed flow sensors nguyen et al 2014 2015 varied from 0 2 to 2 when the temperature changed however the error caused by the temperature has no a fixed pattern due to the relationship among the error and the actual flow velocity temperature change tcr and ei flexural rigidity in this study the temperature impact on the mrsf could be neglected by integrating the temperature mea xu et al 2016 2017 on the mrsf in addition the relationship among the absolute error and the actual flow velocity temperature change tcr and ei of the material was established in models eq 10 fig 7 that could be used to minimize the error of the flow monitoring in real time mode 3 4 long term stability test of mrsf in wastewater long term stability is of primary concern for monitoring wastewater flow velocity electrode surface fouling caused by the attachment of inorganic organic particles has been well known to cause the deterioration of the accuracy and stability of electronic sensors geise et al 1991 manica et al 2003 the 4 week immersion in wastewater showed that the mrsf surface did not have obvious change based on macroscopic observation fig s3 there was no significant change less than 0 04 of the mrsf resistance during 4 weeks of immersion in wastewater fig s3 there were two main reasons for the good long term stability of mrsf first the mrsf consisted of three layers from top to bottom the silicon glue layer the electrode layer silver ink and the substrate kapton film fig 3b the silicon layer and the kapton film isolate the electrode layer from the wastewater and thus preventing the direct attachment of inorganic organic particles on the electrode layer xu et al 2016 2017 second the silicon glue layer coated on the mrsf surface shown in fig 3b enhances the hydrophobic property of the kapton film and thus alleviating bacterial adhesion urbain et al 1993 stevik et al 2004 the contact angle increased after the kapton film was coated with silicon glue fig 8 indicating that the surface of the mrsf kapton film silicon layer became more hydrophobic and prevented the attachment of inorganic organic particles 3 5 towards energy saving wwtps through high resolution monitoring of flow rate using mrsfs flexible mrsfs fig 3e installed across a given wwtp consisting of anoxic aerobic units e g influent anoxic tank aeration tank effluent sludge pipeline and chemical dosage pipeline would detect the fluctuation of flow rate throughout each unit and facilitate precise and proactive control and thus sustaining the stable operational status under transient shock and saving energy and chemical consumption fig 9 for example under flow fluctuation e g heavy rainfall or snowmelt or overflow in combined flow systems organic carbon sources could be diluted to 33 45 compared with normal flow condition müller and krauth 1998 mines et al 2007 kim et al 2017 accurate real time monitoring this sharp jump of the incoming flow and the drop of carbon source in a wwtp is expected to save 42 51 electric power for aeration and 53 64 chemical dosage mainly carbon source methanol cost for denitrification table s1 gernaey et al 2004 pai 2007 zeng et al 2010 therefore the mrsf developed exhibited high accuracy excellent signal stability over a broad range of water flow velocity good temperature resistance and long term robustness which poses a great potential to be mass deployed in water wastewater treatment plants for high precision monitoring and energy saving operation 4 conclusions novel mm sized resistance typed sensor film mrsf was developed in this study as a flow velocity sensing technology and examined in a lab scale continuous flow system under different flow velocities mrsf exhibited high accuracy 0 1 m s 0 2 m s and excellent sensitivity single film mrsf 0 1447 ms 1 double film mrsf 0 0721 ms 1 which exceeded the commercial flow sensor and similar types sensors reported single film mrsf possessed twice the sensitivity of double film mrsf based on the ei the flexural rigidity of the sensor film material the sensor models were developed to establish the correlation between flow velocity temperature change tcr and ei the results showed that the mrsf with higher ei double film had bigger error than that with lower ei single film at the same flow velocity and temperature change four week tests in wastewater showed the surface of mrsf was still intact and exhibited a high stability for long term applications computational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted and confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions the novel monitoring system would consume at least 50 less energy compared to the existing monitoring system and it would be much cheaper acknowledgements this study was supported by national science foundation nsf environmental engineering program goali project grant no
