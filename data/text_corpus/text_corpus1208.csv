6040,the paper presents exact closed form analytical solutions describing a two dimensional profile confined groundwater flow induced by areal recharge in a laterally bounded aquifer with anisotropic permeability which decreases with depth the mathematical formulation of the problem for a rectangular flow domain in terms of hydraulic head and stream function are free of the limitation of the dupuit forchheimer assumption two different types of outflow boundary conditions associated with the aquifer discharge area dirichlet and neumann are explored analytical solutions with respect to stream function allow examining the distribution of recharge over depth between contouring streamlines for a variety of flow parameter combinations the solutions are extended to allow the groundwater transit time distribution ttd to be calculated it was found that the dependence of the transit time function on hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and depth decay coefficients may exhibit non monotonic behavior the mathematical models introduced in the article are accompanied by computational simulations keywords groundwater recharge vertical aquifer heterogeneity aquifer anisotropy flow net structure transit time distribution 1 introduction if an aquifer shows a thickness high relative to the distance between its lateral boundaries and manifests heterogeneity and anisotropy in permeability the flow in such aquifer may exhibit non dupuit forchheimer behavior assumed the horizontal velocity is uniform over depth providing a certain research interest to illustrate this we address regional groundwater flow problems focusing mostly on the recent progress in the analytical model developments some of them inherited the features of the earliest 2d cross sectional models introduced by tóth 1963 to support an idea of the existence of hierarchically nested regional flow systems where groundwater is driven by gravity bear 1972 brock 1976 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 they often involved an assumption on the prescribed head boundary condition given head variation at the upper aquifer boundary which allows one to study the effect of periodic undulation in water table on the subsurface flow and the flow with the land surface interaction freeze and witherspoon 1967 wörman et al 2006 jiang et al 2011 zlotnik et al 2014 the development of such regional flow systems was found to be sensitive to basin geometry formation heterogeneity and anisotropy in particular it was shown that the depth decaying trend of hydraulic conductivity as well as formation anisotropy shall not be ignored in studies related to regional groundwater flow jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 recent studies highlight the importance of solutions of 3d water table induced hydraulic head in a tóthian basin to examine the validity of 2d cross sectional models wang et al 2017a b in real aquifer systems the groundwater flow is controlled by recharge rather than the water table configuration whose position depends on the groundwater flow regime and is a priori not known therefore hydrodynamic conceptualization of the upper aquifer boundary as the recharge specified condition seems more reasonable for a prevailing class of hydrogeological problems compared to the above head specified approach haitjema 1995 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 rumynin 2011 despite this not too many non dupuit forchheimer solutions describing groundwater flow induced by areal recharge in a laterally bounded aquifer are known in contemporary hydrogeology an indispensable attribute of the analysis of the regional groundwater flow dynamics is the rearrangement of the analytical model for the hydraulic head to a system of equations written with respect to a stream function there are known advantages of the stream function formulation for obtaining accurate streamlines and transit times as opposed to using a head or potential function formulation the stream function approach can be used to identify the groundwater flow path through the location of interest or to identify the positions of stagnation points in the nested groundwater flow systems tóth 2009 jiang et al 2011 such approach is being increasingly recognized for its value in groundwater contamination issues and groundwater age dating studies based on both numerical and analytical solutions solomon and sudicky 1991 pint et al 2003 chesnaux et al 2005 gassiat et al 2013 the aims of this study are i to analyze the 2d profile groundwater flow with respect to the behavior of the two basic functions hydraulic head and stream function in a bounded recharged aquifer with emphasis on the assessment of the role of aquifer flow properties and boundary conditions in the flow pattern ii to assess the validity of some common assumptions used to simplify regional groundwater flow problems iii to determine the time required for a water particle to move along any flow line between the aquifer top and outflow boundaries of different kinds 2 conceptual models and physical setup mathematical models are developed for describing steady state hydraulic head and stream function distributions in a rectangular confined aquifer as illustrated in fig 1 the aquifer has the thickness of m in z and the length l in x directions the recharge uniformly distributes over a top of the aquifer z 0 the bottom of the aquifer and the water divide act as no flow boundaries the outflow boundary conditions for the aquifer can be different fig 1 they utilize two concepts of the groundwater surface water interaction within the aquifer discharge area the lateral discharge into a stream cutting through the full depth of the aquifer 0 z m a head specified boundary fig 1a or the discharge into a stream of finite width through its bottom a discharge specified boundary on a restricted interval belonging to the x axis fig 1b in the latter case the no flow boundary x 0 can be associated with the line of symmetry dividing a v shape watershed into two equivalent planeshaving width l and therefore l 1 is the half stream width area 0 x l 1 can be associated also with the lake wetland and alluvial plain or coastal area stream or other water body width was shown to appreciably affect the transient time distribution if l 1 l 0 1 luther and haitjema 1998 abrams 2013 thus making the applicability of the simplified analytical models restricted only by watersheds containing narrow river valleys the present mathematical setup is chosen to assess the influence of the finite river width on the ttd explicitly without simplification of the boundary conditions the mathematical formalization of the process is based on the continuity equation for a flow of a homogeneous fluid polubarinova kochina 1952 bear 1972 1 v x x v z z 0 where v x and v z are the horizontal and vertical components of groundwater flow velocity lt 1 1a v x k x h x ψ z v z k z h z ψ x where h h x z is

domain such that the aquifer shows the vertical anisotropy ratio ɛ k x k z in a case of a vertical heterogeneity of the aquifer material k x k x z and k z k z z i e the hydraulic conductivity is a function of depth z below land surface or some reference level jiang et al 2011 yao et al 2017 in our analysis the aquifer is anisotropic and an exponentially decaying function is used to describe the decrease of hydraulic conductivity with depth jiang et al 2011 1b k x k x 0 exp a z k z k z 0 exp a z ɛ k x 0 k z 0 where k x 0 and k z 0 are the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity at the aquifer top z 0 respectively a is the depth decay exponent l 1 although there are studies showing that the anisotropic k components k x and k z may have different rate of reduction with depth wang et al 2011 the decrease in conductivity with depth is common in most fractured geological formations due to the increasing closure of fractures with depth due to the increasing normal stress from the weight of the overlying rock while shear dilation has minimal effect on hydraulic conductivity alteration earnest and boutt 2014 a model where the hydraulic conductivity profile changes exponentially with depth eq 1b the case of isotropic domain ɛ 1 was also utilized recently to describe lateral flow through the superficial saturated soils in the riparian zones ameli et al 2013 2016 in some cases hydraulic conductivity may increase with depth a negative in regional scale reservoirs due to hydrofracturing or through the clogging of the fractures s space near the water table caused by infiltration of finer grains such as colloids and suspended sediment zlotnik et al 2011 anisotropy in permeability is also a fundamental fractured rock property vertical anisotropy of the fractured hard rock aquifers may occur because the density of sub horizontal shallow dipping weathering origin fractures is higher than tectonic origin sub vertical steeply dipping fractures besides shallow dipping fractures have a larger hydraulic conductivity than steeply dipping fractures resulting in shallow dipping fractures dominating the flow field producing anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity earnest and boutt 2014 when talking about the vertical anisotropy of porous media one is referring mostly to layered systems where low permeable layers sandwiched between permeable regions the substitution of 1a and 1b into the continuity eq 1 results in laplace type equations for both the hydraulic head and the stream function thus in accordance with eqs 1 and 1a the laplace equation for the hydraulic head will be 2 x k x h x z k z h z 0 for a model of an anisotropic aquifer utilizing exponential permeability depth relationship 1b eq 2 transforms into equation 3 x k x 0 e a z h x z k z 0 e a z h z 0 the stream function ψ f x z determined by solving the laplace equation chesnaux et al 2005 jiang et al 2011 4 x 1 k z ψ x z 1 k x ψ z 0 is a fundamental characteristic of the steady state groundwater flow in an anisotropic aquifer the stream function is constant along a streamline the increment of its value d ψ between neighboring streamlines from ψ to ψ d ψ represents the elemental discharge between these streamlines specifying the hydraulic conductivity in eq 4 by the exponential dependencies 1b we transform this equation into 5 x 1 k z 0 e az ψ x z 1 k x 0 e az ψ z 0 solutions of eqs 3 and 5 based on the series solution approach are the subject of the present analysis closed form series solutions obtained through the method of separation of variables are presented in detail in appendixes the main advantages of the methodology over numerical techniques were demonstrated in many previous studies thus in the paper by read and volker 1993 series solutions for seepage in the saturated zone of homogeneous isotropic hillsides with arbitrary surface geometry were derived the upper and lower boundaries expressed as cubic splines and piecewise linear polynomials the later application of the series solutions approach was extended to recognition the regional hierarchically nested groundwater flow in heterogeneous and anisotropic basins jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 niu et al 2015 more rigorous semi analytical series solutions were derive derived for 2 d steady free boundary saturated unsaturated subsurface flow induced by spatially variable surface fluxes in stratified hillslopes ameli et al 2013 2016 these series solutions involve essential numerical calculi sometimes with hardly quantifiable truncation errors under the condition this paper deals with the flow regime can be conceptualized as a confined flow by assuming the average saturation aquifer thickness instead of water table height cardenas and jiang 2010 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 the considered artesian flow conditions having certain limitations in the applicability to the unconfined aquifer systems may help to give an insight into some flow phenomena that have not been described by the classical groundwater theory and also mentioned in the cited above research literature in particular with respect to the transit time of groundwater from recharge to discharge areas 3 finite aquifer with a dirichlet outlet boundary condition at x 0 consider a groundwater flow induced by infiltration in a rectangular domain combining constant head dirichlet outlet boundary condition bc specified as a full size constant head profile no flow bc water divide and aquifer bottom and flux specified bc corresponding to the groundwater recharge through the aquifer top fig 1a 6a h l z x 0 6b h x m z 0 6c h 0 z 0 6d k z 0 h x 0 z r where l is the distance between the hydrological boundaries m is the aquifer thickness the first three bcs are obvious the latest one the flux specified bc 6d reflects the equality of the vertical flow velocity at the aquifer top to the areal recharge rate r polubarinova kochina 1952 the solution of the boundary problem 3 and 6 is given in appendix a in a form of a23 and is represented graphically for a particular case in fig 2 the bcs 6 allowing one to analyze the behavior of groundwater flow in term of the hydraulic head can be easily re formulated for the stream function bcs the no flow bcs 6a and 6b at the right and lower boundaries of the flow domain are transformed into the dirichlet bcs since along the boundary the stream function ψ x z is a constant taken for simplicity to be zero 7a ψ l z 0 7b ψ x m 0 the condition of perpendicularity of streamlines to the constant head outflow boundary at x 0 can be treated as an assumption defining the vertical specific discharge v z ψ x 0 which allows the neumann type of bc to be specified 7c ψ 0 z x 0 finally the values of the stream function ψ x z change along the upper boundary of the flow domain in response to the areal recharge following the relationship polubarinova kochina 1952 7d ψ x 0 ψ 0 x r x const a complete derivation of the solution of the flow eq 5 with boundary conditions 7 is given in appendix b in a form of b21 a dimensionless form of the solution is as follows 8 ψ x z 4 π 2 e α z 2 n 1 cos n π x 2 sh a n 1 z n 2 sh a n 1 1 n where ψ ψ r l x x l z z m a n α 2 4 n π ɛ m 2 m m l α a m n 1 2 the analytical solution 8 for the stream function can be used to plot streamlines which represent the trajectories of particles in a steady flow the streamlines together with the contour lines of the hydraulic head a23 are plotted in fig 2 to show the groundwater flow pattern in aquifers having different permeability structures a case of the aquifer geometry ratio m l 0 5 as can be seen from plots in fig 2 the effect of the coefficients ɛ and α on the flow structure is consistent with expectations the increase in the values of these parameters leads to the concentration of the flow near the top of the aquifer thus preventing the penetration of recharge water deep into the aquifer note that in homogeneous but anisotropic media the construction of a flow net is complicated by the fact that the streamlines and the contour lines of the hydraulic head are not orthogonal bear 1972 the graphical representation of the solution 8 fully coincides with the result of modeling based on particle tracking with pmpath chiang and kinzelbach 1994 fig 3 a 4 finite aquifer with a neumann outlet boundary condition at z 0 in its mathematical setting the problem differs from that discussed above by the type of the outlet boundary condition the latter is specified as a local area of the inverse recharge at the aquifer top mathematically this condition is defined as neumann bc on a specified interval 0 l 1 lying on the x axis at z 0 fig 1b as before the flow is described with the use of a head function h x z and a stream function ψ x z no flow lateral and bottom bcs for eq 3 are applied to the model domain fig 1b 9a h 0 z x 0 9b h l z x 0 9c h x m z 0 additionally the relationships 9d k z 0 h x 0 z r l 1 x l q r l l 1 l 1 0 x l 1 are adopted to specify the flux condition at the aquifer top they correspond to the groundwater recharge contributing area l 1 l adjacent to the water divide with the recharge rate r and upward groundwater discharge through area 0 l 1 i e through the stream bottom where the left hand no flow boundary x 0 is the line of symmetry for the idealized v shape watershed with the discharge rate q it is assumed that the discharge q is uniform over the half width of the stream l 1 in reality it would be more focused near the stream boundary x 0 luther and haitjema 1998 the solution of the boundary problem 3 and 9 is given in appendix c in a form of c13 and is represented graphically for a particular case in fig 4 as shown early the stream function ψ f x z can be found by solving the laplace eq 5 for the model domain geometry in fig 1b the condition of zero normal flow across the specified above no flow boundaries 9a 9b and 9c implies that the stream function must be constant we simply choose the constant to be zero 10a ψ x m 0 10b ψ l z 0 10c ψ 0 z 0 the non zero flux distributed along the aquifer top in the following manner 10d ψ x 0 ψ 0 x r l x l 1 x l r l l 1 x l 1 0 x l 1 allows us to specify the piecewise bc describing the groundwater recharge contributing area l 1 l and upward groundwater discharge through area 0 l 1 fig 1b which is consistent with the bc 9d a completederivation of the solution of a flow eq 5 with boundary conditions 10 is given in appendix d in a form of d16 the dimensionless form of the solution is as follows 11 ψ x z 2 π 2 l 1 e α z 2 n

solution 11 shows that an increase in the anisotropy and the rate of permeability attenuation leads similarly to the previous problem to the concentration of streamlines flow discharge near aquifer top as can be seen in the plots fig 4 illustrating the pattern of groundwater flow net the contour lines of the hydraulic head were plotted using the analytical solution c13 as can be seen from fig 4b an inversion of the gradient of hydraulic head can be seen in an aquifer with high ɛ values the same section x can show an increase in the head over depth in its upper part and its decrease in the lower part i e the plot of h z has an extremum the plot in fig 3b gives a comparison of an analytical 11 and particle tracking solutions with pmpath chiang and kinzelbach 1994 for groundwater flow in anisotropic heterogeneous aquifers the analysis of the plot shows a good agreement between the curves finally note that the comparison of plots in figs 2 and 4 which give the solutions of flow problem for two types of boundary conditions shows considerable difference in the structure of flows not only near the outlet flow boundary but also on the water divide no flow neumann bc in particular the introduction of dirichlet bc leads to an increase in the hydraulic head compared with its values under discharge specified neumann bc for sufficiently extended aquifers m l 0 1 such differences naturally smooth out 5 the distribution of groundwater travel time the formulas describing the time characteristics of the motion of fluid particles along a fixed trajectory ψ x z in the absence of dispersion effects can be derived from expressions for the principal components of flow velocity 1a 13 v x ψ z v z ψ x for which kinematic equalities are known 14 v x φ dx dt v z φ dz dt where φ is the porosity separating variables in 13 and integrating these expressions with 14 taken into account we come to the following equations for a water particle traveling along ψ streamline 15 t φ x 0 x 1 ψ z d x t φ 0 z 1 ψ x d z which are equations for the groundwater ttd for a watershed here x 0 is the starting point of the streamline the initial coordinate of the streamline for example from the solution of the 2d flow problem with dirichlet bc at x 0 section 3 we obtain a derivative of the function ψ x z with respect to z for the first formula in 15 in a dimensionless form 16 d ψ x z d z 4 π

17a d ψ x z d z 2 π e α z 2 n 1 sin n π x α 2 sh a n 1 z a n ch a n 1 z n sh a n in further calculations the first formula in 15 was used presented for the dimensionless ttd in the form 18 τ t t x 0 x

groundwater discharge 0 l 1 is determined by the transcendental formula 11 at z 0 18a ψ 0 x 2 π 2 l 1 n 1 1 n 2 sin n π x sin n π l 1 the solution 18 for two aquifer models homogeneous anisotropic and heterogeneous isotropic case l 1 0 i e a point sink at 0 0 are given in figs 5 and 6 for the major portion of flow domain 0 x 0 9 or ψ 0 0 1 the travel time is the lesser the higher the values of the anisotropy ratio and the depth decay exponent this is due to the effect of flow concentration in the upper zone of the aquifers however in the inflow points of recharge water in the vicinity of the watershed profile 0 9 x 1 ψ 0 0 1 the dependence of the travel time on the anisotropy ratio for long aquifers becomes inverse fig 5b plots in figs 5a and 6a and b show that the effect of the aquifer characteristics on the travel time can be ambiguous for the points ψ 0 lying near the water divide line the travel time to the discharge zone can be the same for radically different values of ɛ fig 5a and α fig 6a and b for example as can be seen from fig 7 a the top curve the dimensionless travel time will be about the same about 9 for ɛ 1 7 and 7 in other words an increase in ɛ starting from the case of isotropic aquifer ɛ 1 first leads to an increase in the travel time and next starting from some value of ɛ to a decrease in this time this paradoxical effect results from an abrupt drop in the hydraulic gradient dh d x over depth at an increase in the coefficient of anisotropy notwithstanding the streamlines becoming shorter with increasing ɛ the velocity of water particles along them decreases this anomaly in the behavior of the travel time smooths out with a decrease in the dimensionless parameter m l fig 7b the comparison of plots in fig 8 shows that the effect of the type of boundary conditions on the characteristic times of migration is not as considerable as it might be expected judging from the difference in the structure of flows figs 2 and 4 in practice a direct application of the above ttd modeling concept purely advective transport for the groundwater dating may introduce a certain errors since the hydrodynamic micro dispersive mixing of dissolved species e g environmental tracers occurs between waters having different travel times effect of dispersion on the isotope age was examined by a number of investigators e g solomon and sudicky 1991 goode 1996 bethke and johnson 2008 torgersen et al 2013 it was shown that the effect of dispersion depends on flow conditions and the input function as manifested in the inlet boundary condition the effect is minor for tracers with a constant input because the concentration gradient is small in the direction of flow in contrast to the peak shape inputs as for the historical 3h bomb pulse failure to take into account matrix diffusion and or diffusive exchange with confining layers may also introduce errors in the isotope data interpretation based on the ttd concept resulting in underestimation of the actual groundwater velocities in the conductive zones three dimensional geologic heterogeneity also affects the groundwater mixing for reasonable macro dispersivities of the aquifer material gelhar et al 1992 the effect would lead to an underestimation of the groundwater age moreover in heterogeneous aquifer systems with large hydraulic conductivity variance the travel time distribution may itself deviate from the fickian model weissmann et al 2002 gotovac et al 2009 but that is an issue beyond the scope of this paper 6 discussion and conclusions the present analysis is based on the original analytical solutions of the 2d laplace equation for steady state incompressible flow with respect to both the hydraulic head h x z and the stream function ψ x z all of the recharge inflow was treated as a fluid flux boundary condition solutions are presented for two types of outlet boundary conditions in convergent series forms from which the values of h x z and ψ x z may be computed for any x and z flow process analysis is consistent with previously published analytical and modeling studies utilizing the dupuit forchheimer concept to describe groundwater flow in isotropic homogeneous aquifer characterized by small ratios of their vertical to horizontal dimensions allowing the vertical resistance to groundwater flow to be neglected however groundwater response to the areal recharge in terms of the hydraulic head streamline pattern and residence time in the case of anisotropic heterogeneous aquifer material may be essentially different from what is predicted by this concept the solutions obtained for the stream function allow us to quantify the influence of anisotropy and heterogeneity on the flow velocity field and the depth of penetration of the recharge water it was shown that the distribution of the recharge water inflowing to an aquifer is controlled by the anisotropy and the hydraulic conductivity change with depth in a similar manner an increase in the anisotropy ratio and depth decay exponent leads to a compression of streamlines in the upper part of the aquifer which indicates that the flow focuses near the aquifer top resulting in an increased horizontal specific discharge in this part of the flow domain the similar behavior of the flow field was observed by cardenas and jiang 2010 and zlotnik et al 2011 who used prescribed head boundary condition to describe the tóthian flow in anisotropic aquifers based on the classic governing equations for hydraulic head distribution they showed that the increase in the decay rate a weakens the deep circulation while enhances the shallow circulation finally the hypothesis that flow paths display a distinct shift to shallower depths with increasing the anisotropy ratio of a fractured groundwater reservoir was supported by the study conducted by earnest and boutt 2014 who incorporated hydromechanical equations as a mechanism for creating depth dependent hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic conductivity anisotropy the streamline patterns generated by the areal recharge for two types of outflow boundary conditions are quite different in the case of the dirichlet bc streamlines show a gradual immersion to depth while in the case of the neumann bc the streamlines tend to converge upwards to the discharge area forming a re cycling structure the revealed specific discharge distribution over depth under recharge conditions caused by the permeability anisotropy and the heterogeneity of the aquifer material shall be taken into account in many hydrogeological applications first of all related to the solute transport prediction and hence to the assessment of the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination as well as to the analysis of depth specific or plan view hydrochemical and isotopic data these conclusions are even more evident in the light of the residence time behavior thus groundwater ages from streambed sampling show a symmetric lateral pattern of higher age in the center of the streambed and younger apparent age toward the stream banks gilmore et al 2016 this tendency is consistent with the theoretical prediction based on the suggested analytical solutions for the discharge into a stream of finite width through its bottom a discharge specified bc because the obtained solutions account for aquifer anisotropy and heterogeneity they wider to some extent the ability of the existing interpretation models solomon et al 2006 gilmore et al 2016 analytical solutions for the head and stream functions were used both to plot flow net which represent the trajectories of particles in a steady flow and to estimate particle travel time from a variety of distances to a flow domain boundary the results of the present study replicate the earlier findings on the high sensitivity of the transport times to depth dependent hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy earnest and boutt 2014 zlotnik et al 2014 and provide new information about the behavior of the travel time distribution function thus the derived solutions for both types of bcs indicate that the dependence of the particle travel time on anisotropy can have different tendencies depending on the streamline entrance location with respect to the aquifer lateral boundaries and on the ratio of the aquifer extension to depth the general trend is that the higher the value of the anisotropy ratio the quicker the particle migrates in term of time required to reach the outflow boundary it can be explained by the fact that an increase in the anisotropy ratio results in higher flow velocities in the upper part of the aquifer this is almost always true if the particle entrance region is located not too close to the water divide roughly x l 0 9 for a thin aquifer the location of the streamline entry region at the watershed area x l 0 9 0 95 gives another trend the lesser the anisotropy ratio the lesser the residence time for thick aquifers m l 0 3 0 5 under the same condition the relationship between the particle residence time and the anisotropy ratio may be non unique and depend on the chosen initial state the use of different anisotropy ratios in calculations can result in the same value of the residence time similar tendencies were identified for relationship between the depth decay exponent and the residence time the above phenomenon is not manifested in models where a prescribed head upper boundary condition is used jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 earnest and boutt 2014 zlotnik et al 2014 the main limitation of the presented analysis is the confined conditions assuming constant aquifer saturated thickness indeed earlier it has been shown zlotnik et al 2014 that the magnitude of variations of water table elevation may significantly affect the accuracy of results of equipotential and streamline calculation obtained for aquifer under confined condition however this shortcoming of the developed models shall not lead to serious loss of accuracy in the investigation of the unconfined deep aquifers where hydraulic gradients are moderate at least such a simplification i e flat upper boundary with a given head variation at depth z 0 is acceptable and has been widely used in theoretical analyses of 2d and 3d regional scale groundwater flow wörman et al 2006 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2017a b although the relevant efforts aimed at finding more comprehensive solutions that take into consideration unconfined flow conditions are essential in implementation of the ttd concept in the groundwater transport modeling

6040,the paper presents exact closed form analytical solutions describing a two dimensional profile confined groundwater flow induced by areal recharge in a laterally bounded aquifer with anisotropic permeability which decreases with depth the mathematical formulation of the problem for a rectangular flow domain in terms of hydraulic head and stream function are free of the limitation of the dupuit forchheimer assumption two different types of outflow boundary conditions associated with the aquifer discharge area dirichlet and neumann are explored analytical solutions with respect to stream function allow examining the distribution of recharge over depth between contouring streamlines for a variety of flow parameter combinations the solutions are extended to allow the groundwater transit time distribution ttd to be calculated it was found that the dependence of the transit time function on hydraulic conductivity anisotropy and depth decay coefficients may exhibit non monotonic behavior the mathematical models introduced in the article are accompanied by computational simulations keywords groundwater recharge vertical aquifer heterogeneity aquifer anisotropy flow net structure transit time distribution 1 introduction if an aquifer shows a thickness high relative to the distance between its lateral boundaries and manifests heterogeneity and anisotropy in permeability the flow in such aquifer may exhibit non dupuit forchheimer behavior assumed the horizontal velocity is uniform over depth providing a certain research interest to illustrate this we address regional groundwater flow problems focusing mostly on the recent progress in the analytical model developments some of them inherited the features of the earliest 2d cross sectional models introduced by tóth 1963 to support an idea of the existence of hierarchically nested regional flow systems where groundwater is driven by gravity bear 1972 brock 1976 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 they often involved an assumption on the prescribed head boundary condition given head variation at the upper aquifer boundary which allows one to study the effect of periodic undulation in water table on the subsurface flow and the flow with the land surface interaction freeze and witherspoon 1967 wörman et al 2006 jiang et al 2011 zlotnik et al 2014 the development of such regional flow systems was found to be sensitive to basin geometry formation heterogeneity and anisotropy in particular it was shown that the depth decaying trend of hydraulic conductivity as well as formation anisotropy shall not be ignored in studies related to regional groundwater flow jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 recent studies highlight the importance of solutions of 3d water table induced hydraulic head in a tóthian basin to examine the validity of 2d cross sectional models wang et al 2017a b in real aquifer systems the groundwater flow is controlled by recharge rather than the water table configuration whose position depends on the groundwater flow regime and is a priori not known therefore hydrodynamic conceptualization of the upper aquifer boundary as the recharge specified condition seems more reasonable for a prevailing class of hydrogeological problems compared to the above head specified approach haitjema 1995 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 rumynin 2011 despite this not too many non dupuit forchheimer solutions describing groundwater flow induced by areal recharge in a laterally bounded aquifer are known in contemporary hydrogeology an indispensable attribute of the analysis of the regional groundwater flow dynamics is the rearrangement of the analytical model for the hydraulic head to a system of equations written with respect to a stream function there are known advantages of the stream function formulation for obtaining accurate streamlines and transit times as opposed to using a head or potential function formulation the stream function approach can be used to identify the groundwater flow path through the location of interest or to identify the positions of stagnation points in the nested groundwater flow systems tóth 2009 jiang et al 2011 such approach is being increasingly recognized for its value in groundwater contamination issues and groundwater age dating studies based on both numerical and analytical solutions solomon and sudicky 1991 pint et al 2003 chesnaux et al 2005 gassiat et al 2013 the aims of this study are i to analyze the 2d profile groundwater flow with respect to the behavior of the two basic functions hydraulic head and stream function in a bounded recharged aquifer with emphasis on the assessment of the role of aquifer flow properties and boundary conditions in the flow pattern ii to assess the validity of some common assumptions used to simplify regional groundwater flow problems iii to determine the time required for a water particle to move along any flow line between the aquifer top and outflow boundaries of different kinds 2 conceptual models and physical setup mathematical models are developed for describing steady state hydraulic head and stream function distributions in a rectangular confined aquifer as illustrated in fig 1 the aquifer has the thickness of m in z and the length l in x directions the recharge uniformly distributes over a top of the aquifer z 0 the bottom of the aquifer and the water divide act as no flow boundaries the outflow boundary conditions for the aquifer can be different fig 1 they utilize two concepts of the groundwater surface water interaction within the aquifer discharge area the lateral discharge into a stream cutting through the full depth of the aquifer 0 z m a head specified boundary fig 1a or the discharge into a stream of finite width through its bottom a discharge specified boundary on a restricted interval belonging to the x axis fig 1b in the latter case the no flow boundary x 0 can be associated with the line of symmetry dividing a v shape watershed into two equivalent planeshaving width l and therefore l 1 is the half stream width area 0 x l 1 can be associated also with the lake wetland and alluvial plain or coastal area stream or other water body width was shown to appreciably affect the transient time distribution if l 1 l 0 1 luther and haitjema 1998 abrams 2013 thus making the applicability of the simplified analytical models restricted only by watersheds containing narrow river valleys the present mathematical setup is chosen to assess the influence of the finite river width on the ttd explicitly without simplification of the boundary conditions the mathematical formalization of the process is based on the continuity equation for a flow of a homogeneous fluid polubarinova kochina 1952 bear 1972 1 v x x v z z 0 where v x and v z are the horizontal and vertical components of groundwater flow velocity lt 1 1a v x k x h x ψ z v z k z h z ψ x where h h x z is

domain such that the aquifer shows the vertical anisotropy ratio ɛ k x k z in a case of a vertical heterogeneity of the aquifer material k x k x z and k z k z z i e the hydraulic conductivity is a function of depth z below land surface or some reference level jiang et al 2011 yao et al 2017 in our analysis the aquifer is anisotropic and an exponentially decaying function is used to describe the decrease of hydraulic conductivity with depth jiang et al 2011 1b k x k x 0 exp a z k z k z 0 exp a z ɛ k x 0 k z 0 where k x 0 and k z 0 are the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity at the aquifer top z 0 respectively a is the depth decay exponent l 1 although there are studies showing that the anisotropic k components k x and k z may have different rate of reduction with depth wang et al 2011 the decrease in conductivity with depth is common in most fractured geological formations due to the increasing closure of fractures with depth due to the increasing normal stress from the weight of the overlying rock while shear dilation has minimal effect on hydraulic conductivity alteration earnest and boutt 2014 a model where the hydraulic conductivity profile changes exponentially with depth eq 1b the case of isotropic domain ɛ 1 was also utilized recently to describe lateral flow through the superficial saturated soils in the riparian zones ameli et al 2013 2016 in some cases hydraulic conductivity may increase with depth a negative in regional scale reservoirs due to hydrofracturing or through the clogging of the fractures s space near the water table caused by infiltration of finer grains such as colloids and suspended sediment zlotnik et al 2011 anisotropy in permeability is also a fundamental fractured rock property vertical anisotropy of the fractured hard rock aquifers may occur because the density of sub horizontal shallow dipping weathering origin fractures is higher than tectonic origin sub vertical steeply dipping fractures besides shallow dipping fractures have a larger hydraulic conductivity than steeply dipping fractures resulting in shallow dipping fractures dominating the flow field producing anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity earnest and boutt 2014 when talking about the vertical anisotropy of porous media one is referring mostly to layered systems where low permeable layers sandwiched between permeable regions the substitution of 1a and 1b into the continuity eq 1 results in laplace type equations for both the hydraulic head and the stream function thus in accordance with eqs 1 and 1a the laplace equation for the hydraulic head will be 2 x k x h x z k z h z 0 for a model of an anisotropic aquifer utilizing exponential permeability depth relationship 1b eq 2 transforms into equation 3 x k x 0 e a z h x z k

state groundwater flow in an anisotropic aquifer the stream function is constant along a streamline the increment of its value d ψ between neighboring streamlines from ψ to ψ d ψ represents the elemental discharge between these streamlines specifying the hydraulic conductivity in eq 4 by the exponential dependencies 1b we transform this equation into 5 x 1 k z 0 e az ψ x z 1 k x 0 e az ψ z 0 solutions of eqs 3 and 5 based on the series solution approach are the subject of the present analysis closed form series solutions obtained through the method of separation of variables are presented in detail in appendixes the main advantages of the methodology over numerical techniques were demonstrated in many previous studies thus in the paper by read and volker 1993 series solutions for seepage in the saturated zone of homogeneous isotropic hillsides with arbitrary surface geometry were derived the upper and lower boundaries expressed as cubic splines and piecewise linear polynomials the later application of the series solutions approach was extended to recognition the regional hierarchically nested groundwater flow in heterogeneous and anisotropic basins jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 niu et al 2015 more rigorous semi analytical series solutions were derive derived for 2 d steady free boundary saturated unsaturated subsurface flow induced by spatially variable surface fluxes in stratified hillslopes ameli et al 2013 2016 these series solutions involve essential numerical calculi sometimes with hardly quantifiable truncation errors under the condition this paper deals with the flow regime can be conceptualized as a confined flow by assuming the average saturation aquifer thickness instead of water table height cardenas and jiang 2010 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 the considered artesian flow conditions having certain limitations in the applicability to the unconfined aquifer systems may help to give an insight into some flow phenomena that have not been described by the classical groundwater theory and also mentioned in the cited above research literature in particular with respect to the transit time of groundwater from recharge to discharge

streamlines together with the contour lines of the hydraulic head a23 are plotted in fig 2 to show the groundwater flow pattern in aquifers having different permeability structures a case of the aquifer geometry ratio m l 0 5 as can be seen from plots in fig 2 the effect of the coefficients ɛ and α on the flow structure is consistent with expectations the increase in the values of these parameters leads to the concentration of the flow near the top of the aquifer thus preventing the penetration of recharge water deep into the aquifer note that in homogeneous but anisotropic media the construction of a flow net is complicated by the fact that the streamlines and the contour lines of the hydraulic head are not orthogonal bear 1972 the graphical representation of the solution 8 fully coincides with the result of modeling based on particle tracking with pmpath chiang and kinzelbach 1994 fig 3 a 4 finite aquifer with a neumann outlet boundary condition at z 0 in its mathematical setting the problem differs from that discussed above by the type of the outlet boundary condition the latter is specified as a local area of the inverse recharge at the aquifer top mathematically this condition is defined as neumann bc on a specified interval 0 l 1 lying on the x axis at z 0 fig 1b as before the flow is described with the use of a head function h x z and a stream function ψ x

are adopted to specify the flux condition at the aquifer top they correspond to the groundwater recharge contributing area l 1 l adjacent to the water divide with the recharge rate r and upward groundwater discharge through area 0 l 1 i e through the stream bottom where the left hand no flow boundary x 0 is the line of symmetry for the idealized v shape watershed with the discharge rate q it is assumed that the discharge q is uniform over the half width of the stream l 1 in reality it would be more focused near the stream boundary x 0 luther and haitjema 1998 the solution of the boundary problem 3 and 9 is given in appendix c in a form of c13 and is represented graphically for a particular case in fig 4 as shown early the stream function ψ f x z can be found by solving the laplace eq

top as can be seen in the plots fig 4 illustrating the pattern of groundwater flow net the contour lines of the hydraulic head were plotted using the analytical solution c13 as can be seen from fig 4b an inversion of the gradient of hydraulic head can be seen in an aquifer with high ɛ values the same section x can show an increase in the head over depth in its upper part and its decrease in the lower part i e the plot of h z has an extremum the plot in fig 3b gives a comparison of an analytical 11 and particle tracking solutions with pmpath chiang and kinzelbach 1994 for groundwater flow in anisotropic heterogeneous aquifers the analysis of the plot shows a good agreement between the curves finally note that the comparison of plots in figs 2 and 4 which give the solutions of flow problem for two types of boundary conditions shows considerable difference in the structure of flows not only near the outlet flow boundary but also on the water divide no flow neumann bc in particular the introduction of dirichlet bc leads to an increase in the hydraulic head compared with its values under discharge specified neumann bc for sufficiently extended aquifers m l 0 1 such differences

heterogeneous isotropic case l 1 0 i e a point sink at 0 0 are given in figs 5 and 6 for the major portion of flow domain 0 x 0 9 or ψ 0 0 1 the travel time is the lesser the higher the values of the anisotropy ratio and the depth decay exponent this is due to the effect of flow concentration in the upper zone of the aquifers however in the inflow points of recharge water in the vicinity of the watershed profile 0 9 x 1 ψ 0 0 1 the dependence of the travel time on the anisotropy ratio for long aquifers becomes inverse fig 5b plots in figs 5a and 6a and b show that the effect of the aquifer characteristics on the travel time can be ambiguous for the points ψ 0 lying near the water divide line the travel time to the discharge zone can be the same for radically different values of ɛ fig 5a and α fig 6a and b for example as can be seen from fig 7 a the top curve the dimensionless travel time will be about the same about 9 for ɛ 1 7 and 7 in other words an increase in ɛ starting from the case of isotropic aquifer ɛ 1 first leads to an increase in the travel time and next starting from some value of ɛ to a decrease in this time this paradoxical effect results from an abrupt drop in the hydraulic gradient dh d x over depth at an increase in the coefficient of anisotropy notwithstanding the streamlines becoming shorter with increasing ɛ the velocity of water particles along them decreases this anomaly in the behavior of the travel time smooths out with a decrease in the dimensionless parameter m l fig 7b the comparison of plots in fig 8 shows that the effect of the type of boundary conditions on the characteristic times of migration is not as considerable as it might be expected judging from the difference in the structure of flows figs 2 and 4 in practice a direct application of the above ttd modeling concept purely advective transport for the groundwater dating may introduce a certain errors since the hydrodynamic micro dispersive mixing of dissolved species e g environmental tracers occurs between waters having different travel times effect of dispersion on the isotope age was examined by a number of investigators e g solomon and sudicky 1991 goode 1996 bethke and johnson 2008 torgersen et al 2013 it was shown that the effect of dispersion depends on flow conditions and the input function as manifested in the inlet boundary condition the effect is minor for tracers with a constant input because the concentration gradient is small in the direction of flow in contrast to the peak shape inputs as for the historical 3h bomb pulse failure to take into account matrix diffusion and or diffusive exchange with confining layers may also introduce errors in the isotope data interpretation based on the ttd concept resulting in underestimation of the actual groundwater velocities in the conductive zones three dimensional geologic heterogeneity also affects the groundwater mixing for reasonable macro dispersivities of the aquifer material gelhar et al 1992 the effect would lead to an underestimation of the groundwater age moreover in heterogeneous aquifer systems with large hydraulic conductivity variance the travel time distribution may itself deviate from the fickian model weissmann et al 2002 gotovac et al 2009 but that is an issue beyond the scope of this paper 6 discussion and conclusions the present analysis is based on the original analytical solutions of the 2d laplace equation for steady state incompressible flow with respect to both the hydraulic head h x z and the stream function ψ x z all of the recharge inflow was treated as a fluid flux boundary condition solutions are presented for two types of outlet boundary conditions in convergent series forms from which the values of h x z and ψ x z may be computed for any x and z flow process analysis is consistent with previously published analytical and modeling studies utilizing the dupuit forchheimer concept to describe groundwater flow in isotropic homogeneous aquifer characterized by small ratios of their vertical to horizontal dimensions allowing the vertical resistance to groundwater flow to be neglected however groundwater response to the areal recharge in terms of the hydraulic head streamline pattern and residence time in the case of anisotropic heterogeneous aquifer material may be essentially different from what is predicted by this concept the solutions obtained for the stream function allow us to quantify the influence of anisotropy and heterogeneity on the flow velocity field and the depth of penetration of the recharge water it was shown that the distribution of the recharge water inflowing to an aquifer is controlled by the anisotropy and the hydraulic conductivity change with depth in a similar manner an increase in the anisotropy ratio and depth decay exponent leads to a compression of streamlines in the upper part of the aquifer which indicates that the flow focuses near the aquifer top resulting in an increased horizontal specific discharge in this part of the flow domain the similar behavior of the flow field was observed by cardenas and jiang 2010 and zlotnik et al 2011 who used prescribed head boundary condition to describe the tóthian flow in anisotropic aquifers based on the classic governing equations for hydraulic head distribution they showed that the increase in the decay rate a weakens the deep circulation while enhances the shallow circulation finally the hypothesis that flow paths display a distinct shift to shallower depths with increasing the anisotropy ratio of a fractured groundwater reservoir was supported by the study conducted by earnest and boutt 2014 who incorporated hydromechanical equations as a mechanism for creating depth dependent hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic conductivity anisotropy the streamline patterns generated by the areal recharge for two types of outflow boundary conditions are quite different in the case of the dirichlet bc streamlines show a gradual immersion to depth while in the case of the neumann bc the streamlines tend to converge upwards to the discharge area forming a re cycling structure the revealed specific discharge distribution over depth under recharge conditions caused by the permeability anisotropy and the heterogeneity of the aquifer material shall be taken into account in many hydrogeological applications first of all related to the solute transport prediction and hence to the assessment of the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination as well as to the analysis of depth specific or plan view hydrochemical and isotopic data these conclusions are even more evident in the light of the residence time behavior thus groundwater ages from streambed sampling show a symmetric lateral pattern of higher age in the center of the streambed and younger apparent age toward the stream banks gilmore et al 2016 this tendency is consistent with the theoretical prediction based on the suggested analytical solutions for the discharge into a stream of finite width through its bottom a discharge specified bc because the obtained solutions account for aquifer anisotropy and heterogeneity they wider to some extent the ability of the existing interpretation models solomon et al 2006 gilmore et al 2016 analytical solutions for the head and stream functions were used both to plot flow net which represent the trajectories of particles in a steady flow and to estimate particle travel time from a variety of distances to a flow domain boundary the results of the present study replicate the earlier findings on the high sensitivity of the transport times to depth dependent hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy earnest and boutt 2014 zlotnik et al 2014 and provide new information about the behavior of the travel time distribution function thus the derived solutions for both types of bcs indicate that the dependence of the particle travel time on anisotropy can have different tendencies depending on the streamline entrance location with respect to the aquifer lateral boundaries and on the ratio of the aquifer extension to depth the general trend is that the higher the value of the anisotropy ratio the quicker the particle migrates in term of time required to reach the outflow boundary it can be explained by the fact that an increase in the anisotropy ratio results in higher flow velocities in the upper part of the aquifer this is almost always true if the particle entrance region is located not too close to the water divide roughly x l 0 9 for a thin aquifer the location of the streamline entry region at the watershed area x l 0 9 0 95 gives another trend the lesser the anisotropy ratio the lesser the residence time for thick aquifers m l 0 3 0 5 under the same condition the relationship between the particle residence time and the anisotropy ratio may be non unique and depend on the chosen initial state the use of different anisotropy ratios in calculations can result in the same value of the residence time similar tendencies were identified for relationship between the depth decay exponent and the residence time the above phenomenon is not manifested in models where a prescribed head upper boundary condition is used jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 earnest and boutt 2014 zlotnik et al 2014 the main limitation of the presented analysis is the confined conditions assuming constant aquifer saturated thickness indeed earlier it has been shown zlotnik et al 2014 that the magnitude of variations of water table elevation may significantly affect the accuracy of results of equipotential and streamline calculation obtained for aquifer under confined condition however this shortcoming of the developed models shall not lead to serious loss of accuracy in the investigation of the unconfined deep aquifers where hydraulic gradients are moderate at least such a simplification i e flat upper boundary with a given head variation at depth z 0 is acceptable and has been widely used in theoretical analyses of 2d and 3d regional scale groundwater flow wörman et al 2006 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2017a b although the relevant efforts aimed at finding more comprehensive solutions that take into consideration unconfined flow conditions are essential in implementation of the ttd concept in the groundwater transport modeling

6041,most analytical or semi analytical models currently used to simulate multispecies transport assume instantaneous equilibrium between the dissolved and sorbed phases of the contaminant however research has demonstrated that rate limited sorption process can have a profound effect upon solute transport in the subsurface environment this study presents a novel semi analytical model for simulating the migrations of plumes of degradable contaminants subject to rate limited sorption the derived semi analytical model is then applied to investigate the effects of the rate limited nonequilibrium controlled sorption on the plume migration of degradable contaminants results show that the kinetic sorption rate constant has significant impacts on the plume migration of degradable contaminants increasing the kinetic sorption rate constant results in a reduction of predicted concentration for all species in the degradable contaminants while the equilibrium controlled sorption model lead to significant underestimation of the concentrations of degradable contaminants under conditions with low sorption damköler number the equilibrium controlled sorption model agrees well with the rate limited sorption model when the ratio of damköler number to the product of distribution coefficient and bulk density is greater than 2 or 3 order of magnitude keywords semi analytical model multispecies transport nonequilibrium controlled sorption sorption reaction rate constant damköler number 1 introduction given growing concern and recognition of the potential threat of environmental contaminants to human health researchers are placing emphasis on understanding the fate and transport of contaminants dissolved in the groundwater system study of contaminant transport problems requires the use of appropriate modeling tools mathematical models that apply analytical or numerical approaches to solve the advection dispersion equations ades have been demonstrated to be effective for comprehending the transport behavior of contaminants in subsurface environments analytical modelling is an essential and efficient tool with a variety of applications such as testing and validating numerical formulations providing approximate analysis of pollution threat scenarios performing sensitivity analysis to investigate how various parameters affect the processes of contaminant transport extrapolating results over large times or extensive spatial scales and last but not least as a screening tool a number of analytical models has been derived for describing single species transport of various contaminants batu 1993 chen et al 2016a b 2017 chen and liu 2011 gao et al 2013 leij et al 1993 liang et al 2016 park and zhan 2001 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 van genuchten and alves 1982 yeh 1981 zhan et al 2009 however the transport processes for some contaminants of concern such as nitrogenous and dissolved chlorinated solvents generally involve a more complicated series of chain degradation reactions which also play a decisive role affecting the migration of those degradable contaminants single species transport analytical models are unable to account for mass transformation from the parent species to the daughter species of degradable contaminants efforts to develop multispecies transport analytical models are required in order to more accurately evaluate the transport process of degradable contaminants however at the present time only a small number of analytical or semi analytical models for multispecies transport can be found in the literature as compared to the large number of single species transport analytical models although significant contributions have been made to develop multispecies transport analytical models over the past decades chen et al 2012a b 2016a clement 2001 lunn et al 1996 mieles and zhan 2012 pérez guerrero et al 2009 2010 quezada et al 2004 srinivasan and clement 2008a b sudicky et al 2013 suk 2013 2016 sun and clement 1999 sun et al 1999a b van genuchten 1985 yu et al 2019 currently all these multispecies transport analytical models have been derived by considering equilibrium controlled sorption process by making the equilibrium controlled assumption the rate of mass adsorption desorption between the dissolved and sorbed phases is considered to occur rapidly in comparison to the time scale required for the movement of contaminants through a porous medium when the sorption process is not sufficiently fast compared to the time scale required for transport in the dissolved phase the sorption behavior should be described as a rate limited process it has been shown that rate limited sorption process can have a profound effect on the transport behaviors of the sorbing contaminants van genuchten and wierenga 1976 nkedi kizza et al 1982 goltz and roberts 1988 ball 1999 brusseau and rao 1989 brusseau et al 1991 sought to understand the influence of rate limited sorption and nonequilibrium transport on the movement of hydrophobic organic chemicals in various low organic carbon aquifer materials their results showed that contaminants moving in a slowly flowing groundwater system could be successfully simulated with the equilibrium controlled sorption model however appropriate models based on nonequilibrium or rate limited sorption processes are needed to correctly predict the solute transport behavior for cases when the pore water velocity is so fast that local instantaneous equilibrium cannot be attained goltz and oxley 1991 demonstrated that rate limited sorption has a significant impact upon the efficiency of aquifer decontamination by pumping the use of a rate limited sorption model can be very different from the results obtained from the equilibrium controlled sorption model in predicting contaminant concentrations and remediation time haggerty and gorelick 1994 clement et al 2004 also pointed out that the commonly used equilibrium controlled sorption approach might not be valid in some environmental assessment cases they considered a rate limited sorption approach to simulate more realistic multispecies reactive transport using the three dimensional code rt3d clement 1997 khandelwal and rabideau 1999 developed a semi analytical solution for simulating multi species transport subject to rate limited sorption their solution considered four species and a first type inlet boundary condition notwithstanding the use of first type inlet condition lead to physically improper mass conservation and significant errors in predicting the species concentration for a groundwater system with a large dispersion coefficient the objective of this study is to develop a novel semi analytical model for describing multispecies reactive transport subject to rate limited sorption the novel semi analytical model has two key feature first the third type inlet boundary conditions which can satisfy physical mass conservation are considered second the solution is derived for an arbitrary number of species of degradable contaminants third the generalized solution with a parsimonious mathematical expression is obtained for any product generated from a series of chain reaction the correctness of the derived semi analytical models is evaluated by a comparison of the computational results of our novel model with those obtained from a multispecies transport analytical model subject to equilibrium controlled sorption in the literature and a numerical model that is constructed by solving the same set of coupled transport equations using the laplace transform finite difference ltfd method moridis and reddell 1991 the derived semi analytical model is then applied to investigate the effects of the rate limited sorption on the multispecies transport of degradable contaminants moreover we also investigate how the inlet boundary condition affects the multispecies transport 2 development of a multispecies semi analytical model this study considers the multispecies transport of degradable contaminants subject to rate limited sorption the contaminant transport is controlled by the movement of the groundwater flow hydrodynamic dispersion as well as the degradation reaction and the rate limited sorption on the microscopic scale sorption refers to the exchange of contaminants between the dissolved and sorbed phases instead of the widely used equilibrium controlled sorption assumption this study considers rate limited nonequilibrium controlled sorption the rate limited sorption process is often represented as a first order reversible kinetic reaction when dissolved contaminants migrate in the groundwater flow system there is a loss of contaminant mass in the dissolved phase due to the degradation reactions and rate limited sorption one key feature of the so called multispecies model is that the mass accumulation of the predecessors is also considered based on the conceptual description the governing equations for describing one dimensional transport of degradable contaminants involving an arbitrary number of species undergoing a series of first order degradation reactions in the dissolved phase and first order reversible kinetic sorption reaction between the dissolved and sorbed phases are 1a d 2 c 1 x t x 2 v c 1 x t x λ 1 c 1 x t β 1 θ c 1 x t s 1 x t k 1 c 1 x t t 1b d 2 c

dissolved phase ml 3 s i x t is the concentration of species i in the sorbed phase mm 1 v is the average uniform pore water velocity lt 1 d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2t 1 x is the spatial coordinate l t is the time t θ is the porosity ρ b is the bulk dry density of the solid grain ml 3 k i is the distribution coefficient of species i m 1 l3 λ i is the first order degradation rate constant of species i in the dissolved phase t 1 β i is the first order sorption rate constant of species i between the dissolved and sorbed phases t 1 referred to as the kinetic sorption rate constant thereafter n is the total species number of degradable contaminants eqs 1a and 1b describe the advective dispersive transport of the dissolved phase of degradable contaminants subject to a series of first order degradation reactions and first order reversible kinetic rate limited mass transfer due to sorption the mass transfer between the dissolved and sorbed phases of multiple species is represented by a first order reversible kinetic reaction coupled to the equations so that the assumption of rate limited sorption can be considered eq 2 accounts for mass conservation in the sorbed phase of multiple species the fourth term on the left hand side of eq 1a and the fifth term on the left hand side of eq 1b quantify the mass accumulation from the predecessor species between the dissolved and sorbed phases note that these eq 2 considers that the degradation reactions occur exclusively in the dissolved phase and justifying the validity of the assumption is required for more reasonably and accurately simulating the transport behavior using our derived analytical model many studies for modeling transport of organic contaminants neglect the degradation in the sorbed phase for example clement et al 2004 modeled dnapl dissolution rate limited sorption and biodegradation reactions in groundwater systems using the three dimensional code rt3d clement 1997 with exclusively degradation occurring in the dissolved phase neglect of degradation in the sorbed phase was also adopted by biochlor software and haggerty and gorelick 1994 currently limited data in the literature can be provided to justify the validity of the assumption the degradation rate constants for the dissolved and sorbed phases are very site specific and should differ as a function of many factors involved in the complex interactions among microorganisms contaminants and constituents of solid particles jury et al 1987 it is generally accepted that sorption can block the degradation of organic contaminants guo et al 2000 earlier experimental work from many studies showed the evidence of the negative dependence of degradation on sorption for a variety of contaminants cantwell et al 1989 smith et al 1992 it is postulated that the contaminants in the sorbed phase are less accessible to microorganisms that utilize exclusively or preferentially contaminants in the dissolved phase guo et al 2000 nevertheless inverse dependence of sorption on degradation does not necessarily mean that degradation of contaminants in the sorbed phase should be negligible guo et al 2000 presented a nonequilibrium model to quantitatively characterize the effect of sorption on degradation of 2 4 d and to examine the role of nonequilibrium sorption plays in degradation kinetics in combined use of batch sorption and incubation experiments they estimated the degradation rate constant of 0 157 and 0 00243 day 1 for the dissolved and sorbed phases respectively differing by a factor of 65 for this case it seems the degradation in the sorbed phase can be safely neglected in the modeling approach because the degradation rate in the dissolved phase is much faster than that in the sorbed phase although the simpler model that the degradation in the sorbed phase is neglected developed in this study seems to suffice for modeling a case with a small degradation rate constant in the sorbed phase however the more refined model that considers degradation in both the dissolved and sorbed phases is much more useful and necessary in accurately evaluating all the decaying and degradable contaminants especially when the decay or degradation simultaneously occurring in the dissolved and sorbed phases the above coupled equations described in eqs 1a 1b and 2 must be solved simultaneously to obtain the solutions for each individual species in the dissolved and sorbed phases it should be pointed out that for the sake of clarity the porous medium is considered homogeneous and all the aforementioned transport parameters of the porous medium are assumed to be independent of time and space the medium is initially assumed to be free of the individual species mass of a decay chain in both the dissolved and sorbed phases 3 c i x t 0 0 i 1 n 4 s i x t 0 0 i 1 n there is assumed to be a continuous constant concentration of dissolved phase contaminant sources the contaminant sources are treated mathematically as third type boundary conditions and formulated as 5 d c i x 0 t x v c i x 0 t v c i 0 i 1 n where c i 0 is the source of the constant concentration of species i at the inlet boundary ml 3 the third type boundary conditions in eq 5 is regarded as satisfying the principle of mass conservation of each individual species at the inlet boundary a finite domain subsurface porous medium system is considered in this study considering the mass conservation of each individual species at the outlet boundary a second type boundary condition with zero concentration gradient is used and can be mathematically expressed as 6 c i x l t x 0 i 1 n where l is the length of the transport system l the derivation of the analytical solutions to the initial boundary value problem as defined in eqs 1a 1b and 2 6 is facilitated by reducing the number of model parameters the coupled governing equations initial conditions and boundary conditions are transformed into dimensionless forms as follows 6a 1 pe c 1 2 x t x 2 c 1 x t x λ 1 c 1 x t b 1 θ c 1 x t s 1 x t k 1 c 1 x t t i 2 n 6b 1 pe 2 c i x t x 2 c i x t x λ i c i x t λ i 1 c i 1 x t b i θ c i x t s i x t k i c i x t t 7

first step is to take the laplace transform with respect to t after the laplace transform eqs 6a 6b and 7 can be expressed as 12a 1 pe d 2 c 1 l x s d x 2 d c 1 l x s dx λ 1 c 1 l x s b 1 θ c 1 l x s

x s where c i l x s 0 e s t c i x t d t and c i l x s 0 e s t c i x t d t s is the laplace transform parameter then we can solve eq 13 algebraically for the transform of the sorbed phase concentration for each individual species s i l x s and s i l x s is conveniently expressed in terms of the transform of dissolved phase concentration for each individual species c i l x s through substitution of the relations between s i l x s c i l x s eqs 12a and 12b can be expressed as 14a 1 pe d 2 c 1 l x s d x 2 d c 1 l x s dx θ 1 s c 1 l x s 0 14b 1 pe d 2 c i l x s d x 2 d c i l x s dx θ i s c i l x s

1 n next the integral transform technique is used to eliminate the x variable and reduce the system of the ordinary differential equations into a set of linear algebraic equations prior to applying the integral transform technique we need to homogenize the boundary condition in eq 15 and convert eqs 14a and 14b into purely diffusive equations the homogenization of the boundary conditions in eq 15 is done with a change of variable 17 c i lv x s e pe 2 x c i l x s c i 0 s where c i lv x s is the variable change of c i l x s eqs 14a 14b 15 and 16 are then written as 18a 1 pe d 2 c 1 lv x s d x

eqs 18a and 18b and their corresponding boundary conditions in eqs 19 and 20 the appropriate integral transform pairs in relation to eqs 18a 18b 19 and 20 can be found as follows chen et al 2012a 21a

transform of eq 25 cannot be carried out to yield the solution in exact fashion at present methods based on the fourier series been proposed for numerical inversion of laplace transform the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm is frequently used to execute the numerical inversion because it is accurate for a wide range of functions and it also performs reasonably well in the neighborhood of a discontinuity as demonstrated by moench 1991 the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm was based on accelerating the convergence of the fourier series obtained from the inversion integral using the trapezoidal rule moench 1991 also demonstrated how to use the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm to numerically obtain the real time domain concentration for a convergent flow tracer transport problem a fortran subroutine dinlap inlap provided by imsl subroutine library visual numerics inc 1994 based on the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm is readily used to evaluate the concentration value of the solution in the real time domain 3 results and discussion 3 1 convergence evaluation and verification of the derived analytical solution the derived semi analytical solution in eq 25 is mathematically expressed as the sum of an infinite series expansion the numerical evaluation of this infinite series expansion sum can be calculated straightforwardly to ensure the precision of the numerical evaluation while at the same time avoiding the redundant computation of the infinite series expansion term by term it is important to investigate the convergence behavior of the numerical evaluation of the derived analytical solutions we executed routine convergence tests to determine the optimal number required for summing up the infinite series expansion term by term to obtain the desired accuracies an illustrated example coming from the manual for the most commonly used public domain model biochlor provided by the center for subsurface modeling support of the united states environmental protection agency usepa aziz et al 2000 is considered herein to evaluate the convergence of the numerical calculation of the developed analytical model this illustrative example simulates the natural attenuation of the groundwater contaminant plumes of a chlorinated solvent site the biodegradation pathway of the chlorinated solvent is assumed to follow sequential first order kinetics as follows pce tce dce vc eth the descriptive simulation conditions and transport parameters are summarized in table 1 table2 show the convergence behavior obtained by the numerical evaluation of the spatial concentration profiles of the five species using the derived analytical solution in eq 24 with a desired accuracy of 2 decimal digits in table 2 n is defined as the number required for summing up the infinite series expansion term by term it can be seen that for larger values of pe the evaluation must be carried out with a large number for summing up the series expansion to desired accuracy of 2 decimal digits moreover the number required for accurately summing up the series expansion decreases as the serial number of the species increases the number of terms required for convergence are 40 1000 and 16 000 for pe 1 10 and 20 respectively for the pce of the first species and 20 320 and 2 000 respectively for pe 1 10 and 20 for the tce of the second species for vc of the fourth species convergence is reached when the numbers of terms are 8 80 and 800 for pe 1 10 and 20 while for eth only 8 20 and 100 terms are required to meet the desired accuracy for pe 1 10 and 20 a computer code for executing the calculation of the developed semi analytical model is constructed based on the aforementioned convergence criterion comparison between the computed results obtained from the computer code constructed for the analytical model and the simulated results from a corresponding numerical solutions is carried out to assess the correctness the derived analytical model as well as the accuracy of its auxiliary computer code the numerical solutions are obtained using the laplace transform finite difference ltfd method developed by moridis and reddell 1991 for the purpose of solving the partial differential equation for transient groundwater flow through porous media the ltfd method provides an approach to solve the discretized partial differential equation in the laplace domain and then numerically invert the transformed solution vectors therefore we are able to obtain a solution which is only discretized in space and continuous in time the comparative example considers the same simulation conditions and transport parameters for natural attenuation of the contamination plumes of a chlorinated solvent site as those used for the convergence evaluation the comparison clearly shows excellent agreement between the spatial concentration distributions for all five species obtained from the semi analytical and numerical solutions see supporting information the results confirm the correctness of the developed semi analytical models as well as the accuracy and usefulness of the constructed computer code 3 2 effect of the kinetic sorption rate constant β i the major merit of the derived semi analytical solution is that the sorption process can be more realistically and flexibly described as a first order reversible kinetic sorption process with an important kinetic sorption rate constant β i therefore we are interested in how β i affects the multispecies plume migration we now consider the same multispecies transport problem used in the previous numerical convergence evaluation and solution verification to investigate the effect of β i on multispecies plume development the simulation conditions and model parameters used in the convergence tests are considered as a baseline simulation for each of the individual species i four values of β i 0 05 0 5 5 and 50 year 1 are considered in order to investigate the effect of β i on multispecies transport fig 1 depicts the spatial concentration profiles of the five species at t 1 year under different β i values the spatial concentration profiles of the five species obtained with the equilibrium controlled linear sorption model developed by chen et al 2016b are also included in fig 1 it is found that an increase in β i will lead to a decrease in the peak concentration and a upstream shift in the location of the peak concentration as β i continues to increase the spatial concentration profile obtained from the rate limited sorption model of gradually reaches those obtained from the equilibrium controlled sorption model the spatial concentration profiles show that the rate limited sorption model of β i 50 year 1 coincides with the equilibrium controlled sorption model it further demonstrates that the asymptotical condition of the rate limited sorption model agrees with the equilibrium controlled sorption model the higher peak concentrations predicted by the rate limited sorption model with small β i values have important implications for groundwater contaminant concentration predictions as well as the assessment of the risk to human health it should be noted that the health risk might be underestimated when an equilibrium controlled sorption model is used for assessing the exposure concentration the concentrations of five species as a function of time at distances x 165 35 m from the source boundary are also depicted in fig 2 it can be observed from fig 2 the time for the concentration above a specific concentration is sensitive to β i when β i values is small for example the time for vc concentrations being above 10 mg l for β i 0 05 0 5 5 and 50 year 1 are 4 6 6 2 and 6 2 years respectively to measure the relative importance of rate limited sorption between the dissolved and sorbed phases in comparison to advection process the sorption damköler number d a i b i β i l v which is the ratio of time l v taken for the groundwater moving a distance l through the aquifer to the time scale for kinetic sorption rate constant β i is considered the d a i is a dimensionless number to relate the sorption reaction rate to the advective transport rate is considered a smaller value of d a i indicates that the sorption reaction rate between the dissolved and the sorbed phase is relatively smaller in comparison to rate of the groundwater flow through a porous medium as β i gradually increases the d a i increases proportionally with coincidence between the rate limited sorption model of β i 50 y 1 and the equilibrium controlled sorption model d a i β i l v 50 y 1 330 7 m 34 0 m y 486 is obtained it should be noted that d a i 486 for validity condition of the equilibrium controlled sorption model is obtained on our descriptive simulation conditions and transport parameters we can rearrange eq 7 can be expressed as 26 k i ρ b b i s i x t t k i c i x t s i x t therefore k i ρ b b i k i ρ b d a i is an important parameters to determine if the equilibrium controlled sorption can be assumed it is suggested that the equilibrium controlled sorption model can replace the rate limited sorption model when the ratio of the damkoler number to the product of the distribution coefficient and bulk density is greater than 2 or 3 order of magnitude the results of the aforementioned investigation clearly evidence that the kinetic sorption rate constant is an important parameter governing the multispecies plume transport however because of the difficulty in obtaining the sorption reaction rate constant current transport modeling practices are often based on the equilibrium sorption assumption thus more efforts are required to develop a method for more effective and accurately determining the kinetic sorption rate coefficient in the field 3 3 effect of inlet boundary condition several previous studies have discussed the mass balance constraints and potential errors in concentration prediction when improper inlet boundary conditions are used for the development of the single species transport analytical model van genuchten and parker 1974 leij et al 1991 chen et al 2011a b single species transport analytical models with a first type inlet condition give rise to physically improper mass conservation and significant errors in predicting the solute concentration distribution especially for a porous medium system with a large longitudinal dispersion coefficient if it is used to interpret the usual volume average concentration selection of the appropriate inlet boundary condition has been the subject of much investigation such as for the study of solute transport either in a uniform flow van genuchten and parker 1974 leij et al 1991 chen et al 2011a b or a radial flow field chen 1987 to the best of the author s knowledge the effect of the inlet boundary condition on multispecies transport has not been investigated yet here the impact of the inlet boundary conditions on multispecies transport are investigated using our derived multispecies transport analytical models subject to the first type and third type inlet boundary conditions the analytical solutions for the first type inlet boundary condition can be easily obtained following the same method chen et al 2011b has showed how to obtain the analytical solution for single species transport in a finite domain with a first type inlet boundary condition fig 3 depicts the spatial concentration profiles of the five species at t 1 year for both the first type and third type inlet boundary conditions using different dispersion coefficient values it is observed that the predicted concentration is higher for the first type inlet boundary condition than with the third type inlet boundary condition for all species moreover with an increasing dispersion coefficient the discrepancy between the concentration distributions for first type and third type inlet boundary conditions increases along with the discrepancy between the peak concentrations the results show that improper inlet boundary conditions leads to pronounced mass balance errors and the discrepancy increases as the dispersion coefficient increases to investigate the mass balance errors caused by the improper first type boundary conditions the mass flux error is defined as 27 mass flux error d c i x 0 t x v c i x 0 t v c i 0 with substitution of the solutions for each species derived for the first type boundary conditions into eq 27 the mass flux errors for each species caused by the use of improper first type boundary conditions can be calculated fig 4 depicts the calculated mass flux errors of 5 species as functions of time for different pe values with fixed β i 5 year 1 the mass flux errors for 5 species is pronounced for small pe values but it become smaller when large pe values is considered we also investigate how the mass flux errors is affected by the β i values when pe 5 as shown in fig 5 the mass flux errors increases with increasing β i values for pce tce and dce whereas the mass flux errors increases with decreasing β i values for vc and eth the calculated mass flux errors of 5 species for the solutions derived for the first type boundary conditions shows the importance of using proper boundary conditions in modeling the transport of degradable contaminants in groundwater 4 conclusions in this study a novel semi analytical model is developed for multispecies advective dispersive transport subject to rate limited sorption the developed model is then applied to assess the effects of the kinetic sorption rate constant on multispecies transport increasing the kinetic sorption rate constant leads to lower concentration predictions for all species of the degradable contaminants the equilibrium controlled sorption model could significantly underestimate the concentration of decaying or degradable contaminants under the condition of a low sorption damköler number d a i β i l v but will agrees well with the rate limited sorption model when the sorption damköler number is greater than 486 it should be noted that d a i 486 for validity condition of the equilibrium controlled sorption model is obtained on our descriptive simulation conditions and transport parameters uncertainty analysis on the value for the threshold of da should be conducted to support the general validity condition the invalidity of the equilibrium controlled sorption model under a low sorption damköler number suggests that the health risk might be underestimated when an equilibrium controlled sorption model is used for assessing the exposure concentration in the health risk assessment of the contaminated site moreover the solution strategy presented in this study can be extended to derive analytical models for multispecies

6041,most analytical or semi analytical models currently used to simulate multispecies transport assume instantaneous equilibrium between the dissolved and sorbed phases of the contaminant however research has demonstrated that rate limited sorption process can have a profound effect upon solute transport in the subsurface environment this study presents a novel semi analytical model for simulating the migrations of plumes of degradable contaminants subject to rate limited sorption the derived semi analytical model is then applied to investigate the effects of the rate limited nonequilibrium controlled sorption on the plume migration of degradable contaminants results show that the kinetic sorption rate constant has significant impacts on the plume migration of degradable contaminants increasing the kinetic sorption rate constant results in a reduction of predicted concentration for all species in the degradable contaminants while the equilibrium controlled sorption model lead to significant underestimation of the concentrations of degradable contaminants under conditions with low sorption damköler number the equilibrium controlled sorption model agrees well with the rate limited sorption model when the ratio of damköler number to the product of distribution coefficient and bulk density is greater than 2 or 3 order of magnitude keywords semi analytical model multispecies transport nonequilibrium controlled sorption sorption reaction rate constant damköler number 1 introduction given growing concern and recognition of the potential threat of environmental contaminants to human health researchers are placing emphasis on understanding the fate and transport of contaminants dissolved in the groundwater system study of contaminant transport problems requires the use of appropriate modeling tools mathematical models that apply analytical or numerical approaches to solve the advection dispersion equations ades have been demonstrated to be effective for comprehending the transport behavior of contaminants in subsurface environments analytical modelling is an essential and efficient tool with a variety of applications such as testing and validating numerical formulations providing approximate analysis of pollution threat scenarios performing sensitivity analysis to investigate how various parameters affect the processes of contaminant transport extrapolating results over large times or extensive spatial scales and last but not least as a screening tool a number of analytical models has been derived for describing single species transport of various contaminants batu 1993 chen et al 2016a b 2017 chen and liu 2011 gao et al 2013 leij et al 1993 liang et al 2016 park and zhan 2001 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 van genuchten and alves 1982 yeh 1981 zhan et al 2009 however the transport processes for some contaminants of concern such as nitrogenous and dissolved chlorinated solvents generally involve a more complicated series of chain degradation reactions which also play a decisive role affecting the migration of those degradable contaminants single species transport analytical models are unable to account for mass transformation from the parent species to the daughter species of degradable contaminants efforts to develop multispecies transport analytical models are required in order to more accurately evaluate the transport process of degradable contaminants however at the present time only a small number of analytical or semi analytical models for multispecies transport can be found in the literature as compared to the large number of single species transport analytical models although significant contributions have been made to develop multispecies transport analytical models over the past decades chen et al 2012a b 2016a clement 2001 lunn et al 1996 mieles and zhan 2012 pérez guerrero et al 2009 2010 quezada et al 2004 srinivasan and clement 2008a b sudicky et al 2013 suk 2013 2016 sun and clement 1999 sun et al 1999a b van genuchten 1985 yu et al 2019 currently all these multispecies transport analytical models have been derived by considering equilibrium controlled sorption process by making the equilibrium controlled assumption the rate of mass adsorption desorption between the dissolved and sorbed phases is considered to occur rapidly in comparison to the time scale required for the movement of contaminants through a porous medium when the sorption process is not sufficiently fast compared to the time scale required for transport in the dissolved phase the sorption behavior should be described as a rate limited process it has been shown that rate limited sorption process can have a profound effect on the transport behaviors of the sorbing contaminants van genuchten and wierenga 1976 nkedi kizza et al 1982 goltz and roberts 1988 ball 1999 brusseau and rao 1989 brusseau et al 1991 sought to understand the influence of rate limited sorption and nonequilibrium transport on the movement of hydrophobic organic chemicals in various low organic carbon aquifer materials their results showed that contaminants moving in a slowly flowing groundwater system could be successfully simulated with the equilibrium controlled sorption model however appropriate models based on nonequilibrium or rate limited sorption processes are needed to correctly predict the solute transport behavior for cases when the pore water velocity is so fast that local instantaneous equilibrium cannot be attained goltz and oxley 1991 demonstrated that rate limited sorption has a significant impact upon the efficiency of aquifer decontamination by pumping the use of a rate limited sorption model can be very different from the results obtained from the equilibrium controlled sorption model in predicting contaminant concentrations and remediation time haggerty and gorelick 1994 clement et al 2004 also pointed out that the commonly used equilibrium controlled sorption approach might not be valid in some environmental assessment cases they considered a rate limited sorption approach to simulate more realistic multispecies reactive transport using the three dimensional code rt3d clement 1997 khandelwal and rabideau 1999 developed a semi analytical solution for simulating multi species transport subject to rate limited sorption their solution considered four species and a first type inlet boundary condition notwithstanding the use of first type inlet condition lead to physically improper mass conservation and significant errors in predicting the species concentration for a groundwater system with a large dispersion coefficient the objective of this study is to develop a novel semi analytical model for describing multispecies reactive transport subject to rate limited sorption the novel semi analytical model has two key feature first the third type inlet boundary conditions which can satisfy physical mass conservation are considered second the solution is derived for an arbitrary number of species of degradable contaminants third the generalized solution with a parsimonious mathematical expression is obtained for any product generated from a series of chain reaction the correctness of the derived semi analytical models is evaluated by a comparison of the computational results of our novel model with those obtained from a multispecies transport analytical model subject to equilibrium controlled sorption in the literature and a numerical model that is constructed by solving the same set of coupled transport equations using the laplace transform finite difference ltfd method moridis and reddell 1991 the derived semi analytical model is then applied to investigate the effects of the rate limited sorption on the multispecies transport of degradable contaminants moreover we also investigate how the inlet boundary condition affects the multispecies transport 2 development of a multispecies semi analytical model this study considers the multispecies transport of degradable contaminants subject to rate limited sorption the contaminant transport is controlled by the movement of the groundwater flow hydrodynamic dispersion as well as the degradation reaction and the rate limited sorption on the microscopic scale sorption refers to the exchange of contaminants between the dissolved and sorbed phases instead of the widely used equilibrium controlled sorption assumption this study considers rate limited nonequilibrium controlled sorption the rate limited sorption process is often represented as a first order reversible kinetic reaction when dissolved contaminants migrate in the groundwater flow system there is a loss of contaminant mass in the dissolved phase due to the degradation reactions and rate limited sorption one key feature of the so called multispecies model is that the mass accumulation of the predecessors is also considered based on the conceptual description the governing equations for describing one dimensional transport of degradable contaminants involving an arbitrary number of species undergoing a series of first order degradation reactions in the dissolved phase and first order reversible kinetic sorption reaction between the dissolved and sorbed phases are 1a d 2 c 1 x t x 2 v c 1 x t x λ 1 c 1 x t β 1 θ c 1 x t s 1 x t k 1 c 1 x t t 1b d 2 c

dissolved phase ml 3 s i x t is the concentration of species i in the sorbed phase mm 1 v is the average uniform pore water velocity lt 1 d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2t 1 x is the spatial coordinate l t is the time t θ is the porosity ρ b is the bulk dry density of the solid grain ml 3 k i is the distribution coefficient of species i m 1 l3 λ i is the first order degradation rate constant of species i in the dissolved phase t 1 β i is the first order sorption rate constant of species i between the dissolved and sorbed phases t 1 referred to as the kinetic sorption rate constant thereafter n is the total species number of degradable contaminants eqs 1a and 1b describe the advective dispersive transport of the dissolved phase of degradable contaminants subject to a series of first order degradation reactions and first order reversible kinetic rate limited mass transfer due to sorption the mass transfer between the dissolved and sorbed phases of multiple species is represented by a first order reversible kinetic reaction coupled to the equations so that the assumption of rate limited sorption can be considered eq 2 accounts for mass conservation in the sorbed phase of multiple species the fourth term on the left hand side of eq 1a and the fifth term on the left hand side of eq 1b quantify the mass accumulation from the predecessor species between the dissolved and sorbed phases note that these eq 2 considers that the degradation reactions occur exclusively in the dissolved phase and justifying the validity of the assumption is required for more reasonably and accurately simulating the transport behavior using our derived analytical model many studies for modeling transport of organic contaminants neglect the degradation in the sorbed phase for example clement et al 2004 modeled dnapl dissolution rate limited sorption and biodegradation reactions in groundwater systems using the three dimensional code rt3d clement 1997 with exclusively degradation occurring in the dissolved phase neglect of degradation in the sorbed phase was also adopted by biochlor software and haggerty and gorelick 1994 currently limited data in the literature can be provided to justify the validity of the assumption the degradation rate constants for the dissolved and sorbed phases are very site specific and should differ as a function of many factors involved in the complex interactions among microorganisms contaminants and constituents of solid particles jury et al 1987 it is generally accepted that sorption can block the degradation of organic contaminants guo et al 2000 earlier experimental work from many studies showed the evidence of the negative dependence of degradation on sorption for a variety of contaminants cantwell et al 1989 smith et al 1992 it is postulated that the contaminants in the sorbed phase are less accessible to microorganisms that utilize exclusively or preferentially contaminants in the dissolved phase guo et al 2000 nevertheless inverse dependence of sorption on degradation does not necessarily mean that degradation of contaminants in the sorbed phase should be negligible guo et al 2000 presented a nonequilibrium model to quantitatively characterize the effect of sorption on degradation of 2 4 d and to examine the role of nonequilibrium sorption plays in degradation kinetics in combined use of batch sorption and incubation experiments they estimated the degradation rate constant of 0 157 and 0 00243 day 1 for the dissolved and sorbed phases respectively differing by a factor of 65 for this case it seems the degradation in the sorbed phase can be safely neglected in the modeling approach because the degradation rate in the dissolved phase is much faster than that in the sorbed phase although the simpler model that the degradation in the sorbed phase is neglected developed in this study seems to suffice for modeling a case with a small degradation rate constant in the sorbed phase however the more refined model that considers degradation in both the dissolved and sorbed phases is much more useful and necessary in accurately evaluating all the decaying and degradable contaminants especially when the decay or degradation simultaneously occurring in the dissolved and sorbed phases the above coupled equations described in eqs 1a 1b and 2 must be solved simultaneously to obtain the solutions for each individual species in the dissolved and sorbed phases it should be pointed out that for the sake of clarity the porous medium is considered homogeneous and all the aforementioned transport parameters of the porous medium are assumed to be independent of time and space the medium is initially assumed to be free of the individual species mass of a decay chain in both the dissolved and sorbed phases 3 c i x t 0 0 i 1 n 4 s i x t 0 0 i 1 n there is assumed to be a continuous constant concentration of dissolved phase contaminant sources the contaminant sources are treated mathematically as third type boundary conditions and formulated as 5 d c i x 0 t x v c i x 0 t v c i 0 i 1 n where c i 0 is the source of the constant concentration of species i at the inlet boundary ml 3 the third type boundary conditions in eq 5 is regarded as satisfying the principle of mass conservation of each individual species at the inlet boundary a finite domain subsurface porous medium system is considered in this study considering the mass conservation of each individual species at the outlet boundary a second type boundary condition with zero concentration gradient is used and can be mathematically expressed as 6 c i x l t x 0 i 1 n where l is the length of the transport system l the derivation of the analytical solutions to the initial boundary value problem as defined in eqs 1a 1b and 2 6 is facilitated by reducing the number of model parameters the coupled governing equations initial conditions and boundary conditions are transformed into dimensionless forms as follows 6a 1 pe c 1 2 x t x 2 c 1 x t x λ 1 c 1 x t b 1 θ c 1 x t s 1 x t k 1 c 1 x t t i 2 n 6b 1 pe 2 c i x t x 2 c i x t x λ i c i x t λ i 1 c i 1 x t b i θ c i x t s i x t k i c i x t t 7

first step is to take the laplace transform with respect to t after the laplace transform eqs 6a 6b and 7 can be expressed as 12a 1 pe d 2 c 1 l x s d x 2 d c 1 l x s dx λ 1 c 1 l x s b 1 θ c 1 l x s

for each individual species s i l x s and s i l x s is conveniently expressed in terms of the transform of dissolved phase concentration for each individual species c i l x s through substitution of

1 n next the integral transform technique is used to eliminate the x variable and reduce the system of the ordinary differential equations into a set of linear algebraic equations prior to applying the integral transform technique we need to homogenize the boundary condition in eq 15 and convert eqs 14a and 14b into purely diffusive equations the homogenization of the boundary conditions in eq 15 is done with a change of variable 17 c i lv x s e pe 2 x c i l x s c i 0 s where c i lv x s is the variable change of c i l x s eqs 14a 14b 15 and 16 are then written as 18a 1 pe d 2 c 1 lv x s d x

eqs 18a and 18b and their corresponding boundary conditions in eqs 19 and 20 the appropriate integral transform pairs in relation to eqs 18a 18b 19 and 20 can be found as follows chen et al 2012a 21a

transform of eq 25 cannot be carried out to yield the solution in exact fashion at present methods based on the fourier series been proposed for numerical inversion of laplace transform the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm is frequently used to execute the numerical inversion because it is accurate for a wide range of functions and it also performs reasonably well in the neighborhood of a discontinuity as demonstrated by moench 1991 the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm was based on accelerating the convergence of the fourier series obtained from the inversion integral using the trapezoidal rule moench 1991 also demonstrated how to use the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm to numerically obtain the real time domain concentration for a convergent flow tracer transport problem a fortran subroutine dinlap inlap provided by imsl subroutine library visual numerics inc 1994 based on the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm is readily used to evaluate the concentration value of the solution in the real time domain 3 results and discussion 3 1 convergence evaluation and verification of the derived analytical solution the derived semi analytical solution in eq 25 is mathematically expressed as the sum of an infinite series expansion the numerical evaluation of this infinite series expansion sum can be calculated straightforwardly to ensure the precision of the numerical evaluation while at the same time avoiding the redundant computation of the infinite series expansion term by term it is important to investigate the convergence behavior of the numerical evaluation of the derived analytical solutions we executed routine convergence tests to determine the optimal number required for summing up the infinite series expansion term by term to obtain the desired accuracies an illustrated example coming from the manual for the most commonly used public domain model biochlor provided by the center for subsurface modeling support of the united states environmental protection agency usepa aziz et al 2000 is considered herein to evaluate the convergence of the numerical calculation of the developed analytical model this illustrative example simulates the natural attenuation of the groundwater contaminant plumes of a chlorinated solvent site the biodegradation pathway of the chlorinated solvent is assumed to follow sequential first order kinetics as follows pce tce dce vc eth the descriptive simulation conditions and transport parameters are summarized in table 1 table2 show the convergence behavior obtained by the numerical evaluation of the spatial concentration profiles of the five species using the derived analytical solution in eq 24 with a desired accuracy of 2 decimal digits in table 2 n is defined as the number required for summing up the infinite series expansion term by term it can be seen that for larger values of pe the evaluation must be carried out with a large number for summing up the series expansion to desired accuracy of 2 decimal digits moreover the number required for accurately summing up the series expansion decreases as the serial number of the species increases the number of terms required for convergence are 40 1000 and 16 000 for pe 1 10 and 20 respectively for the pce of the first species and 20 320 and 2 000 respectively for pe 1 10 and 20 for the tce of the second species for vc of the fourth species convergence is reached when the numbers of terms are 8 80 and 800 for pe 1 10 and 20 while for eth only 8 20 and 100 terms are required to meet the desired accuracy for pe 1 10 and 20 a computer code for executing the calculation of the developed semi analytical model is constructed based on the aforementioned convergence criterion comparison between the computed results obtained from the computer code constructed for the analytical model and the simulated results from a corresponding numerical solutions is carried out to assess the correctness the derived analytical model as well as the accuracy of its auxiliary computer code the numerical solutions are obtained using the laplace transform finite difference ltfd method developed by moridis and reddell 1991 for the purpose of solving the partial differential equation for transient groundwater flow through porous media the ltfd method provides an approach to solve the discretized partial differential equation in the laplace domain and then numerically invert the transformed solution vectors therefore we are able to obtain a solution which is only discretized in space and continuous in time the comparative example considers the same simulation conditions and transport parameters for natural attenuation of the contamination plumes of a chlorinated solvent site as those used for the convergence evaluation the comparison clearly shows excellent agreement between the spatial concentration distributions for all five species obtained from the semi analytical and numerical solutions see supporting information the results confirm the correctness of the developed semi analytical models as well as the accuracy and usefulness of the constructed computer code 3 2 effect of the kinetic sorption rate constant β i the major merit of the derived semi analytical solution is that the sorption process can be more realistically and flexibly described as a first order reversible kinetic sorption process with an important kinetic sorption rate constant β i therefore we are interested in how β i affects the multispecies plume migration we now consider the same multispecies transport problem used in the previous numerical convergence evaluation and solution verification to investigate the effect of β i on multispecies plume development the simulation conditions and model parameters used in the convergence tests are considered as a baseline simulation for each of the individual species i four values of β i 0 05 0 5 5 and 50 year 1 are considered in order to investigate the effect of β i on multispecies transport fig 1 depicts the spatial concentration profiles of the five species at t 1 year under different β i values the spatial concentration profiles of the five species obtained with the equilibrium controlled linear sorption model developed by chen et al 2016b are also included in fig 1 it is found that an increase in β i will lead to a decrease in the peak concentration and a upstream shift in the location of the peak concentration as β i continues to increase the spatial concentration profile obtained from the rate limited sorption model of gradually reaches those obtained from the equilibrium controlled sorption model the spatial concentration profiles show that the rate limited sorption model of β i 50 year 1 coincides with the equilibrium controlled sorption model it further demonstrates that the asymptotical condition of the rate limited sorption model agrees with the equilibrium controlled sorption model the higher peak concentrations predicted by the rate limited sorption model with small β i values have important implications for groundwater contaminant concentration predictions as well as the assessment of the risk to human health it should be noted that the health risk might be underestimated when an equilibrium controlled sorption model is used for assessing the exposure concentration the concentrations of five species as a function of time at distances x 165 35 m from the source boundary are also depicted in fig 2 it can be observed from fig 2 the time for the concentration above a specific concentration is sensitive to β i when β i values is small for example the time for vc concentrations being above 10 mg l for β i 0 05 0 5 5 and 50 year 1 are 4 6 6 2 and 6 2 years respectively to measure the relative importance of rate limited sorption between the dissolved and sorbed phases in comparison to advection process the sorption damköler number d a i b i β i l v which is the ratio of time l v taken for the groundwater moving a distance l through the aquifer to the time scale for kinetic sorption rate constant β i is considered the d a i is a dimensionless number to relate the sorption reaction rate to the advective transport rate is considered a smaller value of d a i indicates that the sorption reaction rate between the dissolved and the sorbed phase is relatively smaller in comparison to rate of the groundwater flow through a porous medium as β i gradually increases the d a i increases proportionally with coincidence between the rate limited sorption model of β i 50 y 1 and the equilibrium controlled sorption model d a i β i l v 50 y 1 330 7 m 34 0 m y 486 is obtained it should be noted that d a i 486 for validity condition of the equilibrium controlled sorption model is obtained on our descriptive simulation conditions and transport parameters we can rearrange eq 7 can be expressed as 26 k i ρ b b i s i x t t k i c i x t s i x t therefore k i ρ b b i k i ρ b d a i is an important parameters to determine if the equilibrium controlled sorption can be assumed it is suggested that the equilibrium controlled sorption model can replace the rate limited sorption model when the ratio of the damkoler number to the product of the distribution coefficient and bulk density is greater than 2 or 3 order of magnitude the results of the aforementioned investigation clearly evidence that the kinetic sorption rate constant is an important parameter governing the multispecies plume transport however because of the difficulty in obtaining the sorption reaction rate constant current transport modeling practices are often based on the equilibrium sorption assumption thus more efforts are required to develop a method for more effective and accurately determining the kinetic sorption rate coefficient in the field 3 3 effect of inlet boundary condition several previous studies have discussed the mass balance constraints and potential errors in concentration prediction when improper inlet boundary conditions are used for the development of the single species transport analytical model van genuchten and parker 1974 leij et al 1991 chen et al 2011a b single species transport analytical models with a first type inlet condition give rise to physically improper mass conservation and significant errors in predicting the solute concentration distribution especially for a porous medium system with a large longitudinal dispersion coefficient if it is used to interpret the usual volume average concentration selection of the appropriate inlet boundary condition has been the subject of much investigation such as for the study of solute transport either in a uniform flow van genuchten and parker 1974 leij et al 1991 chen et al 2011a b or a radial flow field chen 1987 to the best of the author s knowledge the effect of the inlet boundary condition on multispecies transport has not been investigated yet here the impact of the inlet boundary conditions on multispecies transport are investigated using our derived multispecies transport analytical models subject to the first type and third type inlet boundary conditions the analytical solutions for the first type inlet boundary condition can be easily obtained following the same method chen et al 2011b has showed how to obtain the analytical solution for single species transport in a finite domain with a first type inlet boundary condition fig 3 depicts the spatial concentration profiles of the five species at t 1 year for both the first type and third type inlet boundary conditions using different dispersion coefficient values it is observed that the predicted concentration is higher for the first type inlet boundary condition than with the third type inlet boundary condition for all species moreover with an increasing dispersion coefficient the discrepancy between the concentration distributions for first type and third type inlet boundary conditions increases along with the discrepancy between the peak concentrations the results show that improper inlet boundary conditions leads to pronounced mass balance errors and the discrepancy increases as the dispersion coefficient increases to investigate the mass balance errors caused by the improper first type boundary conditions the mass flux error is defined as 27 mass flux error d c i x 0 t x v c i x 0 t v c i 0 with substitution of the solutions for each species derived for the first type boundary conditions into eq 27 the mass flux errors for each species caused by the use of improper first type boundary conditions can be calculated fig 4 depicts the calculated mass flux errors of 5 species as functions of time for different pe values with fixed β i 5 year 1 the mass flux errors for 5 species is pronounced for small pe values but it become smaller when large pe values is considered we also investigate how the mass flux errors is affected by the β i values when pe 5 as shown in fig 5 the mass flux errors increases with increasing β i values for pce tce and dce whereas the mass flux errors increases with decreasing β i values for vc and eth the calculated mass flux errors of 5 species for the solutions derived for the first type boundary conditions shows the importance of using proper boundary conditions in modeling the transport of degradable contaminants in groundwater 4 conclusions in this study a novel semi analytical model is developed for multispecies advective dispersive transport subject to rate limited sorption the developed model is then applied to assess the effects of the kinetic sorption rate constant on multispecies transport increasing the kinetic sorption rate constant leads to lower concentration predictions for all species of the degradable contaminants the equilibrium controlled sorption model could significantly underestimate the concentration of decaying or degradable contaminants under the condition of a low sorption damköler number d a i β i l v but will agrees well with the rate limited sorption model when the sorption damköler number is greater than 486 it should be noted that d a i 486 for validity condition of the equilibrium controlled sorption model is obtained on our descriptive simulation conditions and transport parameters uncertainty analysis on the value for the threshold of da should be conducted to support the general validity condition the invalidity of the equilibrium controlled sorption model under a low sorption damköler number suggests that the health risk might be underestimated when an equilibrium controlled sorption model is used for assessing the exposure concentration in the health risk assessment of the contaminated site moreover the solution strategy presented in this study can be extended to derive analytical models for multispecies transport in multi dimensional media subjected to rate limited sorption for which analytical solutions are not currently available declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

6042,geologic osmotic pressure has been proposed as a cause of excess fluid pressures in argillaceous formations in which dynamic geologic processes have little effect on pressure however the identification of geologic osmotic pressure has rarely been attempted thus its potential effect on groundwater systems is a longstanding question in hydrogeology herein we present a quantitative analysis of excess fluid pressures of unknown origin in the wakkanai formation assuming osmotically generated overpressure potential geologic osmotic pressures are estimated from profiles of pore water salinity and rock physical properties using a one dimensional model that describes geologic osmotic pressures in a state of dynamic equilibrium between chemical osmosis and advection the model results indicate that the wakkanai formation has the requisite conditions of both salinity gradient and semipermeability to generate geologic osmotic pressures comparable to observed excess pressures up to 230 kpa the applicability of the dynamic equilibrium model is also confirmed by using a steady state model with the same pore water salinity and rock physical properties data these results suggest that chemical osmosis is a potential cause for the excess fluid pressures observed in the wakkanai formation keywords chemical osmosis osmotic pressure semipermeability argillite excess fluid pressure 1 introduction chemical osmosis that arises from the semipermeability of argillite and salinity differences in groundwater generates geologic osmotic pressure within argillaceous formations which is observed as overpressure or underpressure relative to hydrostatic or hydrodynamically equilibrated fluid pressure greenberg et al 1973 neuzil 2000 wilson et al 2003 gonçalvès et al 2004 neuzil and provost 2009 chemical osmosis occurs from low to high salinity regions of an argillaceous formation inducing fluid pressure buildup in the high salinity region and drawdown in the low salinity region the pressure gradient that develops within the formation causes advection that counters the chemical osmotic flow and causes the osmotically induced pressure to dissipate however because of the low permeability of argillites the osmotically induced pressure is maintained in a quasi equilibrium state as the counteracting flows ultimately reach a state of dynamic equilibrium neuzil 2000 gonçalvès et al 2004 bader and kooi 2005 takeda et al 2014 since the salinity profile controlling osmotic flow is generally in a transient state and is mainly in the diffusion dominated regime of argillaceous formations e g mazurek et al 2011 the osmotically induced pressure i e the geologic osmotic pressure lasts over geologically long timescales neuzil 2000 gonçalvès et al 2004 geologic osmotic pressure is relatively small in comparison to excess fluid pressures caused by dynamic geologic processes such as tectonic loading or compaction disequilibrium e g osborne and swarbrick 1997 gonçalvès et al 2010 however ignoring or underestimating the role of geologic osmotic pressure may result in misinterpretation of groundwater flow directions and associated solute transport e g marine and fritz 1981 therefore when excess fluid pressures are encountered in hydrogeologic investigations the possibility of geologic osmotic pressure needs to be identified particularly in the case of nuclear waste isolation in argillaceous formations neuzil 2000 wilson et al 2003 neuzil and provost 2009 geologic osmotic pressure has been proposed as a cause of excess fluid pressures in argillaceous formations in which dynamic geologic processes are thought to be too minor to affect pressures e g young and low 1965 marine and fritz 1981 however the idea of geologic osmotic pressure has long been controversial because of the lack of data directly supporting its existence in situ since evidence for the semipermeability of argillites to produce geologic osmotic pressure was first obtained from in situ borehole experiments on the pierre shale performed by neuzil 2000 semipermeability has been investigated extensively in other argillites including the opalinus clay noy et al 2004 horseman et al 2007 boom clay garavito et al 2007 callovo oxfordian argillite gonçalvès et al 2004 gueutin et al 2007 cruchaudet et al 2008 rousseau gueutin et al 2008 2009 2010 and wakkanai mudstone takeda et al 2014 takeda and manaka 2018 manaka and takeda 2018 so far extensive studies of the callovo oxfordian formation have revealed that geologic osmotic pressure can explain 0 1 0 15 mpa of the 0 5 0 6 mpa overpressures observed in the formation gonçalvès et al 2004 rousseau gueutin et al 2009 a one dimensional steady state analysis performed by tremosa et al 2012 also suggests that the excess fluid pressures within the argillaceous formation at tournemire france may be partly due to geologic osmotic pressures neuzil and provost 2009 examined data in the existing literature on the semipermeability of argillites and suggested that all analyzed media exhibited at least a modest ability to generate osmotic pressure however geologic osmotic pressures quantitatively identified based on field and laboratory data are still limited thus the potential effects of geologic osmotic pressures on groundwater systems are still largely unknown here we report on a quantitative analysis of excess fluid pressures of unknown origin observed in the wakkanai formation in the horonobe region of japan as osmotically generated in the wakkanai formation excess fluid pressures up to 400 kpa and salinities up to half that of seawater have been observed at depth kurikami 2007 iwatsuki et al 2009 the excess fluid pressures at depth in this region can be explained by topography driven flow but needs the assumption of a caprock in hydrogeological modeling that has not been observed by borehole investigations nor by permeability experiments karasaki et al 2011 in addition although the horonobe region is located near the north american eurasian plate boundary the strain rate in this region is too low to increase fluid pressures as a result of relatively high permeability tokiwa and sugimoto 2012 neuzil 2015 furthermore a recent study on the semipermeability of the wakkanai mudstone suggests that the mudstone may act as a weak geologic membrane takeda and manaka 2018 in this study we use a one dimensional model that describes geologic osmotic pressures in a state of dynamic equilibrium between chemical osmosis and advection which was originally developed by neuzil 2000 for theoretically screening favorable conditions for generating geologic osmotic pressures in order to estimate geologic osmotic pressures from salinity distribution and rock physical properties both of which are obtained from field and laboratory investigations we use a first order approximation of the model the effectiveness of which was demonstrated by yu 2017 in analyses of geologic osmotic pressures in the opalinus clay of mont terri in northwestern switzerland we also compare our results to the geologic osmotic pressure estimated from experimentally determined semipermeabilities of the wakkanai mudstone the applicability of the dynamic equilibrium model is also tested against a steady state model using additional hypothetical data and boundary conditions finally we discuss the potential causes affecting fluid pressure distribution in the horonobe region to assess the relevance of geologic osmotic pressure to the overpressures observed in this region 2 estimation of geologic osmotic pressure in the wakkanai formation 2 1 geological setting and data suggesting geologic osmotic pressures the wakkanai formation is located in the horonobe area of hokkaido prefecture japan fig 1 a according to iwatsuki et al 2009 the wakkanai formation and overlying formations were originally formed in a marine environment during the neogene to quaternary periods then were compacted during subsidence prior to 1 ma the maximum burial depth of the top of the wakkanai formation is estimated to be 1000 m ishii et al 2011a the strata in this area have been uplifted due to folding and thrusting and the top layers have been denudated iwatsuki et al 2009 although many borehole investigations have been conducted in this area matsui et al 2007 detailed semipermeability measurements have been only performed on wakkanai mudstones retrieved from the sab 2 borehole fig 1a takeda and manaka 2018 accordingly the data obtained from the sab 2 borehole were used in the present study fig 1b shows the lithology of the sab 2 borehole the wakkanai formation mainly consists of siliceous mudstone and its shallow section 5 75 m depth is a transition zone between siliceous and diatomaceous mudstones fig 2 shows the data obtained from the sab 2 borehole amano et al 2012 suko et al 2014 fig 2a shows that the dominant ions in pore water are sodium and chloride their concentrations tend to increase with depth suggesting that the salinity gradient within the wakkanai formation may induce downward chemical osmosis to generate geologic osmotic pressures at depth fig 2b shows the temperature measured during drilling of the sab 2 borehole suko et al 2014 the temperature gap at 450 m depth is due to separate drilling stages for the shallow and deep sections which occurred in different seasons fig 2c shows that the observed fluid pressures are close to hydrostatic fluid pressures determined from the varying solute concentration and temperature however the observed fluid pressures tend to deviate from hydrostatic with increasing depth with a maximum deviation of 230 kpa at a depth of 660 m 2 2 analysis based on the state of dynamic equilibrium between chemical osmosis and advection the present analysis assumes a horizontally uniform argillaceous formation in which lateral hydrodynamic fluxes are negligibly small based on this assumption one dimensional vertical pore water flux through the argillaceous formation is described by a generalized darcy s law equation e g neuzil and provost 2009 tremosa et al 2012 1 q k μ z p ρ g z σ π z where q is the pore water flux m s k is the intrinsic permeability m2 μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s p is the fluid pressure pa ρ is the pore water density kg m3 g is gravitational acceleration m s2 z is the depth below the ground level m σ is the osmotic efficiency and π is the theoretical osmotic pressure pa σ is a dimensionless parameter that ranges between 0 and 1 by definition and represents semipermeability that is controlled by the pore size between clay minerals the electrochemical properties of clay minerals and the solute concentration of the pore water e g bresler 1973 the osmotic pressure π has the same dimension as pressure but is a measure of the decrease in the chemical potential of water neuzil and provost 2009 the first and second terms on the right side of eq 1 represent advection driven by pressure and gravity potentials and chemical osmosis driven by chemical potential respectively when a state of dynamic equilibrium is established between chemical osmosis and advection the net water flux through the argillaceous formation becomes almost zero and geologic osmotic pressure emerges as the excess fluid pressure relative to the hydrostatic or hydrodynamic fluid pressures this situation was originally considered by neuzil 2000 for theoretically screening favorable conditions for generating geologic osmotic pressures and it gives eq 1 the constraint of q 0 further introducing p phy pos where phy is the hydrostatic or hydrodynamic pressure pa and pos is the geologic osmotic pressure pa eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 0 k μ z p hy ρ g z p os z σ π z assuming that hydraulic flux which is represented by the first term on the right side of eq 2 is negligible owing to hydrostatic or hydrodynamic equilibrium eq 2 can be rewritten as e g neuzil and provost 2009 3 p os z σ π z although k and μ are eliminated eq 3 states that chemical osmosis represented by the right side of eq 3 is equal to the counteracting advection driven by the geologic osmotic pressure gradient when the system is at dynamic equilibrium upon integration eq 3 can be solved over the vertical domain when σ and π are given as smooth functions of z and or solute concentration neuzil 2000 neuzil and provost 2009 however the present analysis addresses field and laboratory data that were discretely obtained from a borehole fig 2 so pos is calculated using the discretized form of eq 3 4 δ p os z i σ i δ π z i where i is the index for the discretized formation element i 1 for the top element zi is the vertical coordinate of the center of the i th element δpos and δ π are the changes in the geologic and theoretical osmotic pressure respectively along the i th element and σ i is the osmotic efficiency of the i th element summing eq 4 from the top to the n th element the geologic osmotic pressure at the n th element can be estimated as 5 p os z n i 1 n δ p os z i the above approach for assigning osmotic efficiencies and osmotic pressure is essentially the same as the first order approximation of the generalized darcy s law adopted by yu 2017 2 3 osmotic efficiency calculation the osmotic efficiency σ in eq 4 is a measure of the anion exclusion effect that is exerted by the overlap of electrical double layers edls at pore spaces between negatively charged clay surfaces e g marine and fritz 1981 appelo and postma 2005 accordingly σ varies by location in argillaceous formations in accordance with the factors affecting the edls overlap such as pore size between clay minerals electrochemical properties of the clay minerals and solute concentrations of the pore water among a number of models developed for the anion exclusion effect e g kemper and rollins 1966 bresler 1973 marine and fritz 1981 fritz 1986 revil and leroy 2004 gonçalvès et al 2007 tremosa et al 2012 revil 2017 the kemper bresler model for monovalent solutes bresler 1973 was used in our analysis because the model has an advantage of describing osmotic efficiency as a single curve relating σ to b c where b is the nominal half distance between clay surfaces in å fig 3 in addition the kemper bresler model has previously been successfully applied to describe the osmotic efficiencies of undisturbed argillaceous formation media cey et al 2001 neuzil and provost 2009 oduor et al 2009 rousseau gueutin et al 2008 takeda et al 2014 although the groundwater recovered from the sab 2 borehole contains divalent cations which compress the edls more than monovalent cations e g bresler 1970 bresler 1973 tremosa et al 2012 the concentration of divalent cations in the groundwater is considerably lower and accounts for only 0 3 2 7 of the total cations and 1 3 on average fig 2a and amano et al 2012 these values are close to that of the multi component solution adopted in the experiments performed by cey et al 2001 in which the osmotic efficiencies were well characterized by the kemper bresler model for a nacl solution parameter b in the kemper bresler model has been related to rock physical properties by neuzil 2000 and is expressed as 6 b n ρ b a s where n is the porosity ρ b is the dry bulk density and as is the specific surface area in order to obtain the vertical profile of b in the sab 2 borehole we measured n and ρ b using mercury intrusion porosimetry and as using the brunauer emmett teller method brunauer et al 1938 on the cores retrieved from the borehole fig 4 shows the measured n ρ b and as values and the estimated b values the profile of b exhibits fluctuations at depths of 649 and 698 m however b values for the other depths are relatively constant and within a range of 29 31 å the profile of σ which is necessary for calculating eq 4 was evaluated using the kemper bresler model and the profiles of b and the solute concentrations the b values were also estimated from the experimental values of σ 0 021 and 0 081 which were measured in the cores retrieved from depths of 401 and 698 m respectively in the sab 2 borehole at a salinity difference of 0 6 0 1 m nacl takeda and manaka 2018 these experimental σ values are those measured at effective confining stresses for individual cores after applying their past maximum effective burial stresses this is because the wakkanai formation is currently overconsolidated as a result of the denudation of overlying strata for these experimental σ values the b values were adjusted to fit the kemper bresler model with the measured σ values fig 3 the estimated b values are 31 and 21 å for the cores retrieved from depths of 401 and 698 m respectively fig 4d these values are relatively close to those calculated from physical properties data however the measured σ values were obtained at a relatively large salinity difference of 0 6 0 1 m nacl so the representativeness of the estimated b values is ambiguous fig 3 also the number of experimentally derived b values were not sufficient to delineate a vertical profile for b accordingly these experimentally derived b values are used as a reference in the analysis using a linear function with respect to z for calculating the vertical profiles of osmotic efficiency fig 4d 2 4 theoretical osmotic pressure approximation the theoretical osmotic pressure π in eq 4 is the decrease in the chemical potential of water due to the presence of solutes thus it is affected by the concentration of each solute present in the groundwater although the groundwater of the wakkanai formation contains various solutes its dominant anionic and cationic species are chloride and sodium respectively fig 2a we therefore assumed that the groundwater in the wakkanai formation was a nacl solution fig 5 shows the equivalent nacl concentrations estimated from the total amounts of solutes dissolved in groundwater collected from the sab 2 borehole amano et al 2012 the equivalent nacl concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 0 16 m for solutions with concentrations lower than 1 m the theoretical osmotic pressure can be approximated according to the van t hoff relation fritz 1986 π νrtc where ν is the number of ionic species e g ν 2 for nacl r is the gas constant 8 314 m3 pa k mol and t is the absolute temperature k introducing this relationship eq 4 can be rewritten as 7 δ p z i σ i ν r t δ c z i where δc is the change in nacl concentration along the i th element the temperature within the wakkanai formation increases with depth fig 2b so we assumed that the temperature was a linear function of z median line in fig 2b 3 results fig 6 a shows the vertical distribution of the osmotic efficiency calculated from b and c fig 4d and 5 using the kemper bresler model fig 3 using eqs 5 and 7 and the vertical profiles of t c and σ figs 2b 5 and 6a the potential geologic osmotic pressures in the formation were estimated fig 6b shows the vertical profiles of the estimated geologic osmotic pressures and the fluid overpressures observed at the sab 2 borehole the observed fluid overpressures were determined by subtracting the hydrostatic fluid pressures from the observed fluid pressures fig 2c the estimated geologic osmotic pressure profiles replicate the downward increase in fluid overpressure observed in the sab 2 borehole however they fail to delineate the fluid overpressures observed at depths shallower than 370 m in contrast the potential geologic osmotic pressures estimated for depths below 490 m are relatively close to observed fluid overpressures in particular potential geologic osmotic pressures estimated from the linear approximation of experimental b values are almost equivalent to the observed fluid overpressures fig 6b despite the sparse semipermeability measurements fig 4d and the relatively high salinity conditions takeda and manaka 2018 on the other hand the analysis performed using the b values determined from the physical properties of retrieved cores slightly overestimates the fluid overpressures fig 6b 4 discussion this study assumed chemical osmosis as the process that deviates pore fluid pressures from a hydrostatic distribution and exemplified the potential of the wakkanai formation to generate geologic osmotic pressures comparable to the observed fluid overpressures of 230 kpa however our analyses do not replicate observed fluid overpressures particularly well at depths shallower than 370 m in the sab 2 borehole this suggests that other factors still need to be addressed in order to determine the relevance of geologic osmotic pressure in the fluid overpressures observed in this region 4 1 applicability of dynamic equilibrium model the dynamic equilibrium model adopted in this study enables the calculation of geologic osmotic pressure from limited salinity and basic rock physical properties data independently from permeability variations this is an advantage of the dynamic equilibrium model compared to the steady state and transient models both of which require additional data regarding transport parameters such as permeability and diffusivity and initial and boundary conditions at formation boundaries however eq 3 on which the dynamic equilibrium model is based implicitly assumes a no flux boundary condition in the direction that chemical osmosis occurs and consequently could lead to the overestimation of geologic osmotic pressures where a no flux boundary condition cannot be assumed at a formation boundary if this is the case the permeability variation also exerts an influence on the estimation of the geologic osmotic pressure profile e g tremosa et al 2012 in order to examine the applicability of dynamic equilibrium model we compared our results with those estimated from steady state analyses without a no flux boundary condition using the same data shown in figs 4 and 5 the analysis used the continuity equation at steady state tremosa et al 2012 8 z ρ k μ p ρ g z σ d π dz 0 the thickness of the wakkanai formation at the sab 2 borehole has not been investigated therefore the hydraulic boundary condition at the bottom of the formation cannot be explicitly defined thus the formation thickness was assumed as 1000 m referring to the nearby geologic profile ota et al 2011 and the fluid pressure at the bottom of the formation was assumed as a constant hydrostatic pressure at that depth which is the most conservative boundary condition for the emergence of geologic osmotic pressure field and laboratory data necessary for the analyses are also not available for depths below 700 m figs 4 and 5 so they were assumed to be the same as those at 700 m the vertical profile of k can be estimated from rock physical properties assuming poiseuille s law for a plane parallel pore geometry tremosa et al 2012 9 k b 2 3 n 2 3 fig 7 a shows the estimated profile for k the profile of k was also evaluated using the experimental values of k 1 41 10 19 and 4 29 10 20 m2 which were measured by the same experiments as the osmotic efficiencies at depths of 401 and 698 m in the sab 2 borehole takeda and manaka 2018 from these experimentally derived k values the profile of k was estimated assuming a linear relationship of logk z kurikami et al 2008 fig 7a shows that the estimated intrinsic permeability ranges from 1 3 10 20 to 7 0 10 19 m2 which corresponds approximately to the intrinsic permeabilities reported for the wakkanai mudstone by kurikami et al 2008 which range from 10 20 to10 18 m2 and tend to decrease with increasing depth fig 7b shows the profiles of geologic osmotic pressure estimated from the steady state analyses with a constant hydrostatic pressure at the bottom boundary the geologic osmotic pressures estimated from the steady state analyses are slightly smaller than those estimated from the dynamic equilibrium model this indicates that the magnitude of geologic osmotic pressure is dependent on osmosis driven downward advection which is controlled by permeability variations however the geologic osmotic pressures estimated from the steady state analyses are still large and agree well with the observed overpressures at depths below 490 m suggesting that the intrinsic permeabilities assumed for the wakkanai formation fig 7a are sufficiently small to maintain geologic osmotic pressures e g tremosa et al 2012 fig 7c shows the profiles of geologic osmotic pressure estimated from the steady state analyses with a no flux boundary at the bottom for reference as expected the estimated geologic osmotic pressures are almost the same as those from the dynamic equilibrium model this explicitly indicates that the analysis based on the dynamic equilibrium model is equivalent to the steady state analysis with the profile of k and a no flux bottom boundary and can be used to estimate the maximum potential geologic osmotic pressure for given salinity and rock physical property profiles this is the advantage of using the dynamic equilibrium model when adequate data for performing steady state or transient state modeling are not available especially during the early stages of hydrogeologic investigations 4 2 topography driven flow the present analyses are based on a one dimensional vertical model so they cannot reflect topography driven flow that governs the three dimensional groundwater flow regime in accordance with the three dimensional permeability structure the horonobe region contains hilly and sloping terrain that could store higher or lower elevation water tables than that of the sab 2 borehole fig 1 in addition the hydrogeologic environment in the horonobe region has been affected by tectonic deformation fig 1 and ishii et al 2011b so the connectivity of conductive fractures and major faults makes the permeability structure of this region complex on both local and regional scales kurikami et al 2008 ishii 2018 with these topography driven effects and a complex permeability structure the groundwater flow regime and thus the fluid pressure distribution in this region is very uncertain indeed it is difficult for topography driven flow to comprehensively explain the fluid overpressures observed in this region and therefore the calibration of permeability distributions e g suko et al 2014 or the assumption of a caprock karasaki et al 2011 have been used to reproduce the observed fluid pressures in groundwater flow modeling now that the potential for geologic osmotic pressure in the wakkanai formation is indicated incorporating its effect into conventional modeling may improve the misfit between observed and predicted fluid pressures in this region also the local fluid pressure disparity observed in our analyses may be improved by using simulations that also account for topography driven flow 4 3 errors in fluid pressure measurement except the natural process described above artificial errors in fluid pressure measurements can result in a disparity between observed and estimated values errors in borehole measurements can be introduced by insufficient recovery of fluid pressures after drilling and or by the short circuiting of fluid from a measurement interval to the open hole above or below the measurement interval e g quinn et al 2012 although the fluid pressure measurements in the sab 2 borehole were performed during the course of drilling the measurements were made after the fluid pressure in the packed off interval reached equilibrium suko et al 2014 therefore the possibility of insufficient pressure recovery can be ruled out however short circuiting of fluid through the surrounding formation to the open borehole can occur particularly at shallow depths in the sab 2 borehole where the observed overpressures are below our estimated pressures because the permeability of the shallow part of the wakkanai formation is relatively high kurikami et al 2008 takeda et al 2014 takeda manaka 2018 the pressure of the fluid isolated below the packer in the borehole might have equilibrated with hydrostatic fluid pressure in the open portion of the borehole above the packer consequently the excess pressures might have been measured at lower values than those present prior to drilling this effect should be ascertained by using a steady state analysis that describes the three dimensional configuration of fluid measurement and permeability distribution within the formation for further study 5 conclusions the quantitative analysis presented herein reveals that the fluid overpressures observed in the wakkanai formation which cannot be explained by gravity driven flow due to topographic effects karasaki et al 2011 or pressure driven flow due to dynamic geologic processes neuzil 2015 may be explained as geologic osmotic pressures however further research is needed to ascertain whether geologic osmotic pressures are the primary cause of the observed fluid overpressure in the wakkanai formation in this region the effects of topography driven lateral flow should be also addressed to improve further detailed studies also scrutinizing measured fluid pressures using numerical modeling and detailed semipermeability modeling that considers varying groundwater compositions and additional semipermeability measurements may improve the misfit between the calculated and observed values generally geologic osmotic pressure is relatively small in comparison to fluid overpressures caused by other geologic processes such as tectonic loading or compaction disequilibrium e g osborne and swarbrick 1997 gonçalvès et al 2010 however it could be a dominant process that affects groundwater flow and associated solute transport over geologically long timescales in stable argillaceous formations e g neuzil 2000 therefore the identification of geologic osmotic pressure is also crucial for investigating nuclear waste isolation in argillaceous formation sites neuzil 2000 wilson et al 2003 neuzil and provost 2009 the approach used in this study can only be applied to laterally uniform argillaceous formations however an approach using profiles of salinity and basic rock physical properties can be conducted without initial and boundary conditions or transport parameters such as semipermeability permeability and diffusivity which are necessary for the type of conventional simulation that fully describe transport processes within an argillaceous formation accordingly the approach used in this study may help identify potential geologic osmotic pressures in argillaceous formations especially during the early stages of hydrogeologic investigations when adequate data for simulating transport may not be available declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

6042,geologic osmotic pressure has been proposed as a cause of excess fluid pressures in argillaceous formations in which dynamic geologic processes have little effect on pressure however the identification of geologic osmotic pressure has rarely been attempted thus its potential effect on groundwater systems is a longstanding question in hydrogeology herein we present a quantitative analysis of excess fluid pressures of unknown origin in the wakkanai formation assuming osmotically generated overpressure potential geologic osmotic pressures are estimated from profiles of pore water salinity and rock physical properties using a one dimensional model that describes geologic osmotic pressures in a state of dynamic equilibrium between chemical osmosis and advection the model results indicate that the wakkanai formation has the requisite conditions of both salinity gradient and semipermeability to generate geologic osmotic pressures comparable to observed excess pressures up to 230 kpa the applicability of the dynamic equilibrium model is also confirmed by using a steady state model with the same pore water salinity and rock physical properties data these results suggest that chemical osmosis is a potential cause for the excess fluid pressures observed in the wakkanai formation keywords chemical osmosis osmotic pressure semipermeability argillite excess fluid pressure 1 introduction chemical osmosis that arises from the semipermeability of argillite and salinity differences in groundwater generates geologic osmotic pressure within argillaceous formations which is observed as overpressure or underpressure relative to hydrostatic or hydrodynamically equilibrated fluid pressure greenberg et al 1973 neuzil 2000 wilson et al 2003 gonçalvès et al 2004 neuzil and provost 2009 chemical osmosis occurs from low to high salinity regions of an argillaceous formation inducing fluid pressure buildup in the high salinity region and drawdown in the low salinity region the pressure gradient that develops within the formation causes advection that counters the chemical osmotic flow and causes the osmotically induced pressure to dissipate however because of the low permeability of argillites the osmotically induced pressure is maintained in a quasi equilibrium state as the counteracting flows ultimately reach a state of dynamic equilibrium neuzil 2000 gonçalvès et al 2004 bader and kooi 2005 takeda et al 2014 since the salinity profile controlling osmotic flow is generally in a transient state and is mainly in the diffusion dominated regime of argillaceous formations e g mazurek et al 2011 the osmotically induced pressure i e the geologic osmotic pressure lasts over geologically long timescales neuzil 2000 gonçalvès et al 2004 geologic osmotic pressure is relatively small in comparison to excess fluid pressures caused by dynamic geologic processes such as tectonic loading or compaction disequilibrium e g osborne and swarbrick 1997 gonçalvès et al 2010 however ignoring or underestimating the role of geologic osmotic pressure may result in misinterpretation of groundwater flow directions and associated solute transport e g marine and fritz 1981 therefore when excess fluid pressures are encountered in hydrogeologic investigations the possibility of geologic osmotic pressure needs to be identified particularly in the case of nuclear waste isolation in argillaceous formations neuzil 2000 wilson et al 2003 neuzil and provost 2009 geologic osmotic pressure has been proposed as a cause of excess fluid pressures in argillaceous formations in which dynamic geologic processes are thought to be too minor to affect pressures e g young and low 1965 marine and fritz 1981 however the idea of geologic osmotic pressure has long been controversial because of the lack of data directly supporting its existence in situ since evidence for the semipermeability of argillites to produce geologic osmotic pressure was first obtained from in situ borehole experiments on the pierre shale performed by neuzil 2000 semipermeability has been investigated extensively in other argillites including the opalinus clay noy et al 2004 horseman et al 2007 boom clay garavito et al 2007 callovo oxfordian argillite gonçalvès et al 2004 gueutin et al 2007 cruchaudet et al 2008 rousseau gueutin et al 2008 2009 2010 and wakkanai mudstone takeda et al 2014 takeda and manaka 2018 manaka and takeda 2018 so far extensive studies of the callovo oxfordian formation have revealed that geologic osmotic pressure can explain 0 1 0 15 mpa of the 0 5 0 6 mpa overpressures observed in the formation gonçalvès et al 2004 rousseau gueutin et al 2009 a one dimensional steady state analysis performed by tremosa et al 2012 also suggests that the excess fluid pressures within the argillaceous formation at tournemire france may be partly due to geologic osmotic pressures neuzil and provost 2009 examined data in the existing literature on the semipermeability of argillites and suggested that all analyzed media exhibited at least a modest ability to generate osmotic pressure however geologic osmotic pressures quantitatively identified based on field and laboratory data are still limited thus the potential effects of geologic osmotic pressures on groundwater systems are still largely unknown here we report on a quantitative analysis of excess fluid pressures of unknown origin observed in the wakkanai formation in the horonobe region of japan as osmotically generated in the wakkanai formation excess fluid pressures up to 400 kpa and salinities up to half that of seawater have been observed at depth kurikami 2007 iwatsuki et al 2009 the excess fluid pressures at depth in this region can be explained by topography driven flow but needs the assumption of a caprock in hydrogeological modeling that has not been observed by borehole investigations nor by permeability experiments karasaki et al 2011 in addition although the horonobe region is located near the north american eurasian plate boundary the strain rate in this region is too low to increase fluid pressures as a result of relatively high permeability tokiwa and sugimoto 2012 neuzil 2015 furthermore a recent study on the semipermeability of the wakkanai mudstone suggests that the mudstone may act as a weak geologic membrane takeda and manaka 2018 in this study we use a one dimensional model that describes geologic osmotic pressures in a state of dynamic equilibrium between chemical osmosis and advection which was originally developed by neuzil 2000 for theoretically screening favorable conditions for generating geologic osmotic pressures in order to estimate geologic osmotic pressures from salinity distribution and rock physical properties both of which are obtained from field and laboratory investigations we use a first order approximation of the model the effectiveness of which was demonstrated by yu 2017 in analyses of geologic osmotic pressures in the opalinus clay of mont terri in northwestern switzerland we also compare our results to the geologic osmotic pressure estimated from experimentally determined semipermeabilities of the wakkanai mudstone the applicability of the dynamic equilibrium model is also tested against a steady state model using additional hypothetical data and boundary conditions finally we discuss the potential causes affecting fluid pressure distribution in the horonobe region to assess the relevance of geologic osmotic pressure to the overpressures observed in this region 2 estimation of geologic osmotic pressure in the wakkanai formation 2 1 geological setting and data suggesting geologic osmotic pressures the wakkanai formation is located in the horonobe area of hokkaido prefecture japan fig 1 a according to iwatsuki et al 2009 the wakkanai formation and overlying formations were originally formed in a marine environment during the neogene to quaternary periods then were compacted during subsidence prior to 1 ma the maximum burial depth of the top of the wakkanai formation is estimated to be 1000 m ishii et al 2011a the strata in this area have been uplifted due to folding and thrusting and the top layers have been denudated iwatsuki et al 2009 although many borehole investigations have been conducted in this area matsui et al 2007 detailed semipermeability measurements have been only performed on wakkanai mudstones retrieved from the sab 2 borehole fig 1a takeda and manaka 2018 accordingly the data obtained from the sab 2 borehole were used in the present study fig 1b shows the lithology of the sab 2 borehole the wakkanai formation mainly consists of siliceous mudstone and its shallow section 5 75 m depth is a transition zone between siliceous and diatomaceous mudstones fig 2 shows the data obtained from the sab 2 borehole amano et al 2012 suko et al 2014 fig 2a shows that the dominant ions in pore water are sodium and chloride their concentrations tend to increase with depth suggesting that the salinity gradient within the wakkanai formation may induce downward chemical osmosis to generate geologic osmotic pressures at depth fig 2b shows the temperature measured during drilling of the sab 2 borehole suko et al 2014 the temperature gap at 450 m depth is due to separate drilling stages for the shallow and deep sections which occurred in different seasons fig 2c shows that the observed fluid pressures are close to hydrostatic fluid pressures determined from the varying solute concentration and temperature however the observed fluid pressures tend to deviate from hydrostatic with increasing depth with a maximum deviation of 230 kpa at a depth of 660 m 2 2 analysis based on the state of dynamic equilibrium between chemical osmosis and advection the present analysis assumes a horizontally uniform argillaceous formation in which lateral hydrodynamic fluxes are negligibly

on the right side of eq 1 represent advection driven by pressure and gravity potentials and chemical osmosis driven by chemical potential respectively when a state of dynamic equilibrium is established between chemical osmosis and advection the net water flux through the argillaceous formation becomes almost zero and geologic osmotic pressure emerges as the excess fluid pressure relative to the hydrostatic or hydrodynamic fluid pressures this situation was originally considered by neuzil 2000 for theoretically screening favorable conditions for generating geologic osmotic pressures and it gives eq 1 the constraint of q 0 further introducing p phy pos where phy is the hydrostatic or hydrodynamic pressure pa and pos is the geologic osmotic pressure pa eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 0

driven by the geologic osmotic pressure gradient when the system is at dynamic equilibrium upon integration eq 3 can be solved over the vertical domain when σ and π are given as smooth functions of z and or solute concentration neuzil 2000 neuzil and provost 2009 however the present analysis addresses field and laboratory data that were discretely obtained from a borehole fig 2 so pos is calculated using the discretized form of eq 3 4 δ p os z i σ i δ π z i where i is the index for the discretized formation element i 1 for the top element zi is the vertical coordinate of the center of

from the top to the n th element the geologic osmotic pressure at the n th element can be estimated as 5 p os z n i 1 n δ p os z i the above approach for assigning osmotic efficiencies and osmotic pressure is essentially the same as the first order approximation of the generalized darcy s law adopted by yu 2017 2 3 osmotic efficiency calculation the osmotic efficiency σ in eq 4 is a measure of the anion exclusion effect that is exerted by the overlap of electrical double layers edls at pore spaces between negatively charged clay surfaces e g marine and fritz 1981 appelo and postma 2005 accordingly σ varies by location in argillaceous formations in accordance with the factors affecting the edls overlap such as pore size between clay minerals electrochemical properties of the clay

osmotic efficiency as a single curve relating σ to b c where b is the nominal half distance between clay surfaces in å fig 3 in addition the kemper bresler model has previously been successfully applied to describe the osmotic efficiencies of undisturbed argillaceous formation media cey et al 2001 neuzil and provost 2009 oduor et al 2009 rousseau gueutin et al 2008 takeda et al 2014 although the groundwater recovered from the sab 2 borehole contains divalent cations which compress the edls more than monovalent cations e g bresler 1970 bresler 1973 tremosa et al 2012 the concentration of divalent cations in the groundwater is considerably lower and accounts for only 0 3 2 7 of the total cations and 1 3 on average fig 2a and amano et al 2012 these values are close to that of the multi component solution adopted in the experiments performed by cey et al 2001 in which the osmotic efficiencies were well characterized by the kemper bresler model for a nacl solution parameter b in the kemper bresler model has been related to rock physical properties by neuzil 2000 and is expressed as 6 b n ρ b a s where n is the porosity ρ b is the dry bulk density and as is the specific surface area in order to obtain the vertical profile of b in the sab 2 borehole we measured n and ρ b using mercury intrusion porosimetry and as using the brunauer emmett teller method brunauer et al 1938 on the cores retrieved from the borehole fig 4 shows the measured n ρ b and as values and the estimated b values the profile of b exhibits fluctuations at depths of 649 and 698 m however b values for the other depths are relatively constant and within a range of 29 31 å the profile of σ which is necessary for calculating eq 4 was evaluated using the kemper bresler model and the profiles of b and the solute concentrations the b values were also estimated from the experimental values of σ 0 021 and 0 081 which were measured in the cores retrieved from depths of 401 and 698 m respectively in the sab 2 borehole at a salinity difference of 0 6 0 1 m nacl takeda and manaka 2018 these experimental σ values are those measured at effective confining stresses for individual cores after applying their past maximum effective burial stresses this is because the wakkanai formation is currently overconsolidated as a result of the denudation of overlying strata for these experimental σ values the b values were adjusted to fit the kemper bresler model with the measured σ values fig 3 the estimated b values are 31 and 21 å for the cores retrieved from depths of 401 and 698 m respectively fig 4d these values are relatively close to those calculated from physical properties data however the measured σ values were obtained at a relatively large salinity difference of 0 6 0 1 m nacl so the representativeness of the estimated b values is ambiguous fig 3 also the number of experimentally derived b values were not sufficient to delineate a vertical profile for b accordingly these experimentally derived b values are used as a reference in the analysis using a linear function with respect to z for calculating the vertical profiles of osmotic efficiency fig 4d 2 4 theoretical osmotic pressure approximation the theoretical osmotic pressure π in eq 4 is the decrease in the chemical potential of water due to the presence of solutes thus it is affected by the concentration of each solute present in the groundwater although the groundwater of the wakkanai formation contains various solutes its dominant anionic and cationic species are chloride and sodium respectively fig 2a we therefore assumed that the groundwater in the wakkanai formation was a nacl solution fig 5 shows the equivalent nacl concentrations estimated from the total amounts of solutes dissolved in groundwater collected from the sab 2 borehole amano et al 2012 the equivalent nacl concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 0 16 m for solutions with concentrations lower than 1 m the theoretical osmotic pressure can be approximated according to the van t hoff relation fritz 1986 π νrtc where ν is the number of ionic species e g ν 2 for nacl r is the gas constant 8 314 m3 pa k mol and t is the absolute temperature k introducing this relationship eq 4 can be rewritten as 7 δ p z i σ i ν r t δ c z i where δc is the change in nacl concentration along the i th element the temperature within the wakkanai formation increases with depth fig 2b so we assumed that the temperature was a linear function of z median line in fig 2b 3 results fig 6 a shows the vertical distribution of the osmotic efficiency calculated from b and c fig 4d and 5 using the kemper bresler model fig 3 using eqs 5 and 7 and the vertical profiles of t c and σ figs 2b 5 and 6a the potential geologic osmotic pressures in the formation were estimated fig 6b shows the vertical profiles of the estimated geologic osmotic pressures and the fluid overpressures observed at the sab 2 borehole the observed fluid overpressures were determined by subtracting the hydrostatic fluid pressures from the observed fluid pressures fig 2c the estimated geologic osmotic pressure profiles replicate the downward increase in fluid overpressure observed in the sab 2 borehole however they fail to delineate the fluid overpressures observed at depths shallower than 370 m in contrast the potential geologic osmotic pressures estimated for depths below 490 m are relatively close to observed fluid overpressures in particular potential geologic osmotic pressures estimated from the linear approximation of experimental b values are almost equivalent to the observed fluid overpressures fig 6b despite the sparse semipermeability measurements fig 4d and the relatively high salinity conditions takeda and manaka 2018 on the other hand the analysis performed using the b values determined from the physical properties of retrieved cores slightly overestimates the fluid overpressures fig 6b 4 discussion this study assumed chemical osmosis as the process that deviates pore fluid pressures from a hydrostatic distribution and exemplified the potential of the wakkanai formation to generate geologic osmotic pressures comparable to the observed fluid overpressures of 230 kpa however our analyses do not replicate observed fluid overpressures particularly well at depths shallower than 370 m in the sab 2 borehole this suggests that other factors still need to be addressed in order to determine the relevance of geologic osmotic pressure in the fluid overpressures observed in this region 4 1 applicability of dynamic equilibrium model the dynamic equilibrium model adopted in this study enables the calculation of geologic osmotic pressure from limited salinity and basic rock physical properties data independently from permeability variations this is an advantage of the dynamic equilibrium model compared to the steady state and transient models both of which require additional data regarding transport parameters such as permeability and diffusivity and initial and boundary conditions at formation boundaries however eq 3 on which the dynamic equilibrium model is based implicitly assumes a no flux boundary condition in the direction that chemical osmosis occurs and consequently could lead to the overestimation of geologic osmotic pressures where a no flux boundary condition cannot be assumed at a formation boundary if this is the case the permeability variation also exerts an influence on the estimation of the geologic osmotic pressure profile e g tremosa et al 2012 in order to examine the applicability of dynamic equilibrium model we compared our results with those estimated from steady state analyses without a no flux boundary condition using the same data shown in figs 4 and 5 the analysis used the continuity equation at steady state tremosa et al 2012 8 z ρ k μ p ρ g z σ d π dz 0 the thickness of the wakkanai formation at the sab 2 borehole has not been investigated therefore the hydraulic boundary condition at the bottom of the formation cannot be explicitly defined thus the formation thickness was assumed as 1000 m referring to the nearby geologic profile ota et al 2011 and the fluid pressure at the bottom of the formation was assumed as a constant hydrostatic pressure at that depth which is the most conservative boundary condition for the emergence of geologic osmotic pressure field and laboratory data necessary for the analyses are also not available for depths below 700 m figs 4 and 5 so they were assumed to be the same as those at 700 m the vertical profile of k can be estimated from rock physical properties assuming poiseuille s law for a plane parallel pore geometry tremosa et al 2012 9 k b 2 3 n 2 3 fig 7 a shows the estimated profile for k the profile of k was also evaluated using the experimental values of k 1 41 10 19 and 4 29 10 20 m2 which were measured by the same experiments as the osmotic efficiencies at depths of 401 and 698 m in the sab 2 borehole takeda and manaka 2018 from these experimentally derived k values the profile of k was estimated assuming a linear relationship of logk z kurikami et al 2008 fig 7a shows that the estimated intrinsic permeability ranges from 1 3 10 20 to 7 0 10 19 m2 which corresponds approximately to the intrinsic permeabilities reported for the wakkanai mudstone by kurikami et al 2008 which range from 10 20 to10 18 m2 and tend to decrease with increasing depth fig 7b shows the profiles of geologic osmotic pressure estimated from the steady state analyses with a constant hydrostatic pressure at the bottom boundary the geologic osmotic pressures estimated from the steady state analyses are slightly smaller than those estimated from the dynamic equilibrium model this indicates that the magnitude of geologic osmotic pressure is dependent on osmosis driven downward advection which is controlled by permeability variations however the geologic osmotic pressures estimated from the steady state analyses are still large and agree well with the observed overpressures at depths below 490 m suggesting that the intrinsic permeabilities assumed for the wakkanai formation fig 7a are sufficiently small to maintain geologic osmotic pressures e g tremosa et al 2012 fig 7c shows the profiles of geologic osmotic pressure estimated from the steady state analyses with a no flux boundary at the bottom for reference as expected the estimated geologic osmotic pressures are almost the same as those from the dynamic equilibrium model this explicitly indicates that the analysis based on the dynamic equilibrium model is equivalent to the steady state analysis with the profile of k and a no flux bottom boundary and can be used to estimate the maximum potential geologic osmotic pressure for given salinity and rock physical property profiles this is the advantage of using the dynamic equilibrium model when adequate data for performing steady state or transient state modeling are not available especially during the early stages of hydrogeologic investigations 4 2 topography driven flow the present analyses are based on a one dimensional vertical model so they cannot reflect topography driven flow that governs the three dimensional groundwater flow regime in accordance with the three dimensional permeability structure the horonobe region contains hilly and sloping terrain that could store higher or lower elevation water tables than that of the sab 2 borehole fig 1 in addition the hydrogeologic environment in the horonobe region has been affected by tectonic deformation fig 1 and ishii et al 2011b so the connectivity of conductive fractures and major faults makes the permeability structure of this region complex on both local and regional scales kurikami et al 2008 ishii 2018 with these topography driven effects and a complex permeability structure the groundwater flow regime and thus the fluid pressure distribution in this region is very uncertain indeed it is difficult for topography driven flow to comprehensively explain the fluid overpressures observed in this region and therefore the calibration of permeability distributions e g suko et al 2014 or the assumption of a caprock karasaki et al 2011 have been used to reproduce the observed fluid pressures in groundwater flow modeling now that the potential for geologic osmotic pressure in the wakkanai formation is indicated incorporating its effect into conventional modeling may improve the misfit between observed and predicted fluid pressures in this region also the local fluid pressure disparity observed in our analyses may be improved by using simulations that also account for topography driven flow 4 3 errors in fluid pressure measurement except the natural process described above artificial errors in fluid pressure measurements can result in a disparity between observed and estimated values errors in borehole measurements can be introduced by insufficient recovery of fluid pressures after drilling and or by the short circuiting of fluid from a measurement interval to the open hole above or below the measurement interval e g quinn et al 2012 although the fluid pressure measurements in the sab 2 borehole were performed during the course of drilling the measurements were made after the fluid pressure in the packed off interval reached equilibrium suko et al 2014 therefore the possibility of insufficient pressure recovery can be ruled out however short circuiting of fluid through the surrounding formation to the open borehole can occur particularly at shallow depths in the sab 2 borehole where the observed overpressures are below our estimated pressures because the permeability of the shallow part of the wakkanai formation is relatively high kurikami et al 2008 takeda et al 2014 takeda manaka 2018 the pressure of the fluid isolated below the packer in the borehole might have equilibrated with hydrostatic fluid pressure in the open portion of the borehole above the packer consequently the excess pressures might have been measured at lower values than those present prior to drilling this effect should be ascertained by using a steady state analysis that describes the three dimensional configuration of fluid measurement and permeability distribution within the formation for further study 5 conclusions the quantitative analysis presented herein reveals that the fluid overpressures observed in the wakkanai formation which cannot be explained by gravity driven flow due to topographic effects karasaki et al 2011 or pressure driven flow due to dynamic geologic processes neuzil 2015 may be explained as geologic osmotic pressures however further research is needed to ascertain whether geologic osmotic pressures are the primary cause of the observed fluid overpressure in the wakkanai formation in this region the effects of topography driven lateral flow should be also addressed to improve further detailed studies also scrutinizing measured fluid pressures using numerical modeling and detailed semipermeability modeling that considers varying groundwater compositions and additional semipermeability measurements may improve the misfit between the calculated and observed values generally geologic osmotic pressure is relatively small in comparison to fluid overpressures caused by other geologic processes such as tectonic loading or compaction disequilibrium e g osborne and swarbrick 1997 gonçalvès et al 2010 however it could be a dominant process that affects groundwater flow and associated solute transport over geologically long timescales in stable argillaceous formations e g neuzil 2000 therefore the identification of geologic osmotic pressure is also crucial for investigating nuclear waste isolation in argillaceous formation sites neuzil 2000 wilson et al 2003 neuzil and provost 2009 the approach used in this study can only be applied to laterally uniform argillaceous formations however an approach using profiles of salinity and basic rock physical properties can be conducted without initial and boundary conditions or transport parameters such as semipermeability permeability and diffusivity which are necessary for the type of conventional simulation that fully describe transport processes within an argillaceous formation accordingly the approach used in this study may help identify potential geologic osmotic pressures in argillaceous formations especially during the early stages of hydrogeologic

6043,hydrochemical changes in three hot springs gd ltg and edq were studied by following three large near field earthquakes 2008 wenchuan ms 8 0 2013 lushan ms 7 0 and 2014 kangding ms 6 3 earthquakes in the xianshuihe fault zone western china each earthquake caused significant hydrochemical and isotopic changes in the three thermal springs hydrochemical ions such as ca2 and hco3 decreased sharply following the wenchuan earthquake and recovered after the lushan and kangding earthquakes although δd and δ18o data from before the wenchuan earthquake are lacking we find that δd and δ18o after the lushan and kangding earthquakes shifted toward the local meteoric water line lmwl both the hydrochemical and isotope data indicate changes in the mixture of different waters co2 degassing and geothermal reservoir temperatures combining this information with the noble gas analysis we interpret that new flow paths were created after the wenchuan earthquake and were reclogged following the lushan and kangding earthquakes more groundwater with low hco3 and ca2 from the granite aquifer entered the hydrothermal system and more co2 escaped from the water following the wenchuan earthquake while less water from the granite aquifer entered the system following the lushan and kangding earthquakes this study indicates that permeability can either increase or decrease in the near field following different earthquakes such changes should be considered significant factors in the management of groundwater supply and earthquake precursor monitoring in seismically active areas keywords thermal spring earthquake fault zone permeability hydrochemistry 1 introduction large earthquakes can alter the physical and chemical processes of subsurface water through changes in hydrogeological properties such as permeability which control key geological processes such as advective transport of heat and solutes manga and wang 2015 especially in fault zones the hydrogeological properties in fault zones are sensitive to stress strain changes caused by crustal deformation i e seismic activity shi and wang 2015 thus earthquake related changes occur more frequently in fault zones during pre and coseismic periods earthquake related hydrological changes include increased discharge in streams manga 2001 fluctuations in water levels in wells shi et al 2014 wang et al 2001 changes in temperature or chemical composition in springs claesson et al 2004 shi and wang 2014 skelton et al 2014 etc during the interseismic period these changes experience a recovery process and show a response to the next earthquake claesson et al 2007 elkhoury et al 2006 many studies have focused on purely hydrological changes brodsky et al 2003 jónsson et al 2003 mohr et al 2015 and most earthquake related studies of groundwater chemical composition changes have focused on searching for precursory changes there have been few cases that systematically studied the composition of groundwater changes in a fault zone following multiple earthquakes claesson et al 2007 wang and manga 2010 studies of such changes can provide useful constraints on models of earthquake induced groundwater flow in addition the coseismic hydrochemical changes and postseismic recovery may record the processes of earthquake induced fault fracturing and healing through the evolution of permeability along the fractures wästeby et al 2014 if the hydrochemical changes occur in geothermal areas the faster precipitation rates of minerals and water rock interactions in the fault zone may provide us with an opportunity to study earthquake induced fault fracturing and healing and water rock interactions during the earthquake cycle brodsky et al 2003 wästeby et al 2014 here we studied the hydrochemical changes of three thermal springs from 2005 to 2014 in the xianshuihe fault zone xfz western sichuan china during the study period three large near field earthquakes the 2008 wenchuan ms 8 0 2013 lushan ms 7 0 and 2014 kangding ms 6 3 earthquakes occurred in the xfz and the nearby longmenshan fault zone lfz all three earthquakes caused significant hydrochemical changes in the three thermal springs the hydrochemical data and three nearby earthquakes provide us with a unique opportunity to investigate and test the different mechanisms of earthquake related hydrochemical changes in the geothermal area 2 geological setting and seismicity the three thermal springs gd ltg and edq are located in the kangding district western sichuan china tectonically they are located southeast of the xianshuihe fault zone xfz fig 1 the xfz is one of the major left lateral strike slip faults that emanate from tibet it penetrates the whole lithosphere and incises the upper mantle shen et al 2007 as one of the world s most active faults at least 10 earthquakes with magnitudes larger than 7 have occurred along a 350 km segment of the xfz papadimitriou et al 2004 the thermal springs of the kangding district occur along the kangding moxi fault one of the major subfaults of the xianshuihe fault zone fig 1 they are mainly located in the erdaoqiao to yulingong area approximately 15 km apart according to previous studies the thermal springs occur along the fault intersection areas because the faults are permeable and allow easy thermal groundwater circulation curewitz and karson 1997 the kangding moxi fault serves as a favorable conduit for groundwater circulation the ltg and gd springs rise along the contact zone between granite and quartz sandstone while the edq spring rises in the contact zone between paleozoic limestone and mesozoic sandstone phyllite the kangding ms 6 3 earthquake 101 69 e 30 27 n occurred on november 22 2014 in kangding sichuan province three days later another ms 5 8 earthquake 101 73 e 30 18 n occurred 10 km southeast of the ms 6 3 earthquake fig 1 both earthquakes occurred on the nw striking xfz where no earthquakes larger than ms 6 have been reported since 1982 the kangding earthquake is also the third largest earthquake following the 2008 wenchuan earthquake and the 2013 lushan earthquake in the west sichuan area fig 1 both the wenchuan and lushan earthquakes were located in the lfz fig 1 near the xfz the lfz strikes ne to sw with a length of 500 km and a width of approximately 40 50 km the ms 8 0 wenchuan earthquake produced a single 340 km long rupture with thrust and right lateral components on a high angle fault dipping to the nw xu et al 2009 the lushan earthquake occurred 85 km southwest of the wenchuan earthquake with a focal mechanism dominated by a thrust component the rupture length was approximately 66 5 km along the strike of the lfz liu et al 2013 3 data and analysis as the hot springs mark one of the geothermally active areas in the xfz several studies have investigated their hydrochemical characteristics cao et al 2006 zhang et al 1991 reservoir temperatures yang et al 1999 and changes in hydrochemical parameters and gas geochemistry in response to the wenchuan earthquake chen et al 2015 based on previous studies we collected samples from the edq ltg and gd thermal springs during december 3 5 2014 fig 1 which was 12 days after the 2014 kangding earthquake the water samples for hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope oxygen 18 and deuterium analysis were collected and stored in 50 ml polyethylene bottles while the samples for major ions cl so4 2 no3 k na ca2 and mg2 were collected and stored in two 250 ml polyethylene bottles each sample collection was completed underwater water temperatures were measured in the field with a digital thermometer having an accuracy of 0 1 c the major ions were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex 900 stable isotopes of oxygen 18 and deuterium were analyzed with the liquid water isotope analyzer lgr with accuracies of 0 2 for δ18o and 0 3 for δd the co3 2 and hco3 concentrations were measured by a potentiometric titrator the ionic charge balance defined in terms of meq l is represented by cations anions cations anions and the ionic balance error of each sample was within 5 other hydrochemical monitoring data were collected from previous studies in this district in total seven sampling times were conducted in november 2005 june 2008 october 2008 june 2009 april 2010 april 2013 and december 2014 taking these data together we can observe the hydrochemical evolution following the three earthquakes we analyzed the water samples of the three thermal springs edq ltg and gd and the results are listed in table 1 the chemical types of the thermal springs are ca na hco3 na hco3 cl and na hco3 cl the ltg and gd springs have the same water chemical type which indicates they may derive from the same source the isotope compositions of h and o are displayed on the δd δ18o diagram in fig 2 with δ18o ranging from 17 4 to 15 3 and δd values of 129 2 to 112 8 all the samples plot near the lmwl indicating a meteoric origin however these samples have different ranges of δd and δ18o values edq shows the heaviest isotope values while ltg and gd have similar δd and δ18o values thus we can infer from the isotope data that ltg and gd may have had the same recharge area after the 2014 kangding earthquake while edq had a different recharge area moreover cl can transport conservatively in groundwater which is relatively similar to hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes while so4 2 could be affected by water rock interaction redox and mixing in many geothermal systems nicholson 1993 hence different processes during the ascending flow may lead to complicated variation in so4 2 4 earthquake induced hydrochemical variation and recovery the fault zone plays an important role in controlling regional groundwater flow and deep hydrothermal fluid circulation because it can form either an effective barrier to flow or hydraulic conduits connecting shallow and deep geological environments bense et al 2013 the xfz is a hydraulic conduit fault because there are large numbers of deep circulation thermal springs located along the fault zone most of the thermal springs are located on the joint planes or turning points of the subfaults of the xfz the subfaults are tenso shear faults that have relatively large permeabilities and are sensitive to weak stress strain changes luo 1994 thus the geochemical characteristics of thermal springs at these locations easily show implications to earthquakes few studies have been carried out to determine the earthquake induced geochemical changes and mechanisms in these thermal springs such a study however is important in detecting earthquake precursors and understanding water rock interactions in fault zones one of the important processes in thermal spring geochemical studies is continuous monitoring which is always difficult and costly the most common method for monitoring hydrochemical variation is by sampling frequently and analyzing the samples in the laboratory biagi et al 2000 chen et al 2015 skelton et al 2014 except for the thermal water samples we collected from december 3 to december 5 2014 which was 12 days after the kangding earthquake the other hydrochemical monitoring data are from previous studies in this district cao et al 2006 chen et al 2015 table 2 the volume percentages of co2 in these spring gases are from zhou et al 2015 and were obtained in the field by measuring the gas samples with a cg irms analytical system gas chromatography agilent 6890 stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer consequently the sampling times are different between ions and the volume percentages of co2 these data collected in different periods allow us to explore the hydrochemical variations during the earthquake cycles 4 1 evolution of water chemical type based on the data for major ions k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 in the three springs from 2005 to 2014 a piper diagram and time series changes of the three thermal springs are plotted in fig 3 as shown in the piper diagram the water chemistry types in edq and gd changed during the study period the water chemistry type in edq changed from ca na hco3 to na mg hco3 after the wenchuan earthquake and from na mg hco3 back to ca na hco3 after the 2014 kangding earthquake the water chemistry type in gd changed from na hco3 cl to na cl hco3 after the wenchuan earthquake and from na cl hco3 back to na hco3 cl after the 2013 lushan earthquake no significant changes were found in ltg during the study period fig 3 4 2 evolution of major ions we plot the time series of major ions k na ca2 cl so4 2 hco3 2 and ph for these three springs in order to observe the changes in each ion fig 4 ions in the three springs edq ltg and gd exhibited significant changes after the wenchuan earthquake and these ions showed relatively stable changes before the lushan earthquake these changes also occurred after the lushan earthquake but more significant changes occurred after the kangding earthquake we found that the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in all three springs decreased greatly after the wenchuan earthquake but recovered after the 2014 kangding earthquake for k the concentrations in the three springs showed large decreases after the wenchuan earthquake and recovered slightly after the kangding earthquake na and so4 2 showed changes similar to those in ca2 and hco3 that is they showed a decrease increase after the wenchuan earthquake and an increase decrease after the kangding earthquake the cl concentration in edq showed a continuous decrease since the wenchuan earthquake the gd spring increased after the wenchuan earthquake and then recovered slowly since then the cl concentration showed little fluctuation 5 during the study period in the ltg spring an interesting phenomenon is that k ca2 and hco3 showed cyclic variations during the wenchuan and kangding earthquakes ion concentrations decreased significantly after the wenchuan earthquake but recovered after the kangding earthquake while ph showed the opposite changes additionally the concentrations of co2 in the three thermal spring gases increased significantly after the wenchuan earthquake zhou et al 2015 although there is a lack of pre earthquake data it can still be inferred that the amount of co2 degassing had a coseismic increase thus the mechanisms causing chemical changes during the wenchuan and kangding earthquakes should have had opposite effects on the hydrochemical changes 4 3 evolution of d and 18o isotopes although there are no d and 18o isotope data available before the wenchuan earthquake it is still insightful to discuss the isotope evolution after the wenchuan earthquake as shown in fig 2 the δd and δ18o values in the three thermal springs deviated from the lmwl after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake but shifted toward the lmwl during the following years the edq spring showed a process similar to the oxygen 18 shift and the δd value showed little fluctuation but δ18o was more negative in the years after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake for the gd and ltg springs both δd and δ18o shifted to lighter values and approached the lmwl after the wenchuan earthquake which is similar to evaporation because of the lack of isotope data after the 2013 lushan earthquake we cannot judge the effect caused by this earthquake combining the changes that occurred in chemical components however we can deduce that the isotopes should have had less fluctuation after the lushan earthquake than after the kangding earthquake the 2014 kangding earthquake had large effects on δd and δ18o in edq and gd springs according to previous studies the isotopes and chemical components of groundwater change slowly without any external disturbance reddy et al 2011 toutain et al 1997 wästeby et al 2014 thus the large changes in δd and δ18o in the three springs from the 2008 wenchuan earthquake to the 2014 kangding earthquake may also imply a recovery process moreover edq is relatively rich in heavy isotopes according to the elevation effect of isotope distribution the elevation of edq is low approximately 400 m lower than ltg and gd in addition thermal springs are strongly affected by the mixing of shallow cold water the ratio of which can reach 70 guo et al 2017 therefore the local meteoric water isotope composition determines the composition in spring water to some extent the difference between thermal springs is very close to the local δd elevation gradient approximately 4 3 100 m 5 mechanisms of chemical and isotope changes as described above we have shown that both chemical and isotope data experienced large changes after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake and recovered after the 2014 kangding earthquake two processes may have controlled these changes 1 earthquake induced hydrochemical changes and 2 water rock interactions during the earthquake cycle many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the co and postseismic hydrochemical changes during the coseismic periods earthquake induced coseismic static strain causes the mixture of deep and shallow waters woith et al 2013 accelerated water rock interactions result from increased reactive surface area after rupturing of the rock surface thomas 1988 rupturing of the hydrological barrier between two chemically distinct aquifers may occur claesson et al 2007 and groundwaters may mix by switching between fracture pathways caused by earthquake induced permeability changes skelton et al 2014 during the interseismic period the mechanisms of chemical evolution include fracture healing permeability recovery folch and mas pla 2008 xue et al 2013 sealing and gouge compaction of both the fault system and the host rock nelson et al 2009 and re establishing water rock chemical equilibrium satake et al 2003 we next discuss the mechanisms of chemical changes during the coseismic period and the interseismic period we begin with the mechanism of coseismic static strain first the coseismic static strain caused by the three earthquakes the 2008 wenchuan 2013 lushan and 2014 kangding earthquakes is calculated by the program coulomb 3 3 which is based on okada s elastic half space theory lin and stein 2004 okada 1992 the parameters for the wenchuan and lushan earthquakes used in the calculation are the same as those used in shi et al 2014 for the 2014 kangding earthquake we assume the fault plane solution of fang et al 2015 which consists of a single rupture plane striking 142 dipping 83 and raking 8 the epicenter was located at 30 3 n and 101 7 e with a hypocentral depth of 18 km fang et al 2015 the static strains at the three springs caused by the kangding earthquake inferred from coulomb 3 3 are shown in fig 5 and we list all the static strains caused by the wenchuan lushan and kangding earthquakes in table 3 the occurrence of earthquakes leads to the appearance of four quadrants of negative and positive strain calculated through the coseismic strain model muir wood and king 1993 diagonal quadrants possess similar strain characteristics negative coseismic strain represents compaction zones and positive strain represents expansion zones all springs are located in the coseismic compaction zone following the wenchuan earthquake but in the expansion zone following the lushan earthquake for the kangding earthquake the edq spring is located in the expansion zone and the other two springs are located in the coseismic strain compaction zone if coseismic static strain is the dominant mechanism causing the chemical and isotope changes in the three springs then the gd and ltg springs should have similar coseismic changes following the wenchuan and kangding earthquakes and opposite changes after the lushan earthquake which is not the case in our data the coseismic hydrochemical responses following the wenchuan earthquake are opposite to the changes after the lushan and kangding earthquakes fig 4 thus static strain caused by the three earthquakes cannot explain these chemical changes the second mechanism is accelerated water rock interaction which results from increased reactive surface area caused by rupturing of the rock surface the accelerated water rock interaction model would predict an increase in the concentration of dissolved ions as extensive water rock interactions allow the rapid dissolution of minerals into groundwater this process has been confirmed in the laboratory brantley 2003 and through field observations claesson et al 2007 for the changes in the three springs we find that most ion concentrations decreased following the 2008 wenchuan earthquake but increased following the 2013 lushan and 2014 kangding earthquakes thus it seems that the changes after the wenchuan earthquake cannot be explained by the accelerated water rock interaction model although the accelerated water interaction model can explain the coseismic chemical increases following the lushan and kangding earthquakes this model fails to explain the shift to more negative isotopic values after the kangding earthquake this failure is because the water rock interaction is expected to shift δ18o toward less negative values claesson et al 2007 furthermore only small fluctuations in hydrochemical concentrations occurred during the five years after the wenchuan earthquake indicating that the water rock interaction mechanism cannot apply to our observations the third mechanism is changes in co2 degassing and the mixing ratio of chemically distinct waters through changes in permeability woith et al 2013 it has been revealed that mixing and degassing are the most common geochemical processes in geothermal systems which strongly affect the dissolution and precipitation balance between minerals with geothermal water and the chemical composition of groundwater pang and reed 1998 palandri and reed 2001 among them co2 degassing influences the dissolution and precipitation of carbonate minerals as well as silicate minerals in the study area co2 is the predominant geothermal gas hence degassing as a factor controlling water rock interactions should not be overlooked guo et al 2017 there has been many studies on the effects of magma degassing on hydrochemistry villemant et al 2005 chen et al 2018 decompression cooling oxidation processes interactions with wall rocks or hydrothermal systems and mixing with air lead to large variations in the concentration and speciation of most volatile components symonds and reed 1993 the relatively conservative volatile components are mainly derived from magma degassing such as cl and so4 2 but their contents do not seem to show significantly synchronous changes although co2 is also mainly derived from magma it cannot be transported conservatively in groundwater therefore it can be inferred that the occurrence of the earthquakes may not have caused changes in the activity of deep magma in the kangding district where the thermal generates from geothermal gradient an 2017 the mixing and decompression induced by earthquakes could result in changes in the degassing and dissolution of co2 only in thermal water undergoing deep circulation namely geothermal reservoirs the lag and memory of degassing are not obvious in the study as well as the hydrochemical variations in the springs shift back and forth during the three earthquakes the mechanism that causes the changes following the wenchuan earthquake should be opposite to the mechanism that follows the lushan and kangding earthquakes the conceptual model can be described as follows fig 6 1 before the wenchuan earthquake the groundwater in these hot springs is mainly receiving recharge from meteoric water through the kangding moxing fault zone and from the granite the groundwater from the kangding moxing fault zone has relatively high concentrations of hco3 and ca2 due to flowing through limestone strata while the water from granite fractures has low hco3 content fig 1 an 2017 since the springs receive much more water from the kangding moxi fault zone they show relatively high contents of hco3 fig 6a 2 after the wenchuan earthquake new fractures were created in the deep granite layer which led to more water with low hco3 entering these hot springs simultaneously more co2 escaped from water due to the pressure and temperature decreases resulting from the formation of new fractures which reversed the reactions of eqs 1 and 2 consequently the contents of hco3 ca2 and k decreased and the ph of the three thermal springs changed from acidic or neutral to alkaline the ph is controlled by carbonate balance which is a relatively complex and susceptible system there is very little co3 2 in the samples which has no effect on this system so the processes shown by eqs 3 5 can be considered the degassing of co2 inhibits co2 dissolution and the dissociation of h2co3 in the system eqs 3 and 4 with decreasing h h2o electrolysis is promoted eq 5 causing an increase in ph pang and reed 1998 in addition water rock interactions may be inhibited in the system which could lead to the drift of the d and 18o isotopes toward the lmwl fig 6b in addition the saturation index si of selected minerals in the three thermal springs reveals that the sis of carbonate minerals increased after the wenchuan earthquake because of the reversed reaction fig 7 3 the fractures created during the wenchuan earthquake healed slowly under geochemical processes manga et al 2012 thus leading to a decrease in the water from granite however the small fluctuations in these chemical components in springs indicate that the healing process is slow 4 after the lushan earthquake some fractures created during the wenchuan earthquake may have been reclogged by the seismic wave which caused a decrease in water from the granite layer then hco3 and ca2 increased fig 6c 5 after the kangding earthquake more fractures were reclogged and the groundwater recharge recovered to the status before the wenchuan earthquake fig 6d thus hco3 and ca2 also recovered to the levels before the wenchuan earthquake with the trend of recovery in k ph and mineral sis under this conceptual model the changes in chemical components are induced by the mixing of two chemically distinct waters and by co2 degassing because of these processes the rates of water rock interactions also change as the water rock equilibrium is disrupted which may lead to fluctuations in hydrochemical ion concentrations and isotope values this process may be the reason for the irregular variations in some hydrochemical and isotope changes for the three springs such as so4 2 cl and isotope variations during the interseismic period calcite dissolution 1 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o 2 hco 3 ca 2 feldspar dissolution 2 2kalsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 3 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2k 2hco 3 4sio 2 3 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 4 h 2 co 3 hco 3 h 5 h 2 o h oh inverse geochemical modeling can determine the main water rock interactions in the hydrogeochemical evolution processes based on variations in hydrochemical composition gastmans et al 2010 similarly time series of springs hydrochemistry can be regarded as simulation path in phreeqc which can be used to quantitatively modeling the reactions that might occur during the hydrochemical evolution according to lithology and mineral constituents of aquifers we selected halite gypsum dolomite calcite kaolinite k feldspar quartz and co2 as possible minerals phases the results of the mass balance simulation are listed in table 4 it can be inferred that more co2 escaped from system approximately increasing by 10 180 mmol l than that before the wenchuan earthquake and transfer amounts of other minerals changed significantly after the wenchuan earthquake especially calcite k feldspar and quartz the balance of dissolution and precipitation of minerals was relatively stable during the wenchuan earthquake and the lushan earthquake while co2 degassing amount decreased and transfer amounts of other minerals recovered after the lushan earthquake which is consistent with the results discussed above the co2 degassing amount after the kangding earthquake decreased by 3 18 mmol l than that before the lushan earthquake furthermore cyclic changes in the vent temperatures and noble gas data of 3he 4he in these springs also indicate that much more deep fluid was added to these springs after the wenchuan earthquake zhou et al 2015 due to the deep new fissures but less deep fluid entered after the lushan and kangding earthquakes figs 4 and 8 thus we consider that new fractures were created during the wenchuan earthquake which caused the permeability to increase deeply more water to migrate from the granite layer and co2 degassing to increase but the fractures were reclogged and permeability decreased following the lushan and kangding earthquakes laboratory experiments have showed that shaking induced particle transport can either lead to blocking of the flow path liu and manga 2009 or clearing of the flow path by removing particles elkhoury et al 2011 additionally similar phenomena have been observed in the field in which earthquakes may lead to clear flow paths that enhance the permeability elkhoury et al 2006 shi and wang 2014 xue et al 2013 or blocked flow paths that reduce the permeability manga et al 2012 shi et al 2015 the calculated seismic energy density ranges from 3 52 to 3 99 j m 3 following the wenchuan earthquake and from 1 59 to 3 67 j m 3 following the kangding earthquake which is enough to cause permeability changes in the field wang and manga 2010 thus it is reasonable to speculate that fractures were created following the wenchuan earthquake but reclogged following the lushan and kangding earthquakes moreover cation geothermometry is applied to estimate the reservoir temperature of the study area fig 9 it can be inferred that the reservoir temperature before the wenchuan earthquake was high 340 and that temperature decreased to a relatively stable level after the earthquake 220 260 luo et al 2017 guo et al 2017 according to the third mechanism the variations in reservoir temperature may also be the result of permeability changes after the wenchuan earthquake there was more cold shallow water entering the reservoir and participating in deep circulation because of new fractures while with the clogging of fractures that prevented the entry of cold water the temperature increased slightly following the other two earthquakes based on the discussion about reservoir temperature it is not difficult to explain the phenomenon that the isotope evolution after the wenchuan earthquake approximates the evaporation line the increase in deep temperature accelerated evaporation leading to deviation of isotopes from the lmwl then the deep temperatures decreased finally evaporation weakened resulting in the changes in isotopes that is drift to the lmwl accordingly the isotope recoveries were significantly faster than those of the major ions the changes during the other two earthquakes were small but may have had identical processes which was similar to reservoir temperature in conclusion it can be inferred that continuous long term monitoring of groundwater is required to obtain a large amount of hydrochemical information through methods such as machine learning anomalies in time series can be identified and future trends can be predicted which could provide clues for earthquake prediction multiple hydrochemical methods are used to explain the possible mechanisms in addition continuous data can provide aid for quantifying specific processes which can yield more accurate results of course it is necessary to fully understand the groundwater background of the study area beforehand this study will be a significant reference for relevant research in this region and similar regions 6 conclusion we studied the hydrochemical changes in three thermal springs from 2005 to 2014 in the xianshuihe fault zone xfz western sichuan china during the study period three large earthquakes 2008 wenchuan ms 8 0 2013 lushan ms 7 0 and 2014 kangding ms 6 3 earthquakes occurred in the xfz fault zone and the nearby longmenshan fault zone lfz all of which caused significant hydrochemical changes in the three thermal springs several ions such as hco3 ca2 and k decreased sharply following the wenchuan earthquake and remained at low levels until the lushan and kangding earthquakes occurred the concentrations of these ions returned to the pre wenchuan earthquake levels after the kangding earthquake the back and forth changes also occurred in the chemistry types in gd and edq springs although isotope changes lack data before the wenchuan earthquake we can deduce that similar changes occurred in the isotopes that is the δd and δ18o values in the three thermal springs deviated from the lmwl after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake but shifted toward the lmwl during the following years which could be the result of deep reservoir temperature variations these changes indicate that a permeability increase occurred after the wenchuan earthquake but a permeability decrease occurred after the kangding earthquake thereby inducing changes in co2 degassing and mixing newly created and reclogged fractures may be the mechanism that caused permeability changes which in turn led to hydrochemical changes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

6043,hydrochemical changes in three hot springs gd ltg and edq were studied by following three large near field earthquakes 2008 wenchuan ms 8 0 2013 lushan ms 7 0 and 2014 kangding ms 6 3 earthquakes in the xianshuihe fault zone western china each earthquake caused significant hydrochemical and isotopic changes in the three thermal springs hydrochemical ions such as ca2 and hco3 decreased sharply following the wenchuan earthquake and recovered after the lushan and kangding earthquakes although δd and δ18o data from before the wenchuan earthquake are lacking we find that δd and δ18o after the lushan and kangding earthquakes shifted toward the local meteoric water line lmwl both the hydrochemical and isotope data indicate changes in the mixture of different waters co2 degassing and geothermal reservoir temperatures combining this information with the noble gas analysis we interpret that new flow paths were created after the wenchuan earthquake and were reclogged following the lushan and kangding earthquakes more groundwater with low hco3 and ca2 from the granite aquifer entered the hydrothermal system and more co2 escaped from the water following the wenchuan earthquake while less water from the granite aquifer entered the system following the lushan and kangding earthquakes this study indicates that permeability can either increase or decrease in the near field following different earthquakes such changes should be considered significant factors in the management of groundwater supply and earthquake precursor monitoring in seismically active areas keywords thermal spring earthquake fault zone permeability hydrochemistry 1 introduction large earthquakes can alter the physical and chemical processes of subsurface water through changes in hydrogeological properties such as permeability which control key geological processes such as advective transport of heat and solutes manga and wang 2015 especially in fault zones the hydrogeological properties in fault zones are sensitive to stress strain changes caused by crustal deformation i e seismic activity shi and wang 2015 thus earthquake related changes occur more frequently in fault zones during pre and coseismic periods earthquake related hydrological changes include increased discharge in streams manga 2001 fluctuations in water levels in wells shi et al 2014 wang et al 2001 changes in temperature or chemical composition in springs claesson et al 2004 shi and wang 2014 skelton et al 2014 etc during the interseismic period these changes experience a recovery process and show a response to the next earthquake claesson et al 2007 elkhoury et al 2006 many studies have focused on purely hydrological changes brodsky et al 2003 jónsson et al 2003 mohr et al 2015 and most earthquake related studies of groundwater chemical composition changes have focused on searching for precursory changes there have been few cases that systematically studied the composition of groundwater changes in a fault zone following multiple earthquakes claesson et al 2007 wang and manga 2010 studies of such changes can provide useful constraints on models of earthquake induced groundwater flow in addition the coseismic hydrochemical changes and postseismic recovery may record the processes of earthquake induced fault fracturing and healing through the evolution of permeability along the fractures wästeby et al 2014 if the hydrochemical changes occur in geothermal areas the faster precipitation rates of minerals and water rock interactions in the fault zone may provide us with an opportunity to study earthquake induced fault fracturing and healing and water rock interactions during the earthquake cycle brodsky et al 2003 wästeby et al 2014 here we studied the hydrochemical changes of three thermal springs from 2005 to 2014 in the xianshuihe fault zone xfz western sichuan china during the study period three large near field earthquakes the 2008 wenchuan ms 8 0 2013 lushan ms 7 0 and 2014 kangding ms 6 3 earthquakes occurred in the xfz and the nearby longmenshan fault zone lfz all three earthquakes caused significant hydrochemical changes in the three thermal springs the hydrochemical data and three nearby earthquakes provide us with a unique opportunity to investigate and test the different mechanisms of earthquake related hydrochemical changes in the geothermal area 2 geological setting and seismicity the three thermal springs gd ltg and edq are located in the kangding district western sichuan china tectonically they are located southeast of the xianshuihe fault zone xfz fig 1 the xfz is one of the major left lateral strike slip faults that emanate from tibet it penetrates the whole lithosphere and incises the upper mantle shen et al 2007 as one of the world s most active faults at least 10 earthquakes with magnitudes larger than 7 have occurred along a 350 km segment of the xfz papadimitriou et al 2004 the thermal springs of the kangding district occur along the kangding moxi fault one of the major subfaults of the xianshuihe fault zone fig 1 they are mainly located in the erdaoqiao to yulingong area approximately 15 km apart according to previous studies the thermal springs occur along the fault intersection areas because the faults are permeable and allow easy thermal groundwater circulation curewitz and karson 1997 the kangding moxi fault serves as a favorable conduit for groundwater circulation the ltg and gd springs rise along the contact zone between granite and quartz sandstone while the edq spring rises in the contact zone between paleozoic limestone and mesozoic sandstone phyllite the kangding ms 6 3 earthquake 101 69 e 30 27 n occurred on november 22 2014 in kangding sichuan province three days later another ms 5 8 earthquake 101 73 e 30 18 n occurred 10 km southeast of the ms 6 3 earthquake fig 1 both earthquakes occurred on the nw striking xfz where no earthquakes larger than ms 6 have been reported since 1982 the kangding earthquake is also the third largest earthquake following the 2008 wenchuan earthquake and the 2013 lushan earthquake in the west sichuan area fig 1 both the wenchuan and lushan earthquakes were located in the lfz fig 1 near the xfz the lfz strikes ne to sw with a length of 500 km and a width of approximately 40 50 km the ms 8 0 wenchuan earthquake produced a single 340 km long rupture with thrust and right lateral components on a high angle fault dipping to the nw xu et al 2009 the lushan earthquake occurred 85 km southwest of the wenchuan earthquake with a focal mechanism dominated by a thrust component the rupture length was approximately 66 5 km along the strike of the lfz liu et al 2013 3 data and analysis as the hot springs mark one of the geothermally active areas in the xfz several studies have investigated their hydrochemical characteristics cao et al 2006 zhang et al 1991 reservoir temperatures yang et al 1999 and changes in hydrochemical parameters and gas geochemistry in response to the wenchuan earthquake chen et al 2015 based on previous studies we collected samples from the edq ltg and gd thermal springs during december 3 5 2014 fig 1 which was 12 days after the 2014 kangding earthquake the water samples for hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope oxygen 18 and deuterium analysis were collected and stored in 50 ml polyethylene bottles while the samples for major ions cl so4 2 no3 k na ca2 and mg2 were collected and stored in two 250 ml polyethylene bottles each sample collection was completed underwater water temperatures were measured in the field with a digital thermometer having an accuracy of 0 1 c the major ions were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex 900 stable isotopes of oxygen 18 and deuterium were analyzed with the liquid water isotope analyzer lgr with accuracies of 0 2 for δ18o and 0 3 for δd the co3 2 and hco3 concentrations were measured by a potentiometric titrator the ionic charge balance defined in terms of meq l is represented by cations anions cations anions and the ionic balance error of each sample was within 5 other hydrochemical monitoring data were collected from previous studies in this district in total seven sampling times were conducted in november 2005 june 2008 october 2008 june 2009 april 2010 april 2013 and december 2014 taking these data together we can observe the hydrochemical evolution following the three earthquakes we analyzed the water samples of the three thermal springs edq ltg and gd and the results are listed in table 1 the chemical types of the thermal springs are ca na hco3 na hco3 cl and na hco3 cl the ltg and gd springs have the same water chemical type which indicates they may derive from the same source the isotope compositions of h and o are displayed on the δd δ18o diagram in fig 2 with δ18o ranging from 17 4 to 15 3 and δd values of 129 2 to 112 8 all the samples plot near the lmwl indicating a meteoric origin however these samples have different ranges of δd and δ18o values edq shows the heaviest isotope values while ltg and gd have similar δd and δ18o values thus we can infer from the isotope data that ltg and gd may have had the same recharge area after the 2014 kangding earthquake while edq had a different recharge area moreover cl can transport conservatively in groundwater which is relatively similar to hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes while so4 2 could be affected by water rock interaction redox and mixing in many geothermal systems nicholson 1993 hence different processes during the ascending flow may lead to complicated variation in so4 2 4 earthquake induced hydrochemical variation and recovery the fault zone plays an important role in controlling regional groundwater flow and deep hydrothermal fluid circulation because it can form either an effective barrier to flow or hydraulic conduits connecting shallow and deep geological environments bense et al 2013 the xfz is a hydraulic conduit fault because there are large numbers of deep circulation thermal springs located along the fault zone most of the thermal springs are located on the joint planes or turning points of the subfaults of the xfz the subfaults are tenso shear faults that have relatively large permeabilities and are sensitive to weak stress strain changes luo 1994 thus the geochemical characteristics of thermal springs at these locations easily show implications to earthquakes few studies have been carried out to determine the earthquake induced geochemical changes and mechanisms in these thermal springs such a study however is important in detecting earthquake precursors and understanding water rock interactions in fault zones one of the important processes in thermal spring geochemical studies is continuous monitoring which is always difficult and costly the most common method for monitoring hydrochemical variation is by sampling frequently and analyzing the samples in the laboratory biagi et al 2000 chen et al 2015 skelton et al 2014 except for the thermal water samples we collected from december 3 to december 5 2014 which was 12 days after the kangding earthquake the other hydrochemical monitoring data are from previous studies in this district cao et al 2006 chen et al 2015 table 2 the volume percentages of co2 in these spring gases are from zhou et al 2015 and were obtained in the field by measuring the gas samples with a cg irms analytical system gas chromatography agilent 6890 stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer consequently the sampling times are different between ions and the volume percentages of co2 these data collected in different periods allow us to explore the hydrochemical variations during the earthquake cycles 4 1 evolution of water chemical type based on the data for major ions k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 in the three springs from 2005 to 2014 a piper diagram and time series changes of the three thermal springs are plotted in fig 3 as shown in the piper diagram the water chemistry types in edq and gd changed during the study period the water chemistry type in edq changed from ca na hco3 to na mg hco3 after the wenchuan earthquake and from na mg hco3 back to ca na hco3 after the 2014 kangding earthquake the water chemistry type in gd changed from na hco3 cl to na cl hco3 after the wenchuan earthquake and from na cl hco3 back to na hco3 cl after the 2013 lushan earthquake no significant changes were found in ltg during the study period fig 3 4 2 evolution of major ions we plot the time series of major ions k na ca2 cl so4 2 hco3 2 and ph for these three springs in order to observe the changes in each ion fig 4 ions in the three springs edq ltg and gd exhibited significant changes after the wenchuan earthquake and these ions showed relatively stable changes before the lushan earthquake these changes also occurred after the lushan earthquake but more significant changes occurred after the kangding earthquake we found that the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in all three springs decreased greatly after the wenchuan earthquake but recovered after the 2014 kangding earthquake for k the concentrations in the three springs showed large decreases after the wenchuan earthquake and recovered slightly after the kangding earthquake na and so4 2 showed changes similar to those in ca2 and hco3 that is they showed a decrease increase after the wenchuan earthquake and an increase decrease after the kangding earthquake the cl concentration in edq showed a continuous decrease since the wenchuan earthquake the gd spring increased after the wenchuan earthquake and then recovered slowly since then the cl concentration showed little fluctuation 5 during the study period in the ltg spring an interesting phenomenon is that k ca2 and hco3 showed cyclic variations during the wenchuan and kangding earthquakes ion concentrations decreased significantly after the wenchuan earthquake but recovered after the kangding earthquake while ph showed the opposite changes additionally the concentrations of co2 in the three thermal spring gases increased significantly after the wenchuan earthquake zhou et al 2015 although there is a lack of pre earthquake data it can still be inferred that the amount of co2 degassing had a coseismic increase thus the mechanisms causing chemical changes during the wenchuan and kangding earthquakes should have had opposite effects on the hydrochemical changes 4 3 evolution of d and 18o isotopes although there are no d and 18o isotope data available before the wenchuan earthquake it is still insightful to discuss the isotope evolution after the wenchuan earthquake as shown in fig 2 the δd and δ18o values in the three thermal springs deviated from the lmwl after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake but shifted toward the lmwl during the following years the edq spring showed a process similar to the oxygen 18 shift and the δd value showed little fluctuation but δ18o was more negative in the years after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake for the gd and ltg springs both δd and δ18o shifted to lighter values and approached the lmwl after the wenchuan earthquake which is similar to evaporation because of the lack of isotope data after the 2013 lushan earthquake we cannot judge the effect caused by this earthquake combining the changes that occurred in chemical components however we can deduce that the isotopes should have had less fluctuation after the lushan earthquake than after the kangding earthquake the 2014 kangding earthquake had large effects on δd and δ18o in edq and gd springs according to previous studies the isotopes and chemical components of groundwater change slowly without any external disturbance reddy et al 2011 toutain et al 1997 wästeby et al 2014 thus the large changes in δd and δ18o in the three springs from the 2008 wenchuan earthquake to the 2014 kangding earthquake may also imply a recovery process moreover edq is relatively rich in heavy isotopes according to the elevation effect of isotope distribution the elevation of edq is low approximately 400 m lower than ltg and gd in addition thermal springs are strongly affected by the mixing of shallow cold water the ratio of which can reach 70 guo et al 2017 therefore the local meteoric water isotope composition determines the composition in spring water to some extent the difference between thermal springs is very close to the local δd elevation gradient approximately 4 3 100 m 5 mechanisms of chemical and isotope changes as described above we have shown that both chemical and isotope data experienced large changes after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake and recovered after the 2014 kangding earthquake two processes may have controlled these changes 1 earthquake induced hydrochemical changes and 2 water rock interactions during the earthquake cycle many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the co and postseismic hydrochemical changes during the coseismic periods earthquake induced coseismic static strain causes the mixture of deep and shallow waters woith et al 2013 accelerated water rock interactions result from increased reactive surface area after rupturing of the rock surface thomas 1988 rupturing of the hydrological barrier between two chemically distinct aquifers may occur claesson et al 2007 and groundwaters may mix by switching between fracture pathways caused by earthquake induced permeability changes skelton et al 2014 during the interseismic period the mechanisms of chemical evolution include fracture healing permeability recovery folch and mas pla 2008 xue et al 2013 sealing and gouge compaction of both the fault system and the host rock nelson et al 2009 and re establishing water rock chemical equilibrium satake et al 2003 we next discuss the mechanisms of chemical changes during the coseismic period and the interseismic period we begin with the mechanism of coseismic static strain first the coseismic static strain caused by the three earthquakes the 2008 wenchuan 2013 lushan and 2014 kangding earthquakes is calculated by the program coulomb 3 3 which is based on okada s elastic half space theory lin and stein 2004 okada 1992 the parameters for the wenchuan and lushan earthquakes used in the calculation are the same as those used in shi et al 2014 for the 2014 kangding earthquake we assume the fault plane solution of fang et al 2015 which consists of a single rupture plane striking 142 dipping 83 and raking 8 the epicenter was located at 30 3 n and 101 7 e with a hypocentral depth of 18 km fang et al 2015 the static strains at the three springs caused by the kangding earthquake inferred from coulomb 3 3 are shown in fig 5 and we list all the static strains caused by the wenchuan lushan and kangding earthquakes in table 3 the occurrence of earthquakes leads to the appearance of four quadrants of negative and positive strain calculated through the coseismic strain model muir wood and king 1993 diagonal quadrants possess similar strain characteristics negative coseismic strain represents compaction zones and positive strain represents expansion zones all springs are located in the coseismic compaction zone following the wenchuan earthquake but in the expansion zone following the lushan earthquake for the kangding earthquake the edq spring is located in the expansion zone and the other two springs are located in the coseismic strain compaction zone if coseismic static strain is the dominant mechanism causing the chemical and isotope changes in the three springs then the gd and ltg springs should have similar coseismic changes following the wenchuan and kangding earthquakes and opposite changes after the lushan earthquake which is not the case in our data the coseismic hydrochemical responses following the wenchuan earthquake are opposite to the changes after the lushan and kangding earthquakes fig 4 thus static strain caused by the three earthquakes cannot explain these chemical changes the second mechanism is accelerated water rock interaction which results from increased reactive surface area caused by rupturing of the rock surface the accelerated water rock interaction model would predict an increase in the concentration of dissolved ions as extensive water rock interactions allow the rapid dissolution of minerals into groundwater this process has been confirmed in the laboratory brantley 2003 and through field observations claesson et al 2007 for the changes in the three springs we find that most ion concentrations decreased following the 2008 wenchuan earthquake but increased following the 2013 lushan and 2014 kangding earthquakes thus it seems that the changes after the wenchuan earthquake cannot be explained by the accelerated water rock interaction model although the accelerated water interaction model can explain the coseismic chemical increases following the lushan and kangding earthquakes this model fails to explain the shift to more negative isotopic values after the kangding earthquake this failure is because the water rock interaction is expected to shift δ18o toward less negative values claesson et al 2007 furthermore only small fluctuations in hydrochemical concentrations occurred during the five years after the wenchuan earthquake indicating that the water rock interaction mechanism cannot apply to our observations the third mechanism is changes in co2 degassing and the mixing ratio of chemically distinct waters through changes in permeability woith et al 2013 it has been revealed that mixing and degassing are the most common geochemical processes in geothermal systems which strongly affect the dissolution and precipitation balance between minerals with geothermal water and the chemical composition of groundwater pang and reed 1998 palandri and reed 2001 among them co2 degassing influences the dissolution and precipitation of carbonate minerals as well as silicate minerals in the study area co2 is the predominant geothermal gas hence degassing as a factor controlling water rock interactions should not be overlooked guo et al 2017 there has been many studies on the effects of magma degassing on hydrochemistry villemant et al 2005 chen et al 2018 decompression cooling oxidation processes interactions with wall rocks or hydrothermal systems and mixing with air lead to large variations in the concentration and speciation of most volatile components symonds and reed 1993 the relatively conservative volatile components are mainly derived from magma degassing such as cl and so4 2 but their contents do not seem to show significantly synchronous changes although co2 is also mainly derived from magma it cannot be transported conservatively in groundwater therefore it can be inferred that the occurrence of the earthquakes may not have caused changes in the activity of deep magma in the kangding district where the thermal generates from geothermal gradient an 2017 the mixing and decompression induced by earthquakes could result in changes in the degassing and dissolution of co2 only in thermal water undergoing deep circulation namely geothermal reservoirs the lag and memory of degassing are not obvious in the study as well as the hydrochemical variations in the springs shift back and forth during the three earthquakes the mechanism that causes the changes following the wenchuan earthquake should be opposite to the mechanism that follows the lushan and kangding earthquakes the conceptual model can be described as follows fig 6 1 before the wenchuan earthquake the groundwater in these hot springs is mainly receiving recharge from meteoric water through the kangding moxing fault zone and from the granite the groundwater from the kangding moxing fault zone has relatively high concentrations of hco3 and ca2 due to flowing through limestone strata while the water from granite fractures has low hco3 content fig 1 an 2017 since the springs receive much more water from the kangding moxi fault zone they show relatively high contents of hco3 fig 6a 2 after the wenchuan earthquake new fractures were created in the deep granite layer which led to more water with low hco3 entering these hot springs simultaneously more co2 escaped from water due to the pressure and temperature decreases resulting from the formation of new fractures which reversed the reactions of eqs 1 and 2 consequently the contents of hco3 ca2 and k decreased and the ph of the three thermal springs changed from acidic or neutral to alkaline the ph is controlled by carbonate balance which is a relatively complex and susceptible system there is very little co3 2 in the samples which has no effect on this system so the processes shown by eqs 3 5 can be considered the degassing of co2 inhibits co2 dissolution and the dissociation of h2co3 in the system eqs 3 and 4 with decreasing h h2o electrolysis is promoted eq 5 causing an increase in ph pang and reed 1998 in addition water rock interactions may be inhibited in the system which could lead to the drift of the d and 18o isotopes toward the lmwl fig 6b in addition the saturation index si of selected minerals in the three thermal springs reveals that the sis of carbonate minerals increased after the wenchuan earthquake because of the reversed reaction fig 7 3 the fractures created during the wenchuan earthquake healed slowly under geochemical processes manga et al 2012 thus leading to a decrease in the water from granite however the small fluctuations in these chemical components in springs indicate that the healing process is slow 4 after the lushan earthquake some fractures created during the wenchuan earthquake may have been reclogged by the seismic wave which caused a decrease in water from the granite layer then hco3 and ca2 increased fig 6c 5 after the kangding earthquake more fractures were reclogged and the groundwater recharge recovered to the status before the wenchuan earthquake fig 6d thus hco3 and ca2 also recovered to the levels before the wenchuan earthquake with the trend of recovery in k ph and mineral sis under this conceptual model the changes in chemical components are induced by the mixing of two chemically distinct waters and by co2 degassing because of these processes the rates of water rock interactions also change as the water rock equilibrium is disrupted which may lead to fluctuations in hydrochemical ion concentrations and isotope values this process may be the reason for the irregular variations in some hydrochemical and isotope changes for the three springs such as so4 2 cl and isotope variations during the interseismic period calcite dissolution 1 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o 2 hco 3 ca 2 feldspar dissolution 2 2kalsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 3 h 2 o al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 2k 2hco 3 4sio 2 3 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 4 h 2 co 3 hco 3 h 5 h 2 o h oh inverse geochemical modeling can determine the main water rock interactions in the hydrogeochemical evolution processes based on variations in hydrochemical composition gastmans et al 2010 similarly time series of springs hydrochemistry can be regarded as simulation path in phreeqc which can be used to quantitatively modeling the reactions that might occur during the hydrochemical evolution according to lithology and mineral constituents of aquifers we selected halite gypsum dolomite calcite kaolinite k feldspar quartz and co2 as possible minerals phases the results of the mass balance simulation are listed in table 4 it can be inferred that more co2 escaped from system approximately increasing by 10 180 mmol l than that before the wenchuan earthquake and transfer amounts of other minerals changed significantly after the wenchuan earthquake especially calcite k feldspar and quartz the balance of dissolution and precipitation of minerals was relatively stable during the wenchuan earthquake and the lushan earthquake while co2 degassing amount decreased and transfer amounts of other minerals recovered after the lushan earthquake which is consistent with the results discussed above the co2 degassing amount after the kangding earthquake decreased by 3 18 mmol l than that before the lushan earthquake furthermore cyclic changes in the vent temperatures and noble gas data of 3he 4he in these springs also indicate that much more deep fluid was added to these springs after the wenchuan earthquake zhou et al 2015 due to the deep new fissures but less deep fluid entered after the lushan and kangding earthquakes figs 4 and 8 thus we consider that new fractures were created during the wenchuan earthquake which caused the permeability to increase deeply more water to migrate from the granite layer and co2 degassing to increase but the fractures were reclogged and permeability decreased following the lushan and kangding earthquakes laboratory experiments have showed that shaking induced particle transport can either lead to blocking of the flow path liu and manga 2009 or clearing of the flow path by removing particles elkhoury et al 2011 additionally similar phenomena have been observed in the field in which earthquakes may lead to clear flow paths that enhance the permeability elkhoury et al 2006 shi and wang 2014 xue et al 2013 or blocked flow paths that reduce the permeability manga et al 2012 shi et al 2015 the calculated seismic energy density ranges from 3 52 to 3 99 j m 3 following the wenchuan earthquake and from 1 59 to 3 67 j m 3 following the kangding earthquake which is enough to cause permeability changes in the field wang and manga 2010 thus it is reasonable to speculate that fractures were created following the wenchuan earthquake but reclogged following the lushan and kangding earthquakes moreover cation geothermometry is applied to estimate the reservoir temperature of the study area fig 9 it can be inferred that the reservoir temperature before the wenchuan earthquake was high 340 and that temperature decreased to a relatively stable level after the earthquake 220 260 luo et al 2017 guo et al 2017 according to the third mechanism the variations in reservoir temperature may also be the result of permeability changes after the wenchuan earthquake there was more cold shallow water entering the reservoir and participating in deep circulation because of new fractures while with the clogging of fractures that prevented the entry of cold water the temperature increased slightly following the other two earthquakes based on the discussion about reservoir temperature it is not difficult to explain the phenomenon that the isotope evolution after the wenchuan earthquake approximates the evaporation line the increase in deep temperature accelerated evaporation leading to deviation of isotopes from the lmwl then the deep temperatures decreased finally evaporation weakened resulting in the changes in isotopes that is drift to the lmwl accordingly the isotope recoveries were significantly faster than those of the major ions the changes during the other two earthquakes were small but may have had identical processes which was similar to reservoir temperature in conclusion it can be inferred that continuous long term monitoring of groundwater is required to obtain a large amount of hydrochemical information through methods such as machine learning anomalies in time series can be identified and future trends can be predicted which could provide clues for earthquake prediction multiple hydrochemical methods are used to explain the possible mechanisms in addition continuous data can provide aid for quantifying specific processes which can yield more accurate results of course it is necessary to fully understand the groundwater background of the study area beforehand this study will be a significant reference for relevant research in this region and similar regions 6 conclusion we studied the hydrochemical changes in three thermal springs from 2005 to 2014 in the xianshuihe fault zone xfz western sichuan china during the study period three large earthquakes 2008 wenchuan ms 8 0 2013 lushan ms 7 0 and 2014 kangding ms 6 3 earthquakes occurred in the xfz fault zone and the nearby longmenshan fault zone lfz all of which caused significant hydrochemical changes in the three thermal springs several ions such as hco3 ca2 and k decreased sharply following the wenchuan earthquake and remained at low levels until the lushan and kangding earthquakes occurred the concentrations of these ions returned to the pre wenchuan earthquake levels after the kangding earthquake the back and forth changes also occurred in the chemistry types in gd and edq springs although isotope changes lack data before the wenchuan earthquake we can deduce that similar changes occurred in the isotopes that is the δd and δ18o values in the three thermal springs deviated from the lmwl after the 2008 wenchuan earthquake but shifted toward the lmwl during the following years which could be the result of deep reservoir temperature variations these changes indicate that a permeability increase occurred after the wenchuan earthquake but a permeability decrease occurred after the kangding earthquake thereby inducing changes in co2 degassing and mixing newly created and reclogged fractures may be the mechanism that caused permeability changes which in turn led to hydrochemical changes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

6044,much attention is being paid to the design and implementation of community based monitoring initiatives of water and environment and how to attract more citizens to participate in such initiatives although mass participation in collecting and sharing water related or environmental data and good project design and implementation are key factors for the success of community based monitoring these initiatives do not operate in a void community based monitoring initiatives are embedded in and can influence existing social institutional political and technological settings in spite of the fact that these contextual factors are not static and constantly change over time capturing their status quo at the initiation of a community based monitoring activity delivers critical insights for establishing a sustainable initiative and can be used as a benchmark for assessing its subsequent outcomes and impacts yet the salience of understanding the initial contextual settings is often underestimated or these are only considered once an initiative has already been established the objective of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of early stage research about such contextual realities in order to do so we employed the cpi framework gharesifard et al 2019 for conducting a systematic analysis of the baseline situation of two newly established community based monitoring initiatives one in the netherlands and one in kenya the case study in the netherlands focuses on the issue of pluvial flooding in an urban setting while the kenyan case study deals with balancing sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity management in a rural area our baseline analysis showed that aside from the fact that these initiatives have different thematic foci there are distinct differences between the two in terms of access to technology availability and accessibility of data the institutional arrangements for public participation in decision making processes and the level of citizen trust in the authorities in charge of managing the respective water related and environmental issues based on the findings of this research a number of recommendations are provided that can be beneficial for the future development and functioning of the two initiatives keywords citizen science community based monitoring context analysis participation technology power dynamics 1 introduction complexity uncertainty and multi dimensionality are among the inherent characteristics of environmental problems polasky et al 2011 reed 2008 and despite great scientific and technological advancements solving these challenges has proven to require more than just conventional science centered ideology irwin 1995 over the past two decades the promotion of non structural measures along with widespread replacement of water and environmental management concepts with governance ideology wehn et al 2015 has highlighted the role of citizens and envisioned their participation as one of the most important stakeholders in the management of natural resources this has resulted in paying special attention to citizen science projects and community based monitoring hereafter cbm initiatives of water and environmental resources as innovative approaches that can help address the complex water and environmental challenges of the 21st century cbm initiatives on the one hand have the potential to help enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of shared environmental data inform environmental decision making and subsequently help reform water related and environmental policies and on the other hand they can facilitate the communication between different stakeholders and the co creation of knowledge much emphasis is being placed on the design and implementation of cbm and how to attract more citizens to participate in such initiatives although mass participation in collecting and sharing water and environmental data and good project design and implementation are key factors for the success of a cbm initiative these initiatives do not operate in a void during the initiation of a cbm initiative there are already existing institutions policies and technological settings in which the initiative will be embedded with which it will interact or which it aims to influence as an example lessons learned from the wesenseit project an eu fp7 project for developing cbm initiatives of water and flooding confirm that such circumstantial factors influenced the participation dynamics and the shape and size of the cbm initiatives in this project joshi wehn 2017 wehn et al 2015 although contextual factors 1 1 the two terms contextual factors and circumstantial factors have been used as synonyms in this paper and both refer to the circumstances that influence the establishment and functioning of a cbm initiative are not static and constantly change over time capturing their status quo at the initiation of a cbm delivers critical insights for establishing a sustainable initiative and for assessing its evolving outcomes and impacts nevertheless the importance of such a baseline analysis is often underestimated or only considered after initiation of a cbm activity this has resulted in initiatives that discontinue after a short while whose results have no actual use in policy and decision making or they even have contributed to creating new forms of exclusion and inequalities within society we argue that for a cbm to have impact on policy and decision making processes it is essential to first gain a thorough understanding of the contextual setting in which it will be embedded and operate since these aspects can strongly affect the design implementation outcomes and impacts of the initiative the aim of this paper is thus to demonstrate the importance of an early analysis of such contextual realities although the role of contextual factors in shaping the design and implementation of citizen science and cbm initiatives have been highlighted in the literature e g dehnen schmutz et al 2016 irwin 1995 phillips et al 2019 wehn et al 2015 until recently there was no framework that enables a systematic analysis of the contextual factors that affect the establishment and functioning of these initiatives gharesifard et al 2019 proposed a conceptual framework for systematic analysis of five generic dimensions across all cbm initiatives this framework called the cpi framework 2 2 conceptual framework for examining the contextual setting process evaluation and impact of a cbm initiative is designed for context analysis processes evaluation and impact assessment of cbm initiatives the cpi framework takes into account the multidimensional characteristics of cbms and recognizes the difference between the aspects that are intrinsic to a cbm initiative and the contextual realities in which it is being or will be embedded and with which it interacts adopting the cpi framework enables a systematic evaluation of the contextual aspects related to participation power dynamics and technological settings in this paper we use this framework to showcase an in depth qualitative empirical research into the contextual realities of two cbm initiatives in the netherlands and kenya both of these initiatives are part of ground truth 2 0 an eu funded project that is setting up and validating six cbm initiatives in europe and africa 3 3 https gt20 eu ground truth 2 0 has a people centered approach towards establishing and scaling up cbm initiatives and aimed to set up sustainable cbm initiatives by involving three main categories of stakeholders citizens data aggregators scientists and decision makers the cbm case study in the netherlands focuses on the issue of pluvial floods in land van heusden en altena while the kenyan cbm aims to help balancing sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity management in the maasai mara ecosystem this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the theoretical background of the research and introduces the selected dimensions and aspects of the cpi framework for this research the method used for applying the framework for capturing the baseline situation in the two aforementioned cbm initiatives is then discussed in section 3 the two case studies of this research are introduced in section 4 section 5 is dedicated to demonstrating the application of the framework by depicting the baseline situation for the two cbm initiatives finally general as well as case specific discussions recommendations and conclusions are presented in sections 6 and 7 2 theoretical background the cpi framework consists of five generic dimensions across all cbm initiatives namely goals objectives technology participation power dynamics and results of the cbm initiative gharesifard et al 2019 the aspects discussed in the two dimensions of goals objectives and results of the cbm initiative relate to the internal characteristics of the cbm initiative while the technology participation and power dynamics dimensions cover a wide range of contextual factors about the issue in focus of the cbm e g the institutional and political context the cbm initiative itself e g its establishment mechanism or both e g communication paradigm about the issue and within the cbm initiative to be able to capture the baseline situation of the contextual settings in the cases in this research we have used the elements of the cpi framework that focus on the contextual aspects see fig 1 specifically these elements include the context related aspects of power dynamics participation and technology dimensions this section is dedicated to introducing the key context related aspects of the cpi framework 2 1 power dynamics dimension of cbm initiatives the power dynamics dimension focuses on the question who controls and influences the cbm initiative and how answering this question first and foremost requires an in depth understanding of the current power dynamics among stakeholders and existing practices regarding the management of the issue in focus of the cbm initiative gharesifard et al 2019 identified 1 the institutional and political context related to the issue in focus of a cbm initiative 2 authority and power of different stakeholder and 3 their access to and control over data as three context related aspects that influence the power dynamics within a cbm initiative see fig 1 institutional and political context includes the formal and informal rules and regulations and the extent of their implementation as well as the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders and the place of public participation in these processes authority and power of different stakeholder refers to their actual level of impact or influence on decision making processes finally access to and control over data relates to existing regulations and procedures that determine the level of access to data for different stakeholders 2 2 participation dimension of cbm initiatives this dimension of the framework focuses on the question who participates in the cbm initiative and how gharesifard et al 2019 introduces three context related aspects that can help depict the participation dynamics before the establishment of a cbm initiative 1 identifying the stakeholders who are included in or excluded from managing the water related or environmental issue in focus of the cbm initiative 2 studying the existing communication pattern among these stakeholders and 3 understanding how these stakeholders interact with each other while participating in the decision making processes i e the communication and participation method identifying the stakeholders who are currently involved in managing the water related or environmental issues will enhance our understanding of included and excluded groups in decision making processes regarding these issues this is particularly necessary for cbm initiatives that aim to move beyond data collection and to facilitate public participation in decision making processes studying the existing pattern of communication and information flow among different stakeholders before the establishment of a cbm initiative is essential for explaining if and how a cbm initiative has mediated these interactions finally studying existing methods of communication and participation in decision making processes is a prerequisite for understanding the extent to which an initiative may have affected or altered these interactions 2 3 technology dimension of cbm initiatives technology is an integral part of cbm initiatives and should enable participation of different stakeholders in a cbm initiative technology within a cbm initiative is either newly developed for the purpose of achieving the cbm goals e g a newly developed app or has previously existed and is adopted to provide desired functionalities within the cbm initiative e g off the shelf air or water quality sensors technology can also be categorized based on its functionality within the cbm initiative e g data collection analysis or communication the decision to select and adopt any existing or newly introduced technology comes with social economic political and even cultural implications that need to be carefully considered the key question for this dimension is therefore how effective and appropriate are the chosen technologies answering this question requires assessing the technological choices for a cbm initiative in relation to existing infrastructure as well as social and technological capabilities this is in line with two context related aspects of the cpi framework namely 1 the existing infrastructure and the different forms of access to technology material motivational usage and skills among different stakeholder groups and 2 included excluded groups resulting from the existing technological settings gharesifard et al 2019 3 methodology the conceptual framework introduced in section 2 was developed within the scope of the ground truth 2 0 project the results and discussions in this paper reflect the application of the cpi framework developed by gharesifard et al 2019 in depicting the baseline situation in two of the six ground truth 2 0 case studies namely in kenya and the netherlands the baseline situation in this paper refers to the contextual setting related to the issue in focus of each cbm initiative at their initiation for collecting the baseline data about the participation paradigms power dynamics and technological settings before establishment of the cbm initiatives 60 in depth semi structured interviews were conducted in the netherlands 26 interviews and in kenya 34 interviews case the complete lists of questions used for conducting the baseline interviews in the two cases were derived from the cpi framework and are provided as suppementary data in appendix a the average length of the interviews was 50 min and they were conducted either face to face or via phone skype in general four categories of stakeholders were approached for the interviews namely participants in the co design meetings of the respective cbm initiatives regulatory entities members of the general public and expert advisors i e experts on the issue in focus of the cbm initiative in many cases the organizations and individuals that are categorized as regulatory entities or expert advisors were also present in the respective cbm co design meetings and thus are also considered as members of the cbm co design group because of the complexity of the topics and due to the fact that different stakeholders had different levels of knowledge or understanding about the issue in focus of the cbm and the processes that we were interested to study we had to customize the interview questions for the four categories of interviewees see appendix a for further details the sample from the general public was selected using snowball and stratified sampling based on both gender and age while interviewees from the other three categories were selected using cluster sampling in case of the regulatory entities we interviewed at least one respondent from the local or national authorities who has a formal or legal mandate for managing the issue in focus of the cbm initiative expert advisors were selected from the pool of individuals with knowledge or experience about the issue in focus of the cbm initiative who were either identified in the co design meetings or were already known to the co authors as a part of their professional network as an extra sampling criterion at least 60 of the participants in the co design meetings were interviewed fig 2 illustrates the detailed distribution of interviewees in the two cases based on their age gender and stakeholder type it is important to note that the age and gender distribution of the samples are influenced by factors such as the overall population composition of each case and the age and gender composition of the participants in the cbm co design meetings the results and findings from the interviews were further complemented by a review of secondary sources as well as by the results of the discussions and observations made during several co design meetings in the cases the secondary sources include scientific publications major laws regulations acts and statistics related to the issues in focus of the two cbm initiatives 4 case studies the two cbm initiatives that were selected as the case studies for this paper are part of the ground truth 2 0 project the cbm initiative in the netherlands focuses on the issue of pluvial flooding in land van heusden en altena while the cbm initiative in kenya focuses on a much wider set of environmental issues that affect biodiversity conservation and livelihood management in the maasai mara ecosystem the selection of these two cases enabled conducting a rare comparative study of the factors that influences the establishment and functioning of cbm initiatives in the context of a developed country versus a developing country although the difference in the thematic foci of the cases limited the possibility of a direct comparison of some of the aspects it allowed for demonstrating the applicability of the cpi framework for conducting a baseline analysis of cbm initiatives regardless of their aims and objectives in addition it helped strengthen the overarching message of this research i e the need for careful consideration of contextual realities while establishing cbm initiatives which cuts across initiatives with different thematic foci 4 1 the dutch case study grip op water altena the dutch case study is located in the land van heudsen en altena which is a part of the dutch province of north brabant in terms of water management this area falls under the jurisdiction of the rivierenland regional water authority and consists of the three municipalities of werkendam woudrichem and aalburg with an increase in the number of intense rainfall incidents in recent years e g two extreme rainfall events in the summers of 2014 and 2015 pluvial flooding has become a major concern and has negatively affected a number of residents in this area the agreed goal of the stakeholders in this cbm initiative is therefore to prevent damage from extreme precipitation and this is reflected in the name of the initiative grip op water altena in dutch which means grip on water this will be achieved by improving the status quo of communication and data information and knowledge sharing between local citizens researchers three aforementioned municipalities and the rivierenland regional water authority the cbm initiative in this case study is facilitated by a web platform 4 4 http altena gripopwater nl this platform is used by local stakeholders to raise awareness and communicate about the measures that they have taken to improve water retention capacity in the area of land van heudsen en altena for example the local authorities utilize this platform to communicate about newly constructed or improved water infrastructure or water retention areas and citizens can share information and tips about their local measures such as removing extra tiles from their garden or attaching their roof downspout to a rain barrel 4 2 the kenyan case study maasai mara citizen observatory the kenya case is located in narok county in southwestern kenya close to the tanzanian border this area includes the maasai mara national reserve the mara triangle and conservancies around the national reserve this is a part of the wider mara ecosystem and is being managed by the narok county government the majority of the inhabitants of this area are maasai pastoralists and it is one of the most famous touristic destinations in kenya the human wildlife conflict is a prominent issue in this area and practices such as overstocking overgrazing and fencing alongside droughts have put a lot of pressure on biodiversity and people s livelihoods the ground truth 2 0 cbm initiative in kenya is called the maasai mara citizen observatory mmco and aims to support balancing sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity management in the wider mara region this will be achieved with the help of citizens and key stakeholders involved in managing biodiversity and livelihoods in the mara region mmco is supported by a web platform 5 5 https mara info ke and an app that enable the users including local community members tourists tour guides researchers rangers and local authorities to collect share and receive data about a wide range of topics including biodiversity sightings natural hazards e g floods and droughts pollution and emergency situations in addition the ground truth 2 0 will install a number of inexpensive tahmo 6 6 https tahmo org weather stations in the project area which will collect meteorological data and share this via the mmco web platform and app this data will help the local communities to have a better overview of available water resources and grazing lands and the authorities to predict species distributions the key stakeholders who were involved in the co design process of the kenyan cbm case included local community member scientists and researchers from local and international research institutes ngos conservancies and representatives of the narok county and national government 5 baseline situation in the two case studies this section depicts the baseline situation in which grip op water and the maasai mara citizen observatory were being established the findings are organized based on the eight key context related aspects across the power dynamics participation and technology dimensions of the cpi framework see fig 1 each sub section i e 5 1 5 2 etc focuses on one of these aspects and starts with a cross case comparison of the findings the case specific findings of the two case studies are then presented under each sub section 5 1 power dynamics dimension institutional political context the institutional and political context in the dutch case study can be characterized as a well established decentralized water governance system that has increasing attention to the issue of pluvial flooding in urban areas the stakeholders describe this as a well functioning system in which citizens have a high level of trust in the authorities responsible for water management however an awareness gap exists among the citizens about the topic of water management in contrast the kenyan case study has a recently devolved system of water and environmental governance a young system which still heavily relies on the central government in terms of policies procedures and resources the level of trust in the authorities responsible for the management of natural resources is much lower in the kenyan than in the dutch case study and the local communities are more concerned and conscious about the affect of environmental management and conservation practices on their daily lives 5 1 1 institutional political context in the dutch case study there are three major institutional layers in the dutch water management system 1 european level including the eu and international river basin commissions 2 national level which includes the central government ministry of infrastructure and the environment and the national water authority rijkswaterstaat and 3 sub national level which consists of the triangle of provinces regional water authorities and municipalities oecd 2014 dutch water management has been traditionally decentralized from both functional and territorial perspectives oecd 2014 functional decentralization refers to the tasks that each decentralized unit carries while territorial decentralization is linked to different provinces and municipalities within the country in terms of hierarchy the regional water authorities and municipalities are both at the same level while the provinces have a supervisory function over both the provinces are also responsible for laying down rules about water management and setting up or dissolving regional water authorities havekes et al 2017 during the past eight years the issue of pluvial flooding has moved from being absent in the dutch water policy for flood protection climate adaptation and water resilience to being high on the political agenda in delta programmes 2016 2017 and 2018 in practice the main actors involved in managing pluvial flooding are the municipalities and regional water authorities this is due to the fact that the water act 2010 places the municipalities in charge of processing urban waste water which includes rainwater run off in the municipal area and obliges the municipalities and regional water authorities to coordinate their activities the issue of pluvial flooding in urban areas is closely linked to spatial planning municipalities and property developers are the main stakeholders who benefit from spatial development in the netherlands nevertheless unlike the regional water authorities they do not bear much of the cost when it comes to water management oecd 2014 nor is water management among their primary tasks moreover the regional water authorities are independent from the central government in terms of generating their own revenue while municipalities are largely dependent on the national government for their income via municipal funds in addition to the water act 2010 and the delta programmes there are several other laws agreements plans and policy guidelines related to the topic of this cbm initiative among which are the national administrative agreement on water the spatial planning act the national water plan 2016 2021 the noord brabant provincial environment and water plan 2016 2021 the water management plan of the rivierenland regional water authority the sewerage policy vision of the werkendam woudrichem and aalburg municipalities and the common water plan of the municipalities and the rivierenland regional water authority moreover the dutch government is currently working on developing the environmental planning act expected to take effect in 2021 an act that will combine several existing laws including the water act the crisis and recovery act and the spatial planning act into one simplified and coherent piece of legislation almost all interviewees believed that the implementation of the rules roles and responsibilities related to the management of pluvial floods is very strict and in some cases even stricter than the available protocols several interviewees considered the fact that they do not see much of a problem with pluvial floods in the netherlands as a sign of good implementation moreover a number of interviewees mentioned that they are satisfied with the fact that there are numerous agreements protocols and procedures in place and being implemented especially in emergency situations the majority of the interviewees argued that the authorities are responsible for managing issues such as pluvial flooding and that civilians pay for this service via taxes the interviewees also believed that trust in the government is deeply rooted in dutch culture and that dutch citizens do not want to think about such problems too much several interviewees from all stakeholder groups mentioned the dutch quickly shift attention to matters visible for them for example in case of an incident e g a major flood the dutch community tends to come together and help voluntarily to prevent loss of lives or damage to properties the result of the interviews also revealed an awareness gap among the dutch citizens regarding water management an issue that was also highlighted in oecd 2014 this awareness gap combined with high level of trust in the government can hinder the implementation of necessary actions in the prevention phase of an infrequently experienced problem such as pluvial flooding 5 1 2 institutional political context in the kenyan case study given the fundamental changes in the constitution of kenya cok in august 2010 the country s institutional framework took a major turn from a centralized system of administration and governance to a devolved structure of government which cedes power of legislation execution and also revenue collection and expenditure to 47 counties the judiciary power however remained central at the national level with these changes the new constitution introduced two main levels of government national and county in terms of hierarchy the constitution defines these two levels as parallel and does not indicate any superiority for one level over the other government of kenya 2010 article 1 but several articles emphasize the need for consultation collaboration and coordination between the two levels for example article 6 2 defines these levels as distinct and inter dependent but highlights the need for their mutual relations on the basis of consultation and cooperation two main points were elicited from the interviews firstly the county is autonomous but its decisions should not conflict with the national parliament law and in any conflicting case the national law prevails secondly a number of interviewees believed that according to the devolution of power the county government has the final decision making power yet in many cases it is still the national government that takes some of the measures on the ground apart from the cok the interviewees identified inter national level legislation and policy guidelines related to the topic of the cbm including the agreement for the joint trans boundary management of the mara river basin the kenyan law on the management of protected areas the wildlife act the water act 2005 and the forest act at the county level the narok county integrated development plan and the environmental management bill are the main pieces of legislation and for many other aspects the county uses bylaws driven by the national policies and customized to the local issue nevertheless at the time of conducting this research the narok county government was in the process of approving a number of bills that will substitute these bylaws namely the maasai mara management plan the narok county tourism act the environmental management act and the livestock act the vast majority of the interviewees believed that the extent of implementation of rules roles and responsibilities regarding biodiversity conservation and livelihood management in kenya highly depends on the specific issue location and actors involved but overall implementation is not very strict at both local and national levels interviewees often referred to increasing wildlife deterioration and the existence of multiple barriers for sustaining livelihoods to back up their claim they identified several institutional social and political barriers for improved implementation including lack of resources money knowledge and staff especially at the county level conflicting personal and political interests and corruption moreover it was mentioned that strengthening implementation by the county is difficult because the county does not have the judiciary power to enforce the law for example in a poaching incident only the kenya wildlife service kws can arrest and prosecute people if the county rangers want to arrest someone they have to report it to kws the same applies to the issue of illegal logging and the kenya forest service kfs interviewees also highlighted several values norms and traditions of the maasai culture that can positively or negatively influence biodiversity conservation and livelihood management in the mara for example the traditional land ownership model of the maasai was community land ownership instead of individual land ownership preserving this tradition can help stop controversial practices such as fencing which increasingly cause wildlife deaths on the other hand maasai are traditionally pastoralists and they consider the number of livestock they have as an indicator of their wealth therefore overstocking and overgrazing have became prominent issues in the mara region 5 2 power dynamics dimension authority and power there was not a big difference in the perceived level of authority and power among the stakeholders in the two cases the regulatory entities in both cases are the most influential stakeholders in decision making processes they either have direct authority or a mandate for management of water or environment related issues or they participate in co governing the resources with other stakeholders or alternatively provide them with advice or consultation in contrast the majority of the general public and expert advisors in both cases perceived no direct influence on decision making processes or that they only have an indirect influence through participation in elections awareness raising or via communicating with authorities to express their concerns there is however one clear difference between the two cases whereas in the kenya case the roles of stakeholders are perceived to be strongly gendered this was not the case in the dutch case 5 2 1 authority and power in the dutch case study all interviewees from regulatory entities in this case mentioned that they exert influence on decisions related to pluvial flood management by providing advice consultation joining other colleagues or other organizations for decision making or by having direct authority on the decisions because of their job expert advisors who are not part of regulatory entities mainly have an influence by providing advice to the authorities or communicative influence for example by publishing their research findings the majority of the interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public perceived to have little or no influence on decisions related to managing pluvial floods or mentioned that they have an indirect influence via participation in the elections of regional water authorities several participants also mentioned they do not automatically receive information about such decisions however if they are interested they can search for and find this information on the other hand a few interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public gave examples of communicative influence on decisions such as signing a petition writing a letter to the authorities and expressing their opinions on how to manage pluvial floods or campaigning via social and mass media regarding the latter one of the interviewees argued that you can always complain by publishing an article in a newspaper or writing a note on their facebook page public shaming works 5 2 2 authority and power in the kenyan case study all interviewees from the regulatory entities at the county and national levels perceived direct influence on decisions related to biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihood management because of their official mandate according to the cok and a number of interviewees from the local regulatory entities the county government has the strongest influence among all actors nevertheless local chiefs play a vital role in the balance of power between the national and local government they have an explicit influence on daily local decisions and act as a direct link between the community and national authorities they have an advising consulting role towards the national government and relay the decisions and agreements that are made at the national level to the community moreover the church was also identified as one of the most powerful stakeholders a platform which can communicate directly with the authorities and influence public opinion in this regard a spiritual leader from a church said we provide advice and consultation to the authorities even the president sometimes consults the church on different decisions the respondents from the cbm co design group the expert advisors and the general public expressed two ways in which they can have a minimal influence on decisions 1 via altering public opinion rather than policies and decisions and educating community members e g via awareness raising programs or 2 by providing advice to the authorities inside or outside of participatory meetings the rest of the interviewees from these groups stated that they have little or no influence on decisions and they are informed about decisions when these are gazetted or advertised via other channels in this regard one interviewee mentioned our chance to influence the decisions is very limited they the authorities are not ready to listen to just a simple person some of the respondents from the general public also emphasized that at household level the decision making power normally rests with men female members of the communities are less involved in making decisions 5 3 power dynamics dimension access to and control over data both the dutch and the kenyan constitutions explicitly express the right of access to information for the general public nevertheless the interpretation and implementation of this issue differs between the two cases in the dutch case public authorities have explicit deadlines for responding to requests for data and in case of denying access they need to clearly justify their choice in the kenyan case however a rather open interpretation of sensitive or exempt information seems to be used sometimes to deny access to data sharing requests moreover in practice in both cases access to data is often controlled by the organizations or individuals who collect or hold the data 5 3 1 access to and control over data in the dutch case study in line with article 110 of the constitution of the kingdom of the netherlands all dutch government information has to be shared with the public and any information that is not already publicly shared e g via websites can be requested in accordance with the dutch public access to government information act law of 31 october 1991 this law however also allows government organizations to withhold certain information if considered confidential for privacy or security reasons public authorities have explicit deadlines for responding to requests and in case of refusal should provide the applicants with the reasons for their decision the interviewees from the regulatory entities and the expert advisors believed that a lot of data is available about pluvial floods but the general public is not aware of this because the information is mostly stored in internal databases within organizations and thus not immediately available for the public the majority of the remaining interviewees especially those from the general public did not have any experience with accessing data about pluvial floods however the few who did mentioned that some organizations e g the dutch meteorological institute knmi make more data publicly available than others the interviewees identified a wide range of organizations and individuals as qualified to analyze data about pluvial floods including the ministry of infrastructure and the environment rijkswaterstaat the regional water authorities the union of regional water authorities provinces municipalities knmi ngos consultancies scientists and scientific institutes only a few interviewees considered citizens among this group the regional water authorities were identified as the main organization that collects data about pluvial floods at the local level and rijkswaterstaat was identified as the main producer and owner of data at the national level in addition some interviewees believed that municipalities and provinces hardly take measurements themselves and even if they do the measurements are mostly qualitative e g whether or not a sewage overflow occurred not quantitative e g how much sewage water has been released to the surface waters regarding control over data it was mentioned that it is mainly the owner of the data who defines the level of access for others 5 3 2 access to and control over data in the kenyan case study article 35 of the cok 2010 explicitly indicates that every kenyan citizen has the right of access to the information held by the state or by another person if this is required for exercising or protecting any right or fundamental freedom furthermore the state shall publish and publicize any important information affecting the nation with reference to this article the access to information act 2016 and part ix of the county government act 2012 preserve the right of kenyan citizens for requesting access to information held by any government organization including the county government or any unit or department thereof despite these written rules a great majority of the interviewees believed that the level of access to data actually depends on the organization department or individuals who hold the data several interviewees criticized the current limited data sharing practices of the authorities based on their previous experiences and encounters for example a respondent mentioned sometimes they give you the data and sometimes they simply decide not to another one argued that sometimes you will be asked why you need the data in a harsh way they have the fear of use of this information by the community this is due to the fact that certain data and information are deemed sensitive or exempt information and although defined in the legislation the definition is open to interpretation this has resulted in keeping essential information from the public moreover some expert advisors stated that in any case one should not publish data that is not accepted or endorsed by the government otherwise they will advertise against using the data and claim that the data is not good at all all interviewees unanimously believed that the availability of data about biodiversity and livelihoods is not very good the available data was often described as inaccurate unreliable not up to date not well distributed spatially and temporally and inaccessible especially publicly or in a central way furthermore lack of coordination between organizations in terms of collecting and sharing data was identified as another issue it was mentioned that if data exists it is difficult to know who has the data and the organizations who hold the data do not share it with the public and sometimes not even with each other research organizations individual experts scientists ngos and government organizations were identified by the interviewees as the best placed stakeholders for analyzing data on biodiversity and livelihoods however it was mentioned that for some data the analysis requires highly specific expertise that may not even exist among the county rangers on the other hand many interviewees believed that the local people have a very good understanding of biodiversity and livelihoods but literacy and language are barriers that affect their ability to share their knowledge 5 4 participation dimension non participant groups although public participation has been gaining more attention in the dutch case study it is not a fundamental pillar of dutch democracy and not an integral part of current water management practices in contrast public participation is considered a governance principle in the kenyan case study and has a vivid footprint in several pieces of legislation nevertheless examining the main stakeholders who are currently involved in the management of the respective issue in focus of these cbm initiatives revealed that despite the legislative differences the role of the general public in both cases is minimal often limited to electing representatives 5 4 1 non participant groups in the dutch case study the interviewees were asked to identify those stakeholders who they think are currently involved in decision making and policy making processes regarding the management of pluvial floods in the netherlands the identified stakeholders included the major actors involved in water management in the netherlands namely the regional water authorities municipalities provinces rijkswaterstaat ministry of infrastructure and the environment union of regional water authorities unie van waterschappen the association of dutch municipalities vereniging van nederlandse gemeenten moreover the interviewees also identified the rioned foundation an umbrella organization for urban water management and sewerage in the netherlands and the southern agriculture and horticulture organization zlto which is a farmers association with 15 000 members in zeeland noord brabant and zuid gelderland in addition the interviewees also perceived an advising role for research and consulting companies from the private sector in managing pluvial floods the role of the citizens however was mentioned to be limited to electing representatives in the parliamentary provincial municipal or regional water authority elections this is due to the fact that public participation is not a fundamental pillar of dutch democracy there is no mention whatsoever of public participation in the constitution of the kingdom of the netherlands nor in the water act 2010 although citizen participation is gaining more attention in more recent policy guidelines such as the national water plan 2016 2021 fundamentally it is at best as an instrument to improve the current working of representative democracy michels 2006 p 336 5 4 2 non participant groups in the kenyan case study the parliament of kenya was identified as the main body of policy making regarding biodiversity conservation and livelihood management at the national level cabinet secretaries especially those who head the ministries involved in managing biodiversity and livelihoods relevant wings of ministries such as kws kfs kenya water resources management authority wrma the national museums of kenya and the kenya water tower agency were identified as the most relevant actors for the issue in focus of the cbm initiative at the national level furthermore the narok county government was elicited as the most influential stakeholder at the local level local chiefs conservancies and ngos were also deemed relevant stakeholders at the local level despite the devolution of power from the national level to the county government in kenya in 2010 the national level organizations such as kws are still very much involved in conservation activities at the county level public participation has a vivid footprint throughout the cok 2010 and in several other pieces of legislation including the county government act 2012 the public service values and principles act 2015 and more specifically related to the topic of this cbm initiative the environmental management and coordination act 1999 the wildlife conservation and management act 2013 and the agriculture and food authority act 2013 the first article of the constitution portrays public participation as a right for every kenyan and states that all sovereign power belongs to the people of kenya and that they can exercise their power directly or through their elected representatives the constitution also recognizes participation of the kenyan people as a national value and a governance principle and obliges the state to facilitate participation of everyone in governance processes furthermore public participation is also mentioned as a purpose of devolution of government for providing self governance power to the people and to enhance their participation in decision making processes the national and county governments are obliged to facilitate and encourage public participation in the legislative process public finance and also conservation of environmental and natural resources management despite the formal anchoring of participation in these legal frameworks none of the interviewees perceived any involvement of the general public in policy and decision making processes regarding biodiversity conservation and livelihood management this among other things presents a picture of the limited extent of implementation of these legislations despite much emphasis on public participation in the cok and the aforementioned acts kenya still lacks a national act that provides a general framework for how to give effect to the constitutional and legislative requirements in this regard it has been argued that such a framework at the national level is needed to guide the public participation processes at the local level marine 2015 the public participation bill 2016 was prepared to cover this gap however this bill still has not been accepted due to controversies and opposing ideas at the time of conducting this research the county public participation guidelines 2016 was the only available but not legally binding tool to guide this process 5 5 participation dimension communication paradigm although pluvial flooding is a popular conversation topic among the dutch the predominant pattern of communication about this topic is unidirectional from authorities to the citizens citizens only communicate about pluvial flooding with authorities if there is an acute problem or an emergency situation in such situations people would like to receive a quick response and therefore mostly communicate using phone calls similarly in the kenyan case study the authorities mostly communicated about biodiversity conservation and livelihood management unidirectionally and for the purpose of informing citizens 5 5 1 communication paradigm in the dutch case study the safety regions act 2010 sets the legal framework for risk and crisis communication in the netherlands this act divides the country into 25 security regions which are extended local government units with joint safety regulations the management board of a security region is responsible for informing a number of government authorities and personnel as well as the citizens about risks and crises that may affect a specific region although occasional bi directional and interactive patterns of information flow for risk and disaster communication can be found within and between central government authorities the predominant pattern of information flow is unidirectional from authorities to the citizens in addition this act only focuses on such communication at regional level however as kaufmann et al 2016 clarified communication of preparatory and responsive measures for events such as pluvial floods at a smaller scale can highly differ from one location to another the interviewees were asked whether or not they communicate about pluvial flooding with others and to indicate their preferred channels for such communication using apps on smart phones e g whatsapp viber line and communicating via email telephone call or sms or face to face e g daily bilateral discussions with others or participation in meetings were among the most frequent means of communication in this case study interviewees from the regulatory entities and expert advisors indicated that they communicate about this issue mostly for work purposes both internally e g with colleagues and externally with other individuals and organizations e g with residents or regional water authorities interviewees in this case often linked the issue of pluvial flooding with bad weather and intense rainfall incidents the interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public mentioned they often communicate about the issue with other residents in informal settings or after heavy rainfall at the same time a number of interviewees from these groups emphasized that unless there is an actual problem or an emergency situation there is no or too little communication with municipalities and other authorities fig 3 summarizes the preferred channels for communicating based on this figure the most preferred channel for communication was phone call or sms as people prefer to receive a quick response or like someone listen to them 5 5 2 communication paradigm in the kenyan case study there is no article in the cok or other legislation that directly mentions the desired pattern of information flow between different stakeholders for policy and decision making processes however several articles portray a unidirectional communication paradigm as the prescribed pattern of communication from state and county government to the general public the main purpose seems to be informing the public about decisions as an example the county government act 2012 requests county governments to integrate communication in all development activities using telephone and smart phone app calls predominantly whatsapp are by far the two most frequently used means of communication in this case study due to the low average level of literacy among local citizens phone calls are much more common than sending sms different communication channels are used for reaching different target groups for example social media e g facebook is one of the best channels for reaching out to the youth while for elders face to face communication works better moreover radio was indicated as an efficient channel for reaching a large number of people even in remote areas the majority of the interviewees mentioned that they communicate about biodiversity conservation and livelihood management both for work and personal purposes the authorities mainly prefer to communicate with community member face to face while the community members mostly use face to face meetings phone calls and sms whatsapp and email for reaching out to the authorities fig 4 presents the preferred channels for communication as the figure shows using an app on a smartphone predominantly whatsapp and using websites or blogs are respectively the most and least preferred channels for communicating about biodiversity conservation and livelihood management in this case study 5 6 participation dimension methods of communication and participation in both cases decision making about the issue in focus of the cbm initiatives has a top down form and relies heavily on the technical expertise of the regulatory entities and sometimes involves deliberation and negotiation between the stakeholders in charge of managing the issue although several respondents from the expert advisors members of the co design group and the general public in the two case studies perceived to have little or no influence on decision making processes respondents from the kenya case study indicated a much wider range of methods by which they could lobby or communicate their ideas and interests to the authorities and possibly intervene in decision making processes 5 6 1 methods of communication and participation in the dutch case study the interviewees were asked to explain in what ways if any they are involved in managing pluvial floods and how they take part in decision making processes on this issue all interviewees from the regulatory entities mentioned that they are involved in managing pluvial floods via their jobs their involvement spanned from setting policies at the regional water authority or municipal level to decision making at the operational level e g managing the pumps and weirs for preventing floods the examples provided by the interviewees from this group depicted the deliberate and negotiate or technical expertise roles for them in the decision making processes fung 2006 the expert advisors are mostly involved indirectly via providing data and information as well as expressing their expert opinion in meetings with the authorities these data information and expert views may or may not be used by the authorities thus they are mostly involved in decision making processes via explicit data provision and expressing preferences the majority of the interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public had little or no expectation to influence decisions at any level in this regard one of the interviewees mentioned that i don t think i have any influence it is the municipality who makes the decisions if i have a problem i contact the municipality and they decide how to take care of the issue a few interviewees however believed that they have an indirect say in decisions by participating in the elections of the regional water authority elections but they did not consider this as real involvement in making decisions or creating policies 5 6 2 methods of communication and participation in the kenyan case study in the kenyan case study all participants from the regulatory entities perceived they have a direct or indirect say in the decisions because of their technical expertise the expert advisors indicated that they are mostly involved via their jobs and the nature of their involvement was highly dependent on their work this level of involvement ranged from expressing opinions by communicating about their research to deliberation and negotiation with the authorities see fung 2006 many interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public perceived that they are barely or not at all part of decision making processes related to biodiversity conservation and livelihood management some of these interviewees indicated they only get to know about decisions when these are gazetted the other interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public identified two main methods by which they are involved in decision making processes the first method was expressing preferences in participatory meetings or via membership in community action groups although it is not always possible for everyone or even the community representatives to participate in such meetings because of the location or timing of the meetings those who do participate have the opportunity to express their preferences and even bargain with the authorities for example a local maasai gave a clear example of bargaining power that he had because of his membership in a local water users association when we participate in these meetings we express our opinion and contribute to the discussions for example through appealing to the 2010 constitution and the recent wildlife act we could get them the narok county government to assign more compensation for livestock deaths the second identified method was by communicating with different influential stakeholders bilaterally outside of participatory meetings interviewees highlighted that using this method depends heavily on social or professional links with these stakeholders in this regard one interviewee mentioned if you want to have a good influence you should be present in the political forums or know people who are there 5 7 technology dimension access to technology the issue of access to technology in the two case studies of this research presents a classic north south or developed versus developing country situation there is a drastic difference between the netherlands and kenya in terms of both diffusion and actual use of icts a difference that is amplified by the low level of literacy and required skills for effective use of icts in the kenyan context moreover in terms of ict infrastructure narok county is largely under developed as compared to the national average level 5 7 1 access to technology in the dutch case study at the time of conducting this study with an idi rank 7 itu 2017a and a digital economy and society index desi 4 european commision 2017 the netherlands ranked high in terms of ict development in europe as well as worldwide fulfilling the growing demand for high speed internet access is at the forefront of dutch government policy itu 2017b in 2017 there were 129 9 mobile cellular telephone subscriptions and 40 3 fixed telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in the netherlands moreover 92 2 of households had internet access and almost 90 of households had computers the country also ranked high in terms of actual use of information and communication technologies 90 4 of citizens used the internet dutch citizens also have the required skills to use icts according to the itu 2017a the mean years of schooling in the netherlands is 11 9 years moreover the dutch government aims to make digital literacy a core part of the curriculum of primary and secondary education ministry of economic affairs 2016 5 7 2 access to technology in the kenyan case study mobile phones are the main medium for digital communication in kenya and at the time of conducting this research there were 81 3 postpaid and active prepaid mobile cellular telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in kenya itu 2017b in contrast only 0 15 of residents had fixed telephone subscriptions less than 15 of households had computers and 22 3 of households had internet access although a large proportion of the population used mobile phones only some of these individuals were actively using the internet world economic forum 2016 the average low level of literacy in kenya is a challenge for developing the required skills for effective use of icts in 2017 the mean years of schooling in this country was only 6 3 years in terms of both access to and the skills to use icts narok county was performing below the national level the strategy for spatial development of ict infrastructure in kenya is very much focused on service provision for population centers for example in 2016 with a geographical coverage of only 17 up to 78 of the kenyans had access to 3g broadband service intelecon 2016 the downside of this strategy is that a large part of the counties including a large proportion of the narok county that has a dispersed population are either under served e g do not have access to 3g broadband or not served at all moreover a recent report by the kenya national bureau of statistics indicates that only 11 of narok county inhabitants have a secondary level of education and 38 of the residents in this county have no formal education ngugi et al 2013 5 8 technology dimension included excluded groups resulting from technological choices in addition to differences in access to technology for different groups within society lack of basic digital skills by a considerable proportion of the population in both cases and a low average level of literacy among kenyans are among the factors that may contribute to exclusion of a part of the population in processes that require using icts 5 8 1 included excluded groups resulting from technological choices in the dutch case study despite a well developed and growing ict infrastructure and availability of affordable mobile cellular and mobile broadband offers itu 2017b at the time of conducting this research the access gap was not yet closed in the netherlands the results of a recent study of 108 000 dutch citizens reveal that the younger population with higher levels of education and income and in some areas males have better access to internet van deursen van dijk 2015 in terms of actual usage according to available statistics a very large proportion of the dutch population is active technology users nevertheless the main gap resulting from the growing digitization of the dutch society seems to exist for those who lack basic digital skills according to the european commision 2017 this is no less than 23 of the dutch population aged 16 74 a thought provoking figure but one that is still much lower than the 44 average for the whole europe 5 8 2 included excluded groups resulting from technological choices in the kenyan case study despite advancements in the ict sector in kenya there is still a big gap in both access and skills to effectively use technology in addition to differences in accessing technology the low level of literacy especially among the older generation and gender discrepancies in access to and use of technology are among contributing factors in creating new forms of inequalities brännström 2012 world wide web foundation 2015 the gap in access and use is more significant in rural areas with dispersed population and can highly affect the ability of community members to take part in public participation processes as an example public participation in the process of formulating a national strategy for wildlife conservation and management in 2017 was only possible by sending a written memorandum via email or expressing oral or written opinions in the structured regional meetings sending a written memorandum via email among other things requires a certain level of literacy computer skills and internet access provided that community members were aware of this consultation in the first place moreover structured meetings at the regional level are normally held at the center of each county which also limits the chance of participation for community members who live in remote areas 6 discussion this section summarizes the most important findings of this study and demonstrates that aside from the fact that the two cbm initiatives in this study have different thematic foci they are operating in fundamentally different social political institutional and technological settings unlike the kenyan case study the dutch case study can be characterized as an institutional environment that currently has little or no envisioned role for public participation and a social context with high trust in and expectations from the government this issue was also highlighted in previous research by wehn et al 2015 where they concluded that flood risk management in the netherlands is considered by the public and by authorities as an issue that requires technical expertise and needs to be handled by the authorities and not by citizens this has resulted in an evident awareness gap and reluctance of citizens to contribute to tasks related to water management oecd 2014 wehn et al 2018 municipalities and regional water authorities are the main stakeholders involved in managing pluvial flooding and the role of community members is mostly limited to electing representatives in the municipality and regional water authority elections nevertheless municipalities and regional water authorities have occasional conflict of priorities and interests especially when it comes to spatial planning the fact that the upcoming environmental planning act combines the water act and the spatial planning act into one coherent piece of legislation shows that the dutch government is aware of this problem and is taking a step towards resolving it although the overall level of availability and access to data was not identified as a prominent issue in the dutch case the regional water authorities collect and store most of the data about pluvial flooding and data sharing with other stakeholders often happens on demand moreover the netherlands ranks high in terms of access to icts and a large proportion of the dutch population is actively using icts and has the required skills to do so the results of our study elicited several contextual factors in the kenyan case study social institutional political and technological circumstances that if not understood well are known to act as major barriers for establishing cbm initiatives in east africa pocock et al 2018 and beyond haklay 2015 tseng penning rowsell 2012 the kenyan case study can be characterized as a relatively new political and institutional climate with contested power over decisions regarding biodiversity conservation and livelihood management despite the constitutional authority and mandates of the narok county government for managing its resources other powerful stakeholders at different levels e g the national government organizations and the local chiefs have a lot of interest in and influence on decision making processes similar to the dutch case the decision making system in this case study is mostly top down however community members are more concerned and conscious about environmental issues and have a much lower level of trust in authorities despite much emphasis on public participation in the constitution of kenya and several pieces of legislation local citizens who are not well connected or cannot take part in participatory meetings are essentially not being heard in terms of different forms of access to icts narok county performs below the national level a problem that among other things is amplified by the national strategy for spatial development of icts and the dispersed distribution of the narok county population furthermore it is evident that there is a lot of sensitivity about publishing certain data and information in this case study as an example publishing live data about the location of wildlife could raise concerns about potential misuse of such data by poachers for locating certain species 7 conclusions in this paper we used the cpi framework a framework for context analysis processes evaluation and impact assessment of cbm initiatives which was developed by gharesifard et al 2019 to systematically analyze the contextual settings during the initiation of two cbm initiatives in the netherlands and kenya within the context of the ground truth 2 0 project a contextual analysis was carried out to depict the existing power dynamics participation paradigm and technological settings in these two case studies based on the findings of this research a number of realistic expectations of what the netherlands cbm grip op water altena and the kenyan cbm maasai mara citizen observatory can achieve are identified and presented in this section in addition a number of recommendations are provided that can be beneficial for the future development and functioning of these two cbm initiatives these insights will help making informed decisions while designing and implementing cbm initiatives and provide valuable inputs for their future up scaling without a sound understanding of the contextual realities in which these cbm initiatives will operate assumptions need to be made in order to understand what can be expected from each cbm initiative moreover there will be no baseline for measuring outcomes and impacts of the initiatives therefore it is highly important that such a baseline analysis be conducted at a very early stage and preferably before the establishment of a cbm initiative we hypothesize that early assessment of the contextual setting in which a cbm initiative will operate and with which it will interact can help establish more sustainable initiatives a hypothesis that requires further examination and verification the dutch case study presents a case of a well established top down water management system a system in which public participation is not embedded in the institutions and the general public has a low level of awareness of little interest in and no direct authority for managing pluvial flooding and essentially expects the authorities to manage this issue one of the roles of the grip op water altena is therefore to raise awareness and build a better understanding of the issue of pluvial flooding among dutch citizens in addition this cbm can help create a more interactive pattern of communication and information sharing among water managers spatial planners and citizens a functionality that can help achieve the desired coordination goal of the upcoming environmental planning act although municipalities and the rivierenland regional water authority are the main stakeholders involved in managing pluvial flooding in this case study involving other stakeholders at higher levels of policy making e g rijkswaterstaat and the province of noord brabant as well as the rioned foundation and zlto is highly recommended for the long term sustainability of this cbm finally although the access to technology gap is almost closed in the netherlands further technological development of this initiative should consider the requirements of interested citizens with limited digital skills the maasai mara citizen observatory has the potential to help create a much needed platform that facilitates information collection and sharing among stakeholders in the mara region to do so it can leverage the existing interest within the county government national government and private sector for improving the availability of spatial and temporal data about biodiversity and livelihoods as well as public interest in accessing information that affects their livelihoods moreover given the institutional provisions for public participation this cbm has the potential to facilitate the process of public participation in decision making and also communication among different actors moreover the identified gap in access to icts in this case study highlights the need for developing technologies that are open source and can be used offline the open data kit odk is an example of such technological solutions a suite of tools that allows data collection and submission to an online server without internet connection or mobile carrier service at the time of data collection nevertheless because of the low average level of digital skills among the users it is recommended that a user manual is developed and training sessions are organized to further familiarize end users with functionalities of the app and the cbm web platform it is also recommended that alternative possibilities for inclusion of those community members who do not use smart phones are further explored e g the possibility of dissemination of selected information via local radio the existing concerns about sharing sensitive data may result in developing specific data collection or sharing policies that restrict access to live raw data for the end users transparency about such a decision is key for building trust among users an issue that is important for the long term success of a cbm therefore it is recommended that such decisions are clearly communicated with the stakeholders moreover based on the results of this research for scaling up the cbm and recruiting more members it is highly recommended to take the local chiefs and churches onboard as these are among the most influential stakeholders and can help attract a large number of community members future research should trace the changes in the baseline contextual settings of the grip op water altena and maasai mara citizen observatory both during and after the lifetime of the ground truth 2 0 project moreover application of the comprehensive framework proposed by gharesifard et al 2019 to fully functional cbms will complement the results of this research by capturing the intrinsic characteristics of the two initiatives while having demonstrated the advantages of conducting an in depth baseline analysis at the initiation of a cbm initiative we also acknowledge that undertaking such a thorough contextual analysis initiatives requires substantial time resources and expertise which may not always be available for all cbm initiatives nevertheless a less comprehensive context mapping that is tailored to available resources and based on a desk research of secondary data sources can still yield valuable insights and is therefore highly recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the research reported in this paper is part of the ground truth 2 0 project

6044,much attention is being paid to the design and implementation of community based monitoring initiatives of water and environment and how to attract more citizens to participate in such initiatives although mass participation in collecting and sharing water related or environmental data and good project design and implementation are key factors for the success of community based monitoring these initiatives do not operate in a void community based monitoring initiatives are embedded in and can influence existing social institutional political and technological settings in spite of the fact that these contextual factors are not static and constantly change over time capturing their status quo at the initiation of a community based monitoring activity delivers critical insights for establishing a sustainable initiative and can be used as a benchmark for assessing its subsequent outcomes and impacts yet the salience of understanding the initial contextual settings is often underestimated or these are only considered once an initiative has already been established the objective of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of early stage research about such contextual realities in order to do so we employed the cpi framework gharesifard et al 2019 for conducting a systematic analysis of the baseline situation of two newly established community based monitoring initiatives one in the netherlands and one in kenya the case study in the netherlands focuses on the issue of pluvial flooding in an urban setting while the kenyan case study deals with balancing sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity management in a rural area our baseline analysis showed that aside from the fact that these initiatives have different thematic foci there are distinct differences between the two in terms of access to technology availability and accessibility of data the institutional arrangements for public participation in decision making processes and the level of citizen trust in the authorities in charge of managing the respective water related and environmental issues based on the findings of this research a number of recommendations are provided that can be beneficial for the future development and functioning of the two initiatives keywords citizen science community based monitoring context analysis participation technology power dynamics 1 introduction complexity uncertainty and multi dimensionality are among the inherent characteristics of environmental problems polasky et al 2011 reed 2008 and despite great scientific and technological advancements solving these challenges has proven to require more than just conventional science centered ideology irwin 1995 over the past two decades the promotion of non structural measures along with widespread replacement of water and environmental management concepts with governance ideology wehn et al 2015 has highlighted the role of citizens and envisioned their participation as one of the most important stakeholders in the management of natural resources this has resulted in paying special attention to citizen science projects and community based monitoring hereafter cbm initiatives of water and environmental resources as innovative approaches that can help address the complex water and environmental challenges of the 21st century cbm initiatives on the one hand have the potential to help enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of shared environmental data inform environmental decision making and subsequently help reform water related and environmental policies and on the other hand they can facilitate the communication between different stakeholders and the co creation of knowledge much emphasis is being placed on the design and implementation of cbm and how to attract more citizens to participate in such initiatives although mass participation in collecting and sharing water and environmental data and good project design and implementation are key factors for the success of a cbm initiative these initiatives do not operate in a void during the initiation of a cbm initiative there are already existing institutions policies and technological settings in which the initiative will be embedded with which it will interact or which it aims to influence as an example lessons learned from the wesenseit project an eu fp7 project for developing cbm initiatives of water and flooding confirm that such circumstantial factors influenced the participation dynamics and the shape and size of the cbm initiatives in this project joshi wehn 2017 wehn et al 2015 although contextual factors 1 1 the two terms contextual factors and circumstantial factors have been used as synonyms in this paper and both refer to the circumstances that influence the establishment and functioning of a cbm initiative are not static and constantly change over time capturing their status quo at the initiation of a cbm delivers critical insights for establishing a sustainable initiative and for assessing its evolving outcomes and impacts nevertheless the importance of such a baseline analysis is often underestimated or only considered after initiation of a cbm activity this has resulted in initiatives that discontinue after a short while whose results have no actual use in policy and decision making or they even have contributed to creating new forms of exclusion and inequalities within society we argue that for a cbm to have impact on policy and decision making processes it is essential to first gain a thorough understanding of the contextual setting in which it will be embedded and operate since these aspects can strongly affect the design implementation outcomes and impacts of the initiative the aim of this paper is thus to demonstrate the importance of an early analysis of such contextual realities although the role of contextual factors in shaping the design and implementation of citizen science and cbm initiatives have been highlighted in the literature e g dehnen schmutz et al 2016 irwin 1995 phillips et al 2019 wehn et al 2015 until recently there was no framework that enables a systematic analysis of the contextual factors that affect the establishment and functioning of these initiatives gharesifard et al 2019 proposed a conceptual framework for systematic analysis of five generic dimensions across all cbm initiatives this framework called the cpi framework 2 2 conceptual framework for examining the contextual setting process evaluation and impact of a cbm initiative is designed for context analysis processes evaluation and impact assessment of cbm initiatives the cpi framework takes into account the multidimensional characteristics of cbms and recognizes the difference between the aspects that are intrinsic to a cbm initiative and the contextual realities in which it is being or will be embedded and with which it interacts adopting the cpi framework enables a systematic evaluation of the contextual aspects related to participation power dynamics and technological settings in this paper we use this framework to showcase an in depth qualitative empirical research into the contextual realities of two cbm initiatives in the netherlands and kenya both of these initiatives are part of ground truth 2 0 an eu funded project that is setting up and validating six cbm initiatives in europe and africa 3 3 https gt20 eu ground truth 2 0 has a people centered approach towards establishing and scaling up cbm initiatives and aimed to set up sustainable cbm initiatives by involving three main categories of stakeholders citizens data aggregators scientists and decision makers the cbm case study in the netherlands focuses on the issue of pluvial floods in land van heusden en altena while the kenyan cbm aims to help balancing sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity management in the maasai mara ecosystem this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the theoretical background of the research and introduces the selected dimensions and aspects of the cpi framework for this research the method used for applying the framework for capturing the baseline situation in the two aforementioned cbm initiatives is then discussed in section 3 the two case studies of this research are introduced in section 4 section 5 is dedicated to demonstrating the application of the framework by depicting the baseline situation for the two cbm initiatives finally general as well as case specific discussions recommendations and conclusions are presented in sections 6 and 7 2 theoretical background the cpi framework consists of five generic dimensions across all cbm initiatives namely goals objectives technology participation power dynamics and results of the cbm initiative gharesifard et al 2019 the aspects discussed in the two dimensions of goals objectives and results of the cbm initiative relate to the internal characteristics of the cbm initiative while the technology participation and power dynamics dimensions cover a wide range of contextual factors about the issue in focus of the cbm e g the institutional and political context the cbm initiative itself e g its establishment mechanism or both e g communication paradigm about the issue and within the cbm initiative to be able to capture the baseline situation of the contextual settings in the cases in this research we have used the elements of the cpi framework that focus on the contextual aspects see fig 1 specifically these elements include the context related aspects of power dynamics participation and technology dimensions this section is dedicated to introducing the key context related aspects of the cpi framework 2 1 power dynamics dimension of cbm initiatives the power dynamics dimension focuses on the question who controls and influences the cbm initiative and how answering this question first and foremost requires an in depth understanding of the current power dynamics among stakeholders and existing practices regarding the management of the issue in focus of the cbm initiative gharesifard et al 2019 identified 1 the institutional and political context related to the issue in focus of a cbm initiative 2 authority and power of different stakeholder and 3 their access to and control over data as three context related aspects that influence the power dynamics within a cbm initiative see fig 1 institutional and political context includes the formal and informal rules and regulations and the extent of their implementation as well as the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders and the place of public participation in these processes authority and power of different stakeholder refers to their actual level of impact or influence on decision making processes finally access to and control over data relates to existing regulations and procedures that determine the level of access to data for different stakeholders 2 2 participation dimension of cbm initiatives this dimension of the framework focuses on the question who participates in the cbm initiative and how gharesifard et al 2019 introduces three context related aspects that can help depict the participation dynamics before the establishment of a cbm initiative 1 identifying the stakeholders who are included in or excluded from managing the water related or environmental issue in focus of the cbm initiative 2 studying the existing communication pattern among these stakeholders and 3 understanding how these stakeholders interact with each other while participating in the decision making processes i e the communication and participation method identifying the stakeholders who are currently involved in managing the water related or environmental issues will enhance our understanding of included and excluded groups in decision making processes regarding these issues this is particularly necessary for cbm initiatives that aim to move beyond data collection and to facilitate public participation in decision making processes studying the existing pattern of communication and information flow among different stakeholders before the establishment of a cbm initiative is essential for explaining if and how a cbm initiative has mediated these interactions finally studying existing methods of communication and participation in decision making processes is a prerequisite for understanding the extent to which an initiative may have affected or altered these interactions 2 3 technology dimension of cbm initiatives technology is an integral part of cbm initiatives and should enable participation of different stakeholders in a cbm initiative technology within a cbm initiative is either newly developed for the purpose of achieving the cbm goals e g a newly developed app or has previously existed and is adopted to provide desired functionalities within the cbm initiative e g off the shelf air or water quality sensors technology can also be categorized based on its functionality within the cbm initiative e g data collection analysis or communication the decision to select and adopt any existing or newly introduced technology comes with social economic political and even cultural implications that need to be carefully considered the key question for this dimension is therefore how effective and appropriate are the chosen technologies answering this question requires assessing the technological choices for a cbm initiative in relation to existing infrastructure as well as social and technological capabilities this is in line with two context related aspects of the cpi framework namely 1 the existing infrastructure and the different forms of access to technology material motivational usage and skills among different stakeholder groups and 2 included excluded groups resulting from the existing technological settings gharesifard et al 2019 3 methodology the conceptual framework introduced in section 2 was developed within the scope of the ground truth 2 0 project the results and discussions in this paper reflect the application of the cpi framework developed by gharesifard et al 2019 in depicting the baseline situation in two of the six ground truth 2 0 case studies namely in kenya and the netherlands the baseline situation in this paper refers to the contextual setting related to the issue in focus of each cbm initiative at their initiation for collecting the baseline data about the participation paradigms power dynamics and technological settings before establishment of the cbm initiatives 60 in depth semi structured interviews were conducted in the netherlands 26 interviews and in kenya 34 interviews case the complete lists of questions used for conducting the baseline interviews in the two cases were derived from the cpi framework and are provided as suppementary data in appendix a the average length of the interviews was 50 min and they were conducted either face to face or via phone skype in general four categories of stakeholders were approached for the interviews namely participants in the co design meetings of the respective cbm initiatives regulatory entities members of the general public and expert advisors i e experts on the issue in focus of the cbm initiative in many cases the organizations and individuals that are categorized as regulatory entities or expert advisors were also present in the respective cbm co design meetings and thus are also considered as members of the cbm co design group because of the complexity of the topics and due to the fact that different stakeholders had different levels of knowledge or understanding about the issue in focus of the cbm and the processes that we were interested to study we had to customize the interview questions for the four categories of interviewees see appendix a for further details the sample from the general public was selected using snowball and stratified sampling based on both gender and age while interviewees from the other three categories were selected using cluster sampling in case of the regulatory entities we interviewed at least one respondent from the local or national authorities who has a formal or legal mandate for managing the issue in focus of the cbm initiative expert advisors were selected from the pool of individuals with knowledge or experience about the issue in focus of the cbm initiative who were either identified in the co design meetings or were already known to the co authors as a part of their professional network as an extra sampling criterion at least 60 of the participants in the co design meetings were interviewed fig 2 illustrates the detailed distribution of interviewees in the two cases based on their age gender and stakeholder type it is important to note that the age and gender distribution of the samples are influenced by factors such as the overall population composition of each case and the age and gender composition of the participants in the cbm co design meetings the results and findings from the interviews were further complemented by a review of secondary sources as well as by the results of the discussions and observations made during several co design meetings in the cases the secondary sources include scientific publications major laws regulations acts and statistics related to the issues in focus of the two cbm initiatives 4 case studies the two cbm initiatives that were selected as the case studies for this paper are part of the ground truth 2 0 project the cbm initiative in the netherlands focuses on the issue of pluvial flooding in land van heusden en altena while the cbm initiative in kenya focuses on a much wider set of environmental issues that affect biodiversity conservation and livelihood management in the maasai mara ecosystem the selection of these two cases enabled conducting a rare comparative study of the factors that influences the establishment and functioning of cbm initiatives in the context of a developed country versus a developing country although the difference in the thematic foci of the cases limited the possibility of a direct comparison of some of the aspects it allowed for demonstrating the applicability of the cpi framework for conducting a baseline analysis of cbm initiatives regardless of their aims and objectives in addition it helped strengthen the overarching message of this research i e the need for careful consideration of contextual realities while establishing cbm initiatives which cuts across initiatives with different thematic foci 4 1 the dutch case study grip op water altena the dutch case study is located in the land van heudsen en altena which is a part of the dutch province of north brabant in terms of water management this area falls under the jurisdiction of the rivierenland regional water authority and consists of the three municipalities of werkendam woudrichem and aalburg with an increase in the number of intense rainfall incidents in recent years e g two extreme rainfall events in the summers of 2014 and 2015 pluvial flooding has become a major concern and has negatively affected a number of residents in this area the agreed goal of the stakeholders in this cbm initiative is therefore to prevent damage from extreme precipitation and this is reflected in the name of the initiative grip op water altena in dutch which means grip on water this will be achieved by improving the status quo of communication and data information and knowledge sharing between local citizens researchers three aforementioned municipalities and the rivierenland regional water authority the cbm initiative in this case study is facilitated by a web platform 4 4 http altena gripopwater nl this platform is used by local stakeholders to raise awareness and communicate about the measures that they have taken to improve water retention capacity in the area of land van heudsen en altena for example the local authorities utilize this platform to communicate about newly constructed or improved water infrastructure or water retention areas and citizens can share information and tips about their local measures such as removing extra tiles from their garden or attaching their roof downspout to a rain barrel 4 2 the kenyan case study maasai mara citizen observatory the kenya case is located in narok county in southwestern kenya close to the tanzanian border this area includes the maasai mara national reserve the mara triangle and conservancies around the national reserve this is a part of the wider mara ecosystem and is being managed by the narok county government the majority of the inhabitants of this area are maasai pastoralists and it is one of the most famous touristic destinations in kenya the human wildlife conflict is a prominent issue in this area and practices such as overstocking overgrazing and fencing alongside droughts have put a lot of pressure on biodiversity and people s livelihoods the ground truth 2 0 cbm initiative in kenya is called the maasai mara citizen observatory mmco and aims to support balancing sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity management in the wider mara region this will be achieved with the help of citizens and key stakeholders involved in managing biodiversity and livelihoods in the mara region mmco is supported by a web platform 5 5 https mara info ke and an app that enable the users including local community members tourists tour guides researchers rangers and local authorities to collect share and receive data about a wide range of topics including biodiversity sightings natural hazards e g floods and droughts pollution and emergency situations in addition the ground truth 2 0 will install a number of inexpensive tahmo 6 6 https tahmo org weather stations in the project area which will collect meteorological data and share this via the mmco web platform and app this data will help the local communities to have a better overview of available water resources and grazing lands and the authorities to predict species distributions the key stakeholders who were involved in the co design process of the kenyan cbm case included local community member scientists and researchers from local and international research institutes ngos conservancies and representatives of the narok county and national government 5 baseline situation in the two case studies this section depicts the baseline situation in which grip op water and the maasai mara citizen observatory were being established the findings are organized based on the eight key context related aspects across the power dynamics participation and technology dimensions of the cpi framework see fig 1 each sub section i e 5 1 5 2 etc focuses on one of these aspects and starts with a cross case comparison of the findings the case specific findings of the two case studies are then presented under each sub section 5 1 power dynamics dimension institutional political context the institutional and political context in the dutch case study can be characterized as a well established decentralized water governance system that has increasing attention to the issue of pluvial flooding in urban areas the stakeholders describe this as a well functioning system in which citizens have a high level of trust in the authorities responsible for water management however an awareness gap exists among the citizens about the topic of water management in contrast the kenyan case study has a recently devolved system of water and environmental governance a young system which still heavily relies on the central government in terms of policies procedures and resources the level of trust in the authorities responsible for the management of natural resources is much lower in the kenyan than in the dutch case study and the local communities are more concerned and conscious about the affect of environmental management and conservation practices on their daily lives 5 1 1 institutional political context in the dutch case study there are three major institutional layers in the dutch water management system 1 european level including the eu and international river basin commissions 2 national level which includes the central government ministry of infrastructure and the environment and the national water authority rijkswaterstaat and 3 sub national level which consists of the triangle of provinces regional water authorities and municipalities oecd 2014 dutch water management has been traditionally decentralized from both functional and territorial perspectives oecd 2014 functional decentralization refers to the tasks that each decentralized unit carries while territorial decentralization is linked to different provinces and municipalities within the country in terms of hierarchy the regional water authorities and municipalities are both at the same level while the provinces have a supervisory function over both the provinces are also responsible for laying down rules about water management and setting up or dissolving regional water authorities havekes et al 2017 during the past eight years the issue of pluvial flooding has moved from being absent in the dutch water policy for flood protection climate adaptation and water resilience to being high on the political agenda in delta programmes 2016 2017 and 2018 in practice the main actors involved in managing pluvial flooding are the municipalities and regional water authorities this is due to the fact that the water act 2010 places the municipalities in charge of processing urban waste water which includes rainwater run off in the municipal area and obliges the municipalities and regional water authorities to coordinate their activities the issue of pluvial flooding in urban areas is closely linked to spatial planning municipalities and property developers are the main stakeholders who benefit from spatial development in the netherlands nevertheless unlike the regional water authorities they do not bear much of the cost when it comes to water management oecd 2014 nor is water management among their primary tasks moreover the regional water authorities are independent from the central government in terms of generating their own revenue while municipalities are largely dependent on the national government for their income via municipal funds in addition to the water act 2010 and the delta programmes there are several other laws agreements plans and policy guidelines related to the topic of this cbm initiative among which are the national administrative agreement on water the spatial planning act the national water plan 2016 2021 the noord brabant provincial environment and water plan 2016 2021 the water management plan of the rivierenland regional water authority the sewerage policy vision of the werkendam woudrichem and aalburg municipalities and the common water plan of the municipalities and the rivierenland regional water authority moreover the dutch government is currently working on developing the environmental planning act expected to take effect in 2021 an act that will combine several existing laws including the water act the crisis and recovery act and the spatial planning act into one simplified and coherent piece of legislation almost all interviewees believed that the implementation of the rules roles and responsibilities related to the management of pluvial floods is very strict and in some cases even stricter than the available protocols several interviewees considered the fact that they do not see much of a problem with pluvial floods in the netherlands as a sign of good implementation moreover a number of interviewees mentioned that they are satisfied with the fact that there are numerous agreements protocols and procedures in place and being implemented especially in emergency situations the majority of the interviewees argued that the authorities are responsible for managing issues such as pluvial flooding and that civilians pay for this service via taxes the interviewees also believed that trust in the government is deeply rooted in dutch culture and that dutch citizens do not want to think about such problems too much several interviewees from all stakeholder groups mentioned the dutch quickly shift attention to matters visible for them for example in case of an incident e g a major flood the dutch community tends to come together and help voluntarily to prevent loss of lives or damage to properties the result of the interviews also revealed an awareness gap among the dutch citizens regarding water management an issue that was also highlighted in oecd 2014 this awareness gap combined with high level of trust in the government can hinder the implementation of necessary actions in the prevention phase of an infrequently experienced problem such as pluvial flooding 5 1 2 institutional political context in the kenyan case study given the fundamental changes in the constitution of kenya cok in august 2010 the country s institutional framework took a major turn from a centralized system of administration and governance to a devolved structure of government which cedes power of legislation execution and also revenue collection and expenditure to 47 counties the judiciary power however remained central at the national level with these changes the new constitution introduced two main levels of government national and county in terms of hierarchy the constitution defines these two levels as parallel and does not indicate any superiority for one level over the other government of kenya 2010 article 1 but several articles emphasize the need for consultation collaboration and coordination between the two levels for example article 6 2 defines these levels as distinct and inter dependent but highlights the need for their mutual relations on the basis of consultation and cooperation two main points were elicited from the interviews firstly the county is autonomous but its decisions should not conflict with the national parliament law and in any conflicting case the national law prevails secondly a number of interviewees believed that according to the devolution of power the county government has the final decision making power yet in many cases it is still the national government that takes some of the measures on the ground apart from the cok the interviewees identified inter national level legislation and policy guidelines related to the topic of the cbm including the agreement for the joint trans boundary management of the mara river basin the kenyan law on the management of protected areas the wildlife act the water act 2005 and the forest act at the county level the narok county integrated development plan and the environmental management bill are the main pieces of legislation and for many other aspects the county uses bylaws driven by the national policies and customized to the local issue nevertheless at the time of conducting this research the narok county government was in the process of approving a number of bills that will substitute these bylaws namely the maasai mara management plan the narok county tourism act the environmental management act and the livestock act the vast majority of the interviewees believed that the extent of implementation of rules roles and responsibilities regarding biodiversity conservation and livelihood management in kenya highly depends on the specific issue location and actors involved but overall implementation is not very strict at both local and national levels interviewees often referred to increasing wildlife deterioration and the existence of multiple barriers for sustaining livelihoods to back up their claim they identified several institutional social and political barriers for improved implementation including lack of resources money knowledge and staff especially at the county level conflicting personal and political interests and corruption moreover it was mentioned that strengthening implementation by the county is difficult because the county does not have the judiciary power to enforce the law for example in a poaching incident only the kenya wildlife service kws can arrest and prosecute people if the county rangers want to arrest someone they have to report it to kws the same applies to the issue of illegal logging and the kenya forest service kfs interviewees also highlighted several values norms and traditions of the maasai culture that can positively or negatively influence biodiversity conservation and livelihood management in the mara for example the traditional land ownership model of the maasai was community land ownership instead of individual land ownership preserving this tradition can help stop controversial practices such as fencing which increasingly cause wildlife deaths on the other hand maasai are traditionally pastoralists and they consider the number of livestock they have as an indicator of their wealth therefore overstocking and overgrazing have became prominent issues in the mara region 5 2 power dynamics dimension authority and power there was not a big difference in the perceived level of authority and power among the stakeholders in the two cases the regulatory entities in both cases are the most influential stakeholders in decision making processes they either have direct authority or a mandate for management of water or environment related issues or they participate in co governing the resources with other stakeholders or alternatively provide them with advice or consultation in contrast the majority of the general public and expert advisors in both cases perceived no direct influence on decision making processes or that they only have an indirect influence through participation in elections awareness raising or via communicating with authorities to express their concerns there is however one clear difference between the two cases whereas in the kenya case the roles of stakeholders are perceived to be strongly gendered this was not the case in the dutch case 5 2 1 authority and power in the dutch case study all interviewees from regulatory entities in this case mentioned that they exert influence on decisions related to pluvial flood management by providing advice consultation joining other colleagues or other organizations for decision making or by having direct authority on the decisions because of their job expert advisors who are not part of regulatory entities mainly have an influence by providing advice to the authorities or communicative influence for example by publishing their research findings the majority of the interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public perceived to have little or no influence on decisions related to managing pluvial floods or mentioned that they have an indirect influence via participation in the elections of regional water authorities several participants also mentioned they do not automatically receive information about such decisions however if they are interested they can search for and find this information on the other hand a few interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public gave examples of communicative influence on decisions such as signing a petition writing a letter to the authorities and expressing their opinions on how to manage pluvial floods or campaigning via social and mass media regarding the latter one of the interviewees argued that you can always complain by publishing an article in a newspaper or writing a note on their facebook page public shaming works 5 2 2 authority and power in the kenyan case study all interviewees from the regulatory entities at the county and national levels perceived direct influence on decisions related to biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihood management because of their official mandate according to the cok and a number of interviewees from the local regulatory entities the county government has the strongest influence among all actors nevertheless local chiefs play a vital role in the balance of power between the national and local government they have an explicit influence on daily local decisions and act as a direct link between the community and national authorities they have an advising consulting role towards the national government and relay the decisions and agreements that are made at the national level to the community moreover the church was also identified as one of the most powerful stakeholders a platform which can communicate directly with the authorities and influence public opinion in this regard a spiritual leader from a church said we provide advice and consultation to the authorities even the president sometimes consults the church on different decisions the respondents from the cbm co design group the expert advisors and the general public expressed two ways in which they can have a minimal influence on decisions 1 via altering public opinion rather than policies and decisions and educating community members e g via awareness raising programs or 2 by providing advice to the authorities inside or outside of participatory meetings the rest of the interviewees from these groups stated that they have little or no influence on decisions and they are informed about decisions when these are gazetted or advertised via other channels in this regard one interviewee mentioned our chance to influence the decisions is very limited they the authorities are not ready to listen to just a simple person some of the respondents from the general public also emphasized that at household level the decision making power normally rests with men female members of the communities are less involved in making decisions 5 3 power dynamics dimension access to and control over data both the dutch and the kenyan constitutions explicitly express the right of access to information for the general public nevertheless the interpretation and implementation of this issue differs between the two cases in the dutch case public authorities have explicit deadlines for responding to requests for data and in case of denying access they need to clearly justify their choice in the kenyan case however a rather open interpretation of sensitive or exempt information seems to be used sometimes to deny access to data sharing requests moreover in practice in both cases access to data is often controlled by the organizations or individuals who collect or hold the data 5 3 1 access to and control over data in the dutch case study in line with article 110 of the constitution of the kingdom of the netherlands all dutch government information has to be shared with the public and any information that is not already publicly shared e g via websites can be requested in accordance with the dutch public access to government information act law of 31 october 1991 this law however also allows government organizations to withhold certain information if considered confidential for privacy or security reasons public authorities have explicit deadlines for responding to requests and in case of refusal should provide the applicants with the reasons for their decision the interviewees from the regulatory entities and the expert advisors believed that a lot of data is available about pluvial floods but the general public is not aware of this because the information is mostly stored in internal databases within organizations and thus not immediately available for the public the majority of the remaining interviewees especially those from the general public did not have any experience with accessing data about pluvial floods however the few who did mentioned that some organizations e g the dutch meteorological institute knmi make more data publicly available than others the interviewees identified a wide range of organizations and individuals as qualified to analyze data about pluvial floods including the ministry of infrastructure and the environment rijkswaterstaat the regional water authorities the union of regional water authorities provinces municipalities knmi ngos consultancies scientists and scientific institutes only a few interviewees considered citizens among this group the regional water authorities were identified as the main organization that collects data about pluvial floods at the local level and rijkswaterstaat was identified as the main producer and owner of data at the national level in addition some interviewees believed that municipalities and provinces hardly take measurements themselves and even if they do the measurements are mostly qualitative e g whether or not a sewage overflow occurred not quantitative e g how much sewage water has been released to the surface waters regarding control over data it was mentioned that it is mainly the owner of the data who defines the level of access for others 5 3 2 access to and control over data in the kenyan case study article 35 of the cok 2010 explicitly indicates that every kenyan citizen has the right of access to the information held by the state or by another person if this is required for exercising or protecting any right or fundamental freedom furthermore the state shall publish and publicize any important information affecting the nation with reference to this article the access to information act 2016 and part ix of the county government act 2012 preserve the right of kenyan citizens for requesting access to information held by any government organization including the county government or any unit or department thereof despite these written rules a great majority of the interviewees believed that the level of access to data actually depends on the organization department or individuals who hold the data several interviewees criticized the current limited data sharing practices of the authorities based on their previous experiences and encounters for example a respondent mentioned sometimes they give you the data and sometimes they simply decide not to another one argued that sometimes you will be asked why you need the data in a harsh way they have the fear of use of this information by the community this is due to the fact that certain data and information are deemed sensitive or exempt information and although defined in the legislation the definition is open to interpretation this has resulted in keeping essential information from the public moreover some expert advisors stated that in any case one should not publish data that is not accepted or endorsed by the government otherwise they will advertise against using the data and claim that the data is not good at all all interviewees unanimously believed that the availability of data about biodiversity and livelihoods is not very good the available data was often described as inaccurate unreliable not up to date not well distributed spatially and temporally and inaccessible especially publicly or in a central way furthermore lack of coordination between organizations in terms of collecting and sharing data was identified as another issue it was mentioned that if data exists it is difficult to know who has the data and the organizations who hold the data do not share it with the public and sometimes not even with each other research organizations individual experts scientists ngos and government organizations were identified by the interviewees as the best placed stakeholders for analyzing data on biodiversity and livelihoods however it was mentioned that for some data the analysis requires highly specific expertise that may not even exist among the county rangers on the other hand many interviewees believed that the local people have a very good understanding of biodiversity and livelihoods but literacy and language are barriers that affect their ability to share their knowledge 5 4 participation dimension non participant groups although public participation has been gaining more attention in the dutch case study it is not a fundamental pillar of dutch democracy and not an integral part of current water management practices in contrast public participation is considered a governance principle in the kenyan case study and has a vivid footprint in several pieces of legislation nevertheless examining the main stakeholders who are currently involved in the management of the respective issue in focus of these cbm initiatives revealed that despite the legislative differences the role of the general public in both cases is minimal often limited to electing representatives 5 4 1 non participant groups in the dutch case study the interviewees were asked to identify those stakeholders who they think are currently involved in decision making and policy making processes regarding the management of pluvial floods in the netherlands the identified stakeholders included the major actors involved in water management in the netherlands namely the regional water authorities municipalities provinces rijkswaterstaat ministry of infrastructure and the environment union of regional water authorities unie van waterschappen the association of dutch municipalities vereniging van nederlandse gemeenten moreover the interviewees also identified the rioned foundation an umbrella organization for urban water management and sewerage in the netherlands and the southern agriculture and horticulture organization zlto which is a farmers association with 15 000 members in zeeland noord brabant and zuid gelderland in addition the interviewees also perceived an advising role for research and consulting companies from the private sector in managing pluvial floods the role of the citizens however was mentioned to be limited to electing representatives in the parliamentary provincial municipal or regional water authority elections this is due to the fact that public participation is not a fundamental pillar of dutch democracy there is no mention whatsoever of public participation in the constitution of the kingdom of the netherlands nor in the water act 2010 although citizen participation is gaining more attention in more recent policy guidelines such as the national water plan 2016 2021 fundamentally it is at best as an instrument to improve the current working of representative democracy michels 2006 p 336 5 4 2 non participant groups in the kenyan case study the parliament of kenya was identified as the main body of policy making regarding biodiversity conservation and livelihood management at the national level cabinet secretaries especially those who head the ministries involved in managing biodiversity and livelihoods relevant wings of ministries such as kws kfs kenya water resources management authority wrma the national museums of kenya and the kenya water tower agency were identified as the most relevant actors for the issue in focus of the cbm initiative at the national level furthermore the narok county government was elicited as the most influential stakeholder at the local level local chiefs conservancies and ngos were also deemed relevant stakeholders at the local level despite the devolution of power from the national level to the county government in kenya in 2010 the national level organizations such as kws are still very much involved in conservation activities at the county level public participation has a vivid footprint throughout the cok 2010 and in several other pieces of legislation including the county government act 2012 the public service values and principles act 2015 and more specifically related to the topic of this cbm initiative the environmental management and coordination act 1999 the wildlife conservation and management act 2013 and the agriculture and food authority act 2013 the first article of the constitution portrays public participation as a right for every kenyan and states that all sovereign power belongs to the people of kenya and that they can exercise their power directly or through their elected representatives the constitution also recognizes participation of the kenyan people as a national value and a governance principle and obliges the state to facilitate participation of everyone in governance processes furthermore public participation is also mentioned as a purpose of devolution of government for providing self governance power to the people and to enhance their participation in decision making processes the national and county governments are obliged to facilitate and encourage public participation in the legislative process public finance and also conservation of environmental and natural resources management despite the formal anchoring of participation in these legal frameworks none of the interviewees perceived any involvement of the general public in policy and decision making processes regarding biodiversity conservation and livelihood management this among other things presents a picture of the limited extent of implementation of these legislations despite much emphasis on public participation in the cok and the aforementioned acts kenya still lacks a national act that provides a general framework for how to give effect to the constitutional and legislative requirements in this regard it has been argued that such a framework at the national level is needed to guide the public participation processes at the local level marine 2015 the public participation bill 2016 was prepared to cover this gap however this bill still has not been accepted due to controversies and opposing ideas at the time of conducting this research the county public participation guidelines 2016 was the only available but not legally binding tool to guide this process 5 5 participation dimension communication paradigm although pluvial flooding is a popular conversation topic among the dutch the predominant pattern of communication about this topic is unidirectional from authorities to the citizens citizens only communicate about pluvial flooding with authorities if there is an acute problem or an emergency situation in such situations people would like to receive a quick response and therefore mostly communicate using phone calls similarly in the kenyan case study the authorities mostly communicated about biodiversity conservation and livelihood management unidirectionally and for the purpose of informing citizens 5 5 1 communication paradigm in the dutch case study the safety regions act 2010 sets the legal framework for risk and crisis communication in the netherlands this act divides the country into 25 security regions which are extended local government units with joint safety regulations the management board of a security region is responsible for informing a number of government authorities and personnel as well as the citizens about risks and crises that may affect a specific region although occasional bi directional and interactive patterns of information flow for risk and disaster communication can be found within and between central government authorities the predominant pattern of information flow is unidirectional from authorities to the citizens in addition this act only focuses on such communication at regional level however as kaufmann et al 2016 clarified communication of preparatory and responsive measures for events such as pluvial floods at a smaller scale can highly differ from one location to another the interviewees were asked whether or not they communicate about pluvial flooding with others and to indicate their preferred channels for such communication using apps on smart phones e g whatsapp viber line and communicating via email telephone call or sms or face to face e g daily bilateral discussions with others or participation in meetings were among the most frequent means of communication in this case study interviewees from the regulatory entities and expert advisors indicated that they communicate about this issue mostly for work purposes both internally e g with colleagues and externally with other individuals and organizations e g with residents or regional water authorities interviewees in this case often linked the issue of pluvial flooding with bad weather and intense rainfall incidents the interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public mentioned they often communicate about the issue with other residents in informal settings or after heavy rainfall at the same time a number of interviewees from these groups emphasized that unless there is an actual problem or an emergency situation there is no or too little communication with municipalities and other authorities fig 3 summarizes the preferred channels for communicating based on this figure the most preferred channel for communication was phone call or sms as people prefer to receive a quick response or like someone listen to them 5 5 2 communication paradigm in the kenyan case study there is no article in the cok or other legislation that directly mentions the desired pattern of information flow between different stakeholders for policy and decision making processes however several articles portray a unidirectional communication paradigm as the prescribed pattern of communication from state and county government to the general public the main purpose seems to be informing the public about decisions as an example the county government act 2012 requests county governments to integrate communication in all development activities using telephone and smart phone app calls predominantly whatsapp are by far the two most frequently used means of communication in this case study due to the low average level of literacy among local citizens phone calls are much more common than sending sms different communication channels are used for reaching different target groups for example social media e g facebook is one of the best channels for reaching out to the youth while for elders face to face communication works better moreover radio was indicated as an efficient channel for reaching a large number of people even in remote areas the majority of the interviewees mentioned that they communicate about biodiversity conservation and livelihood management both for work and personal purposes the authorities mainly prefer to communicate with community member face to face while the community members mostly use face to face meetings phone calls and sms whatsapp and email for reaching out to the authorities fig 4 presents the preferred channels for communication as the figure shows using an app on a smartphone predominantly whatsapp and using websites or blogs are respectively the most and least preferred channels for communicating about biodiversity conservation and livelihood management in this case study 5 6 participation dimension methods of communication and participation in both cases decision making about the issue in focus of the cbm initiatives has a top down form and relies heavily on the technical expertise of the regulatory entities and sometimes involves deliberation and negotiation between the stakeholders in charge of managing the issue although several respondents from the expert advisors members of the co design group and the general public in the two case studies perceived to have little or no influence on decision making processes respondents from the kenya case study indicated a much wider range of methods by which they could lobby or communicate their ideas and interests to the authorities and possibly intervene in decision making processes 5 6 1 methods of communication and participation in the dutch case study the interviewees were asked to explain in what ways if any they are involved in managing pluvial floods and how they take part in decision making processes on this issue all interviewees from the regulatory entities mentioned that they are involved in managing pluvial floods via their jobs their involvement spanned from setting policies at the regional water authority or municipal level to decision making at the operational level e g managing the pumps and weirs for preventing floods the examples provided by the interviewees from this group depicted the deliberate and negotiate or technical expertise roles for them in the decision making processes fung 2006 the expert advisors are mostly involved indirectly via providing data and information as well as expressing their expert opinion in meetings with the authorities these data information and expert views may or may not be used by the authorities thus they are mostly involved in decision making processes via explicit data provision and expressing preferences the majority of the interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public had little or no expectation to influence decisions at any level in this regard one of the interviewees mentioned that i don t think i have any influence it is the municipality who makes the decisions if i have a problem i contact the municipality and they decide how to take care of the issue a few interviewees however believed that they have an indirect say in decisions by participating in the elections of the regional water authority elections but they did not consider this as real involvement in making decisions or creating policies 5 6 2 methods of communication and participation in the kenyan case study in the kenyan case study all participants from the regulatory entities perceived they have a direct or indirect say in the decisions because of their technical expertise the expert advisors indicated that they are mostly involved via their jobs and the nature of their involvement was highly dependent on their work this level of involvement ranged from expressing opinions by communicating about their research to deliberation and negotiation with the authorities see fung 2006 many interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public perceived that they are barely or not at all part of decision making processes related to biodiversity conservation and livelihood management some of these interviewees indicated they only get to know about decisions when these are gazetted the other interviewees from the cbm co design group and the general public identified two main methods by which they are involved in decision making processes the first method was expressing preferences in participatory meetings or via membership in community action groups although it is not always possible for everyone or even the community representatives to participate in such meetings because of the location or timing of the meetings those who do participate have the opportunity to express their preferences and even bargain with the authorities for example a local maasai gave a clear example of bargaining power that he had because of his membership in a local water users association when we participate in these meetings we express our opinion and contribute to the discussions for example through appealing to the 2010 constitution and the recent wildlife act we could get them the narok county government to assign more compensation for livestock deaths the second identified method was by communicating with different influential stakeholders bilaterally outside of participatory meetings interviewees highlighted that using this method depends heavily on social or professional links with these stakeholders in this regard one interviewee mentioned if you want to have a good influence you should be present in the political forums or know people who are there 5 7 technology dimension access to technology the issue of access to technology in the two case studies of this research presents a classic north south or developed versus developing country situation there is a drastic difference between the netherlands and kenya in terms of both diffusion and actual use of icts a difference that is amplified by the low level of literacy and required skills for effective use of icts in the kenyan context moreover in terms of ict infrastructure narok county is largely under developed as compared to the national average level 5 7 1 access to technology in the dutch case study at the time of conducting this study with an idi rank 7 itu 2017a and a digital economy and society index desi 4 european commision 2017 the netherlands ranked high in terms of ict development in europe as well as worldwide fulfilling the growing demand for high speed internet access is at the forefront of dutch government policy itu 2017b in 2017 there were 129 9 mobile cellular telephone subscriptions and 40 3 fixed telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in the netherlands moreover 92 2 of households had internet access and almost 90 of households had computers the country also ranked high in terms of actual use of information and communication technologies 90 4 of citizens used the internet dutch citizens also have the required skills to use icts according to the itu 2017a the mean years of schooling in the netherlands is 11 9 years moreover the dutch government aims to make digital literacy a core part of the curriculum of primary and secondary education ministry of economic affairs 2016 5 7 2 access to technology in the kenyan case study mobile phones are the main medium for digital communication in kenya and at the time of conducting this research there were 81 3 postpaid and active prepaid mobile cellular telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants in kenya itu 2017b in contrast only 0 15 of residents had fixed telephone subscriptions less than 15 of households had computers and 22 3 of households had internet access although a large proportion of the population used mobile phones only some of these individuals were actively using the internet world economic forum 2016 the average low level of literacy in kenya is a challenge for developing the required skills for effective use of icts in 2017 the mean years of schooling in this country was only 6 3 years in terms of both access to and the skills to use icts narok county was performing below the national level the strategy for spatial development of ict infrastructure in kenya is very much focused on service provision for population centers for example in 2016 with a geographical coverage of only 17 up to 78 of the kenyans had access to 3g broadband service intelecon 2016 the downside of this strategy is that a large part of the counties including a large proportion of the narok county that has a dispersed population are either under served e g do not have access to 3g broadband or not served at all moreover a recent report by the kenya national bureau of statistics indicates that only 11 of narok county inhabitants have a secondary level of education and 38 of the residents in this county have no formal education ngugi et al 2013 5 8 technology dimension included excluded groups resulting from technological choices in addition to differences in access to technology for different groups within society lack of basic digital skills by a considerable proportion of the population in both cases and a low average level of literacy among kenyans are among the factors that may contribute to exclusion of a part of the population in processes that require using icts 5 8 1 included excluded groups resulting from technological choices in the dutch case study despite a well developed and growing ict infrastructure and availability of affordable mobile cellular and mobile broadband offers itu 2017b at the time of conducting this research the access gap was not yet closed in the netherlands the results of a recent study of 108 000 dutch citizens reveal that the younger population with higher levels of education and income and in some areas males have better access to internet van deursen van dijk 2015 in terms of actual usage according to available statistics a very large proportion of the dutch population is active technology users nevertheless the main gap resulting from the growing digitization of the dutch society seems to exist for those who lack basic digital skills according to the european commision 2017 this is no less than 23 of the dutch population aged 16 74 a thought provoking figure but one that is still much lower than the 44 average for the whole europe 5 8 2 included excluded groups resulting from technological choices in the kenyan case study despite advancements in the ict sector in kenya there is still a big gap in both access and skills to effectively use technology in addition to differences in accessing technology the low level of literacy especially among the older generation and gender discrepancies in access to and use of technology are among contributing factors in creating new forms of inequalities brännström 2012 world wide web foundation 2015 the gap in access and use is more significant in rural areas with dispersed population and can highly affect the ability of community members to take part in public participation processes as an example public participation in the process of formulating a national strategy for wildlife conservation and management in 2017 was only possible by sending a written memorandum via email or expressing oral or written opinions in the structured regional meetings sending a written memorandum via email among other things requires a certain level of literacy computer skills and internet access provided that community members were aware of this consultation in the first place moreover structured meetings at the regional level are normally held at the center of each county which also limits the chance of participation for community members who live in remote areas 6 discussion this section summarizes the most important findings of this study and demonstrates that aside from the fact that the two cbm initiatives in this study have different thematic foci they are operating in fundamentally different social political institutional and technological settings unlike the kenyan case study the dutch case study can be characterized as an institutional environment that currently has little or no envisioned role for public participation and a social context with high trust in and expectations from the government this issue was also highlighted in previous research by wehn et al 2015 where they concluded that flood risk management in the netherlands is considered by the public and by authorities as an issue that requires technical expertise and needs to be handled by the authorities and not by citizens this has resulted in an evident awareness gap and reluctance of citizens to contribute to tasks related to water management oecd 2014 wehn et al 2018 municipalities and regional water authorities are the main stakeholders involved in managing pluvial flooding and the role of community members is mostly limited to electing representatives in the municipality and regional water authority elections nevertheless municipalities and regional water authorities have occasional conflict of priorities and interests especially when it comes to spatial planning the fact that the upcoming environmental planning act combines the water act and the spatial planning act into one coherent piece of legislation shows that the dutch government is aware of this problem and is taking a step towards resolving it although the overall level of availability and access to data was not identified as a prominent issue in the dutch case the regional water authorities collect and store most of the data about pluvial flooding and data sharing with other stakeholders often happens on demand moreover the netherlands ranks high in terms of access to icts and a large proportion of the dutch population is actively using icts and has the required skills to do so the results of our study elicited several contextual factors in the kenyan case study social institutional political and technological circumstances that if not understood well are known to act as major barriers for establishing cbm initiatives in east africa pocock et al 2018 and beyond haklay 2015 tseng penning rowsell 2012 the kenyan case study can be characterized as a relatively new political and institutional climate with contested power over decisions regarding biodiversity conservation and livelihood management despite the constitutional authority and mandates of the narok county government for managing its resources other powerful stakeholders at different levels e g the national government organizations and the local chiefs have a lot of interest in and influence on decision making processes similar to the dutch case the decision making system in this case study is mostly top down however community members are more concerned and conscious about environmental issues and have a much lower level of trust in authorities despite much emphasis on public participation in the constitution of kenya and several pieces of legislation local citizens who are not well connected or cannot take part in participatory meetings are essentially not being heard in terms of different forms of access to icts narok county performs below the national level a problem that among other things is amplified by the national strategy for spatial development of icts and the dispersed distribution of the narok county population furthermore it is evident that there is a lot of sensitivity about publishing certain data and information in this case study as an example publishing live data about the location of wildlife could raise concerns about potential misuse of such data by poachers for locating certain species 7 conclusions in this paper we used the cpi framework a framework for context analysis processes evaluation and impact assessment of cbm initiatives which was developed by gharesifard et al 2019 to systematically analyze the contextual settings during the initiation of two cbm initiatives in the netherlands and kenya within the context of the ground truth 2 0 project a contextual analysis was carried out to depict the existing power dynamics participation paradigm and technological settings in these two case studies based on the findings of this research a number of realistic expectations of what the netherlands cbm grip op water altena and the kenyan cbm maasai mara citizen observatory can achieve are identified and presented in this section in addition a number of recommendations are provided that can be beneficial for the future development and functioning of these two cbm initiatives these insights will help making informed decisions while designing and implementing cbm initiatives and provide valuable inputs for their future up scaling without a sound understanding of the contextual realities in which these cbm initiatives will operate assumptions need to be made in order to understand what can be expected from each cbm initiative moreover there will be no baseline for measuring outcomes and impacts of the initiatives therefore it is highly important that such a baseline analysis be conducted at a very early stage and preferably before the establishment of a cbm initiative we hypothesize that early assessment of the contextual setting in which a cbm initiative will operate and with which it will interact can help establish more sustainable initiatives a hypothesis that requires further examination and verification the dutch case study presents a case of a well established top down water management system a system in which public participation is not embedded in the institutions and the general public has a low level of awareness of little interest in and no direct authority for managing pluvial flooding and essentially expects the authorities to manage this issue one of the roles of the grip op water altena is therefore to raise awareness and build a better understanding of the issue of pluvial flooding among dutch citizens in addition this cbm can help create a more interactive pattern of communication and information sharing among water managers spatial planners and citizens a functionality that can help achieve the desired coordination goal of the upcoming environmental planning act although municipalities and the rivierenland regional water authority are the main stakeholders involved in managing pluvial flooding in this case study involving other stakeholders at higher levels of policy making e g rijkswaterstaat and the province of noord brabant as well as the rioned foundation and zlto is highly recommended for the long term sustainability of this cbm finally although the access to technology gap is almost closed in the netherlands further technological development of this initiative should consider the requirements of interested citizens with limited digital skills the maasai mara citizen observatory has the potential to help create a much needed platform that facilitates information collection and sharing among stakeholders in the mara region to do so it can leverage the existing interest within the county government national government and private sector for improving the availability of spatial and temporal data about biodiversity and livelihoods as well as public interest in accessing information that affects their livelihoods moreover given the institutional provisions for public participation this cbm has the potential to facilitate the process of public participation in decision making and also communication among different actors moreover the identified gap in access to icts in this case study highlights the need for developing technologies that are open source and can be used offline the open data kit odk is an example of such technological solutions a suite of tools that allows data collection and submission to an online server without internet connection or mobile carrier service at the time of data collection nevertheless because of the low average level of digital skills among the users it is recommended that a user manual is developed and training sessions are organized to further familiarize end users with functionalities of the app and the cbm web platform it is also recommended that alternative possibilities for inclusion of those community members who do not use smart phones are further explored e g the possibility of dissemination of selected information via local radio the existing concerns about sharing sensitive data may result in developing specific data collection or sharing policies that restrict access to live raw data for the end users transparency about such a decision is key for building trust among users an issue that is important for the long term success of a cbm therefore it is recommended that such decisions are clearly communicated with the stakeholders moreover based on the results of this research for scaling up the cbm and recruiting more members it is highly recommended to take the local chiefs and churches onboard as these are among the most influential stakeholders and can help attract a large number of community members future research should trace the changes in the baseline contextual settings of the grip op water altena and maasai mara citizen observatory both during and after the lifetime of the ground truth 2 0 project moreover application of the comprehensive framework proposed by gharesifard et al 2019 to fully functional cbms will complement the results of this research by capturing the intrinsic characteristics of the two initiatives while having demonstrated the advantages of conducting an in depth baseline analysis at the initiation of a cbm initiative we also acknowledge that undertaking such a thorough contextual analysis initiatives requires substantial time resources and expertise which may not always be available for all cbm initiatives nevertheless a less comprehensive context mapping that is tailored to available resources and based on a desk research of secondary data sources can still yield valuable insights and is therefore highly recommended declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the research reported in this paper is part of the ground truth 2 0 project
