13620,infrastructural development and advancement have provided several tools for the treatment and management of conventional and emerging pollutants to ensure access to clean water emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment such as antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args possess inherent properties that enables them to evade water treatment processes meanwhile the inability of low budget communities to access clean water have been overemphasized therefore developing new or improving existing tools for the management of arb args contaminated water for low income countries requires the collaboration of all stakeholders including business government and the academia this review highlights and evaluates the current technologies adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration and the prevailing mechanism that can effectively serve this purpose in low income communities this report identified the knowledge gaps inherent in these water treatment technologies and provided plausible systematic approaches to overcome some of these challenges the goal of this appraisal was to provide information and awareness on the need to focus on these appropriate water treatment technologies that are implementable in low budget communities keywords antibiotics resistance genes antibiotic resistant bacteria water treatment coagulation adsorption membrane filtration 1 introduction in low budget communities common pathogens constitute a significant threat to public health thus the emergence of arb args has raised the alert level to be critical 1 due to the lack of appropriate water treatment technology which consequently contributes to the mortality rate in those communities 2 3 in general several classes of pollutants have been effectively managed using conventional water treatment strategies when tied with the advanced oxidation processes aops it has extended the application to the emerging pollutants 4 aops often use as the ultimate disinfection tool to remove residual contaminants that elude primary and secondary treatment though these technologies require sophisticated instrumentations but the developed nations have taken full advantage of these technologies since low budget communities struggle for infrastructural development 5 low cost treatment strategies that involve easy setup and minimal maintenance costs are suggested for water treatment 6 waterborne pathogens for example vibrio cholera are classes of contaminants that can increase in abundance via both cell division and accumulation 7 the traditional challenges associated with pathogen in drinking water is vast escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus salmonella enterica and vibrio cholerae are known causes of gastrointestinal pneumonia intestinal and diarrheal respectively the emergence of multidrug resistant pathogen and their genes has further reduced the efficacy of antibiotics in treating common bacterial infections 8 the resistant of enterococci faecium to aminoglycosides and vancomycin is a major cause of death thus many patients requires intensive care 9 they are unlike conventional pollutants e g heavy metals that can only accumulate 10 11 these pollutants are receiving growing attention especially the arb args and mobile genetic elements mges 12 for example a search on scopus 11 10 2019 with the following keywords removal of pathogen removal of e coli or disinfection of pathogen or sterilization of pathogen produced only 216 published documents fig 1 it was observed that the bulk of these studies were conducted in developed countries and there is a paucity of information on such studies in the developing and under developed countries nearly all water treatment plants wtps built in the last decade utilize chlorine or chlorine containing salt for disinfection 13 14 recently established wtps have incorporated the use of other disinfection processes like uv h2o2 and o3 in addition to chlorine 15 heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the technologies that has extensively been employed for the disinfection of multidrug resistant bacteria and removal of resistance genes these treatment processes can manage approximately all contaminants including arb args and mges 16 the combination of different oxidants uv h2o2 with tio2 increased the rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa disinfection 17 the result obtained for the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria and the subsequent oxidation of the extracellular resistance genes released using nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide coated with bi2o2co3 was promising the nanocomposite exhibit multiple oxidizing species on the catalytic sites 18 some notable shortcomings include incomplete disinfection water and wastewater treatment plants posed threats to the well being of staff and residents 19 irrespective of the successes and failures the required infrastructures and facilities to tackle these emerging pollutants are lacking in the underdeveloped regions of the globe unuabonah et al 20 reported that the lack of centralized water wastewater treatment facilities in low budget communities has contributed to the spread of waterborne diseases to obviate these challenges simple decentralized water treatment procedures e g cesspools septic tank gravity percolation boiling sand filter solar disinfection purification tablets and coagulation flocculation are often practiced 6 21 in these regions of the world an overview of the underlying mechanisms of these technologies that are peculiar to the low income countries showed that they are mainly adsorption coagulation flocculation based and membrane filtration processes they are easier to utilize because it can be operated without specialized expertise and require no sophisticated instrumentation or barrier in technology transfer besides other reports have verified that these technologies are potent in the management of arb args in drinking water 22 however only a few reports are available on the use of adsorption membrane filtration and coagulation flocculation based approach for this purpose premised on this reality the objectives of this review include evaluating the suitability of adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration in the removal of arb args identifying shortcomings associated with each water treatment process and proffer recommendations that addresses these challenges in multiple fronts part of these was achieved by understanding the chemistry of arb args and the responses of arb args to water treatment strategies one of the objectives of this review is to encourage more studies in designing cheap and convenient low cost water treatment processes especially for drinking purposes with prime focus on low budget countries where power shortage impact is mostly a challenge 23 2 arb args contamination routes humans are the major contributors to the inflow of arb args in the ecosystem the human gut serves as a reservoir where the abundance of arb args could increase and mutate in the presence of antibacterial agents 24 25 animals could be exposed to arb args from food intake which may cycle back into the environment via sewage 7 meanwhile half of the world lacks access to primary health care 26 a daring situation in low budget countries a recent report from the middle east by alyamani et al 27 associated the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant bacteria to poor medical health care this is also a strong indication that low budget countries are more vulnerable 27 poor sanitation flood water scarcity climate change and inadequate water storage capacity in low budget countries have increased the risk of water contamination exposing communities to water borne infections nearly all the under developed countries lack water treatment tools 28 extended spectrum beta lactamase was the dominant specie 41 3 within the chadian population 29 and well water borehole hand pumps water points and water reservoir in south dafur sudan were concentrated with pathogenic bacterial 30 developing countries though boast of a significant improvement in access to safer water still have communities which lack access to clean water 31 for example in algeria water storage tanks are seen as a potential source of microbial and fluoride contamination 32 in nigeria ampicillin and tetracycline resistant bacterial were dominant in packaged drinking water 33 e coli samples identified in kenya showed resistance against penicillin cefuroxime erythromycin and tetracycline 34 drinking water from the mafikeng region in south african had abundant args 35 in bangladesh 11 of death among children under the age of 5 is linked to poor drinking water 36 in lieu of the current challenges associated with clean water shortage abubakar 37 suggested that on site water treatment should be an immediate goal for urban and rural communities to improve drinking water 37 source water is a major cause of waterborne infection in low budget communities typical source water for drinking and other domestic uses in low budget districts are groundwater borehole well and surface water stream river fig 2 route of the contamination may be airborne 38 water run off 39 and subsequent discharge into freshwater 40 the findings of oluyege et al 2018 revealed that well water was abundant in multidrug resistant bacteria and the quality of water from selected water treatment plants in nigeria was unsafe for consumption 41 thus devising a low cost option is vital in achieving improved water quality 42 3 antibiotic resistant bacteria and their resistance genes arb are bacteria that have developed resistant against a known class of antibiotics thus rendering a previously active antibiotic futile in the treatment of that infection like many charged positive or negative conventional pollutants the membrane protecting the intracellular component of the microorganism is a charged peptidoglycan 43 gram positive bacteria possess a thicker peptidoglycan layer when compared with gram negative bacteria 44 bacteria can acquire resistance via gene mutation and horizontal gene transfer 45 therefore the antibiotic resistance genes are embedded as specific sequence s in the bacterial dna during cell lysis args are released into the aqueous system along with other nucleic acid molecules lipids and protein 12 the args can survive in the ecosystem or cycle through food chain and consequently posing various health risks 46 in general nucleic acids are negatively charged due to the phosphate groups attached to the purine pyrimidine bases 47 args are stationed within the nucleic acids mostly on the plasmid or chromosome 48 during environmental stress the antibiotic resistance gene may be released into the environment resulting in indirect pollution 49 environmental stressors include antimicrobial agents heat and reactive species another source of secondary contamination is the increase in organic content 50 when a cell dies the natural components of bacteria cells contribute to the total organic content and the organic matter serves as a potential energy source for arb resistance genes are specific nucleotide sequences on the nucleic acids thus resistance genes like the coding genes share similar physicochemical characteristics with nucleic acids unlike other contaminants pathogen contaminations arb args are capable of responding to environmental stress via cell wall recycling or production of enzymes or efflux pumps 51 the ability of arb args to respond to ecological tension enhanced their prevalence in the environment as highlighted in previous studies 52 57 arb is a living organism thus it is capable of characterizing its ecosystem and adapt to changes or different environmental stressors 58 arb can distinguish whether a foreign molecule is an enemy friend or host for example multidrug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of expressing resistance even in the absence of antimicrobial agents 59 in summary arb args should not be managed as the usual traditional contaminants preferably a systematic approach should be employed which will focus on removal rather than cell oxidation in aqueous solution to avoid secondary pollution 60 4 the state of the existing treatment plants currently there are no data on the permissible level of args in water to be discharged or water for drinking recreation or reuse therefore it could be argued that only removal efficiency below detection limits may be considered an efficient treatment strategy the current wtps involve three basic stages primary secondary and tertiary each treatment stage complements the previous to improve the absolute disinfection efficiency of the entire water treatment process though reports have suggested that arb are more susceptible to disinfection in treatment plants than args 61 however many treatment plants still recorded low removal efficiency of arb for example the fate of multidrug resistance e coli in two wastewater treatment plants in norway was monitored by schwermer et al 62 the treatment plants employed biofilm and activated sludge process as its final treatment options and physical and chemical methods sedimentation and precipitation in the initial stages respectively these final treatment options employed did not improve the water quality as it was ineffective in the disinfection of multidrug resistance e coli the former physical and chemical treatment strategies were more effective in the removal of multidrug resistant e coli than the latter biofilm and activated sludge 62 in the treatment of more complex water e g aqueous solution that relies heavily on args stressors like antibiotics nutrients detergents and heavy metals the treatment plant is usually designed to incorporate more unit processes at each stage for example in a swine wastewater treatment plant in china 63 the treatment plant combined biological anaerobic anoxic and oxic pools chemical sedimentation and coagulation and advanced microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis and artificial wetland treatment system respectively though it is expected that each stage should improve the water quality but both the biological treatment and artificial wetland were major setbacks in the treatment plant meanwhile the chemical treatment and membrane system were adequate for the removal of targeted args sul1 sul2 teta tetm tetw 16s rrna genes and inti1 in another swine wastewater treatment plant in china the treatment plant solely depends on the biological anaerobic anoxic oxic treatment for the removal of emerging pollutants 64 the swine wastewater treatment plant could achieve an overall 1 91 and 3 43 log removal for intracellular and extracellular args respectively however the abundance of args increased by an average of 11 an indication that biological treatment should not be employed solely during args removal despite the successes of these sophisticated treatment strategies significant concentration 105 copies ml of args 16s rrna genes and int1l were detected in the final effluent 64 radical assisted disinfection has been employed as the ultimate unit process in water 65 and wastewater treatment plants 66 the fate of arb args was characterized in two wastewater treatment plants in china 67 both treatment plants employed similar unit processes primary physical secondary biological physical chemical and tertiary uv biological and uv treatments were detrimental and insignificant for the removal of args respectively the tet sul qnrd and blatem genes were enriched at the biological section and no noticeable removal was observed at 27 mj cm2 uv dosage 67 however in the sedimentation and coagulation sections no arg enrichment was observed with removal up to 375 6 complete removal of ermb genes was achieved in the treatment plant 67 in most treatment plants the secondary treatment sedimentation coagulation and filtration has proven to be more efficient when compared with primary and oxidation based aops that is treatment plants that utilized sedimentation coagulation and membrane filtration have shown to be better suited for the management of arb and args in general the mechanism at the chemical stage of removal involves bond formation with arb args or destabilization of the soluble arb args which settle out of the solution as flocs or removed by another conventional method co precipitation adsorption decantation membrane system on the other hand can trap arb args due to pore compactness thus a more compact nanofilter is useful in the removal of arb args than microfilter and ultrafilter one of the challenges associated with the aforementioned treatment strategies membrane filtration adsorption and coagulation flocculation is the generation of sludge and commercialization of novel materials currently nearly all studies on sludge treatment have shown contrasting reports some reported that thermophilic conditions favored the removal of args 68 while other reported that increasing temperature has an opposing effect 69 70 in general the shortfalls of current wtps have resulted in post pollution of other waterbodies that receive the treated water 71 aquatic lives 72 and ultimately human 73 5 proposed treatment options in order to improve public health and preserve environmental resources low cost treatment of water and wastewater should be practiced especially in low budget communities 74 75 in lieu of this suggestion low cost point of use water treatment has been employed to improve drinking water qualities 76 this type of water treatment is flexible robust user friendly grid independent and low maintenance that removes water related impurities at the source water and location of demand the performances of adsorption and coagulation flocculation processes relative to aops for the treatment of arb args are summarized in table 1 5 1 coagulation based approach arb args are hydrophilic negatively charged colloids thus coagulation is an appropriate removal strategy coagulation process involves the destabilization of stable soluble molecules ions or particulates usually of size less than approximately 1 10 5 mm subsequent agglomeration and settling of the disturbed ions molecules or particulates occur in the dissolved medium 83 the success of coagulation and flocculation process depends mainly on the following surface charge of pollutants and coagulants coagulant dosage mixing flocs stability and are usually enhanced by prior treatment of solution to exclude suspended particles and the addition of coagulant aids 84 the prevalence of arb args has been associated with water quality also turbidity total nitrogen and water temperature have been associated with quinolone sulfonamide and rifampin resistance genes 85 intracellular and extracellular args are dissolved 86 thus are capable of eluding a less compact filter 87 therefore small size args on plasmids are more robust 88 the small sized arb args could be destabilized by coagulants to form a stable floc coagulation as a water treatment option has been employed to treat turbid 89 and nutrient rich water 90 thus the who has recommended coagulation as one of the low cost water treatment approaches to consider for low income communities 91 hence coagulation is a key option in treatment strategy in the management of arb args in aqueous solution arb args may maintain a dispersed stable state due to the electron cloud resulting from the effective negative net charge therefore the process of coagulation includes 92 1 the compression of the arb args diffuse layers ensuing from suppressing of arb args effective surface charge the electron clouds and the adsorbed water or altering the orientation of water molecules on arb args the surface charge on arb args may be caused by adsorption of ions or ionization 2 the destabilization of the stable arb args in aqueous solution is achieved by the coagulant hydrolysis product and to some extent solution ionic strength this can occur due to bridging or electrostatic mechanism for neutral or negatively and positively charged coagulant respectively however overdosing may cause restabilization fig 3 for example the hydrolysis products of aluminum can form negatively charged polynuclear species causing restabilization of anionic species eq 1 93 1 a l 3 a l o h 2 a l o h 2 a l o h 3 a q a l o h 4 a l o h 5 2 a l o h 6 3 the destabilization of arb args increase its adsorptivity thus transfer arb args to insoluble filtrable product the mechanism of flocculation of arb args is achieved by 1 the primary flocs is formed immediately due to thermal agitation or brownian movement this can be enhanced by quick dispersion of the coagulant i e rapid mixing 2 the subsequent growth of the insoluble arb args filtrable products are achieved via orthokinetic caused by mechanical agitation the mechanism could be precipitation co precipitation or adsorption precipitation refers to the settling of arg args colloids out of aqueous solution co precipitation is the incorporation of arb args colloids into the growing coagulant metal hydroxide and adsorption is the surface complexation of arb args colloids and coagulant metal hydroxide adsorption mechanism is described in the section 5 2 5 1 1 biobased coagulant several classes of coagulants have been used in water treatment among these naturally occurring coagulants have been encouraged due to their eco friendly tendencies however studies are few on the use of biobased coagulants for the removal of arb args grehs et al 94 compared the performance of biobased tannin and non biobased aluminum sulfate coagulants for the removal of arb and args from treated urban wastewater 94 the efficiency of both coagulants was similar 98 3 99 4 and approximately 1 log reduction for arb and args respectively however after storage tannin effluent was characterized by arb regrowth while aluminum sulfate effluent further reduced the abundance of arb and args by 4 6 and 1 4 logs respectively 5 1 2 non biobased coagulant coagulants dose play an essential role in the removal of args the efficiency of two wastewater treatment plant that uses polyaluminum chloride as coagulant were compared 67 the coagulant dosage at plant a was 20 000 kg day and the removal efficiency was 48 2 75 3 and 44 3 for tet sul and bla genes respectively plant b utilized less coagulant dosage 7493 kg day and it was effective 75 7 against tet genes however sul and bla genes increased in abundance at 35 6 and 152 respectively iron based coagulants were employed for the removal of sul and tet genes and intl1 from wastewater treatment plants 95 their results showed that fe species played a crucial role in the removal of args the coagulants fecl3 and polyferric compounds could achieve the removal of log 0 5 to 3 1 other inherent pollutions like dissolved nutrients and cod were effectively treated fecl3 could form a stable floc with arb args and mges 96 therefore the clean water is separated by simple sedimentation in the presence of fe3 as coagulant species the removal efficiency was 3 29 2 02 3 42 and 3 05 logs for teta sul1 sul2 and intl1 respectively the authors concluded that the effectiveness of the coagulant could be attributed to the electrostatic force of attraction between the positively charged fe3 and negatively charged args phosphate base for example guanine can attach to fe and al ions at phosphate and benzene ring fig 4 in general understanding the mechanism for the removal of arb args from the aqueous system is essential in the design of appropriate technology the physicochemical parameter of water to be treated may help predict the unit processes needed for effective treatment the isoelectric point and point zero charges of coagulants which correspond with the external surface and total charge respectively 97 would be useful in predicting the mechanism of the removal of arb args initial solution ph may also influence the exclusion of arb args due to protonation and deprotonation the isoelectric point of arb args has been measured to be within the range of 2 5 98 100 hence coagulant could be fabricated to suit the solution ph so that removal of arb args can proceed via electrostatic attraction 5 2 adsorption based approach adsorption is the uptake of dissolved fluids molecule or ions on the surface of a solid adsorbent the process includes the removal of the fluids from solution and excision of solvent from the solid adsorbent due to hydrolysis and bonding of the fluids onto the solid adsorbent the bond is ensuing from chemisorption or physisorption or ion exchange or surface precipitation or a combination of these mechanism 101 the efficiency of adsorption may be attributed to the adsorbent specific surface area charge volume and pore sizes as well as adsorbate ionic charge 102 for example opposite charged adsorbents and adsorbates can attract via electrostatic force of attraction and adsorbate can intercalate into the lattice of an adsorbent as a guest ion similarly ionic strength and ph influence solute mobility competing ions strive and block reactive sites and temperature impact on system adsorption enthalpy 103 adsorption as a water treatment option has been explored over the years and experimental results have been translated into field technology 104 adsorption process is one of the basic unit processes to achieve cleaner water still few studies have been reported on the use of adsorption based methods as sole technology for the remediation of arb args the adsorbent used in water treatment may be organic or inorganic based low cost and non toxic adsorbent are usually encouraged due to economic and environmental impact 105 sometimes adsorbents are modified to improve the inherent physicochemical characteristic or to impact specific functionality 106 a review of the adsorbents that have been investigated for arg removal from water and wastewater are presented below under the biobased and non biobased classification also the tyndall effect resulting from solution turbidity which has been associated with impacting negatively on light and reactive radical induced disinfection do not impede the rate of adsorption when compared with aops 107 5 2 1 biobased adsorbent egg shell an abundant agricultural waste rich in calcium has been evaluated as an effective adsorbent for the removal of several classes of contaminants the functionalization of the eggshell has successfully extended its applicability thus the adsorption capacity modification with sulfate containing groups improved the adsorption capacity towards arb args 108 the adsorption capacity of unmodified eggshell and sulfate modified eggshell was 2 38 107 and 1 39 109 cfu g respectively in the batch experiment the sulfate modified eggshell could altogether remove gentamicin resistant e coli and various classes of args tetb tetm ermb blashv and ampc in leachate the improved adsorption capacity of sulfate modified eggshell was attributed to the structural changes within the lattice of the adsorbent i e increased specific surface area mesopore volume and mesopore diameter biochar has been employed as adsorbent for water and wastewater treatment but studies are limited to its use for arb args management few of the available studies focused on the removal of arb args from soil 109 111 and plant ye et al 2016 gao et al 112 described the performance of anti methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus modified biochar for the removal of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus the modified biochar was active for the complete removal of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus due to the antigen antibody interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 112 thus the modified biochar completely removed methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus at an initial concentration of 4 3 105 cfu ml the functional groups carboxylic amine and carboxyl contained within the matrix of activated sludge makes it a valuable biobased adsorbent 113 the uptake of pollutants by activated sludge has been associated with bonding with these functional groups 114 hrenovic et al 79 characterized the wastewater effluent after treatment with activated sludge about 99 carbapenem resistant bacteria and other contaminants e g nutrients were effectively removed increasing the contact time enhanced the removal efficiency of carbapenem resistant bacteria clay as an adsorbent has received considerable attention due to non toxicity abundance surface area and ease of modification 20 thus clay has been incorporated into biobased material as an effective adsorbent for water purification in a recent study ugwuja et al 115 reported the removal of multidrug and multimetal resistant e coli collected from electronic wastewater using third generation hybrid carica papaya seeds kaolinite modified with zn cu nanocomposites in a fixed bed system adsorption of multidrug multimetal resistant bacteria proceeded via electrostatic attraction to the positively charged surface al oh of the hybrid nanocomposite and the negative end of the bacteria po4 3 and coo 115 though biobased sorbents are promising materials for the removal of arb args however when leached the intrinsic chemical constituents of biobased sorbent serve as nutrients for arb 116 further studies have shown that leached nutrients may enhance arb reactivation and subsequent regrowth 116 in addition to leached nutrients adsorbent toxicity towards arb may result in cell lysis the lysed cell may release args resulting in secondary pollution 117 therefore in addition to adsorption capacity adsorbent stability is also vital when the target pollutant is arb 5 2 2 non biobased adsorbent studies on the adsorption of arb args using non biobased adsorbent are rare therefore we will include the contribution of the adsorption using non biobased adsorbent in the subsequent section under coagulation the potential of graphene oxide as an effective adsorbent against traditional contaminants has been described by many authors due to high surface area and light responses 118 119 in the fight against the menace of args graphene oxide is efficient in the binding of args and can catalyze the degradation of resistomes 120 similarly graphene oxide inhibits the propagation of args 121 yu et al 122 reported the adsorption performance of graphene oxide nanosheet for the removal of cyclic and double stranded args 122 graphene oxide showed high adsorption capacity towards args teta sul2 ermb ampc ionic strength ionic interference args molecular structure and ph influenced the removal efficiency of args in the aqueous system acidic neutral ph 5 7 na and mg2 were beneficial for the uptake of targeted args the adsorption mechanism was described as the binding of dna nucleosides with conjugates π region sites and oxygen containing groups in the graphene oxide tap water containing free dna harboring gyrb was sequestered using ceo2 adsorbent the adsorption of the free dna was attributed to the electrostatic attraction between the hydrolyzed ce oh 2 and the negatively charged free dna backbone 123 sulfidated nanosized zero valent iron s nzvi was synthesized via the reduction of iron sulfate for the removal of args the adsorbent s nzvi simultaneously remove and inhibit args regeneration 124 5 3 membrane filtration membrane filtration relies on the exclusion of pollutants as contaminated solution pass through a permeable filter though membrane filtration is a mechanical process the process can be altered to involve a chemical process 125 the compactness and composition of the filter and gravity control a substantial rate of membrane filtration the process is classified by the nominal pore size of the permeable membrane typically the pore size of microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are 0 05 10 μm 0 001 0 05 μm 2 0 and 0 5 respectively depending on the configuration the membrane filtration configuration can be cross flow or dead end 126 the dead end system is designed to remove pollutants by sieving as the feed flows through the membrane filter the cross flow setup incorporates filtration and adsorption desorption mechanism as the feed flows over the membrane the permeate is collected via adsorption and desorption fig 5 the design of a low cost membrane filter is currently ongoing 127 128 meanwhile an affordable membrane filter is presently commercialized https www vestergaard com lifestraw family 2 0 polyvinylidene fluoride a common ultrafiltration membrane filter was functionalized with tio2 for the removal of args 88 the more compact polyvinylidene fluoride tio2 excluded more bacterial communities and args than the unfunctionalized polyvinylidene from the permeate however unretained resistomes of size 0 1 2 μm larger than the pore of the ultrafilter could exit the filter due to resistomes deformation as a result of resistomes size and hydraulic pressure 1 4 bar the pore size of the membrane filter is one of the most critical factors during the exclusion of resistomes 129 thus membrane of size 1 kda molecular weight cut off mwco were effective in the removal of cell free dna harboring args and removal efficiency 99 was achieved 130 membrane filter of size 5000 da was required to achieve 99 8 retention for a more soluble free dna fragment whereas 20 000 da membrane filter size was necessary to obtain a similar result besides the charge on filter constituent can also play a vital role negatively charged membrane filter showed a lower exclusion rate for the removal of extracellular free dna and args when compared with neutral and positively charged filters due to columbic force 131 5 4 shortcoming and headway laboratory investigation on the management of arb args as emerging contaminants have been extensively studied using aops however translating laboratory results in field technology still lies out of reach 132 thus switching attention to other simple low cost treatment should be encouraged despite that aops may be less effective 133 when compared with secondary water wastewater treatment options in the removal of arb args from contamination bound aqueous system majority of studies still focused on the aops as the ultimate treatment option for example recent studies revealed that the abundance of args in drinking water increased and unchanged after uv and chlorination disinfection respectively 134 aops did not remove args mcr 1 and blandm 1 that confer resistance to colistins and carbapenems in drinking water treatment plant 135 in the treatment of arb args in aqueous systems using aops the common challenge encountered includes incomplete removal and subsequent regrowth or reactivation of arb args 136 137 for example biological water wastewater treatment have been reported to be ineffective in the removal of args in aqueous system 138 it could be argued that this challenge is more pronounced when radical dependent aop is applied for example asides the need for adequate infrastructure and technology to implement and operate radical based aops 139 during chlorination intracellular and extracellular args are released into the water system due to bacteria cell leakage also varying temperatures due to photon source may propagate args and the presence of nh4 n a typical water nutrient may protect the args proliferation in the aqueous systems 49 thus water physicochemical properties can make arb args more challenging pollutants during aops similarly elevated turbidity and high chemical oxygen demand cod is an indication of the presence of bacteria 140 total phosphorous has strong correlation with args 141 these are the inherent characteristics of polluted water 142 turbidity and cod impact negatively on light and reactive radical induced bacteria disinfection 143 moreso light induced disinfection generates heat energy which can increase the local temperature during treatment a recent study has also shown that increasing temperature favors arb diversity and abundance 70 therefore due to inadequate infrastructures common among low income nations and other challenges peculiar with aops it is imperative to implement water treatment options that do not include sophisticated technologies the current state of the art suggests that our proposed treatment methods adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration also present some interesting challenges that needs further examination some apparent shortcomings that is associated on a pilot studies are material performance and removal capacity selectivity recovery and regeneration treated water acceptability sludge treatment and the commercialization of novel adsorbent the adsorbent coagulant membrane performance is related to the overall success of the material in expunging targeted arb args the selectivity is interrelated with the affinity of the adsorbent coagulant membrane towards the targeted resistomes in addition to the exclusion of organic and inorganic impurities water to be used for drinking and cooking purposes should contain essential calcium and minor nutrient molybdenum necessary for complete body function thus adsorbent coagulant membrane selectivity is crucial removal capacity is a factor that is closely controlled by adsorbent coagulant membrane performance therefore depending on adsorbent coagulant membrane physicochemical properties an adsorbent coagulant membrane performance may be linked with the pore volume and size surface area and orientation roughness amorphous and surface functionality flocs size and stability compactness and exclusion rate in the design of an adsorbent coagulant membrane the functional group can be engineered to impact and improve selectivity besides treated water for drinking should be characterized of ph close to neutral though several studies have fabricated materials for water purification however final water ph would incur additional costs to adjust the ph this is a particular shortcoming with coagulation process the successive release of h during metal hydrolysis prior to flocculation may significantly alters the solution final ph similar to other impurities toxic oxoanions borate arsenite and nitrate major nutrients iodine and fluoride and minor nutrients selenium and molybdenum arb args are negatively charged thus important nutrients may be excluded from treated water which may result in major health risk so far nearly all studies on the removal of arb args has ignored this important process parameter in the design of adsorbent coagulant membrane filter and subsequent pilot testing the presence of carbon and nitrogen in natural and organic coagulant have been reported to induce arb regrowth and args activation 94 improper waste management has great environmental implications which ultimately act as resistomes stressors thus it is a major contribution to the current menace of arb args in the ecosystem therefore special emphasis should be focused on the resulting sludge generated from the proposed water treatment strategies current knowledge implored that resistomes in sludge are robust thus more studies is required in this field in addition commercialization of novel adsorbent coagulants filter is another potential hurdle that needs to be addressed in most of the studies reported so far authors have not been explicit in detailing the reaction mechanism which governs the process for example in the study of ye et al 108 the process was characterized via monolayer and physisorption ionic strength and ph affect the reaction the optimum condition was achieved at ph 7 5 the authors however did not provide a detailed account for this observation 5 5 expunging antibiotics from water the significant stress on the propagation of resistomes in the environment is the indiscriminate use and disposal of antibiotics 144 the exponential growth of arb args is sustained by the unlimited influx of various classes of antibiotics in disturbing concentration into the water and wastewater 145 thus bacteria may acquire resistant to previously potent therapeutic bacteria agent due to their continuous interaction with the antibiotics therefore reducing the number of antibiotics that are released as waste or expunging existing antibiotics from the environment especially in water and wastewater contamination is a viable method to reduce the emergence of bacteria strains with multiple antibiotic resistant and subsequently reduce the dissemination of args 146 some promising technologies that have been employed for the removal of antibiotics include constructed wetland adsorption advanced oxidation filtration flocculation and coagulation biological and high temperature compositing the use of unique technology for the removal of antibiotics has shown promising efficiency however the combination of different strategies has tremendously improved application and result 147 for instance during the photocatalytic oxidation of ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin norfloxacin flumequine and 1 2 fluorophenyl piperazine using tio2 in the presence of uv and visible light the lc ms results showed that antibacterial agents are not entirely mineralized instead transformed into stable organic compound 148 a recent study has also reported incomplete mineralization of ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole using solar active clay tio2 composite 149 therefore a hybrid strategy is employed to improve the removal of the antimicrobial agent from aqueous solution a common practice is the use of photocatalyst with high affinity and enhanced adsorption capacity for antibiotics zeolite was used as a support for the tio2 for the removal and mineralization oxytetracycline from aqueous solution at neutral ph at optimum condition the adsorption capacity of the composite to remove oxytetracycline was 1497 mg g and the mineralization efficiency measured as total organic carbon improved as the weight of tio2 increased in the composite 150 the photodegradation of retained antibiotics on the surface of a membrane filter has also been explored as a hybrid antibiotic removal strategy polysulfone was fused with acidified graphite carbon nitride and dopamine to form a reactive membrane for the removal and degradation of ciprofloxacin 151 the removal efficiency of ciprofloxacin using adsorption and filtration technologies singly was 21 6 and 54 2 respectively however when combined with photocatalysis the removal efficiency improved to 99 4 the increase in removal efficiency was attributed to oh and o 2 the required reactive oxygen species for the degradation of antibiotics during combined technologies membrane filtration and reactive species may also be initiated using the photo fenton process the photo fenton degradation of sulfadiazine was studied using α feooh as fenton catalyst in the presence of uv light 152 the presence of uv and α feooh as fenton catalyst caused a drastic increased in the removal of sulfadiazine from 4 to 99 another interesting study reported that large and stable flocs 264 685 μm of sulfamethazine could be rejected on ceramic filter membrane 153 the removal mechanism was preceded by the in situ generation of oh and s o 4 initiated by common groundwater ion fe2 in the presence of peroxymonosulfate this implied that reactive species is vital in achieving complete antibiotics removal from aqueous system 6 conclusion and future recommendation arb args management if not properly designed may result in secondary pollution several authors have reported that water devoid of nutrients were detrimental to the survival of args unlike aop adsorption coagulation and membrane systems do not release args from arb besides nutrient and other physicochemical water properties e g turbidity cod organic load nutrient of source water are also treated thus improving the organoleptic properties of the final water effluent hence adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration can be a powerful tool for the eradication of arb args in drinking water especially for low budget communities therefore engineering material that is cheap and non toxic which can take advantage of the surface chemistry of arb args while incorporating a large specific surface area for effective sorption thus forming a stable floc or uptake or exclusion of arb args from aqueous system this could be a major lifeline for infrastructure deficient communities the current state of art for the treatment of emerging pollutants in the developed countries is achieving some of the set objectives however the technology is still sophisticated for low budget communities due to inadequate infrastructures therefore low cost water treatment options should be developed to cater to the urgent needs notably water for household purposes to meet the sustainable development goal for water needs in underdeveloped and developing regions to achieve these objectives there is need to focus on the following 1 encouragement of research projects that focuses on access to clean water in low budget communities through funding and supervision this type of project should be operational with or without electricity 2 provision of information regarding the permissible level of args in environmental samples this is important in rating the success failure of to be engineered materials 3 public awareness on the need for point of use water treatment strategy before consumption this is vital in improving public health and reducing the need for antibiotics research communities are encouraged to design projects that will adhere to the following 1 the use of cheap and ecofriendly materials as coagulants sorbents and membrane filters 2 prioritize the use of crude instrumentation that should be independent of the use of electricity and account for limitations where necessary 3 the need for effective feedback mechanisms on the success failures and challenges associated with the treatment methods declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

13620,infrastructural development and advancement have provided several tools for the treatment and management of conventional and emerging pollutants to ensure access to clean water emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment such as antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args possess inherent properties that enables them to evade water treatment processes meanwhile the inability of low budget communities to access clean water have been overemphasized therefore developing new or improving existing tools for the management of arb args contaminated water for low income countries requires the collaboration of all stakeholders including business government and the academia this review highlights and evaluates the current technologies adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration and the prevailing mechanism that can effectively serve this purpose in low income communities this report identified the knowledge gaps inherent in these water treatment technologies and provided plausible systematic approaches to overcome some of these challenges the goal of this appraisal was to provide information and awareness on the need to focus on these appropriate water treatment technologies that are implementable in low budget communities keywords antibiotics resistance genes antibiotic resistant bacteria water treatment coagulation adsorption membrane filtration 1 introduction in low budget communities common pathogens constitute a significant threat to public health thus the emergence of arb args has raised the alert level to be critical 1 due to the lack of appropriate water treatment technology which consequently contributes to the mortality rate in those communities 2 3 in general several classes of pollutants have been effectively managed using conventional water treatment strategies when tied with the advanced oxidation processes aops it has extended the application to the emerging pollutants 4 aops often use as the ultimate disinfection tool to remove residual contaminants that elude primary and secondary treatment though these technologies require sophisticated instrumentations but the developed nations have taken full advantage of these technologies since low budget communities struggle for infrastructural development 5 low cost treatment strategies that involve easy setup and minimal maintenance costs are suggested for water treatment 6 waterborne pathogens for example vibrio cholera are classes of contaminants that can increase in abundance via both cell division and accumulation 7 the traditional challenges associated with pathogen in drinking water is vast escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus salmonella enterica and vibrio cholerae are known causes of gastrointestinal pneumonia intestinal and diarrheal respectively the emergence of multidrug resistant pathogen and their genes has further reduced the efficacy of antibiotics in treating common bacterial infections 8 the resistant of enterococci faecium to aminoglycosides and vancomycin is a major cause of death thus many patients requires intensive care 9 they are unlike conventional pollutants e g heavy metals that can only accumulate 10 11 these pollutants are receiving growing attention especially the arb args and mobile genetic elements mges 12 for example a search on scopus 11 10 2019 with the following keywords removal of pathogen removal of e coli or disinfection of pathogen or sterilization of pathogen produced only 216 published documents fig 1 it was observed that the bulk of these studies were conducted in developed countries and there is a paucity of information on such studies in the developing and under developed countries nearly all water treatment plants wtps built in the last decade utilize chlorine or chlorine containing salt for disinfection 13 14 recently established wtps have incorporated the use of other disinfection processes like uv h2o2 and o3 in addition to chlorine 15 heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the technologies that has extensively been employed for the disinfection of multidrug resistant bacteria and removal of resistance genes these treatment processes can manage approximately all contaminants including arb args and mges 16 the combination of different oxidants uv h2o2 with tio2 increased the rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa disinfection 17 the result obtained for the inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria and the subsequent oxidation of the extracellular resistance genes released using nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide coated with bi2o2co3 was promising the nanocomposite exhibit multiple oxidizing species on the catalytic sites 18 some notable shortcomings include incomplete disinfection water and wastewater treatment plants posed threats to the well being of staff and residents 19 irrespective of the successes and failures the required infrastructures and facilities to tackle these emerging pollutants are lacking in the underdeveloped regions of the globe unuabonah et al 20 reported that the lack of centralized water wastewater treatment facilities in low budget communities has contributed to the spread of waterborne diseases to obviate these challenges simple decentralized water treatment procedures e g cesspools septic tank gravity percolation boiling sand filter solar disinfection purification tablets and coagulation flocculation are often practiced 6 21 in these regions of the world an overview of the underlying mechanisms of these technologies that are peculiar to the low income countries showed that they are mainly adsorption coagulation flocculation based and membrane filtration processes they are easier to utilize because it can be operated without specialized expertise and require no sophisticated instrumentation or barrier in technology transfer besides other reports have verified that these technologies are potent in the management of arb args in drinking water 22 however only a few reports are available on the use of adsorption membrane filtration and coagulation flocculation based approach for this purpose premised on this reality the objectives of this review include evaluating the suitability of adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration in the removal of arb args identifying shortcomings associated with each water treatment process and proffer recommendations that addresses these challenges in multiple fronts part of these was achieved by understanding the chemistry of arb args and the responses of arb args to water treatment strategies one of the objectives of this review is to encourage more studies in designing cheap and convenient low cost water treatment processes especially for drinking purposes with prime focus on low budget countries where power shortage impact is mostly a challenge 23 2 arb args contamination routes humans are the major contributors to the inflow of arb args in the ecosystem the human gut serves as a reservoir where the abundance of arb args could increase and mutate in the presence of antibacterial agents 24 25 animals could be exposed to arb args from food intake which may cycle back into the environment via sewage 7 meanwhile half of the world lacks access to primary health care 26 a daring situation in low budget countries a recent report from the middle east by alyamani et al 27 associated the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant bacteria to poor medical health care this is also a strong indication that low budget countries are more vulnerable 27 poor sanitation flood water scarcity climate change and inadequate water storage capacity in low budget countries have increased the risk of water contamination exposing communities to water borne infections nearly all the under developed countries lack water treatment tools 28 extended spectrum beta lactamase was the dominant specie 41 3 within the chadian population 29 and well water borehole hand pumps water points and water reservoir in south dafur sudan were concentrated with pathogenic bacterial 30 developing countries though boast of a significant improvement in access to safer water still have communities which lack access to clean water 31 for example in algeria water storage tanks are seen as a potential source of microbial and fluoride contamination 32 in nigeria ampicillin and tetracycline resistant bacterial were dominant in packaged drinking water 33 e coli samples identified in kenya showed resistance against penicillin cefuroxime erythromycin and tetracycline 34 drinking water from the mafikeng region in south african had abundant args 35 in bangladesh 11 of death among children under the age of 5 is linked to poor drinking water 36 in lieu of the current challenges associated with clean water shortage abubakar 37 suggested that on site water treatment should be an immediate goal for urban and rural communities to improve drinking water 37 source water is a major cause of waterborne infection in low budget communities typical source water for drinking and other domestic uses in low budget districts are groundwater borehole well and surface water stream river fig 2 route of the contamination may be airborne 38 water run off 39 and subsequent discharge into freshwater 40 the findings of oluyege et al 2018 revealed that well water was abundant in multidrug resistant bacteria and the quality of water from selected water treatment plants in nigeria was unsafe for consumption 41 thus devising a low cost option is vital in achieving improved water quality 42 3 antibiotic resistant bacteria and their resistance genes arb are bacteria that have developed resistant against a known class of antibiotics thus rendering a previously active antibiotic futile in the treatment of that infection like many charged positive or negative conventional pollutants the membrane protecting the intracellular component of the microorganism is a charged peptidoglycan 43 gram positive bacteria possess a thicker peptidoglycan layer when compared with gram negative bacteria 44 bacteria can acquire resistance via gene mutation and horizontal gene transfer 45 therefore the antibiotic resistance genes are embedded as specific sequence s in the bacterial dna during cell lysis args are released into the aqueous system along with other nucleic acid molecules lipids and protein 12 the args can survive in the ecosystem or cycle through food chain and consequently posing various health risks 46 in general nucleic acids are negatively charged due to the phosphate groups attached to the purine pyrimidine bases 47 args are stationed within the nucleic acids mostly on the plasmid or chromosome 48 during environmental stress the antibiotic resistance gene may be released into the environment resulting in indirect pollution 49 environmental stressors include antimicrobial agents heat and reactive species another source of secondary contamination is the increase in organic content 50 when a cell dies the natural components of bacteria cells contribute to the total organic content and the organic matter serves as a potential energy source for arb resistance genes are specific nucleotide sequences on the nucleic acids thus resistance genes like the coding genes share similar physicochemical characteristics with nucleic acids unlike other contaminants pathogen contaminations arb args are capable of responding to environmental stress via cell wall recycling or production of enzymes or efflux pumps 51 the ability of arb args to respond to ecological tension enhanced their prevalence in the environment as highlighted in previous studies 52 57 arb is a living organism thus it is capable of characterizing its ecosystem and adapt to changes or different environmental stressors 58 arb can distinguish whether a foreign molecule is an enemy friend or host for example multidrug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of expressing resistance even in the absence of antimicrobial agents 59 in summary arb args should not be managed as the usual traditional contaminants preferably a systematic approach should be employed which will focus on removal rather than cell oxidation in aqueous solution to avoid secondary pollution 60 4 the state of the existing treatment plants currently there are no data on the permissible level of args in water to be discharged or water for drinking recreation or reuse therefore it could be argued that only removal efficiency below detection limits may be considered an efficient treatment strategy the current wtps involve three basic stages primary secondary and tertiary each treatment stage complements the previous to improve the absolute disinfection efficiency of the entire water treatment process though reports have suggested that arb are more susceptible to disinfection in treatment plants than args 61 however many treatment plants still recorded low removal efficiency of arb for example the fate of multidrug resistance e coli in two wastewater treatment plants in norway was monitored by schwermer et al 62 the treatment plants employed biofilm and activated sludge process as its final treatment options and physical and chemical methods sedimentation and precipitation in the initial stages respectively these final treatment options employed did not improve the water quality as it was ineffective in the disinfection of multidrug resistance e coli the former physical and chemical treatment strategies were more effective in the removal of multidrug resistant e coli than the latter biofilm and activated sludge 62 in the treatment of more complex water e g aqueous solution that relies heavily on args stressors like antibiotics nutrients detergents and heavy metals the treatment plant is usually designed to incorporate more unit processes at each stage for example in a swine wastewater treatment plant in china 63 the treatment plant combined biological anaerobic anoxic and oxic pools chemical sedimentation and coagulation and advanced microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis and artificial wetland treatment system respectively though it is expected that each stage should improve the water quality but both the biological treatment and artificial wetland were major setbacks in the treatment plant meanwhile the chemical treatment and membrane system were adequate for the removal of targeted args sul1 sul2 teta tetm tetw 16s rrna genes and inti1 in another swine wastewater treatment plant in china the treatment plant solely depends on the biological anaerobic anoxic oxic treatment for the removal of emerging pollutants 64 the swine wastewater treatment plant could achieve an overall 1 91 and 3 43 log removal for intracellular and extracellular args respectively however the abundance of args increased by an average of 11 an indication that biological treatment should not be employed solely during args removal despite the successes of these sophisticated treatment strategies significant concentration 105 copies ml of args 16s rrna genes and int1l were detected in the final effluent 64 radical assisted disinfection has been employed as the ultimate unit process in water 65 and wastewater treatment plants 66 the fate of arb args was characterized in two wastewater treatment plants in china 67 both treatment plants employed similar unit processes primary physical secondary biological physical chemical and tertiary uv biological and uv treatments were detrimental and insignificant for the removal of args respectively the tet sul qnrd and blatem genes were enriched at the biological section and no noticeable removal was observed at 27 mj cm2 uv dosage 67 however in the sedimentation and coagulation sections no arg enrichment was observed with removal up to 375 6 complete removal of ermb genes was achieved in the treatment plant 67 in most treatment plants the secondary treatment sedimentation coagulation and filtration has proven to be more efficient when compared with primary and oxidation based aops that is treatment plants that utilized sedimentation coagulation and membrane filtration have shown to be better suited for the management of arb and args in general the mechanism at the chemical stage of removal involves bond formation with arb args or destabilization of the soluble arb args which settle out of the solution as flocs or removed by another conventional method co precipitation adsorption decantation membrane system on the other hand can trap arb args due to pore compactness thus a more compact nanofilter is useful in the removal of arb args than microfilter and ultrafilter one of the challenges associated with the aforementioned treatment strategies membrane filtration adsorption and coagulation flocculation is the generation of sludge and commercialization of novel materials currently nearly all studies on sludge treatment have shown contrasting reports some reported that thermophilic conditions favored the removal of args 68 while other reported that increasing temperature has an opposing effect 69 70 in general the shortfalls of current wtps have resulted in post pollution of other waterbodies that receive the treated water 71 aquatic lives 72 and ultimately human 73 5 proposed treatment options in order to improve public health and preserve environmental resources low cost treatment of water and wastewater should be practiced especially in low budget communities 74 75 in lieu of this suggestion low cost point of use water treatment has been employed to improve drinking water qualities 76 this type of water treatment is flexible robust user friendly grid independent and low maintenance that removes water related impurities at the source water and location of demand the performances of adsorption and coagulation flocculation processes relative to aops for the treatment of arb args are summarized in table 1 5 1 coagulation based approach arb args are hydrophilic negatively charged colloids thus coagulation is an appropriate removal strategy coagulation process involves the destabilization of stable soluble molecules ions or particulates usually of size less than approximately 1 10 5 mm subsequent agglomeration and settling of the disturbed ions molecules or particulates occur in the dissolved medium 83 the success of coagulation and flocculation process depends mainly on the following surface charge of pollutants and coagulants coagulant dosage mixing flocs stability and are usually enhanced by prior treatment of solution to exclude suspended particles and the addition of coagulant aids 84 the prevalence of arb args has been associated with water quality also turbidity total nitrogen and water temperature have been associated with quinolone sulfonamide and rifampin resistance genes 85 intracellular and extracellular args are dissolved 86 thus are capable of eluding a less compact filter 87 therefore small size args on plasmids are more robust 88 the small sized arb args could be destabilized by coagulants to form a stable floc coagulation as a water treatment option has been employed to treat turbid 89 and nutrient rich water 90 thus the who has recommended coagulation as one of the low cost water treatment approaches to consider for low income communities 91 hence coagulation is a key option in treatment strategy in the management of arb args in aqueous solution arb args may maintain a dispersed stable state due to the electron cloud resulting from the effective negative net charge therefore the process of coagulation includes 92 1 the compression of the arb args diffuse layers ensuing from suppressing of arb args effective surface charge the electron clouds and the adsorbed water or altering the orientation of water molecules on arb args the surface charge on arb args may be caused by adsorption of ions or ionization 2 the destabilization of the stable arb args in aqueous solution is achieved by the coagulant hydrolysis product and to some extent solution ionic strength this can occur due to bridging or electrostatic mechanism for neutral or negatively and positively charged coagulant respectively however overdosing may cause restabilization fig 3 for example the hydrolysis products of aluminum can form negatively charged polynuclear species causing restabilization of anionic species eq 1 93 1 a l 3 a l o h 2 a l o h 2 a l o h 3 a q a l o h 4 a l o h 5 2 a l o h 6 3 the destabilization of arb args increase its adsorptivity thus transfer arb args to insoluble filtrable product the mechanism of flocculation of arb args is achieved by 1 the primary flocs is formed immediately due to thermal agitation or brownian movement this can be enhanced by quick dispersion of the coagulant i e rapid mixing 2 the subsequent growth of the insoluble arb args filtrable products are achieved via orthokinetic caused by mechanical agitation the mechanism could be precipitation co precipitation or adsorption precipitation refers to the settling of arg args colloids out of aqueous solution co precipitation is the incorporation of arb args colloids into the growing coagulant metal hydroxide and adsorption is the surface complexation of arb args colloids and coagulant metal hydroxide adsorption mechanism is described in the section 5 2 5 1 1 biobased coagulant several classes of coagulants have been used in water treatment among these naturally occurring coagulants have been encouraged due to their eco friendly tendencies however studies are few on the use of biobased coagulants for the removal of arb args grehs et al 94 compared the performance of biobased tannin and non biobased aluminum sulfate coagulants for the removal of arb and args from treated urban wastewater 94 the efficiency of both coagulants was similar 98 3 99 4 and approximately 1 log reduction for arb and args respectively however after storage tannin effluent was characterized by arb regrowth while aluminum sulfate effluent further reduced the abundance of arb and args by 4 6 and 1 4 logs respectively 5 1 2 non biobased coagulant coagulants dose play an essential role in the removal of args the efficiency of two wastewater treatment plant that uses polyaluminum chloride as coagulant were compared 67 the coagulant dosage at plant a was 20 000 kg day and the removal efficiency was 48 2 75 3 and 44 3 for tet sul and bla genes respectively plant b utilized less coagulant dosage 7493 kg day and it was effective 75 7 against tet genes however sul and bla genes increased in abundance at 35 6 and 152 respectively iron based coagulants were employed for the removal of sul and tet genes and intl1 from wastewater treatment plants 95 their results showed that fe species played a crucial role in the removal of args the coagulants fecl3 and polyferric compounds could achieve the removal of log 0 5 to 3 1 other inherent pollutions like dissolved nutrients and cod were effectively treated fecl3 could form a stable floc with arb args and mges 96 therefore the clean water is separated by simple sedimentation in the presence of fe3 as coagulant species the removal efficiency was 3 29 2 02 3 42 and 3 05 logs for teta sul1 sul2 and intl1 respectively the authors concluded that the effectiveness of the coagulant could be attributed to the electrostatic force of attraction between the positively charged fe3 and negatively charged args phosphate base for example guanine can attach to fe and al ions at phosphate and benzene ring fig 4 in general understanding the mechanism for the removal of arb args from the aqueous system is essential in the design of appropriate technology the physicochemical parameter of water to be treated may help predict the unit processes needed for effective treatment the isoelectric point and point zero charges of coagulants which correspond with the external surface and total charge respectively 97 would be useful in predicting the mechanism of the removal of arb args initial solution ph may also influence the exclusion of arb args due to protonation and deprotonation the isoelectric point of arb args has been measured to be within the range of 2 5 98 100 hence coagulant could be fabricated to suit the solution ph so that removal of arb args can proceed via electrostatic attraction 5 2 adsorption based approach adsorption is the uptake of dissolved fluids molecule or ions on the surface of a solid adsorbent the process includes the removal of the fluids from solution and excision of solvent from the solid adsorbent due to hydrolysis and bonding of the fluids onto the solid adsorbent the bond is ensuing from chemisorption or physisorption or ion exchange or surface precipitation or a combination of these mechanism 101 the efficiency of adsorption may be attributed to the adsorbent specific surface area charge volume and pore sizes as well as adsorbate ionic charge 102 for example opposite charged adsorbents and adsorbates can attract via electrostatic force of attraction and adsorbate can intercalate into the lattice of an adsorbent as a guest ion similarly ionic strength and ph influence solute mobility competing ions strive and block reactive sites and temperature impact on system adsorption enthalpy 103 adsorption as a water treatment option has been explored over the years and experimental results have been translated into field technology 104 adsorption process is one of the basic unit processes to achieve cleaner water still few studies have been reported on the use of adsorption based methods as sole technology for the remediation of arb args the adsorbent used in water treatment may be organic or inorganic based low cost and non toxic adsorbent are usually encouraged due to economic and environmental impact 105 sometimes adsorbents are modified to improve the inherent physicochemical characteristic or to impact specific functionality 106 a review of the adsorbents that have been investigated for arg removal from water and wastewater are presented below under the biobased and non biobased classification also the tyndall effect resulting from solution turbidity which has been associated with impacting negatively on light and reactive radical induced disinfection do not impede the rate of adsorption when compared with aops 107 5 2 1 biobased adsorbent egg shell an abundant agricultural waste rich in calcium has been evaluated as an effective adsorbent for the removal of several classes of contaminants the functionalization of the eggshell has successfully extended its applicability thus the adsorption capacity modification with sulfate containing groups improved the adsorption capacity towards arb args 108 the adsorption capacity of unmodified eggshell and sulfate modified eggshell was 2 38 107 and 1 39 109 cfu g respectively in the batch experiment the sulfate modified eggshell could altogether remove gentamicin resistant e coli and various classes of args tetb tetm ermb blashv and ampc in leachate the improved adsorption capacity of sulfate modified eggshell was attributed to the structural changes within the lattice of the adsorbent i e increased specific surface area mesopore volume and mesopore diameter biochar has been employed as adsorbent for water and wastewater treatment but studies are limited to its use for arb args management few of the available studies focused on the removal of arb args from soil 109 111 and plant ye et al 2016 gao et al 112 described the performance of anti methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus modified biochar for the removal of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus the modified biochar was active for the complete removal of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus due to the antigen antibody interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 112 thus the modified biochar completely removed methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus at an initial concentration of 4 3 105 cfu ml the functional groups carboxylic amine and carboxyl contained within the matrix of activated sludge makes it a valuable biobased adsorbent 113 the uptake of pollutants by activated sludge has been associated with bonding with these functional groups 114 hrenovic et al 79 characterized the wastewater effluent after treatment with activated sludge about 99 carbapenem resistant bacteria and other contaminants e g nutrients were effectively removed increasing the contact time enhanced the removal efficiency of carbapenem resistant bacteria clay as an adsorbent has received considerable attention due to non toxicity abundance surface area and ease of modification 20 thus clay has been incorporated into biobased material as an effective adsorbent for water purification in a recent study ugwuja et al 115 reported the removal of multidrug and multimetal resistant e coli collected from electronic wastewater using third generation hybrid carica papaya seeds kaolinite modified with zn cu nanocomposites in a fixed bed system adsorption of multidrug multimetal resistant bacteria proceeded via electrostatic attraction to the positively charged surface al oh of the hybrid nanocomposite and the negative end of the bacteria po4 3 and coo 115 though biobased sorbents are promising materials for the removal of arb args however when leached the intrinsic chemical constituents of biobased sorbent serve as nutrients for arb 116 further studies have shown that leached nutrients may enhance arb reactivation and subsequent regrowth 116 in addition to leached nutrients adsorbent toxicity towards arb may result in cell lysis the lysed cell may release args resulting in secondary pollution 117 therefore in addition to adsorption capacity adsorbent stability is also vital when the target pollutant is arb 5 2 2 non biobased adsorbent studies on the adsorption of arb args using non biobased adsorbent are rare therefore we will include the contribution of the adsorption using non biobased adsorbent in the subsequent section under coagulation the potential of graphene oxide as an effective adsorbent against traditional contaminants has been described by many authors due to high surface area and light responses 118 119 in the fight against the menace of args graphene oxide is efficient in the binding of args and can catalyze the degradation of resistomes 120 similarly graphene oxide inhibits the propagation of args 121 yu et al 122 reported the adsorption performance of graphene oxide nanosheet for the removal of cyclic and double stranded args 122 graphene oxide showed high adsorption capacity towards args teta sul2 ermb ampc ionic strength ionic interference args molecular structure and ph influenced the removal efficiency of args in the aqueous system acidic neutral ph 5 7 na and mg2 were beneficial for the uptake of targeted args the adsorption mechanism was described as the binding of dna nucleosides with conjugates π region sites and oxygen containing groups in the graphene oxide tap water containing free dna harboring gyrb was sequestered using ceo2 adsorbent the adsorption of the free dna was attributed to the electrostatic attraction between the hydrolyzed ce oh 2 and the negatively charged free dna backbone 123 sulfidated nanosized zero valent iron s nzvi was synthesized via the reduction of iron sulfate for the removal of args the adsorbent s nzvi simultaneously remove and inhibit args regeneration 124 5 3 membrane filtration membrane filtration relies on the exclusion of pollutants as contaminated solution pass through a permeable filter though membrane filtration is a mechanical process the process can be altered to involve a chemical process 125 the compactness and composition of the filter and gravity control a substantial rate of membrane filtration the process is classified by the nominal pore size of the permeable membrane typically the pore size of microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are 0 05 10 μm 0 001 0 05 μm 2 0 and 0 5 respectively depending on the configuration the membrane filtration configuration can be cross flow or dead end 126 the dead end system is designed to remove pollutants by sieving as the feed flows through the membrane filter the cross flow setup incorporates filtration and adsorption desorption mechanism as the feed flows over the membrane the permeate is collected via adsorption and desorption fig 5 the design of a low cost membrane filter is currently ongoing 127 128 meanwhile an affordable membrane filter is presently commercialized https www vestergaard com lifestraw family 2 0 polyvinylidene fluoride a common ultrafiltration membrane filter was functionalized with tio2 for the removal of args 88 the more compact polyvinylidene fluoride tio2 excluded more bacterial communities and args than the unfunctionalized polyvinylidene from the permeate however unretained resistomes of size 0 1 2 μm larger than the pore of the ultrafilter could exit the filter due to resistomes deformation as a result of resistomes size and hydraulic pressure 1 4 bar the pore size of the membrane filter is one of the most critical factors during the exclusion of resistomes 129 thus membrane of size 1 kda molecular weight cut off mwco were effective in the removal of cell free dna harboring args and removal efficiency 99 was achieved 130 membrane filter of size 5000 da was required to achieve 99 8 retention for a more soluble free dna fragment whereas 20 000 da membrane filter size was necessary to obtain a similar result besides the charge on filter constituent can also play a vital role negatively charged membrane filter showed a lower exclusion rate for the removal of extracellular free dna and args when compared with neutral and positively charged filters due to columbic force 131 5 4 shortcoming and headway laboratory investigation on the management of arb args as emerging contaminants have been extensively studied using aops however translating laboratory results in field technology still lies out of reach 132 thus switching attention to other simple low cost treatment should be encouraged despite that aops may be less effective 133 when compared with secondary water wastewater treatment options in the removal of arb args from contamination bound aqueous system majority of studies still focused on the aops as the ultimate treatment option for example recent studies revealed that the abundance of args in drinking water increased and unchanged after uv and chlorination disinfection respectively 134 aops did not remove args mcr 1 and blandm 1 that confer resistance to colistins and carbapenems in drinking water treatment plant 135 in the treatment of arb args in aqueous systems using aops the common challenge encountered includes incomplete removal and subsequent regrowth or reactivation of arb args 136 137 for example biological water wastewater treatment have been reported to be ineffective in the removal of args in aqueous system 138 it could be argued that this challenge is more pronounced when radical dependent aop is applied for example asides the need for adequate infrastructure and technology to implement and operate radical based aops 139 during chlorination intracellular and extracellular args are released into the water system due to bacteria cell leakage also varying temperatures due to photon source may propagate args and the presence of nh4 n a typical water nutrient may protect the args proliferation in the aqueous systems 49 thus water physicochemical properties can make arb args more challenging pollutants during aops similarly elevated turbidity and high chemical oxygen demand cod is an indication of the presence of bacteria 140 total phosphorous has strong correlation with args 141 these are the inherent characteristics of polluted water 142 turbidity and cod impact negatively on light and reactive radical induced bacteria disinfection 143 moreso light induced disinfection generates heat energy which can increase the local temperature during treatment a recent study has also shown that increasing temperature favors arb diversity and abundance 70 therefore due to inadequate infrastructures common among low income nations and other challenges peculiar with aops it is imperative to implement water treatment options that do not include sophisticated technologies the current state of the art suggests that our proposed treatment methods adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration also present some interesting challenges that needs further examination some apparent shortcomings that is associated on a pilot studies are material performance and removal capacity selectivity recovery and regeneration treated water acceptability sludge treatment and the commercialization of novel adsorbent the adsorbent coagulant membrane performance is related to the overall success of the material in expunging targeted arb args the selectivity is interrelated with the affinity of the adsorbent coagulant membrane towards the targeted resistomes in addition to the exclusion of organic and inorganic impurities water to be used for drinking and cooking purposes should contain essential calcium and minor nutrient molybdenum necessary for complete body function thus adsorbent coagulant membrane selectivity is crucial removal capacity is a factor that is closely controlled by adsorbent coagulant membrane performance therefore depending on adsorbent coagulant membrane physicochemical properties an adsorbent coagulant membrane performance may be linked with the pore volume and size surface area and orientation roughness amorphous and surface functionality flocs size and stability compactness and exclusion rate in the design of an adsorbent coagulant membrane the functional group can be engineered to impact and improve selectivity besides treated water for drinking should be characterized of ph close to neutral though several studies have fabricated materials for water purification however final water ph would incur additional costs to adjust the ph this is a particular shortcoming with coagulation process the successive release of h during metal hydrolysis prior to flocculation may significantly alters the solution final ph similar to other impurities toxic oxoanions borate arsenite and nitrate major nutrients iodine and fluoride and minor nutrients selenium and molybdenum arb args are negatively charged thus important nutrients may be excluded from treated water which may result in major health risk so far nearly all studies on the removal of arb args has ignored this important process parameter in the design of adsorbent coagulant membrane filter and subsequent pilot testing the presence of carbon and nitrogen in natural and organic coagulant have been reported to induce arb regrowth and args activation 94 improper waste management has great environmental implications which ultimately act as resistomes stressors thus it is a major contribution to the current menace of arb args in the ecosystem therefore special emphasis should be focused on the resulting sludge generated from the proposed water treatment strategies current knowledge implored that resistomes in sludge are robust thus more studies is required in this field in addition commercialization of novel adsorbent coagulants filter is another potential hurdle that needs to be addressed in most of the studies reported so far authors have not been explicit in detailing the reaction mechanism which governs the process for example in the study of ye et al 108 the process was characterized via monolayer and physisorption ionic strength and ph affect the reaction the optimum condition was achieved at ph 7 5 the authors however did not provide a detailed account for this observation 5 5 expunging antibiotics from water the significant stress on the propagation of resistomes in the environment is the indiscriminate use and disposal of antibiotics 144 the exponential growth of arb args is sustained by the unlimited influx of various classes of antibiotics in disturbing concentration into the water and wastewater 145 thus bacteria may acquire resistant to previously potent therapeutic bacteria agent due to their continuous interaction with the antibiotics therefore reducing the number of antibiotics that are released as waste or expunging existing antibiotics from the environment especially in water and wastewater contamination is a viable method to reduce the emergence of bacteria strains with multiple antibiotic resistant and subsequently reduce the dissemination of args 146 some promising technologies that have been employed for the removal of antibiotics include constructed wetland adsorption advanced oxidation filtration flocculation and coagulation biological and high temperature compositing the use of unique technology for the removal of antibiotics has shown promising efficiency however the combination of different strategies has tremendously improved application and result 147 for instance during the photocatalytic oxidation of ciprofloxacin enrofloxacin norfloxacin flumequine and 1 2 fluorophenyl piperazine using tio2 in the presence of uv and visible light the lc ms results showed that antibacterial agents are not entirely mineralized instead transformed into stable organic compound 148 a recent study has also reported incomplete mineralization of ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole using solar active clay tio2 composite 149 therefore a hybrid strategy is employed to improve the removal of the antimicrobial agent from aqueous solution a common practice is the use of photocatalyst with high affinity and enhanced adsorption capacity for antibiotics zeolite was used as a support for the tio2 for the removal and mineralization oxytetracycline from aqueous solution at neutral ph at optimum condition the adsorption capacity of the composite to remove oxytetracycline was 1497 mg g and the mineralization efficiency measured as total organic carbon improved as the weight of tio2 increased in the composite 150 the photodegradation of retained antibiotics on the surface of a membrane filter has also been explored as a hybrid antibiotic removal strategy polysulfone was fused with acidified graphite carbon nitride and dopamine to form a reactive membrane for the removal and degradation of ciprofloxacin 151 the removal efficiency of ciprofloxacin using adsorption and filtration technologies singly was 21 6 and 54 2 respectively however when combined with photocatalysis the removal efficiency improved to 99 4 the increase in removal efficiency was attributed to oh and o 2 the required reactive oxygen species for the degradation of antibiotics during combined technologies membrane filtration and reactive species may also be initiated using the photo fenton process the photo fenton degradation of sulfadiazine was studied using α feooh as fenton catalyst in the presence of uv light 152 the presence of uv and α feooh as fenton catalyst caused a drastic increased in the removal of sulfadiazine from 4 to 99 another interesting study reported that large and stable flocs 264 685 μm of sulfamethazine could be rejected on ceramic filter membrane 153 the removal mechanism was preceded by the in situ generation of oh and s o 4 initiated by common groundwater ion fe2 in the presence of peroxymonosulfate this implied that reactive species is vital in achieving complete antibiotics removal from aqueous system 6 conclusion and future recommendation arb args management if not properly designed may result in secondary pollution several authors have reported that water devoid of nutrients were detrimental to the survival of args unlike aop adsorption coagulation and membrane systems do not release args from arb besides nutrient and other physicochemical water properties e g turbidity cod organic load nutrient of source water are also treated thus improving the organoleptic properties of the final water effluent hence adsorption coagulation and membrane filtration can be a powerful tool for the eradication of arb args in drinking water especially for low budget communities therefore engineering material that is cheap and non toxic which can take advantage of the surface chemistry of arb args while incorporating a large specific surface area for effective sorption thus forming a stable floc or uptake or exclusion of arb args from aqueous system this could be a major lifeline for infrastructure deficient communities the current state of art for the treatment of emerging pollutants in the developed countries is achieving some of the set objectives however the technology is still sophisticated for low budget communities due to inadequate infrastructures therefore low cost water treatment options should be developed to cater to the urgent needs notably water for household purposes to meet the sustainable development goal for water needs in underdeveloped and developing regions to achieve these objectives there is need to focus on the following 1 encouragement of research projects that focuses on access to clean water in low budget communities through funding and supervision this type of project should be operational with or without electricity 2 provision of information regarding the permissible level of args in environmental samples this is important in rating the success failure of to be engineered materials 3 public awareness on the need for point of use water treatment strategy before consumption this is vital in improving public health and reducing the need for antibiotics research communities are encouraged to design projects that will adhere to the following 1 the use of cheap and ecofriendly materials as coagulants sorbents and membrane filters 2 prioritize the use of crude instrumentation that should be independent of the use of electricity and account for limitations where necessary 3 the need for effective feedback mechanisms on the success failures and challenges associated with the treatment methods declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

the magnetic separator is suitable for large scale heavy metal wastewater treatment keywords magnetic separator magnetic bar tanning wastewater heavy metal wastewater treatment fe3o4 regeneration reuse 1 introduction with the rapid development of modern industry a large amount of wastewater containing a variety of heavy metal ions is produced 1 2 these ions are toxic and non biodegradable and cause a notable harm to human health 3 for example about 300 million tons of tannery wastewater are generated annually in the world of which about 140 million tons are produced in china 4 chromium ions are the main source of pollutants in the tanning wastewater the chromium concentration in tanning wastewater is 60 3000 mg l 4 5 the maximum allowable concentration of cr total in tanning wastewater has been determined at 5 mg l by eu 2 77 mg l by usa 6 and 0 5 mg l by china therefore it is critical to remove these heavy metal pollutants from wastewater to allowable limit various techniques have been applied to remove chromium from aqueous solution such as electrocoagulation activated sludge chemical precipitation and magnetic separation 7 magnetic separation method has attracted great attention as an effective and economical way to reach this goal especially for low concentration cr ions 0 05 1 mg l containing wastewater 8 the general strategy of magnetic separation technology is applying magnetic particles to absorb or coagulate with chromium ions and the particle chromium complex is then separated by magnetic separator 9 10 currently widely used magnetic separators include bulk permanent magnet magnetic separator electromagnetic separator and high gradient magnetic separator 11 13 anthony m muliwa et al 10 installed five cylindrical permanent magnet bars on a stainless steel plate and using this permanent magnet magnetic separator to treat the chromium in the aqueous solution with a chromium removal efficiency of 92 and a liquid flow rate of 12 l hr the permanent magnet magnetic separator has a low cr removal efficiency samuel c n tang et al 14 applied an electromagnetic separation device to remove chromium from the aqueous solution the separation chamber can process 5 l of chromium containing aqueous solution each time and the chromium removal rate is about 98 the processing capacity of the electromagnetic separator is small wang et al 15 designed a high gradient magnetic fluid fixed bed magnetic separation device this device is used to treat low concentration chromium containing wastewater the wastewater flow rate is 0 3 l hr and the maximum chromium removal rate is 72 34 high gradient magnetic separator is difficult to scale up because magnetic nanoparticles are small in size and difficult to separate the separation of the magnetic nanoparticles heavy metal complex requires a strong external applied magnetic field many problems have been brought while achieving this goal for example energy consumption is very high for electromagnetic magnetic separator 3 w 10a 16 magnetic flux is low for bulk magnetic permanent magnet separator and filler is difficult to clean for high gradient magnetic separation 17 18 these shortcomings are obstacles to the large scale industrialization of magnetic nanoparticle magnetic separation technology therefore there is an urgent need for a magnetic separator which has high magnetic field strength high separation efficiency low use cost and can be cleaned in situ to achieve continuous or semi continuous operation the nd fe b permanent magnets have been successfully used to separate metals from non metallic ores 19 here we design a simple structure magnetic separator using nd fe b magnetic bars for efficient capturing of magnetic nanoparticles in wastewater the nd fe b magnet bar is a permanent magnet with high magnetic field strength and gradient and its magnetic properties remain stable for a long time at room temperature without consuming energy magnetic nanoparticles chromium complex can be easily adsorbed to magnetic bars and be cleaned in situ the wastewater treatment capacity of this magnetic bar separator can be easily expanded which makes it possible to be used in an actual wastewater treatment plant more importantly the magnetic nanoparticles can be recycled and no hazardous waste generated during wastewater treatment effect of magnetic nanoparticle concentration magnetic separator magnetic bar spacing and liquid flow rate on capture efficiency was studied the designed magnetic separator has been applied to removal of chromium ions in tanning wastewater the goal of this article is to make the chromium concentration of tanning wastewater below 0 5 mg l reaching the latest discharge limit 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents amine functioned fe3o4 nanoparticles were provided by beijing gignano biointerface company the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles is 15 nm in size supplementary fig s1 the saturation magnetization of the fe3o4 nanoparticles is 72 emu g supplementary fig s2 ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o sodium hypochlorite naclo and tryptone were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all materials were used directly

each with alternating orientation were separated by six magnetically conductive silicon steel sheets outer ring diameter 19 5 mm inner ring diameter 6 5 mm and thickness 1 5 and covered by nonmagnetic stainless steel shell the internal structure of magnetic bar is shown in fig 1 the langitudinal direction of the magnetic bar is calibrated as the x axis direction and the radial direction of the magnetic bar is calibrated as the y axis direction the origin of the y axis is on the surface of the stainless steel shell the dimensions of cylindrical neodymium iron boron magnet and circular magnetically conductive silicon steel sheets are shown in fig 1 b d simulation of magnetic field was performed via mechanical apdl ansys18 0 in order to simplify computer calculations three nd fe b magnet units were selected in a single magnetic bar a tesla meter ht20 is used to measure the magnetic field strength of the magnet bar the working parameters of the tesla meter are working voltage is 220 v ambient temperature 2 3 magnetic separator construction the magnetic separator consists of four vertically aligned magnetic bars and a scraping system as shown in fig 2 each magnetic bar is 140 mm long with diameter 19 mm the upper part 100 mm of magnetic bar contains nd fe b magnet units the lower part 40 mm has no magnet units the scraping system consists of a scraper and a lifting handle the scraper is made of a piece of 3 mm thick silicone rubber sandwiched between two 3 mm thick stainless steel splints it has four 19 mm diameter holes which let four magnetic bars pass through them the wastewater enters the magnetic separator from the water inlet at the bottom after the magnetic complex in the wastewater is captured by the magnetic bar it flows out from the upper water outlet of the separator the scraper is lifted to the upper part of the separator during absorption process after the magnetic bars reach absorption saturation drain the solution in the separator reversely through the water inlet and then close the water inlet valve pushing down the scraper particle chromium complex can be moved out of the separator from the lower inlet 2 4 simulated wastewater treatment in deionized water the trial run with the magnetic separator is shown in fig 2 the schematic diagram of wastewater treatment is shown in fig 3 a certain amount of fe3o4 nanoparticles is added to water in mixing tank to simulate wastewater then the mixed simulated wastewater is pumped into magnetic separator at a certain flow rate it flows through the magnetic separator with magnetic nanoparticles captured on magnetic bars the processed waterflows into the collecting tank iron ion concentration of water in collecting tank are determined every hour by atomic absorption spectroscopy

magnetic nanoparticle concentration cin is constant the greater the liquid flow rate v0 the shorter the time ts for the magnetic bar to reach capture saturation when the liquid flow rate v0 is constant the higher the inlet magnetic nanoparticle concentration cin the shorter the time ts for the magnetic bar to reach capture saturation therefore it is necessary to adjust liquid flow rate v0 according to inlet magnetic particle concentration cin in order to get high treatment volume as well as long capture saturation time ts 2 5 tanning wastewater treatment with amino fe3o4 nanoparticles chromium containing tanning wastewater is collected from comprehensive regulation tank of a tannery in shijiazhuang hebei province china the wastewater in the comprehensive regulation tank is mainly composed of the retanning and dyeing wastewater in the tannery wastewater composition is shown in table 1 magnetic bar spacing of magnetic separator is 30 mm flow rate is 18 l hr add 2 88 l of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticle solution 100 mg l to 150 l chromium containing tanning wastewater samples in the collecting tank were taken at intervals chromium ion cr concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy sp 3520 shanghai spectrum instruments co ltd china 2 6 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticle regeneration and reuse experiments soak the spent magnetic nanoparticles in the sodium hypochlorite solution stir at a constant speed and react at 313k for 3 h after the reaction the solution is magnetically separated to obtain magnetic nanoparticles and the supernatant is collected in a container subsequently the magnetic nanoparticles were soaked in a ferrous sulfate solution for 10 min after magnetic separation the magnetic nanoparticles were washed three times with deionized water regenerated magnetic nanoparticles are used in the treatment of chromium containing wastewater in experiment 2 5 the magnetic nanoparticles are regenerated nine times each cycle running for 5 h take one sample every hour and take average value 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation and measurement of single magnetic bar magnetic field 3 1 1 single magnetic bar magnetic field simulation the simulation results are shown in fig 5 a presents the magnetic field strength along x axis at the surface of magnetic bar when y is zero it can be seen from fig 5 a that the magnetic field strength is 8480 g at the position of the first magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet moving the position along the x axis direction the magnetic field strength decreases sharply and the magnetic field strength at the middle position of the nd fe b magnet is the lowest point the value is 2263 g after passing through the middle point of the nd fe b magnet the magnetic field strength increases sharply and the magnetic field strength increases to 9083 g at the position of the second magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the magnetic field strength changes periodically along the langitudinal direction of the magnetic bar it can be seen from the fig 5 a that the maximum magnetic field strength on the first and fourth magnetically conductive sheet is 8480 g while the maximum magnetic field strength of the two magnetically conductive sheet in the middle is 9083 g this may be because the first and fourth magnetically conductive sheet have magnets on only one side fig 5 b is the radial variation of the magnetic field strength at the first magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the magnetic field strength at the surface of the magnetically conductive sheet is as high as 8480 g the farther away from the surface of the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the weaker the magnetic field strength when the distance is 14 mm away from the surface the magnetic field strength decreases to 334 g fig 4 a is the magnetic field gradient distribution diagram on the magnetic bar along the x axis the yellow circle layer on the magnetic bar is the layer with the strongest magnetic gradient and this circle layer corresponds to the position of the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet of the magnetic bar magnetic complex in wastewater are more likely to be captured in this area the thickness of captured layer depends on the magnetic field strength near the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet fig 4 b is the diagram of the magnetic field gradient along the radical direction from the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet it shows that the magnetic field gradient is 553 t m 1 at the surface of magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet and remains 100 t m 1 at 9 6 mm from the surface of magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet such high gradients are typically achieved with high gradient magnetic separator 3 1 2 single magnetic bar magnetic field measure the magnetic field strength of the purchased magnetic bar along the x and y axes were actually measured as shown in fig 5 as seen from fig 5 a the magnetic field strength is 7000 g at the position of the first magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet moving the position along the x axis direction the magnetic field strength decreases sharply and the magnetic field strength at the middle position of the nd fe b magnet is the lowest point the value is close to 0 g after passing through the middle point of the nd fe b magnet the magnetic field strength increases sharply and the magnetic field strength increases to 7000 g at the position of the second magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the magnetic field strength changes periodically along the langitudinal direction of the magnetic bar which is same as the simulation result but the measured values are lower than the corresponding simulated values fig 5 b shows the measured magnetic field along the y axis from the surface of the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the magnetic field strength is 7000 g at the surface of the conductive sheet it decreases away from the surface the value of the magnetic field strength is 200 g when the distance is 13 mm from the surface of the conductive sheet similarly the variation of the measured magnetic field strengths is the same as and the simulated ones along the y axis except that the measured values are lower than the corresponding simulated values the simulation method can be used to predict the magnetic bar s ability to capture magnetic substances 3 2 simulated wastewater treatment in deionized water to investigate magnetic nanoparticle capture of magnetic bar separator in simulated wastewater we designed a separator containing four magnetic bars the magnetic bars are the same size 140 mm long with diameter 19 mm each they are vertically aligned with 12 mm spacing between every two adjacent ones effect of magnetic nanoparticle concentration on capture efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles is shown in fig 6 the variational curves of capture efficiency as a function of operating time are similar under three different magnetic nanoparticle concentrations 100 200 and 400 mg l at the initial 3 h capture efficiency e is 99 8 after the third hour the capture efficiency experiences an abrupt decrease for particle concentration 400 mg l and it turns to 27 by the 8th hour for the magnetic nanoparticle concentration of 100 mg l and 200 mg l capture efficiency remains stable at 99 8 till 3 5 h then decreases sharply after that at the 8th hour the capture efficiency are 33 and 36 respectively the capture saturation time ts of magnetic bar separator are 3 5 h 3 5 h and 3 h for magnetic nanoparticle concentrations of 100 mg l 200 mg l and 400 mg l respectively the smaller concentration of magnetic nanoparticles the longer capture saturation time ts of the magnetic separator effect of flow rate on capture efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles is shown in fig 7 capture efficiencies of magnetic nanoparticle are 99 8 for three different flow rates within first 5 h after the 5th hour they began to decrease abruptly the larger the flow rate the larger the decreasing slope when the magnetic separator is operated at 8th hour the corresponding capture efficiencies are 62 45 and 33 for the three different flow rates 3 l hr 10 5 l hr 18 l hr the result shows that flow rate has little effect on saturation capture time ts of magnetic bar under the three flow rates which is 5 h therefore the maximum flow rate of this magnetic separator is 18 l hr another two separators were designed to investigate the effect of magnetic bar spacing on capture efficiency of magnetic particle same as the first one they contain four magnetic bars of 140 mm long with diameter 19 mm each except that the distances between every two adjacent bars are 20 mm and 30 mm respectively the effect of magnetic bars spacing on magnetic particles capture is shown in fig 8 during the initial operating time period the capture efficiency is high prolong the operating time magnetic particles gradually adsorbed on the magnetic bar when the adsorption reaches saturation that is the operating time exceeds capture saturation time ts the capture efficiency decreases abruptly for the 12 mm spacing separator capture efficiency is almost the same as 99 83 in the first 4 h of operating it decreases slightly to 99 75 at the 5th hour after 5 h it decreases abruptly the saturation capture time ts of the 12 mm spacing magnetic separator is about 5 h increasing the distance between magnetic bars the highest capture efficiency is decreased 99 6 for 20 mm spacing and 99 4 for 30 mm spacing as well as the saturation capture time ts the saturation capture time ts of the 20 mm spacing magnetic separator is about 3 5 h the saturation capture time ts of the 30 mm spacing magnetic separator is about 3 h increasing the magnetic bar spacing can not only reduce the number of magnetic separator magnetic bars to reduce costs but also increase the separator capacity to capture more magnetic particles however if the distance between the magnetic bars is too large the magnetic particles cannot be completely captured in this experiment therefore 30 mm is optimal bar spacing 3 3 tanning wastewater treatment with amino fe3o4 nanoparticles the capture efficiency of magnetic bar separator for low concentration chromium containing wastewater treatment is shown in fig 9 capture efficiency of magnetic separator is high within 5 h it is 99 5 for cr at the 5th hour the chromium concentration of the treated wastewater is less than 0 5 mg l after 5 h the capture efficiency decreased sharply by the 8th hour the capture efficiency of the magnetic separator decreased to 16 the experimental results show that the saturation capture time ts is 5 h the real chromium containing wastewater treatment capacity of the magnetic separator is 18 l hr based on the results of this experiment we can amplify the treatment capacity of the magnetic separator according to actual production needs tables 2 and 3 compared other chromium removal methods and other magnetic separators with this research it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that the outlet chromium concentration treatment capacity and chromium capture efficiency of the chromium removal method in this article are far superior to other methods and separators therefore the chromium removal method in this study has great practical application potential 3 4 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticle regeneration and reuse experiments amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles were found to be effective in removing chromium from chromium containing tanning wastewater however the spent magnetic nanoparticles combined with chromium are regarded as hazardous waste in wastewater treatment plants hazardous waste disposal costs are very high regeneration of the spent amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles not only reduces the disposal cost of hazardous waste but also increases the reusability of amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles and thus reduces the wastewater treatment cost using sodium hypochlorite 10 solution can oxidize the chromium bound on the surface of amino fe3o4 particles into hexavalent chromium to form solution and the organic substances on the surface of the particles were oxidized at the same time 25 the further processing of the hexavalent chromium solution can realize the recovery of chromium fig 10 shows the evaporated chromium recovered in this experiment since hexavalent chromium is a very toxic heavy metal element we must remove it 26 the hexavalent chromium on the surface of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles can be reduced to trivalent chromium by ferrous sulfate solution to eliminate its toxicity 27 28 therefore the amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles that have reacted with the sodium hypochlorite solution are soaked in the ferrous sulfate solution and then washed with deionized water after magnetic separation to achieve amino fe3o4 particles regeneration the capture efficiency and outlet chromium concentration of magnetic bar separator for low concentration chromium containing wastewater treatment with regeneration magnetic nanoparticles are shown in fig 11 when the regenerated amino fe3o4 are recycled for 9 times the capture efficiency of chromium can be maintained above 99 6 when used for 4 times the average outlet chromium concentration is 0 152 mg l after being recycled for 4 times the outlet chromium concentration gradually increased and at the 9th time the outlet chromium concentration is 0 402 mg l in summary the amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles can be recycled at least 9 times this can greatly reduce the cost of wastewater treatment in practical applications the raw materials for the production of amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles can also be replaced the price of industrial grade ferric salt is at least 10 times cheaper than laboratory grade the technology has great practical application prospects 4 conclusions we designed a magnetic separator for application in wastewater treatment the device enables high throughput high gradient magnetic separation of magnetic nanoparticles and easy cleaning by utilizing 4 vertical aligned magnetic bars and a in situ cleaning scraper the capture efficiency of 15 nm fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles in simulated wastewater could keep more than 99 4 within 3 h the magnetic separator was applied to capture chromium ions in tanning wastewater through 15 nm magnetic nanoparticles absorption the capture efficiency of chromium ions can keep 99 7 within 5 h the chromium concentration is less than 0 5 mg l in processed water the wastewater treatment capacity is 18 l h the treatment capacity can be further increased by using more and or longer magnetic bars we will perform a pilot experiment in order to find out the capture efficiency of chromium ions in tanning wastewater using larger scale separator over long term the chromium in wastewater can be completely recycled which greatly reduces the cost of hazardous waste treatment the amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles are recycled 9 times the capture efficiency of chromium is as high as 99 6 and the outlet chromium concentration is always lower than 0 5 mg l credit

through the water inlet and then close the water inlet valve pushing down the scraper particle chromium complex can be moved out of the separator from the lower inlet 2 4 simulated wastewater treatment in deionized water the trial run with the magnetic separator is shown in fig 2 the schematic diagram of wastewater treatment is shown in fig 3 a certain amount of fe3o4 nanoparticles is added to water in mixing tank to simulate wastewater then the mixed simulated wastewater is pumped into magnetic separator at a certain flow rate it flows through the magnetic separator with magnetic

according to inlet magnetic particle concentration cin in order to get high treatment volume as well as long capture saturation time ts 2 5 tanning wastewater treatment with amino fe3o4 nanoparticles chromium containing tanning wastewater is collected from comprehensive regulation tank of a tannery in shijiazhuang hebei province china the wastewater in the comprehensive regulation tank is mainly composed of the retanning and dyeing wastewater in the tannery wastewater composition is shown in table 1 magnetic bar spacing of magnetic separator is 30 mm flow rate is 18 l hr add 2 88 l of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticle solution 100 mg l to 150 l chromium containing tanning wastewater samples in the collecting tank were taken at intervals chromium ion cr concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy sp 3520 shanghai spectrum instruments co ltd china 2 6 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticle regeneration and reuse experiments soak the spent magnetic nanoparticles in the sodium hypochlorite solution stir at a constant speed and react at 313k for 3 h after the reaction the solution is magnetically separated to obtain magnetic nanoparticles and the supernatant is collected in a container subsequently the magnetic nanoparticles were soaked in a ferrous sulfate solution for 10 min after magnetic separation the magnetic nanoparticles were washed three times with deionized water regenerated magnetic nanoparticles are used in the treatment of chromium containing wastewater in experiment 2 5 the magnetic nanoparticles are regenerated nine times each cycle running for 5 h take one sample every hour and take average value 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation and measurement of single magnetic bar magnetic field 3 1 1 single magnetic bar magnetic field simulation the simulation results are shown in fig 5 a presents the magnetic field strength along x axis at the surface of magnetic bar when y is zero it can be seen from fig 5 a that the magnetic field strength is 8480 g at the position of the first magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet moving the position along the x axis direction the magnetic field strength decreases sharply and the magnetic field strength at the middle position of the nd fe b magnet is the lowest point the value is 2263 g after passing through the middle point of the nd fe b magnet the magnetic field strength increases sharply and the magnetic field strength increases to 9083 g at the position of the second magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the magnetic field strength changes periodically along the langitudinal direction of the magnetic bar it can be seen from the fig 5 a that the maximum magnetic field strength on the first and fourth magnetically conductive sheet is 8480 g while the maximum magnetic field strength of the two magnetically conductive sheet in the middle is 9083 g this may be because the first and fourth magnetically conductive sheet have magnets on only one side fig 5 b is the radial variation of the magnetic field strength at the first magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the magnetic field strength at the surface of the magnetically conductive sheet is as high as 8480 g the farther away from the surface of the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the weaker the magnetic field strength when the distance is 14 mm away from the surface the magnetic field strength decreases to 334 g fig 4 a is the magnetic field gradient distribution diagram on the magnetic bar along the x axis the yellow circle layer on the magnetic bar is the layer with the strongest magnetic gradient and this circle layer corresponds to the position of the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet of the magnetic bar magnetic complex in wastewater are more likely to be captured in this area the thickness of captured layer depends on the magnetic field strength near the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet fig 4 b is the diagram of the magnetic field gradient along the radical direction from the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet it shows that the magnetic field gradient is 553 t m 1 at the surface of magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet and remains 100 t m 1 at 9 6 mm from the surface of magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet such high gradients are typically achieved with high gradient magnetic separator 3 1 2 single magnetic bar magnetic field measure the magnetic field strength of the purchased magnetic bar along the x and y axes were actually measured as shown in fig 5 as seen from fig 5 a the magnetic field strength is 7000 g at the position of the first magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet moving the position along the x axis direction the magnetic field strength decreases sharply and the magnetic field strength at the middle position of the nd fe b magnet is the lowest point the value is close to 0 g after passing through the middle point of the nd fe b magnet the magnetic field strength increases sharply and the magnetic field strength increases to 7000 g at the position of the second magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the magnetic field strength changes periodically along the langitudinal direction of the magnetic bar which is same as the simulation result but the measured values are lower than the corresponding simulated values fig 5 b shows the measured magnetic field along the y axis from the surface of the magnetically conductive silicon steel sheet the magnetic field strength is 7000 g at the surface of the conductive sheet it decreases away from the surface the value of the magnetic field strength is 200 g when the distance is 13 mm from the surface of the conductive sheet similarly the variation of the measured magnetic field strengths is the same as and the simulated ones along the y axis except that the measured values are lower than the corresponding simulated values the simulation method can be used to predict the magnetic bar s ability to capture magnetic substances 3 2 simulated wastewater treatment in deionized water to investigate magnetic nanoparticle capture of magnetic bar separator in simulated wastewater we designed a separator containing four magnetic bars the magnetic bars are the same size 140 mm long with diameter 19 mm each they are vertically aligned with 12 mm spacing between every two adjacent ones effect of magnetic nanoparticle concentration on capture efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles is shown in fig 6 the variational curves of capture efficiency as a function of operating time are similar under three different magnetic nanoparticle concentrations 100 200 and 400 mg l at the initial 3 h capture efficiency e is 99 8 after the third hour the capture efficiency experiences an abrupt decrease for particle concentration 400 mg l and it turns to 27 by the 8th hour for the magnetic nanoparticle concentration of 100 mg l and 200 mg l capture efficiency remains stable at 99 8 till 3 5 h then decreases sharply after that at the 8th hour the capture efficiency are 33 and 36 respectively the capture saturation time ts of magnetic bar separator are 3 5 h 3 5 h and 3 h for magnetic nanoparticle concentrations of 100 mg l 200 mg l and 400 mg l respectively the smaller concentration of magnetic nanoparticles the longer capture saturation time ts of the magnetic separator effect of flow rate on capture efficiency of magnetic nanoparticles is shown in fig 7 capture efficiencies of magnetic nanoparticle are 99 8 for three different flow rates within first 5 h after the 5th hour they began to decrease abruptly the larger the flow rate the larger the decreasing slope when the magnetic separator is operated at 8th hour the corresponding capture efficiencies are 62 45 and 33 for the three different flow rates 3 l hr 10 5 l hr 18 l hr the result shows that flow rate has little effect on saturation capture time ts of magnetic bar under the three flow rates which is 5 h therefore the maximum flow rate of this magnetic separator is 18 l hr another two separators were designed to investigate the effect of magnetic bar spacing on capture efficiency of magnetic particle same as the first one they contain four magnetic bars of 140 mm long with diameter 19 mm each except that the distances between every two adjacent bars are 20 mm and 30 mm respectively the effect of magnetic bars spacing on magnetic particles capture is shown in fig 8 during the initial operating time period the capture efficiency is high prolong the operating time magnetic particles gradually adsorbed on the magnetic bar when the adsorption reaches saturation that is the operating time exceeds capture saturation time ts the capture efficiency decreases abruptly for the 12 mm spacing separator capture efficiency is almost the same as 99 83 in the first 4 h of operating it decreases slightly to 99 75 at the 5th hour after 5 h it decreases abruptly the saturation capture time ts of the 12 mm spacing magnetic separator is about 5 h increasing the distance between magnetic bars the highest capture efficiency is decreased 99 6 for 20 mm spacing and 99 4 for 30 mm spacing as well as the saturation capture time ts the saturation capture time ts of the 20 mm spacing magnetic separator is about 3 5 h the saturation capture time ts of the 30 mm spacing magnetic separator is about 3 h increasing the magnetic bar spacing can not only reduce the number of magnetic separator magnetic bars to reduce costs but also increase the separator capacity to capture more magnetic particles however if the distance between the magnetic bars is too large the magnetic particles cannot be completely captured in this experiment therefore 30 mm is optimal bar spacing 3 3 tanning wastewater treatment with amino fe3o4 nanoparticles the capture efficiency of magnetic bar separator for low concentration chromium containing wastewater treatment is shown in fig 9 capture efficiency of magnetic separator is high within 5 h it is 99 5 for cr at the 5th hour the chromium concentration of the treated wastewater is less than 0 5 mg l after 5 h the capture efficiency decreased sharply by the 8th hour the capture efficiency of the magnetic separator decreased to 16 the experimental results show that the saturation capture time ts is 5 h the real chromium containing wastewater treatment capacity of the magnetic separator is 18 l hr based on the results of this experiment we can amplify the treatment capacity of the magnetic separator according to actual production needs tables 2 and 3 compared other chromium removal methods and other magnetic separators with this research it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that the outlet chromium concentration treatment capacity and chromium capture efficiency of the chromium removal method in this article are far superior to other methods and separators therefore the chromium removal method in this study has great practical application potential 3 4 fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticle regeneration and reuse experiments amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles were found to be effective in removing chromium from chromium containing tanning wastewater however the spent magnetic nanoparticles combined with chromium are regarded as hazardous waste in wastewater treatment plants hazardous waste disposal costs are very high regeneration of the spent amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles not only reduces the disposal cost of hazardous waste but also increases the reusability of amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles and thus reduces the wastewater treatment cost using sodium hypochlorite 10 solution can oxidize the chromium bound on the surface of amino fe3o4 particles into hexavalent chromium to form solution and the organic substances on the surface of the particles were oxidized at the same time 25 the further processing of the hexavalent chromium solution can realize the recovery of chromium fig 10 shows the evaporated chromium recovered in this experiment since hexavalent chromium is a very toxic heavy metal element we must remove it 26 the hexavalent chromium on the surface of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles can be reduced to trivalent chromium by ferrous sulfate solution to eliminate its toxicity 27 28 therefore the amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles that have reacted with the sodium hypochlorite solution are soaked in the ferrous sulfate solution and then washed with deionized water after magnetic separation to achieve amino fe3o4 particles regeneration the capture efficiency and outlet chromium concentration of magnetic bar separator for low concentration chromium containing wastewater treatment with regeneration magnetic nanoparticles are shown in fig 11 when the regenerated amino fe3o4 are recycled for 9 times the capture efficiency of chromium can be maintained above 99 6 when used for 4 times the average outlet chromium concentration is 0 152 mg l after being recycled for 4 times the outlet chromium concentration gradually increased and at the 9th time the outlet chromium concentration is 0 402 mg l in summary the amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles can be recycled at least 9 times this can greatly reduce the cost of wastewater treatment in practical applications the raw materials for the production of amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles can also be replaced the price of industrial grade ferric salt is at least 10 times cheaper than laboratory grade the technology has great practical application prospects 4 conclusions we designed a magnetic separator for application in wastewater treatment the device enables high throughput high gradient magnetic separation of magnetic nanoparticles and easy cleaning by utilizing 4 vertical aligned magnetic bars and a in situ cleaning scraper the capture efficiency of 15 nm fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles in simulated wastewater could keep more than 99 4 within 3 h the magnetic separator was applied to capture chromium ions in tanning wastewater through 15 nm magnetic nanoparticles absorption the capture efficiency of chromium ions can keep 99 7 within 5 h the chromium concentration is less than 0 5 mg l in processed water the wastewater treatment capacity is 18 l h the treatment capacity can be further increased by using more and or longer magnetic bars we will perform a pilot experiment in order to find out the capture efficiency of chromium ions in tanning wastewater using larger scale separator over long term the chromium in wastewater can be completely recycled which greatly reduces the cost of hazardous waste treatment the amino fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles are recycled 9 times the capture efficiency of chromium is as high as 99 6 and the outlet chromium concentration is always lower than 0 5 mg l credit

13622,microalgae scenedesmus obliquus dewatering using forward osmosis membrane has received considerable attention for its possible application in biofuel generation to investigate the filtration performance by analyzing permeate water flux five different velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s were selected in a bench scale experiments the results showed that the optimal flux was with 0 55 m s velocity moreover the same velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s and three various spacer positions 0 3 mm 1 mm and 2 mm away from the membrane were simulated employing the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach the results showed that the pressure and velocity distribution were affected by the velocities at the module inlet and the spacer configuration and the 0 55 m s velocity was confirmed while the cfd revealed that the velocity distribution was relatively uniform and exerted a higher pressure on the membrane and 0 55 m s velocity agreed with the experiment in optimal operation as for the spacer configurations they were evenly distributed in the channel and the optimum structures occurred when the spacers were 1 mm away from the membrane the spacer is beneficial for alleviating external concentration polarization ecp during osmosis process keywords microalgae dewatering forward osmosis computational fluid dynamics hydraulics condition optimization external concentration polarization 1 introduction microalgae technology is widely used in food nutrition aquatic products environmental protection energy agriculture industry etc and the cost of algae harvesting cell drying and oil extraction accounted for 50 of the production cost 1 the bottleneck of algae water separation restricts the application of microalgae in the fields of sewage nitrogen uptake and advanced treatment large scale cultivation and energy 2 recently forward osmosis fo technology for microalgae pretreatment to further dewatering process has drawn great attention due to its potential low energy consumption its ability to reject a high level of contaminants and its being subject to much less membrane fouling 3 5 the processes of dewatering usually achieved by centrifugation flocculation sedimentation pressure driven membrane processes or the combinations of these processes have a number of disadvantages such as high consumption of energy algal cells breakage high susceptibility to fouling and negative effect on biomass quality 6 7 for example landels et al 8 concentrated on electrocoagulation flotation ecf and the efficient rapid and scalable dewatering of microalgal cultures to yield 13 algal biomass load was ideal for direct downstream processing by hydrothermal liquefaction yusra et al 9 used air sparging to perform ultrafiltration on microalgae dewatering the results showed that the gas sparging could inhibit the formation of microalgae filter cake layer and improve the recovery of permeation flux and biomass however these physical or chemical operations are either cost effective or susceptible to irreversible fouling 10 different from those conventional methods especially pressure driven membrane processes fo process a semipermeable membrane is placed between a microalgal solution of low concentration 0 1 0 2 g dry wt l and a draw solution ds of high concentration this can be achieved by driving water through a membrane under a differential osmotic pressure 11 13 however the concentration polarization cp phenomenon does occur accompanied by the separation process and cause a severe flux decline during the fo process 14 17 this phenomenon can be further classified as internal concentration polarization icp in the membrane support layer and external concentration polarization ecp on the membrane surface layer 18 19 the ecp originating from the solute of feed solution accumulates on the active layer and the draw solution concentration is commonly diluted by the permeating water 20 21 it is the barrier that reduces the effective osmosis pressure differential and subsequently the water flux of the process especially in the low velocity and without spacers 22 24 therefore it is necessary to determine the hydrodynamic conditions of the membrane surface and optimize the module channel s hydraulic conditions to reduce the influence of ecp 25 26 further research on hydrodynamic characteristics e g spacer design has been conducted for example liu et al 27 investigated spacer impacts caused by the velocity field and proposed that the boundary layer at membrane surface may be disturbed by turbulence and the bulk solution absorb the solute which diffused back from the layer the theoretical method of computational fluid dynamics cfd as a powerful method seeks to predict and investigate fluid flow mass transfer heat transfer and other related phenomena 28 31 currently cfd was assisted in the design and associated with running repeated experiments 32 33 to investigate the velocity field for a channel with a permeate flow through a wall hansen et al 34 established a spectral element method to solve the navier stokes equations indicating that mass transfer would increase between neighboring filaments due to shedding of vortices consequently the best mass transfer at certain values of filament spacing channel height ratio was evident 35 36 cao et al 37 evaluating the velocity profile of the spacer filled channel by utilizing the cfd simulation method confirmed that the presence of spacer would cause eddy activity on the membrane surface to promote mass transfer and reduce fouling while plausibly improving local shear stress abdelbaky and el refaee 38 reported a spacer channels incorporated in membrane modules for reverse osmosis applications in which the feed spacer functioned to promote turbulence improve mass transfer and reduce concentration polarization many cfd simulation studies indicated the relationship between hydraulic configuration and permeation efficiency 39 40 this line of research tried to numerically and experimentally optimize the hydraulic conditions on the membrane and examined the characteristics of flow field under configurations with different flow velocities and spacers in the osmosis process to do numerical analysis forward membrane module has been designed by using 3d cfd simulation in which liquid velocity and pressure distribution have been taken into consideration 21 41 in these studies to investigate the filtration performance of microalgae dewatering by analyzing permeate water flux five velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s were selected in lab scale experiments then the same velocities and spacer positions 0 3 mm 1 mm and 2 mm away from the membrane between the membrane and channel were selected for further study in addition the piezo film sensor was employed in the experimental investigation to verify the obtained simulation results 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae cultivation and fs ds preparation scenedesmus obliquus shanghai guangyu biological technology co ltd was chosen as model microalgal species due to its frequent application in biofuels production and wastewater treatment 42 the bg11 medium was used to pre culture scenedesmus obliquus the culture temperature was 25 the light intensity was 3000 4000 lx and the light dark time ratio was 12 h 12 h the algae suspensions were continuously stirred at room temperature 25 1 c by injecting air at a rate of 60 l h in the microalgae dewatering experiment with the fo system 500 ml of scenedesmus obliquus solution 0 1 g l and 200 ml of 1 m nacl ar tianjin sinopharm chemical reagent china were used for fs and ds respectively both fs and ds used deionized water di milli qgard az mingche integral merck millipore china and the al ds mode active layer facing draw solution was adopted 2 2 bench scale test system in the first part of the experiment to investigate permeate flux during the fo process with an active surface area of approximately 14 cm2 bench scale tests were conducted fig 1 two tubing pumps wt600 2j yz1515x longer china were applied to inject the feed and draw solutions into the channel simultaneously at the different rotating rates of feed and draw solutions to investigate permeate flux difference on the fo membrane a commercially available cta fo membrane seapack crew emergency desalination pouch hti usa was used in this study two flow meters lzb 6 were used to monitor the flow rate at both lines of ds and fs in the system a conductivity meter hi98197 hanna usa was used to record both conductivity and temperature of the fs an electronic analytical balance me2002 t mettler toledo china was used to measure the weight change of ds and determine the permeate flux at same time five different velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s were selected to investigate the filtration performance of microalgae dewatering by analyzing permeate water flux the water flux l m2 h was determined by the following eq 1 1 jw δ m ρ at where δm is the measured weight interval for the water that permeates from the fs to the ds g ρ is the density of water g cm3 a is the effective membrane surface area m2 and t is duration of the experiment h the ds weight change was monitored at 5 min intervals by using the me2002 t balance 2 3 fo membrane module in the second part of the experiment the fo membrane module had symmetrical channels that allow separate circulation of fs ds and it was made from custom made flat organic glass the rectangular channel was 7 cm 2 cm 0 3 cm in size the inlet diameter was designed to be 0 4 cm the membrane was sandwiched between two organic glass plates by using a silicon gasket and six stainless steel screws the effective membrane area was the same as the first part of the experiment in this module furthermore the cta fo membrane was placed under the spacers in the feed channel and the spacer gap was determined by thickness of the silicon gasket 2 4 simulation experimental setup the al fs orientation was adopted in fo performance experiments a piezo film of rectangle area 11 mm 15 mm in size was attached to the central section of the membrane surface the fs and ds were prepared by dissolving analytical grade nacl tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china in pure water or deionized di water milli qgard az mingche integral merck millipore china the draw solutions consisted of five concentrations 32 g l 50 g l 70 g l 100 g l 117 g l while the fs was 5 g l nacl resembling the concentration of brackish water bw the same method was adopted to establish the experimental setup as shown in fig 1 and a magnetic stirring apparatus rct was used to mix the fs and adjust its temperature an me2002 t scale was used to measure the weight change of draw solution and determine the permeate flux at the same time voltage acquisition system used a voltmeter one end of the voltmeter connected with the piezoelectric film to achieve the output voltage the other end connected with the computer to obtain real time count 2 5 piezo film commercially metallized piezo film sheets 11 mm 15 mm in size from meas united states were used in the second experiment the upper and lower surfaces of the pvdf film were covered with a thin silver electrode layer and the conductive silver glue from capiton sci technology company was coated with the silver electrode layer to lead the wire from the electrode layer the silver ink was used for electrode materials of pvdf thick films in the metallization stage 28 um thick films were chosen for this analysis the pressure on the surface of forward membrane was measured by piezoelectric pvdf sensors the piezoelectric film was attached to the surface of the film for testing as shown in fig 2 pvdf film parameters are shown in table 1 the operating theory of pvdf film elements was employed that when force is applied to compress or bend the film pvdf will generate an external charge that is called piezoelectric effect 43 which can be glued to the surface of the electrode to generate electrical signals i e the signal output by the universal meter the pressure can be calculated by eq 2 2 x v 0 g 3 n x n t where g3n is the piezoelectric coefficient xn is the stress added in the relative direction t is piezoelectric film thickness and n is 3 in our study due to the electrode positions top mid bottom on the film 44 2 6 cfd model and simulations to examine the hydrodynamic conditions single phase flow was used in three dimensional 3d simulations to the membrane surface it was assumed that the fluid is newtonian incompressible and isothermal turbulent and has constant physical properties under steady state conditions 1 45 46 the governing equations for modeling fluid flow in a steady state system are the conservation of continuity and momentum equations listed below 47 i continuity equation 3 ρ ν 0 ii momentum equation 4 ρ ν ν p τ ρ g where ρ is density kg m3 ν is velocity m s τ is stress tensor pa p is pressure pa τ is surface shear stress pa and g is the gravitational force n in this work a geometric 3d block module with 15 spacers distributed throughout the length of the chamber was investigated which was simulated with approximately 390 w 313 w and 372 w cooper cells with different spacer positions 0 3 mm 1 mm 2 mm away from the membrane a fine mesh was generated because of the importance of flow around the membrane surface and spacers in this region the model included inlet and outlet tubes with diameters of 4 mm and lengths of 3 mm to model the flow combining the simple pressure velocity and segregated solution method the governing equations were established and were discretized into a whole volume in the one order scheme the standard k ε was used to model the turbulent flow behavior 48 49 five analysis surfaces along the gallery were set up at an interval of 10 mm and recorded as y 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m 0 05 m respectively the flow fields on each analytical surface were investigated for different inlet velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s fig 3 presents membrane module model and the velocity analysis location on membrane surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different feed velocities on fo performance fig 4 shows the membrane flux trends in the 6 h bench scale experiment under given velocities as shown in all the cases the reaction time increased while water flux declined this decline is attributed to 1 the loss of osmotic driving force of the whole fo membrane due to the dilution in the draw solution and 2 membrane fouling 50 from 0 23 m s to 0 55 m s the feed velocities was positively related to the value of water flux with a given concentration of draw solution however the water flux showed lower value at the velocity of 0 66 m s than at 0 55 m s but still higher than at other velocities thus 0 55 m s velocity exhibited a much greater water flux compared with the others during the whole fo process this observation coincides with the previous study 51 as the inlet velocities directly change in water flux to better understand the character of membrane fouling under microalgae dewatering process the effect of hydraulics conditions in fo process should be investigated 3 2 impact of operational conditions five flow rates ranging from 150 ml min to 400 ml min corresponding to velocities of 0 2 0 7 m s at the module inlet were simulated in this study and the influent flow hydrodynamics on the membrane surface was researched fig 5 and fig 6 show the velocity and pressure profiles on the membrane surface under three different operational conditions the fluid flowed upward in the space between the channel and membrane fig 5 a presents a predicted velocity profiles on the membrane surface in five velocities and fig 5 b shows speed profiles at different sections 3 2 1 velocity profiles on the membrane surface under different operational conditions the cross flow velocity of the membrane surface was generally low at about 0 035 m s while the inlet velocity was 0 23 m s fig 5 nevertheless the average cross flow velocities reached 0 048 m s and 0 066 m s while the inlet velocities were 0 31 m s and 0 40 m s respectively and the high velocity near the central axis of membrane began to increase the cross flow velocity went down gradually along with the increased distance from the axis the lower cross flow velocity was difficult to guarantee the high stability of the fo permeate process which is mainly because the lower inlet velocities in the system would lead to strong erosion of the entrance and weak erosion on both sides of membrane and could not cover the entire membrane surface 52 53 therefore it is necessary to set a suitably large inlet velocity during the fo process the distribution area of the higher velocity was increasingly wide with the increase of inlet velocity when the inlet velocity reached 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s the average velocities of the membrane surface were 0 098 m s and 0 12 m s respectively gruber et al 54 used cfd simulation to study the influence of different cross flow velocities on the change of water flux in the fo process and showed that by increasing the tangential flow rate along the fo channel the external concentration polarization could be slowed down and the membrane flux could be increased in this study the area of high fluid velocity could basically cover the entire membrane surface the whole flow field was in a state of high cross flow velocity which could ensure preferable solute mixing and infiltration at each position of the membrane surface during the fo process clearly fig 5 shows that different inlet velocity caused the variation of membrane velocity and distribution and the membrane cross flow velocity increased with the increase of inlet velocity a higher velocity was evident near the inlet entrance and the velocities at velocities of 0 23 m s 0 31 m s and 0 40 m s had a non uniform distribution the higher velocity concentrated at the center of the membrane along the longitudinal direction while decreasing away from the center position when the velocities were 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s the higher velocity covered a larger proportion of the membrane surface than the lower did greater cross flow velocity was at higher velocities on the membrane surface while increasing the turbulence of feed solution which accelerated the solute transfer from the membrane surface layer to the bulk solution and relieved the negative effects caused by the ecp this observation was proven in previous studies for example elimelech and phuntsho 55 56 have shown that the increase of the flow velocity could increase the effective osmotic pressure difference to a certain extent and promote the permeability coefficient of water which was beneficial to the permeation of pure water to the outside of the membrane more importantly it can effectively flush the membrane surface to avoid the accumulation of solute molecules and slow down the concentration polarization to ensure the continuous and stable infiltration process the current study also revealed that the increased velocity improved the effective osmotic driven force difference and subsequently enhanced the water permeation in conclusion the results thus showed that 1 a spatial changing in velocity distribution was generated along the channel and then the permeate flux changed and 2 due to higher velocities higher diffusion loads existed at specific locations on the membrane surface moreover on account of the high velocity generated through flow scour the diffusion load on a particular membrane may result in lower fouling 3 2 2 pressure profiles on the membrane surface under different operational conditions fig 6 illustrates the membrane pressure assignment under five velocities which increased slightly in tandem with the velocities increased the pressure distribution of the membrane surface presents a basically uniform distribution at various velocities when the inlet velocities were 0 23 m s 0 31 m s and 0 40 m s the average pressures of the membrane surface were 80 pa 120 pa and 180 pa respectively as shown in fig 6 a the pressure on the membrane surface increased modestly with the inlet velocity increased however when the inlet velocity reached 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s in fig 6 b the average pressure of the membrane surface increased to 300 pa and 500 pa respectively the membrane pressure assignment in these case was distinctly higher than in other cases this result showed that the pressure assignment on the membrane surface varied with the change of inlet velocities the pressure distribution over the overall membrane area was relatively uniform except near the inlet location where the higher distribution of pressure was produced by hydraulic impact this may be because with the increase of inlet velocity the fluid particle had a movement tendency perpendicular to the membrane surface which affected the infiltration process in addition to the movement along the length of the membrane 57 furthermore this movement tendency also promoted the penetration of water molecules and the hydraulic pressure benefited the water permeation process and enhanced the mass transfer 58 as a consequence the higher membrane pressure produced by enhancing inlet velocity helped improve the permeability of the fo process velocities of 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s which showed good permeability were identified as better operating conditions in this fo process therefore these simulation results indicate that spatial changes in velocity and pressure distribution along the channel were followed by changes in permeate flux nevertheless the pressure distribution in the whole membrane surface was relatively uniform furthermore membrane surface performance could be optimized by increasing the inlet velocity thereby enhancing the performance of the fo process when the inlet velocities were 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s the cross flow velocity and pressure of the membrane surface were larger and the distribution was relatively uniform which was electively better operating condition however there is also energy consumption for increasing the velocity to improve the flow field hence taking into account both of the two factors a velocity of 0 55 m s should be selected as the operation state 3 3 impact of spacers configuration 3 3 1 impact of the number of spacers the selection of the number of submerged type spacers in this study was taken into consideration the result of previous study that of all the configurations submerged type spacers performed the best 59 the spacer diameter was 1 mm and the distance between the spacers was 2 mm in the numerical simulation this section mainly presents the influence of the number of spacers on the flow field at the membrane surface the velocity and the membrane surface pressures were simulated at the inlet velocity of 0 23 m s when three spacer numbers n 1 11 18 were added to the modules figs 7 8 in fig 7 the value of pressure gradually increased with the increase of the spacer number the values of pressure near the center region of the membrane in three spacers varying from 1 to 18 at the inlet velocity of 0 23 m s were 63 pa 75 pa and 94 pa the pressure values of membrane were generally at a high level and mostly distributed in the area where the spacer was located as the spacers were evenly distributed within the module the fluid flow barricaded slightly due to the presence of spacers caused pressure changes on the membrane surface the outcome of pressure change might be beneficial to mass transfer in the osmosis process the velocity distribution on the membrane surface at three spacer numbers are illustrated in fig 8 when the spacer number was 1 the higher velocity was approximately 0 096 m s concentrated at the center of the membrane along the width direction while the velocity on other positions was relatively low this may be attributed to the presence of spacer resulting in restricted membrane fluid flow which in turn caused the non uniformity of the velocities distribution on the membrane 60 when n 11 the spacers were distributed over most of the module obviously the flow velocity in the area with no spacer began to decrease and the inhomogeneity of the whole membrane surface still existed when f or n 18 the spacer had a complete coverage inside the module and the distribution of the higher velocity region was wider which is better than that in other cases in conclusion the velocity and pressure on the membrane surface showed non uniform distribution due to the location of the spacers the phenomenon of non uniform distribution remained when the number was 11 optimum velocity on the membrane surface occurred when the spacer number was 18 and at that particular moment the spacers were evenly distributed in the channel the presence of spacers ensured a more uniform spatial mass transfer over the membrane and increased the average membrane mass transfer in the osmosis process 53 as a result 18 spacers were selected as the ideal spacer configuration 3 3 2 impact of space structure in the modules three spacer positions 0 3 mm 1 mm and 2 mm away from the membrane between the membrane and channel were used to examine the hydrodynamics of fluid flow and the spacers were guaranteed to be uniformly distributed the liquid velocities of membrane surface were analyzed in the flowing sections at the channel width of 1 mm upward along the length direction of the module fig 9 illustrates the velocity streamlines the partially enlarged detail of solution in the channels when the spacer was 0 3 mm away from the membrane the flow velocities in the fo feed channel demonstrated obvious variation in the transverse direction accompanied with the emergence of vortex however the low fluid velocity over the membrane surface could generate the negative influence on mass transfer on one hand spacers could increase the cross flow on the membrane interface to some extent and lead to the greater turbulence in the channel on the other hand the spacer could infect the drag friction of boundary layer which resulted in the loss of momentum and intensified degree of ecp 61 when the spacer is 1 mm away from the film the average velocity is about 0 041 m s which is higher than the average velocity above the film when the spacer is 2 mm away from the film which is 0 036 m s in the high velocity scenario the particles in the fs were much easier to leave from the membrane surface to the stream which could alleviate ecp effectively to improve fo permeability a higher cross flow velocity would have a better effect on the penetration of water molecules and the shear force on the membrane surface 60 hence considering fo flow conditions which have on the most favorable permeability the optimum spacer configuration existed when the spacers were 1 mm away from the membrane 3 4 comparison of experiments and simulations in this section the pressure caused by the cross flow was calculated based on eq 2 the cfd simulation was confirmed by the lab experiment in which four different velocities were adopted ranging from 0 25 m s to 0 40 m s at the module inlet according to fig 10 the experiment and simulated results of the shear pressure on the surface were coincident furthermore a good agreement between experimental and cfd results motivated further numerical studies regarding the effects on the pressure and flow velocity distribution of changing cross flow velocity the results showed that

13622,microalgae scenedesmus obliquus dewatering using forward osmosis membrane has received considerable attention for its possible application in biofuel generation to investigate the filtration performance by analyzing permeate water flux five different velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s were selected in a bench scale experiments the results showed that the optimal flux was with 0 55 m s velocity moreover the same velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s and three various spacer positions 0 3 mm 1 mm and 2 mm away from the membrane were simulated employing the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach the results showed that the pressure and velocity distribution were affected by the velocities at the module inlet and the spacer configuration and the 0 55 m s velocity was confirmed while the cfd revealed that the velocity distribution was relatively uniform and exerted a higher pressure on the membrane and 0 55 m s velocity agreed with the experiment in optimal operation as for the spacer configurations they were evenly distributed in the channel and the optimum structures occurred when the spacers were 1 mm away from the membrane the spacer is beneficial for alleviating external concentration polarization ecp during osmosis process keywords microalgae dewatering forward osmosis computational fluid dynamics hydraulics condition optimization external concentration polarization 1 introduction microalgae technology is widely used in food nutrition aquatic products environmental protection energy agriculture industry etc and the cost of algae harvesting cell drying and oil extraction accounted for 50 of the production cost 1 the bottleneck of algae water separation restricts the application of microalgae in the fields of sewage nitrogen uptake and advanced treatment large scale cultivation and energy 2 recently forward osmosis fo technology for microalgae pretreatment to further dewatering process has drawn great attention due to its potential low energy consumption its ability to reject a high level of contaminants and its being subject to much less membrane fouling 3 5 the processes of dewatering usually achieved by centrifugation flocculation sedimentation pressure driven membrane processes or the combinations of these processes have a number of disadvantages such as high consumption of energy algal cells breakage high susceptibility to fouling and negative effect on biomass quality 6 7 for example landels et al 8 concentrated on electrocoagulation flotation ecf and the efficient rapid and scalable dewatering of microalgal cultures to yield 13 algal biomass load was ideal for direct downstream processing by hydrothermal liquefaction yusra et al 9 used air sparging to perform ultrafiltration on microalgae dewatering the results showed that the gas sparging could inhibit the formation of microalgae filter cake layer and improve the recovery of permeation flux and biomass however these physical or chemical operations are either cost effective or susceptible to irreversible fouling 10 different from those conventional methods especially pressure driven membrane processes fo process a semipermeable membrane is placed between a microalgal solution of low concentration 0 1 0 2 g dry wt l and a draw solution ds of high concentration this can be achieved by driving water through a membrane under a differential osmotic pressure 11 13 however the concentration polarization cp phenomenon does occur accompanied by the separation process and cause a severe flux decline during the fo process 14 17 this phenomenon can be further classified as internal concentration polarization icp in the membrane support layer and external concentration polarization ecp on the membrane surface layer 18 19 the ecp originating from the solute of feed solution accumulates on the active layer and the draw solution concentration is commonly diluted by the permeating water 20 21 it is the barrier that reduces the effective osmosis pressure differential and subsequently the water flux of the process especially in the low velocity and without spacers 22 24 therefore it is necessary to determine the hydrodynamic conditions of the membrane surface and optimize the module channel s hydraulic conditions to reduce the influence of ecp 25 26 further research on hydrodynamic characteristics e g spacer design has been conducted for example liu et al 27 investigated spacer impacts caused by the velocity field and proposed that the boundary layer at membrane surface may be disturbed by turbulence and the bulk solution absorb the solute which diffused back from the layer the theoretical method of computational fluid dynamics cfd as a powerful method seeks to predict and investigate fluid flow mass transfer heat transfer and other related phenomena 28 31 currently cfd was assisted in the design and associated with running repeated experiments 32 33 to investigate the velocity field for a channel with a permeate flow through a wall hansen et al 34 established a spectral element method to solve the navier stokes equations indicating that mass transfer would increase between neighboring filaments due to shedding of vortices consequently the best mass transfer at certain values of filament spacing channel height ratio was evident 35 36 cao et al 37 evaluating the velocity profile of the spacer filled channel by utilizing the cfd simulation method confirmed that the presence of spacer would cause eddy activity on the membrane surface to promote mass transfer and reduce fouling while plausibly improving local shear stress abdelbaky and el refaee 38 reported a spacer channels incorporated in membrane modules for reverse osmosis applications in which the feed spacer functioned to promote turbulence improve mass transfer and reduce concentration polarization many cfd simulation studies indicated the relationship between hydraulic configuration and permeation efficiency 39 40 this line of research tried to numerically and experimentally optimize the hydraulic conditions on the membrane and examined the characteristics of flow field under configurations with different flow velocities and spacers in the osmosis process to do numerical analysis forward membrane module has been designed by using 3d cfd simulation in which liquid velocity and pressure distribution have been taken into consideration 21 41 in these studies to investigate the filtration performance of microalgae dewatering by analyzing permeate water flux five velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s were selected in lab scale experiments then the same velocities and spacer positions 0 3 mm 1 mm and 2 mm away from the membrane between the membrane and channel were selected for further study in addition the piezo film sensor was employed in the experimental investigation to verify the obtained simulation results 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae cultivation and fs ds preparation scenedesmus obliquus shanghai guangyu biological technology co ltd was chosen as model microalgal species due to its frequent application in biofuels production and wastewater treatment 42 the bg11 medium was used to pre culture scenedesmus obliquus the culture temperature was 25 the light intensity was 3000 4000 lx and the light dark time ratio was 12 h 12 h the algae suspensions were continuously stirred at room temperature 25 1 c by injecting air at a rate of 60 l h in the microalgae dewatering experiment with the fo system 500 ml of scenedesmus obliquus solution 0 1 g l and 200 ml of 1 m nacl ar tianjin sinopharm chemical reagent china were used for fs and ds respectively both fs and ds used deionized water di milli qgard az mingche integral merck millipore china and the al ds mode active layer facing draw solution was adopted 2 2 bench scale test system in the first part of the experiment to investigate permeate flux during the fo process with an active surface area of approximately 14 cm2 bench scale tests were conducted fig 1 two tubing pumps wt600 2j yz1515x longer china were applied to inject the feed and draw solutions into the channel simultaneously at the different rotating rates of feed and draw solutions to investigate permeate flux difference on the fo membrane a commercially available cta fo membrane seapack crew emergency desalination pouch hti usa was used in this study two flow meters lzb 6 were used to monitor the flow rate at both lines of ds and fs in the system a conductivity meter hi98197 hanna usa was used to record both conductivity and temperature of the fs an electronic analytical balance me2002 t mettler toledo china was used to measure the weight change of ds and determine the permeate flux at same time five different velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s were selected to investigate the filtration performance of microalgae dewatering by analyzing permeate water flux the water flux l m2 h was determined by the following eq 1 1 jw δ m ρ at where δm is the measured weight interval for the water that permeates from the fs to the ds g ρ is the density of water g cm3 a is the effective membrane surface area m2 and t is duration of the experiment h the ds weight change was monitored at 5 min intervals by using the me2002 t balance 2 3 fo membrane module in the second part of the experiment the fo membrane module had symmetrical channels that allow separate circulation of fs ds and it was made from custom made flat organic glass the rectangular channel was 7 cm 2 cm 0 3 cm in size the inlet diameter was designed to be 0 4 cm the membrane was sandwiched between two organic glass plates by using a silicon gasket and six stainless steel screws the effective membrane area was the same as the first part of the experiment in this module furthermore the cta fo membrane was placed under the spacers in the feed channel and the spacer gap was determined by thickness of the silicon gasket 2 4 simulation experimental setup the al fs orientation was adopted in fo performance experiments a piezo film of rectangle area 11 mm 15 mm in size was attached to the central section of the membrane surface the fs and ds were prepared by dissolving analytical grade nacl tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china in pure water or deionized di water milli qgard az mingche integral merck millipore china the draw solutions consisted of five concentrations 32 g l 50 g l 70 g l 100 g l 117 g l while the fs was 5 g l nacl resembling the concentration of brackish water bw the same method was adopted to establish the experimental setup as shown in fig 1 and a magnetic stirring apparatus rct was used to mix the fs and adjust its temperature an me2002 t scale was used to measure the weight change of draw solution and determine the permeate flux at the same time voltage acquisition system used a voltmeter one end of the voltmeter connected with the piezoelectric film to achieve the output voltage the other end connected with the computer to obtain real time count 2 5 piezo film commercially metallized piezo film sheets 11 mm 15 mm in size from meas united states were used in the second experiment the upper and lower surfaces of the pvdf film were covered with a thin silver electrode layer and the conductive silver glue from capiton sci technology company was coated with the silver electrode layer to lead the wire from the electrode layer the silver ink was used for electrode materials of pvdf thick films in the metallization stage 28 um thick films were chosen for this analysis the pressure on the surface of forward membrane was measured by piezoelectric pvdf sensors the piezoelectric film was attached to the surface of the film for testing as shown in fig 2 pvdf film parameters are shown in table 1 the operating theory of pvdf film elements was employed that when force is applied to compress or bend the film pvdf will generate an external charge that is called piezoelectric effect 43 which can be glued to the surface of the electrode to generate electrical signals i e the signal output by the universal meter the pressure can be calculated by eq 2 2 x v 0 g 3 n x n t where g3n is the piezoelectric coefficient xn is the stress added in the relative direction t is piezoelectric film thickness and n is 3 in our study due to the electrode positions top mid bottom on the film 44 2 6 cfd model and simulations to examine the hydrodynamic conditions single phase flow was used in three dimensional 3d simulations to the membrane surface it was assumed that the fluid is newtonian incompressible and isothermal turbulent and has constant physical properties under steady state conditions 1 45 46 the governing equations for modeling fluid flow in a steady state system are the conservation of continuity and momentum equations listed below 47 i continuity equation 3 ρ ν 0 ii

geometric 3d block module with 15 spacers distributed throughout the length of the chamber was investigated which was simulated with approximately 390 w 313 w and 372 w cooper cells with different spacer positions 0 3 mm 1 mm 2 mm away from the membrane a fine mesh was generated because of the importance of flow around the membrane surface and spacers in this region the model included inlet and outlet tubes with diameters of 4 mm and lengths of 3 mm to model the flow combining the simple pressure velocity and segregated solution method the governing equations were established and were discretized into a whole volume in the one order scheme the standard k ε was used to model the turbulent flow behavior 48 49 five analysis surfaces along the gallery were set up at an interval of 10 mm and recorded as y 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m 0 05 m respectively the flow fields on each analytical surface were investigated for different inlet velocities 0 23 m s 0 31 m s 0 40 m s 0 55 m s 0 66 m s fig 3 presents membrane module model and the velocity analysis location on membrane surface 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different feed velocities on fo performance fig 4 shows the membrane flux trends in the 6 h bench scale experiment under given velocities as shown in all the cases the reaction time increased while water flux declined this decline is attributed to 1 the loss of osmotic driving force of the whole fo membrane due to the dilution in the draw solution and 2 membrane fouling 50 from 0 23 m s to 0 55 m s the feed velocities was positively related to the value of water flux with a given concentration of draw solution however the water flux showed lower value at the velocity of 0 66 m s than at 0 55 m s but still higher than at other velocities thus 0 55 m s velocity exhibited a much greater water flux compared with the others during the whole fo process this observation coincides with the previous study 51 as the inlet velocities directly change in water flux to better understand the character of membrane fouling under microalgae dewatering process the effect of hydraulics conditions in fo process should be investigated 3 2 impact of operational conditions five flow rates ranging from 150 ml min to 400 ml min corresponding to velocities of 0 2 0 7 m s at the module inlet were simulated in this study and the influent flow hydrodynamics on the membrane surface was researched fig 5 and fig 6 show the velocity and pressure profiles on the membrane surface under three different operational conditions the fluid flowed upward in the space between the channel and membrane fig 5 a presents a predicted velocity profiles on the membrane surface in five velocities and fig 5 b shows speed profiles at different sections 3 2 1 velocity profiles on the membrane surface under different operational conditions the cross flow velocity of the membrane surface was generally low at about 0 035 m s while the inlet velocity was 0 23 m s fig 5 nevertheless the average cross flow velocities reached 0 048 m s and 0 066 m s while the inlet velocities were 0 31 m s and 0 40 m s respectively and the high velocity near the central axis of membrane began to increase the cross flow velocity went down gradually along with the increased distance from the axis the lower cross flow velocity was difficult to guarantee the high stability of the fo permeate process which is mainly because the lower inlet velocities in the system would lead to strong erosion of the entrance and weak erosion on both sides of membrane and could not cover the entire membrane surface 52 53 therefore it is necessary to set a suitably large inlet velocity during the fo process the distribution area of the higher velocity was increasingly wide with the increase of inlet velocity when the inlet velocity reached 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s the average velocities of the membrane surface were 0 098 m s and 0 12 m s respectively gruber et al 54 used cfd simulation to study the influence of different cross flow velocities on the change of water flux in the fo process and showed that by increasing the tangential flow rate along the fo channel the external concentration polarization could be slowed down and the membrane flux could be increased in this study the area of high fluid velocity could basically cover the entire membrane surface the whole flow field was in a state of high cross flow velocity which could ensure preferable solute mixing and infiltration at each position of the membrane surface during the fo process clearly fig 5 shows that different inlet velocity caused the variation of membrane velocity and distribution and the membrane cross flow velocity increased with the increase of inlet velocity a higher velocity was evident near the inlet entrance and the velocities at velocities of 0 23 m s 0 31 m s and 0 40 m s had a non uniform distribution the higher velocity concentrated at the center of the membrane along the longitudinal direction while decreasing away from the center position when the velocities were 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s the higher velocity covered a larger proportion of the membrane surface than the lower did greater cross flow velocity was at higher velocities on the membrane surface while increasing the turbulence of feed solution which accelerated the solute transfer from the membrane surface layer to the bulk solution and relieved the negative effects caused by the ecp this observation was proven in previous studies for example elimelech and phuntsho 55 56 have shown that the increase of the flow velocity could increase the effective osmotic pressure difference to a certain extent and promote the permeability coefficient of water which was beneficial to the permeation of pure water to the outside of the membrane more importantly it can effectively flush the membrane surface to avoid the accumulation of solute molecules and slow down the concentration polarization to ensure the continuous and stable infiltration process the current study also revealed that the increased velocity improved the effective osmotic driven force difference and subsequently enhanced the water permeation in conclusion the results thus showed that 1 a spatial changing in velocity distribution was generated along the channel and then the permeate flux changed and 2 due to higher velocities higher diffusion loads existed at specific locations on the membrane surface moreover on account of the high velocity generated through flow scour the diffusion load on a particular membrane may result in lower fouling 3 2 2 pressure profiles on the membrane surface under different operational conditions fig 6 illustrates the membrane pressure assignment under five velocities which increased slightly in tandem with the velocities increased the pressure distribution of the membrane surface presents a basically uniform distribution at various velocities when the inlet velocities were 0 23 m s 0 31 m s and 0 40 m s the average pressures of the membrane surface were 80 pa 120 pa and 180 pa respectively as shown in fig 6 a the pressure on the membrane surface increased modestly with the inlet velocity increased however when the inlet velocity reached 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s in fig 6 b the average pressure of the membrane surface increased to 300 pa and 500 pa respectively the membrane pressure assignment in these case was distinctly higher than in other cases this result showed that the pressure assignment on the membrane surface varied with the change of inlet velocities the pressure distribution over the overall membrane area was relatively uniform except near the inlet location where the higher distribution of pressure was produced by hydraulic impact this may be because with the increase of inlet velocity the fluid particle had a movement tendency perpendicular to the membrane surface which affected the infiltration process in addition to the movement along the length of the membrane 57 furthermore this movement tendency also promoted the penetration of water molecules and the hydraulic pressure benefited the water permeation process and enhanced the mass transfer 58 as a consequence the higher membrane pressure produced by enhancing inlet velocity helped improve the permeability of the fo process velocities of 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s which showed good permeability were identified as better operating conditions in this fo process therefore these simulation results indicate that spatial changes in velocity and pressure distribution along the channel were followed by changes in permeate flux nevertheless the pressure distribution in the whole membrane surface was relatively uniform furthermore membrane surface performance could be optimized by increasing the inlet velocity thereby enhancing the performance of the fo process when the inlet velocities were 0 55 m s and 0 66 m s the cross flow velocity and pressure of the membrane surface were larger and the distribution was relatively uniform which was electively better operating condition however there is also energy consumption for increasing the velocity to improve the flow field hence taking into account both of the two factors a velocity of 0 55 m s should be selected as the operation state 3 3 impact of spacers configuration 3 3 1 impact of the number of spacers the selection of the number of submerged type spacers in this study was taken into consideration the result of previous study that of all the configurations submerged type spacers performed the best 59 the spacer diameter was 1 mm and the distance between the spacers was 2 mm in the numerical simulation this section mainly presents the influence of the number of spacers

methods are studied for the removal of toxic metals from aqueous media such as biosorption chemical precipitation electrochemical treatment and reverse osmosis 3 among current treatment processes biosorption has been widely studied for the removal of polluting metals from aqueous solutions 4 promising results have been obtained for the biosorption of toxic metals ranging from zinc copper chromium nickel and cadmium 5 10 to metals with high added value such as silver gold platinum and rare earth metals rems 11 13 biosorption is a process in which biological materials concentrate organic or inorganic species dissolved in aqueous solutions e g metals dyes and emerging pollutants 14 16 this process uses passive physicochemical mechanisms based on the affinity between biomass cells adsorbent and the metal ions adsorbate to be removed and the difference in concentration between the liquid and solid phase 17 its main advantages include low cost efficiency in removing metals in low concentrations good selectivity and the ability to regenerate reuse the adsorbent biomaterial 18 among the biomasses used as adsorbents seaweed microorganisms and agricultural waste have proved to be efficient in removing toxic metals 19 21 aluminum is found in large quantities in its natural form in the earth s crust 22 approximately 63 million tons of aluminum were produced worldwide in 2019 23 its widespread use in different industrial sectors that involve aluminum processing from its mining through finishing procedures such as rolling machining and casting to its final application as a chemical produces high amounts of effluents contaminated by this metal inadequate disposal of these effluents in bodies of water causes several environmental problems affecting aquatic systems soils plants and living beings 24 the maximum amount of aluminum tolerated in bodies of water and industrial effluents is determined by environmental inspection bodies with small variations between countries in particular the maximum amount of this metal tolerated in drinking water is controlled by national and international government sectors linked to the area of health like the world health organization who an in depth literature search using scopus database indicated that over the last 25 years the biosorption of aluminum has been the subject of several papers the search was performed using the keywords biosorption aluminum and similar as displayed in fig 1 the number of publications varies from year to year however it is observed that recently in 2016 and 2019 publications on aluminum biosorption were more numerous considering the environmental context this work features a review of surveys that specifically address the removal of aluminum by biosorption processes that use unconventional and low cost materials as biosorbents therefore the main topics addressed in this review are i overview of aluminum applications toxicological effects and legislation ii brief introduction to processes for aluminum removal iii theoretical aspects of biosorption processes biosorbents mechanisms kinetics equilibrium thermodynamics fixed bed applications iv performance evaluation of non conventional biosorbents for aluminum removal bacteria fungus algae and agro industrial wastes v future prospects for biosorption of aluminum ions 2 chemical speciation applications and environmental toxicological effects of aluminum classified in group 13 th of the periodic table aluminum is one of the most common and reactive metals in nature the form in which it occurs in the environment depends directly on the ph as this is the main factor governing its solubility in aqueous media fig 2 shows the direct dependence between the ph of the medium and the percentage of formation of species derived from the metal the speciation diagram was simulated using visual minteq 3 1 software 25 with the initial aluminum concentration of 3 mmol l at ph values below 5 the al3 ion which is the most toxic form of the metal in the environment is more easily formed as the ph increases the formation of precipitated species al oh 3 is favored a condition associated with their strong affinity with hydroxide forming ions responsible for the phenomenon of precipitation 26 27 some toxic metals such as zinc and iron are considered essential to living organisms and have been recommended as daily intakes 1 however there is no evidence of the biological relevance of aluminum for humans which may be linked to its characteristic of low solubility in neutral ph ranges between 6 5 and 7 5 such as that of the blood flow in evolutionarily terms therefore aluminum ion dependent metabolisms would be unviable 22 due to its physical and chemical characteristics such as high conductivity malleability and corrosion resistance aluminum is extensively used in several industrial sectors in the machine and construction industries aluminum is used mainly to compose metal alloys in the pharmaceutical industry in turn its use is focused on packaging antacids and vaccines aluminum is also used in the textile industry as a tanning agent for leather in addition aluminum sulfate and polyaluminum chloride pac are the main coagulating agents used in water treatment plants 22 28 in literature effluents with aluminum levels vary greatly on dependence of the region of collect and the effluent origin e g comber et al 29 found al iii total concentration around 0 05 0 45 mg l for effluents from water treatment plant in uk while maleki et al 30 observed an aluminum concentration of 2 mg l on the final discharge from a water treatment plant in iran shaaban et al performed a vast analysis of real effluents from industrial district of borg el arab egypt and found relatively high concentrations of aluminum for example in food sector the aluminum concentration reached 39 03 mg l and in metal processing al iii levels around 4 38 mg l were found intensive use therefore generates a large amount of effluent contaminated by the metal which is sometimes discarded into bodies of water without proper treatment triggering several damages to the environment and human health another form of contamination may occur in water treatment systems where the use of aluminum derivatives may leave residue even in treated water 31 besides exposure in contaminated environments humans are also exposed to aluminum ions through the daily use of products such as deodorants and antacids which contain significant amounts of this metal ion 27 food additives containing aluminum are also commonly used especially in the baking industry however since 2019 the world health organization who expert committee on chemical additives has discouraged its use in several food categories normally the main routes of metal contamination are oral and respiratory and more than 95 of the aluminum consumed daily is rapidly eliminated by the urinary system except in the case of individuals suffering from some kind of kidney failure or children under one year old and adults over 60 years old in this case oral intake of aluminum can be highly harmful with the metal absorbed into the bloodstream tending to accumulate mainly in the bones 32 according to the toxicological opinion issued by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 33 aluminum levels present in products consumed daily are considered safe for humans but several studies suggest the need for further investigation stephens and jolliff 28 observed that when the metal is absorbed into the bloodstream around 40 binds to bones and muscles and may even reach the brain aluminum may negatively affect bone mineralization and inhibit bone cell growth and activity 34 other researchers have investigated the relationship between aluminum and neurological diseases such as alzheimer s disease but studies with more conclusive results are still needed 35 37 in plants toxic effects caused by the accumulation of aluminum include deficiency in nutrient absorption and transport genotype changes and biomass reduction with roots being the most affected area excessive aluminum also considerably decreases cell respiration and the transport of water and other macronutrients such as calcium phosphorus and magnesium a condition that may be linked to competition between those metals and aluminum for active sites 32 soil acidification is a factor strictly linked to aluminum phytotoxicity initially the metal exists in the nature in a harmless form such as aluminosilicates or aluminum oxides in clays but when the ph of the soil reaches values below 5 0 this metal is solubilized in forms potentially toxic to plants such as al 3 38 organisms living in aquatic environments are also affected by the presence of aluminum in the form of al3 the effects on fish being the most widely addressed in the literature researchers report that concentrations of this ion form above 0 5 mg l may cause a high mortality rate in several species mainly affecting osmoregulation and the respiratory system 26 39 40 consequently worldwide local legislations standardize the maximum levels of aluminum in drinking water and effluents discharged in water bodies who for example sets its maximum level at 0 2 mg l in water for human consumption 41 3 water and wastewater treatment approaches for aluminum removal aiming to comply with the limits imposed by national and international legislation several treatment alternatives have been studied for the removal of aluminum present in aqueous systems processes such as precipitation ion exchange with resins membrane separation and adsorption have shown satisfactory results for the removal of this metal in the environmental sector 42 precipitation is still the simplest and most used process it consists of the precipitation of al3 ions recovering them in the form of hydroxides basic substances are used for this such as sodium hydroxide which raises the ph of the solution to an average range between 5 8 the precipitate is separated from the solution by filtration or sedimentation 43 however this process is not suitable for large volumes of effluents that contain toxic metals in low concentrations and moreover it produces large amounts of contaminated residual sludge 44 ion exchange is commonly applied for the uptake of toxic metals its mechanism use as basis the electrostatic interaction between the ion of the solution and the surface of the solid resin which consists of a polymeric matrix with functional groups linked to ion exchange resin that can be cationic or anionic 45 satisfactory results have been obtained using cationic resins that present the following order of selectivity 46 al3 pb2 sr2 ca2 cu2 zn2 mg2 k na h although these resins can be reused in several regenerative cycles their regeneration after each process requires large amounts of chemical reagents such as highly concentrated acids which generates polluting waste 47 membrane separation processes for the removal of toxic metals involve techniques such as electrodialysis ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis the process depends on the type of membrane used and the classification is based on the pore diameter of the material metal removal occurs through the percolation of the solution containing the metal ion which can be of the conventional type or parallel crossflow to the surface of the membrane the driving force of this process stems from applying greater pressure than the system s osmotic pressure 48 in the case of electrodialysis the membrane is electrically charged and the driving force is an electric field applied to the system membrane separation shows good results in removing al3 ions but there are disadvantages such as the high cost and complexity of the process 49 50 in addition aluminum tends to form encrustation layers on these types of membranes 51 52 removal of aluminum and toxic metals in general by adsorption has proved to be quite promising 53 adsorption is based on the process of diffusion and transfer of mass in which the adsorbate in an aqueous solution is transported to the surface of an adsorbent solid the main driving force behind this phenomenon is the difference in concentration between the two phases adhesion of the adsorbate to the solid surface can be governed by physical physisorption or chemical chemisorption interactions 17 54 56 a variety of different materials have been investigated as adsorbents for the uptake of aluminum ranging from the most commonly used ones such as activated carbon and zeolites to low cost alternative materials like wood charcoal clays and biomaterials like polymers and starch 57 60 4 biosorption general approaches 4 1 biosorbent materials biosorption can be defined as a type of adsorption in which the adsorbent is a material of biological origin either natural or waste from an agro industrial process according to vieira and volesky 61 biosorbents should preferably be industrial waste with no added value high bioavailability and a fast production growth cycle the combination of these factors reduces the cost of the biosorption process which is the main advantage of this approach high biosorption capacity rapid removal and resistance to friction are highly desirable features for the material to be considered as a potential biosorbent in general the most commonly used biosorbents for the uptake of toxic metals can be divided into three groups microorganisms algae and agro industrial waste 50 it is important to highlight that only research papers that uses biomass of deactivated microorganisms were discussed in this review since the definition of biosorption adopted here is that this is a metabolic independent process with passive removal of toxic metals 62 among the most used microorganisms biomasses are bacteria including streptomyces rimosus rhodococcus opacus pseudomonas luteola brochothrix thermosphacta and vibrio alginolyticus 63 66 however fungal biosorbents such as aspergillus niger are also very interesting due to their high contents of cell wall material which boost the assortment of functionalities available for metal binding 67 algae have high affinity with a wide variety of metals which is an advantage in their use as biosorbents the seaweeds are divided into three major groups red algae green algae and brown algae 68 71 brown algae stand out for having high rates of alginate in their composition a compound described as being mainly responsible by the uptake of metal ions in the biosorption of al3 algae such as padina pavonica sargassum fluitans and laminaria japonica presented satisfactory metal removal results 72 74 lee 75 also investigated the influence of chemical and physical pretreatments to modify the algae sargassum fluitans and improve aluminum removal waste materials produced by industrial or agro industrial processes have also been studied for the removal of al3 biomass such as sludge from wastewater treatment ponds 76 coconut husks 77 powdered eucalyptus bark 78 tea residue 79 and beach cast seaweed 80 have been investigated as promising biosorbents the main advantages are their low cost high availability and environmental sustainability 81 other biosorbent materials such as nanomaterials derived from alternative sources mainly from agro industrial waste and bacterial biomass have been increasingly investigated for the removal of toxic metals 82 these biosorbents are known to have a large surface area and high porosity which substantially improves the adsorptive capacity of these materials 83 studies on the use of nano adsorbents for the removal of toxic metals are recent and still in their early development but promising results have been reported for the uptake of metals such as copper cadmium chromium and lead 84 86 however specifically for the removal of aluminum there is still a lack of research that delves into the topic 4 2 biosorption mechanisms in the biosorption process contaminants are removed through adsorption onto the cell wall or active sites that exist on the surface of the biomaterial both the biosorbent material and the adsorbate must be evaluated in the case of metal contaminants biosorbent metal affinity should be the first factor to be investigated to assess the potential application of the process the effluent aspects to be evaluated are treated volume metal concentration ph temperature and presence of other contaminants that may compete for active sites for the biosorbent in turn one must analyze the features which directly influence the viability of the process such as its origin selectivity physical chemical and biological properties and reuse capacity 16 20 87 this process differs from bioaccumulation process in which metals are removed by the metabolic action of living cells 4 in this process metal ions are removed from the aqueous solution due to the affinity bond of the metal at the active sites and functional groups of the biomaterial structure studying the mechanisms that govern the biosorption of toxic metals can help elucidate the interaction between biosorbent and adsorbate as reported by robalds and collaborators 88 biosorption process may involve several mechanisms such as physisorption chemisorption which may include covalent bonds and complexation ion exchange and microprecipitation fig 3 depicts the main mechanisms involved in biosorption processes hydroxyl carboxyl sulfonate and amine functional groups have been identified in literature as those that can most favor the removal of metals from aqueous solutions 68 89 90 the hard and soft acids and bases hsab concept can help to understand the binding preferences between metals and certain functional groups in this theory metals are divided into groups those classified as type a al3 mg2 ca2 na among others have a strong tendency to bond with compounds containing oxygen such as oh hpo4 2 co while metals classified as type b ag hg2 pb2 zn2 and others form strong bonds with groups containing n or s such as cn nh2 sh moreover bonds containing type a metals tend to be ionic while for type b they tend to be covalent however this cannot be considered a determinant definition since many other factors such as metal concentration and biomass type may affect the system s behavior 91 92 studies reported in the literature suggest that the main mechanisms participating in the biosorption of al 3 ions are largely related to chemisorption but may also have several additional mechanisms like complexation and ion exchange understanding the biosorption of toxic metals especially aluminum requires studying the kinetics equilibrium and thermodynamics of the process 4 3 biosorption kinetics analysis of biosorption kinetics provides information regarding the uptake rate and the time required to reach equilibrium as well as insights about the controlling mechanisms of the overall process kinetic paremeters can be used to develop predictive modeling for continuous biosorption in fixed bed dynamic systems 93 the application of kinetic models is important to identify the rate limiting phase of the biosorption process the most commonly applied models to describe the kinetic rate of adsorption in biosorption studies of toxic metals including aluminum are pseudo first order pfo 94 and pseudo second order pso 95 models being both based on the adsorptive capacity of the solid phase besides these models others can be used to evaluate mass transfer behavior such as intraparticle diffusion 96 boyd s 97 elovich s 98 these models are based on the system s internal or external diffusion mechanism internal diffusion also called intraparticle describes the transport rate of ions via pores or on the adsorbent surface whereas external diffusion relates to the transport rate of the solution adsorbate across the outer film of the biomaterial 99 adsorption kinetics modeling is considered an important step to understand the phenomenon of mass transfer in biosorption and the dynamics of the adsorbate binding mechanism on the biosorbent surface 100 table 1 features the results of various works in the literature for kinetic modeling of al3 biosorption using different biosorbents in most studies the pso model best describes al3 removal indicating that the main mechanism involved in this process is the chemisorption since the derivation of this model was based on the classic equation of the langmuir equilibrium model in which adsorption is assumed to be governed by chemical reactions occurring on a energetically homogenous surface 101 102 although several authors supports this assumption tran et al 89 and other researchers 103 105 emphasize that the biosorption mechanism cannot be defined by kinetic analysis only for them it requires complementary analytical information determined by characterization techniques such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis tga dta and the examination of isotherm and thermodynamic data in addition the knowledge about the nature of the biosorbent is crucial to understand the process mechanism 4 4 biosorption equilibrium biosorption equilibrium described by the isotherms represents the dynamic equilibrium between the metal concentration present in the liquid phase and the adsorbate concentration in the biosorbent at constant temperature and ph the application of isotherm modeling provides important information regarding the affinity level of the biosorbent adsorbate system the properties of the biomaterial surface and the nature of the process therefore equilibrium parameters are essential for the design of a biosorption system 113 114 the isotherm models most commonly applied to analyze biosorption systems are langmuir 115 and freundlich 116 besides a few classic models such as dubinin radushkevich d r 117 langmuir freundlich 118 and temkin 119 the langmuir model assumes that biosorption is reversible and occurs in monolayers the biosorbent surface is homogeneous and has a fixed number of active sites and there is no interaction between the ions once they are bound to the surface 115 this model does not clarify aspects about the removal mechanism although it provides information about maximum removal capacity qmax which is useful to contrast the performance of distinct biosorbent materials 120 121 the freundlich model is recommended for systems with medium to low ion concentrations the main consideration is that it represents multilayer biosorption on a non homogeneous surface the d r model can be applied to investigate the nature of adsorption which may be chemical or physical 46 table 2 features the results of the fit of the models to the equilibrium experimental data of several studies of al3 biosorption with different biosorbents most systems are largely described by the langmuir model which may indicate that in general aluminum biosorption occurs with monolayer formation 4 5 thermodynamic aspects of biosorption thermodynamics of a biosorption process can be examined using the following parameters variation of gibbs energy δgº variation of enthalpy δhº and variation of entropy δsº analysis of δhº values indicates whether the process is endothermic δhº 0 or exothermic δhº 0 process spontaneity is verified by δgº and may be spontaneous δgº 0 or not δgº 0 δsº values in turn are related to the affinity of the metal by the biosorbent material which can be high δsº 0 or low δsº 0 some authors also associate this variable with the degree of disorder in the system s interface 15 127 the study of the value of enthalpy variation can also help in defining if the process is governed mostly by chemical or physical interactions values below 80 kj mol generally indicate that the adsorption mechanism is physical and reversible mostly governed by weak interactions as van der waals forces in irreversible chemical processes enthalpy variation values usually vary between 80 and 400 kj mol and for electrostatic interactions this values vary from 30 to 70 kj mol 128 129 table 3 features the thermodynamic data of several studies on al3 biosorption with different biosorbents the results show that the biosorption processes of al3 ions are largely spontaneous and endothermic as they present positive values for gibbs energy and enthalpy variation respectively entropy variation ranged from 164 4 j mol k to 207 6 j mol k depending on the system most studies presented positive values for δsº indicating increased disorder in the system s biosorbent adsorbate interface and high affinity of al3 ions for most of the biosorbents used however this cannot be fully confirmed since each type of biomass has its particularities such as different types of active sites which are strongly affected by temperature in some of the studies selected in this review although the thermodynamic quantities of the process were not determined considerable enhancement in aluminum uptake was noticed when the temperature was raised indicating that the adsorption is essentially endothermic 76 78 the main explanation for this behavior is that increased temperature leads the boundary layer to become less thick thus facilitating the transfer of metal ions to the biosorbent 130 in other works however the authors observed an opposite behavior a reduced metal uptake with increasing temperature indicating an exothermic process 64 5 biosorption of aluminum using biomaterials 5 1 using bacterial biomass as biosorbent of aluminum bacteria are ubiquitous able to spread under controlled conditions and highly resistant to variations in the medium therefore bacterium biomass is an advantageous biosorbent 122 the cell walls of bacteria present macromolecules such as enzymes lipo polysaccharides peptidoglycan and lipo proteins which are rich in functionalities like carboxyl sulfate phosphate and amino groups the coexistence of cationic and anionic groups grants the bacterial cell wall with an amphoteric behavior nevertheless van der wal et al 131 verified that the anionic groups prevail over cationic groups and so the isoelectric point of most bacterial biomasses does not exceed ph 4 consequently electrostatic interactions between bacteria and positively charged contaminants such as al3 may favor the biosorption process 64 the biomass of rhodococcus opacus strain gram positive was selected by cayllahua and torem 64 for removing aluminum from water first zeta potential measurements indicated an isoelectric point at ph 3 26 for r opacus which is consonant with the literature accordingly at ph conditions above 3 26 the net charge of r opacus bacterium is negative which can directly impact biosorption through electrostatic forces in fact the authors reported an increase in al3 removal efficiency from 11 to 92 by increasing the solution ph from 3 to 5 respectively hence ph 5 was selected as the optimum condition for al3 biosorption onto r opacus the key role of electrostatic attractions in the process was confirmed by ionic strength tests in which al3 uptake capacity augmented by decreasing electrolyte nacl concentration this last finding agrees with that observed in the study by tassit et al 63 who by calculating the activation energy of the process reached the same conclusion the kinetic study of al3 biosorption onto r opacus demonstrated that the system reached equilibrium after approximately 20 min with 100 removal efficiency pfo pso intraparticle diffusion and boyd s were the kinetic models applied to the results which were best represented by the pso model in the equilibrium study the authors observed a significant decrease in qmax with increasing temperature an indication that the system is exothermic comparatively to langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich models temkin model provided the best fit to the equilibrium data temkin isotherm by definition indicates that the adsorption heat reduces linearly with the raise of biosorbent surface coverage 132 ftir spectra showed that the biomass of r opacus bacterium is rich in hydroxyl amino carbonyl carboxyl and phosphate functional groups the shifts in their vibrational bands reveal the complexation coordination of al3 onto the biomass during the process more clear insights on al3 uptake mechanism depends on further characterizations and analysis tassist et al 63 proposed streptomyces rimosus which is a mycelial gram positive bacterium as biosorbent of al3 this bacterium is extensively used for the biosynthesis of oxytetracycline antibiotic the authors received s rimosus biomass from a local algerian pharmaceutical industry and after cleaning and grinding the material was sieved to obtain samples of different particle sizes ftir characterization of s rimosus biomass showed the presence of methyl carboxyl hydroxyl amino thiol and phosphate groups such functionalities agree with the chemistry of the wall and cellular membrane of the selected bacterium the al3 biosorption onto of s rimosus biomass was studied for the effects of particle size biosorbent dosage agitation speed temperature and ph remarkably there was a significant increase in al3 removal capacity with increasing temperature indicating an endothermic process moreover the increase in ph from 2 to 4 favored al3 biosorption onto s rimosus kinetics was better represented by pso model than pfo model the activation energy in the arrhenius equation was estimated as 52 18 kj mol according to aksu 133 activation energy in 8 4 83 7 kj mol range indicates an activated chemisorption process the authors also considered the involvement of ion exchange mechanisms in which the chemical biding between the metal and the biosorbent might be mainly of electrostatic nature equilibrium was better represented by langmuir model than freundlich or d r isotherms nevertheless the magnitude of mean free adsorption energy of d r isotherm 12 91 kj mol reinforced the fact that chemical ion exchange mechanisms governed al3 biosorption the thermodynamic parameters listed in table 3 indicates that the process is feasible endothermic and spontaneous at 10 80 c in the study of isotherms the authors also evaluated the influence of controlled ph they obtained qmax 11 76 mg g at fixed ph 4 and qmax 6 62 mg g at free ph the lower biosorption capacity at free ph was related to the fact that the solution ph diminished to 3 24 at equilibrium the number of anionic sites especially carboxyl groups available to bind al3 cations is lower at ph 3 24 than ph 4 on one hand al3 biosorption onto s rimosus presented the highest value of maximum biosorption capacity among the bacterial biomasses of table 2 but on the other hand it took a relatively long time of 150 min to reach equilibrium ozdemir and bayasal 65 innovated using chryseomonas luteola strain which is habitually found in activated sludge as metal biosorbent c luteola is a floc forming bacterium so it can form a polysaccharide capsule that binds and accumulates the contaminants al3 uptake by c luteola was examined in 1 0 7 0 ph range and the highest biosorption yield was verified at ph 5 0 according to langmuir isotherm the maximum biosorption capacity of al3 was 55 2 mg g the cell demonstrated a greater affinity for aluminum than chromium ions since the maximum cr6 biosorption capacity at ph 4 did not exceed qmax 3 mg g boeris et al 122 analyzed the potential of the non living non viable biomass of the gram negative bacterium pseudomonas putida a atcc 12633 as biosorbent of al3 for comparison purposes they also evaluated the removal capacity using the living viable biomass of p putida a atcc 12633 the effects of ph 2 12 biosorbent dosage 0 60 g l and contact time 1 15 min on al3 biosorption were evaluated for both types of biomass ph 4 3 provided the highest biosorption efficiency around 95 however lower quantities of biosorbent were required by the non viable p putida a atcc 12633 system to attain 100 removal of al3 resistance to mass transfer using either viable biomass 40 g l or non viable biomass 8 g l was negligible since only 1 min of contact time was sufficient to completely remove al3 from solution furthermore boeris et al 122 proved that the membrane phosphatidylcholine pc present in p putida a atcc 12633 plays a key role in the biosorption of al3 for that purpose they developed a mutant bacterium without pc and compared qmax values obtained using all kinds of biomass viable non viable and non viable without pc the biomass without pc showed the worst performance with fast saturation and low al3 removal capacity qmax 0 27 mg g conversely the non viable p putida a atcc 12633 showed the best results qmax 0 55 mg g this indicates that biosorbent performance may be associated with pre treatment by autoclaving which causes the destruction of cells and may promote enhanced surface area and greater availability of binding sites in the non living biomass thus efficiency could be mostly linked to quantitative characteristics of the biosorbent that is the number of active sites and qualitative factors such as metal biosorbent affinity had a secondary role 18 134 the exact interactions of aluminum ions onto non viable biomass could not be completely elucidated however the changes in ftir spectra before and after biosorption indicated the involvement of functional groups of the cells in the process including aluminum complexation with phosphate ester groups the biosorption isotherms were adjusted not only by the traditional langmuir model but also by the model proposed by bueno et al 135 which applies to systems that use microorganism derived biosorbents the parameters from the fitting of bueno et al 135 model confirmed the non viable p putida a atcc 12633 biomass as the most efficient biosorbent for al3 removal especially because it presents the highest amount of binding sites on the surface m 36 105 sites microorganism from table 2 it is noticeable that gram positive bacteria r opaccus and s rimosus show better removal results than gram negative bacteria p putida which some authors associate with the fact that the cell wall of gram positive bacteria presents a thicker peptidoglycan layer which favors the removal of metals 136 5 2 using fungal biomass as biosorbent of aluminum fungal biomass has also attracted great interest as a biosorbent because it offers several advantages first fungus can have up to 30 of its dry weight in the form of cell wall the high cell wall content elevates the variety of functional groups available for metal binding moreover fungus can be easily produced and has a fast life cycle with high yields of biomass to top that fungal biosorbents are mostly non pathogenic and can be safely applied many types of fungal biomass can be obtained from industrial wastes such as saccharomyces cerevisiae from brewery production and aspergillus niger from citric acid production 67 on the other hand research shows that the efficiencies of metal biosorption using fungal biomasses vary substantially this triggered by several reasons including differences in the chemical composition of the cell wall of fungal species boriová et al 137 examined four distinct wild type strains of a niger for al3 removal using living and non living microorganisms the results obtained by using non living a niger biomass were unsatisfactory since the biosorption efficiency did not exceed 9 in turn the al3 removal efficiency reached 53 using a strain of living a niger the living fungal biomass acts in passive biosorption and active uptake bioaccumulation of al3 the difference in effectiveness between the processes may be associated with several factors from the pre treatment method to obtain the biosorbent to the system s operating conditions 138 139 omeike et al 123 investigated al3 removal using aspergillus oryzae biomass obtained from an aluminum industry waste site in nigeria in comparison to other aspergillus ssp and trichoderma spp a oryzae strain showed the highest metal tolerance considering the inhibition zone around the colonies and so was selected for al3 biosorption the ph influence testing indicated that the biosorption process reaches 45 maximum removal at ph 6 moreover 24 h was determined as the optimum equilibrium time for al3 biosorption onto a oryzae biomass langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm were linearly adjusted to the experimental data but the adjustments had r² values lower than 0 85 of the works listed in table 2 this study presented the lowest values for qmax 0 071 mg g which shows the need to optimize the operating conditions of the biosorption process in order to achieve more satisfactory removal capacity values on the other hand naeemullah et al 106 achieved the greatest adsorption capacity 161 23 mg g among the fungal biomasses here presented demonstrating that this microorganism may have a higher affinity to al3 ions which can be associated to an improved metal bond capacity by the optimized batch conditions highlighting the importance of this step to obtain reasonable results in the biosorption process 5 3 using algal biomass as biosorbent of aluminum algae are among the most popular biosorbents because of their abundance all over the world and the ability to undergo pre treatment compared to microorganisms 140 another advantage is that algae have several potential metal binding groups in their cell wall such as carboxyl sulfate and hydroxyl which favors the uptake of toxic metals considering factors such as operating conditions for example one observes that metal biosorption onto algae shows favorable results for a wide range of concentrations using low amounts of biomass and at mild temperatures 141 brown algae are found to be excellent biosorbents for removing metal contaminants including al3 ions the cell wall of brown algae contains fucoidan and alginate alginate can make up 40 of the algae dry weight and holds almost three quarters of the total amount of functional groups 68 vijayaraghavan et al 100 explored the capacity of the brown algae turbinaria conoides to remove aluminum and cadmium ions from in mono and multicomponent systems first the ph effect was evaluated with al3 removal favored at ph 4 and cd2 removal at ph 5 the authors observed that t conoides has greater affinity for al3 ions than cd2 ions since at ph 4 the qmax value on a molar basis was around 3 times higher for aluminum in the binary solute system containing al3 and cd2 both ions compete strongly for the sites on the biosorbent surface the maximum biosorption capacities of al3 and cd2 reduced by approximately 56 and 27 respectively this verified that the presence of cadmium significantly affects the removal of aluminum by t conoides biomass regarding kinetic study vijayaraghavan et al 100 found that both pfo and pso models fitted well the experimental data with high r² values but the values of equilibrium removal capacity estimated by pfo model were closer to those collected experimentally the authors discussed the fact that pso model tends to overestimate the qe value while the pfo model tends to underestimate it the biosorption isotherms of al3 and cd2 onto t conoides algae were evaluated by two parameter models langmuir and freundlich and three parameter models toth and redlich peterson langmuir and toth models were the ones that best described the equilibrium data although the latter assumes that the biosorption system is heterogeneous going against what is suggested as a hypothesis in the langmuir model this contradictory result may be explained by the occurrence of multiple stages and mechanisms on the metal biosorbent binding still in depth analysis such as micrographs of the biomaterial surface or isosteric heat calculation may be necessary to support this hypothesis sari and tuzen 72 evaluated the efficiency of aluminum ion removal in aqueous solution by the brown algae padina pavonica which abundant in atlantic ocean and mediterranean sea and is customarily known as peacocks tail the authors obtained qmax 77 3 mg g at ph 4 5 with 60 min of contact time the equilibrium was well represented by the langmuir model indicating that al3 biosorption on the surface of p pavonica occurs with a monolayer formation in addition the d r model indicated that metal removal in this system may be occurring by chemical ion exchange the pso model fit well with the kinetic data showing that the possible controlling step of biosorption is chemisorption thermodynamic analysis revealed that al3 biosorption onto p pavonica is favorable viable and endothermic and there was also an increase in the disorder of the adsorbate biosorbent interface ftir characterization of the biosorbent before and after the process indicated that the ion exchange between al3 and h ions possibly occurred mainly in the carboxyl hydroxyl and amide groups this observation corroborates the analyses by davis et al 68 who found that brown algae s carboxyl groups are majorly involved in the removal of metals lodeiro et al 80 examined the use of beach cast seaweed from galician coast in spain as biosorbent of aluminum the main component of the biomass was identified as the brown seaweed cystoseira baccata the study was developed not only in batch but also in fixed bed systems the latter is discussed in section 5 6 in the finite bath assays synthetic aluminum solutions were used at initial concentrations of 10 and 100 mg l the authors verified that the biosorption onto beach cast seaweed was reasonably fast and reached equilibrium after about 60 min at the highest concentration biosorption isotherms were obtained at three acidic conditions ph 1 2 5 and 4 there was strong ph influence on the maximum removal capacity of aluminum at ph 4 the qmax value of 22 5 mg g was about twice as high as that obtained at ph 2 5 qmax 11 1 mg g langmuir isotherm model and langmuir freundlich three parameter model provided good fittings to the experimental data indicating monolayer formation on the surface of the seaweed from potentiometric titration assays in deionized water total amount of weak acid groups in the beach cast seaweed was estimated as 2 61 mmol g considering the much lower value of qmax 22 5 mg g 0 83 mmol g it was speculated that some of the weak acid groups were not ionized at ph 4 and that some of these groups were unavailable for binding aluminum because they were already occupied with cations such as na k and mg which are abundant in seawater shaaban et al 124 evaluated the performance of three different marine algae as biosorbents for the uptake of aluminum zinc and iron present in synthetic aqueous solutions and in real effluents the selected algae were gelidium latifolium red algae ulva lactuca green algae and colpomenia sinuosa brown algae the authors concluded that the brown algae c sinuosa showed better results in removing all the metals evaluated next in al3 biosorption efficiency came the red algae g latifolium followed by the green algae u lactuca this order is in agreement with that reached by romera et al 142 when comparing the performance of green red and brown algae in biosorption of different toxic metals noteworthy the excellence of brown algae as biosorbent for a wide variety of metals may be associated with the alginate present in the composition of their cell wall shaaban et al 124 also investigated the interaction between the marine algae and aluminum zinc and iron it was verified that al3 ions had the lowest biosorption affinity to the three algae which may be associated with the fact that zn2 and fe3 are heavier ions and so can bind more easily to the cell wall in addition other intrinsic factors of the metals for example ionic radius and electronegativity may also affect the bonding with the active sites of the biosorbent 143 144 however despite this result the three algae in question showed satisfactory capabilities of al3 removal in both low 0 5 mg l and high 1000 mg l concentrations varying on average between 0 437 and 60 2 mg g respectively by analyzing the thermodynamic parameters and equilibrium data the researchers concluded that the al3 biosorption process in all algae was endothermic δh 0 and that it occurred in an orderly manner at the interface with high affinity between the metal and the biosorbent δs 0 the satisfactory fit of the langmuir model to the experimental indicates a monolayer disposition on the biosorbent surface analyzing the biosorbent surfaces by scanning electron microscopy they observed that the brown algae c sinuosa had a stratified and extensively papillary surface thus having a greater contact surface corroborating the fact that this biomass had good removal results participation of the c n s group in the al removal mechanism was analyzed by ftir especially in c sinuosa where the band change was more pronounced the co group alcoholic group participated in al biosorption only in the red algae g latifolium groups co co and nh were present in all algae the oh group contributed to the removal of the metal in all algae except u lactuca overall one may conclude that biosorption processes of al3 ions using microorganisms i tend to be fast some authors claim that this may be linked to the fact that the cells are very small so resistance to mass transfer may be negligible 145 ii agitation generally does not directly affect the removal results only the time to reach equilibrium iii the cell walls contain functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl amino and phosphoric which are mainly involved in al3 removal by microorganisms iii the solution ph plays a pivotal role in al3 biosorption onto bacterial fungal and algal biomasses regarding this last point it is noteworthy that at low ph conditions phosphate and carboxyl groups are negatively charged due to pka between 3 and 5 this favors the binding of cations such as al3 conversely aluminum chemical speciation and solubility are function of ph high ph values are prohibitive for al biosorption because there is the formation of insoluble hydroxide species 122 5 4 using agro industrial waste as biosorbent of aluminum in the segment of biosorbents derived from agro industrial waste yurtsever and nalçak 77 evaluated the feasibility of using coconut shells to remove al3 in aqueous solutions the biosorbent was submitted to acid pre treatment with hno3 hcl and h2so4 this type of treatment is often used in biomass to remove impurities and assist in the exposure of active sites increasing the ability to remove metal ions however acid treatment tends to increase the amount of protons on the surface of the biomaterial potentially making it positive which could in theory hinder cation removal 146 however fairly satisfactory values of maximum removal capacity of al3 qmax were achieved using the acid treated coconut shells when compared to other biosorbents as shown in table 2 yurtsever and nalçak 77 observed that the biosorption kinetics of al3 onto acid treated coconut shell was initially fast and well defined by pso model system equilibrium was best expressed by freundlich isotherm it was noticed that the biosorbent surface showed several imperfections heterogeneous thermodynamic analysis table 3 verified that the process was endothermic remarkably the authors performed the experiments at ph 7 and claimed that aluminum is still in transition to its precipitated form at this ph value however according to the speciation diagram of fig 2 and several works in the literature above ph 6 aluminum forms the precipitated species al oh 3 metal precipitation can affect both the definition and the understanding of biosorption mechanisms 65 126 147 148 rosa et al 107 investigated the biosorption of aluminum using humin and ashes from its calcination in the kinetic study the authors observed that pso model fitted better to the biosorption using humin while the process using ashes was better represented by the pfo model table 1 from ftir spectra it was observed that groups such as oh cc and co were possibly involved in al3 removal using both biosorbents however small differences in the structure of the ashes compared to humin were identified such as bands indicating the presence of carbonates aliphatic ethers and polysaccharides or silicates these particularities may explain the fit of distinct models to the kinetic biosorption data using humin and its ashes considering that removal capacity may be influenced by the presence of certain components on the structure of the biomaterial and by the way they interact in the biosorption process which can occur through van der waals forces hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions zeta potential analysis indicated that at ph below 7 2 the surface of both biosorbents are positively charged a fact that can hinder the biosorption of aluminum cations as with kinetic modeling the biosorbents also differed in isotherm modeling the equilibrium of aluminum humin system was better represented by the langmuir model while the freundlich model showed an enhanced fit for aluminum ash system the satisfactory fit of freundlich isotherm using the ashes can be associated to the greater heterogeneity of their surface which is motivated by the fact that the calcination process of humin to obtain ashes cannot indeed be controlled the qmax values also reveal that the removal capacity of humin is about twice as high as that of its respective ashes the authors relate this to the presence of a greater number of complexing groups on the surface of humin rajamohan et al 78 analyzed the biosorbent applicability of powder made from the bark of eucalyptus camaldulensis a tree species widely used in pulp and paper industry e camaldulensis bark is mostly composed of cellulose 37 4 lignin 28 and hemicellulose 19 2 the biomaterial underwent acid treatment with c4h6o6 to remove impurities and improve the number of available sites on its surface the study analyzed the influence of the variation of important operating parameters such as amount of biosorbent ph and initial concentration of the metal solution temperature and agitation for the aluminum biosorption from aqueous solutions removal of metal ions was favored at ph 5 decreasing below 4 and above 6 the pso model was identified as the one that best fit the kinetic data at all studied concentrations and temperature while the intraparticle diffusion model did not fit satisfactorily under any experimental condition system equilibrium was explained by langmuir isotherm indicating that aluminum adsorption occurs through the formation of monolayers and that the biosorbent surface is homogeneous the increase in qmax and kl values with temperature indicated an endothermic process evaluation of the system s activation energy ea provided insights about the type of adsorption in this case ea 43 23 kj mol a value considered high indicated that aluminum biosorption using e camaldulensis residue is intrinsically a chemical process el houda larbi et al 76 researched the removal of aluminum and cadmium ions using sludge from treatment ponds as biosorption material as this is a complex organic material characterization was a key step it was found that the sludge was basically composed of a large fraction of organic matter high values of chemical e biological oxygen demand and also low percentages of phosphorus and metal elements such as zinc copper manganese nickel and iron ftir analysis showed the presence of oh ch aliphatic cooh and aromatic groups cc in kinetic and equilibrium studies the most favorable ph for aluminum removal was 4 the system reached equilibrium after 1 h obtaining a removal of 76 for al3 and only 18 for cd3 for monocomposite solutions with initial concentration of 50 mg l the kinetics of both systems was adequately described by the pso model while the equilibrium data of these processes were represented by the langmuir model moreover the qmax value of aluminum using the sludge was the highest among the works featured in table 2 however the preparation of this biosorbent as described by the authors is extremely time consuming since the sludge must undergo the humification process which takes about 180 days in this study a greater affinity of the biosorbent with aluminum than cadmium can be observed the opposite behavior was observed by seo et al 112 whom studied a similar biosorbent a biomass derived from sludge from a wastewater treatment plant for the removal of heavy metals in this study the authors evaluated the affinity and kinetic and equilibrium parameters for several cations among them aluminum was the metal with worst results of maximum removal capacity while cadmium presented one of the highest values for this variable abdel ghani et al 108 used typha domingensis leaves as biosorption material in a multi metal solution containing aluminum iron zinc and lead characterization of the material revealed that its composition contains mainly cellulose hemicellulose and other components such as carbon hydrogen and nitrogen by analyzing the ftir spectrum before and after biosorption functional groups such as oh nh and ch proved to be the main agents of metal removal all processes were carried out at the natural ph of the mixture 2 5 without any adjustment or control system equilibrium was reached after 120 min kinetics was described using the pso model while isotherms were described using the langmuir model analysis of qmax values showed that al removal was not favored this may be associated with the experimental conditions adopted such as very low ph and the presence of other more competitive ions in the solution to sum up like algae agro industrial waste is abundant and rapidly produced the main positive point of using such waste is the sustainability of the process since the biosorbents can be used in the same process plant where they are generated in general this waste has functional groups like oh co nh and ch which favor the removal of aluminum table 2 presents the highest adsorption capacity qmax of al3 ions given by residual sludge from treatment ponds which has no added value and often requires simple pre treatment to be used as a biosorbent however its use would be recommended to treat effluents rather than drinking water due to the total levels of organic carbon and the chemical and biological oxygen demand of the treated water which may result in the generation of compounds such as lignin tannin pectin etc thus resulting in secondary pollutants 89 5 5 biosorbent regeneration the capacity for regeneration and reuse is an important characteristic in selecting biosorbents given its substantial contribution to the economic and environmental viability of the biosorption process regeneration of saturated biomass and recovery of metals can be carried out using acidic or basic eluents chelating agents and even deionized water 149 150 approximately 90 of the works listed in table 2 did not perform biosorbent regeneration studies revealing a gap in this investigation table 4 features a summary of studies on the regeneration of different saturated biosorbents after al3 uptake two to ten adsorption desorption cycles were performed in these studies with biosorbents showing an average of 88 desorption efficiency in the first cycle and 58 5 in the last average aluminum removal efficiency in processes using regenerated biosorbents was 84 in the first cycle and 66 in the last the most commonly used eluent was hcl but some studies used reagents such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta and naoh the most promising results were obtained with hcl which may be associated with the reduced ph of the medium that favors metal desorption besides increasing competition between al3 and h ions for active sites on the biosorbent surface 151 however the use of acid solutions must be controlled as they can permanently damage the structure of the biomaterial 81 5 6 aluminum biosorption in fixed bed dynamic system aiming at large scale industrial applications continuous applications are more indicated to treat large volumes in this sense fixed bed configurations have to be inspected in laboratory and pilot scales to obtain information about the biosorbent saturation in the column and resistance to mass transfer which are important factors in analyzing the efficiency of the process in treating contaminated waters 152 despite the importance of the subject there are few studies in the literature addressing aluminum biosorption in fixed bed systems or using real wastewaters this review shows that the works addressing aluminum biosorption are largely restricted to discontinuous batch experiments and use synthetic solutions although these trials are the first step to understanding the process and defining the optimal operating conditions of biosorption assays using real effluents and fixed bed columns are necessary aiming at practical large scale applications of the technology in this section we will discuss some works available in literature that explores aluminum biosorption using real effluents and or fixed bed columns lodeiro et al 80 performed dynamic tests of al3 biosorption using beach cast seaweed rich in c baccata the authors worked with real effluent from a water treatment plant in which aluminum was the main constituent with a concentration of approximately 481 mg l with the goal of obtaining sufficient empty bed contact time to reach process equilibrium 26 min a system was developed using a column of 80 cm in length and 12 cm in diameter filled with 1100 g of seaweed and with an average flow rate of 250 ml min the maximum removal capacity was 14 mg g the authors carried out the same process using commercial activated charcoal as adsorbent and the maximum removal value achieved was only 1 6 mg g it was also observed that under the same conditions the system with activated charcoal reached the rupture point more quickly than with the beach cast seaweed 5 7 practical applications costa and coworkers 153 applied the alginate extraction waste from the brown algae sargassum filipendula for the treatment of real effluents four types of effluents were examined one from the wastewater from a tannery industry a1 one from the exit of the wastewater treatment facility of a leather industry a2 and two from the entrance and exit of a french urban water treatment station a3 and a4 respectively in strasbourg these effluents contain several metals including aluminum chromium lead and zinc but in different concentrations aluminum levels in a1 1 62 mg l and a2 0 31 mg l were above the recommended levels the biosorption process was initially carried out in discontinuous systems using the effluents at natural ph and also with ph controlled at 3 5 unlike what has been frequently observed for synthetic effluents in most cases al3 removal was hardly affected by the solution ph the removal percentages were mostly similar in the systems with or without ph control around 43 81 and 44 for a1 a2 and a3 respectively in a4 aluminum concentration was already very low 0 02 mg l and showed no variation whatsoever it is known that aluminum uptake may be inhibited in the presence of other metals 100 154 155 however aluminum removal percentages obtained by costa et al 153 were quite significant despite the coexistence of other metals in a1 a2 and a3 effluents it is important to mention that a2 effluent had natural ph around 7 85 it is known that at this value aluminum is in its precipitated form so the highest removal efficiency obtained for a2 can be also associated to chemical precipitation shaaban et al 124 analyzed the efficiency of three different types of algae for the al3 biosorption the best removal results in synthetic effluents were obtained by the brown algae c sinuosa which was selected to study the viability of biosorption using 21 types of wastewater from different industries in the city of borg el arab high concentrations of aluminum were found in effluents from food paper soap and metal processing industries where the levels were reduced from 39 03 mg l 3 13 mg l 9 09 mg l and 4 38 mg l to 12 67 mg l 0 964 mg l 3 21 mg l and 0 93 mg l respectively after biosorption onto brown algae c sinuosa remarkably aluminum concentrations in effluents from paper and metal processing industries were reduced to values below that required by egyptian legislation 3 mg l however the levels reached are still higher than who recommendation 0 2 mg l overall the biosorption process using brown algae c sinuosa was considered promising since it reached an average of 80 8 aluminum removal in all effluents despite not reaching the maximum concentration parameter defined by international bodies based on these results pretreatment is still recommended to reduce the initial concentration of aluminum before the biosorption process kumari and ravindhranath 109 evaluated the performance of biosorbents derived from the plant pongamia pinnata in removing aluminum from wastewater of alumina manufacturing industries the stems and leaves of p pinnata were evaluated in the form of powder and ash summing four types of biosorbents the initial concentration of aluminum in the samples varied between 10 and 16 mg l good aluminum removal percentages were obtained varying from 90 5 to 93 5 for the effluent with the lowest aluminum concentration and 91 5 96 5 for that with the highest concentration similar results were obtained under the same operating conditions using a biosorbent derived from the plant cassia occidentalis indicating that it can also be a viable biomaterial for the removal of aluminum present in real effluents 125 loiacono et al 156 investigated the removal of aluminum and other metals present in the wastewater of a metal finishing factory using hemp felt as biosorbent the samples were collected from exit of the precipitation process of the factory wastewater treatment plant aluminum concentration in samples varied between 1 1 and 9 6 mg l and removal efficiency was between 43 and 49 the authors suggested that factors such as ionic radius electronegativity and molar mass may affect the system s affinity and selectivity among the metals present in the effluent aluminum has the smallest ionic radius and molar mass which would explain its lower removal percentage as in the work by costa 153 removal percentages did not exceed 50 yet may be considered promising in view of the system s competitiveness 6 conclusion and prospects this work presented a review of studies on metal ion biosorption more specifically the removal of aluminum ions although the toxicity of this metal ion is not highlighted in a significant way in the literature compared to other toxic metals aluminum can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as well as water resources among the many processes used to remove aluminum in aqueous media biosorption stands out as one of the most viable in terms of cost benefit and efficiency the studies reviewed involved non conventional and low cost biosorbents for al3 uptake the performance of biosorbents based on bacteria fungus algae and agro industrial wastes was evaluated based on qmax values this article presented the mechanisms involved in the processes using different biosorbents addressing kinetics equilibrium and thermodynamics modeling revealed that most studies have kinetic data described by the pso model while the langmuir model best represents most equilibrium data biosorption of aluminum are in general spontaneous and endothermic processes factors such as temperature ph and initial metal concentration are those that most directly affect the processes the main functional groups involved in the removal of al3 by most of the investigated biosorbents regardless of their source are the carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups although fixed bed dynamic tests are essential to scale up the process few articles approached this system future studies related to aluminum biosorption from aqueous media could address other topics such as i process and product life cycle assessment of aluminum biosorption evaluating the impacts on humans fauna and flora ii studies involving other biosorbents and functionalization especially biomass derived from microorganisms iii application of bionanomaterials from alternative sources for al iii biosorption iv aluminum biosorption studies using real wastewaters in fixed bed dynamic systems v evaluation of biosorbent reuse with adsorption desorption cycles aimed at commercial industrial application vi evaluation of the costs involved in a potential large scale system aimed at industrial application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13623,aluminum is one of the most common pollutant found in wastewaters from processes like mining galvanizing and metal alloy casting the release of aluminum contaminated effluents into water bodies may cause several harmful effects on the environment and living beings due to its capacity for gradual bioaccumulation biosorption is a process that has gained prominence in water wastewater treatment for its satisfactory results in removing metal pollutants this technology has many advantages like being low cost and eco friendly making it one of the main alternatives to conventional approaches this review features an overview of studies on biosorption of al3 ions highlighting the performance of biosorbents derived from bacterial fungal and algal biomasses and agro industrial wastes for this purpose the main mechanisms involved in this process are investigated and discussed regarding its kinetic equilibrium and thermodynamic behavior the application of biosorption for treating real effluents and regeneration reuse of the biosorbents are also presented finally the prospects for future research on al3 biosorption are outlined keywords biosorption aluminum metals wastewater treatment low cost biosorbents biomass 1 introduction water pollution increases exponentially with the intensification of industrial activities the release of effluents contaminated by toxic metals without proper treatment causes great damage to the environment industrial processes such as mining galvanizing and pigmentation generate significant amounts of waste mainly composed of toxic metals like chromium lead arsenic cadmium and aluminum 1 2 there are several technologies available that involve chemical physical and biological processes to remove metals from aqueous solutions different methods are studied for the removal of toxic metals from aqueous media such as biosorption chemical precipitation electrochemical treatment and reverse osmosis 3 among current treatment processes biosorption has been widely studied for the removal of polluting metals from aqueous solutions 4 promising results have been obtained for the biosorption of toxic metals ranging from zinc copper chromium nickel and cadmium 5 10 to metals with high added value such as silver gold platinum and rare earth metals rems 11 13 biosorption is a process in which biological materials concentrate organic or inorganic species dissolved in aqueous solutions e g metals dyes and emerging pollutants 14 16 this process uses passive physicochemical mechanisms based on the affinity between biomass cells adsorbent and the metal ions adsorbate to be removed and the difference in concentration between the liquid and solid phase 17 its main advantages include low cost efficiency in removing metals in low concentrations good selectivity and the ability to regenerate reuse the adsorbent biomaterial 18 among the biomasses used as adsorbents seaweed microorganisms and agricultural waste have proved to be efficient in removing toxic metals 19 21 aluminum is found in large quantities in its natural form in the earth s crust 22 approximately 63 million tons of aluminum were produced worldwide in 2019 23 its widespread use in different industrial sectors that involve aluminum processing from its mining through finishing procedures such as rolling machining and casting to its final application as a chemical produces high amounts of effluents contaminated by this metal inadequate disposal of these effluents in bodies of water causes several environmental problems affecting aquatic systems soils plants and living beings 24 the maximum amount of aluminum tolerated in bodies of water and industrial effluents is determined by environmental inspection bodies with small variations between countries in particular the maximum amount of this metal tolerated in drinking water is controlled by national and international government sectors linked to the area of health like the world health organization who an in depth literature search using scopus database indicated that over the last 25 years the biosorption of aluminum has been the subject of several papers the search was performed using the keywords biosorption aluminum and similar as displayed in fig 1 the number of publications varies from year to year however it is observed that recently in 2016 and 2019 publications on aluminum biosorption were more numerous considering the environmental context this work features a review of surveys that specifically address the removal of aluminum by biosorption processes that use unconventional and low cost materials as biosorbents therefore the main topics addressed in this review are i overview of aluminum applications toxicological effects and legislation ii brief introduction to processes for aluminum removal iii theoretical aspects of biosorption processes biosorbents mechanisms kinetics equilibrium thermodynamics fixed bed applications iv performance evaluation of non conventional biosorbents for aluminum removal bacteria fungus algae and agro industrial wastes v future prospects for biosorption of aluminum ions 2 chemical speciation applications and environmental toxicological effects of aluminum classified in group 13 th of the periodic table aluminum is one of the most common and reactive metals in nature the form in which it occurs in the environment depends directly on the ph as this is the main factor governing its solubility in aqueous media fig 2 shows the direct dependence between the ph of the medium and the percentage of formation of species derived from the metal the speciation diagram was simulated using visual minteq 3 1 software 25 with the initial aluminum concentration of 3 mmol l at ph values below 5 the al3 ion which is the most toxic form of the metal in the environment is more easily formed as the ph increases the formation of precipitated species al oh 3 is favored a condition associated with their strong affinity with hydroxide forming ions responsible for the phenomenon of precipitation 26 27 some toxic metals such as zinc and iron are considered essential to living organisms and have been recommended as daily intakes 1 however there is no evidence of the biological relevance of aluminum for humans which may be linked to its characteristic of low solubility in neutral ph ranges between 6 5 and 7 5 such as that of the blood flow in evolutionarily terms therefore aluminum ion dependent metabolisms would be unviable 22 due to its physical and chemical characteristics such as high conductivity malleability and corrosion resistance aluminum is extensively used in several industrial sectors in the machine and construction industries aluminum is used mainly to compose metal alloys in the pharmaceutical industry in turn its use is focused on packaging antacids and vaccines aluminum is also used in the textile industry as a tanning agent for leather in addition aluminum sulfate and polyaluminum chloride pac are the main coagulating agents used in water treatment plants 22 28 in literature effluents with aluminum levels vary greatly on dependence of the region of collect and the effluent origin e g comber et al 29 found al iii total concentration around 0 05 0 45 mg l for effluents from water treatment plant in uk while maleki et al 30 observed an aluminum concentration of 2 mg l on the final discharge from a water treatment plant in iran shaaban et al performed a vast analysis of real effluents from industrial district of borg el arab egypt and found relatively high concentrations of aluminum for example in food sector the aluminum concentration reached 39 03 mg l and in metal processing al iii levels around 4 38 mg l were found intensive use therefore generates a large amount of effluent contaminated by the metal which is sometimes discarded into bodies of water without proper treatment triggering several damages to the environment and human health another form of contamination may occur in water treatment systems where the use of aluminum derivatives may leave residue even in treated water 31 besides exposure in contaminated environments humans are also exposed to aluminum ions through the daily use of products such as deodorants and antacids which contain significant amounts of this metal ion 27 food additives containing aluminum are also commonly used especially in the baking industry however since 2019 the world health organization who expert committee on chemical additives has discouraged its use in several food categories normally the main routes of metal contamination are oral and respiratory and more than 95 of the aluminum consumed daily is rapidly eliminated by the urinary system except in the case of individuals suffering from some kind of kidney failure or children under one year old and adults over 60 years old in this case oral intake of aluminum can be highly harmful with the metal absorbed into the bloodstream tending to accumulate mainly in the bones 32 according to the toxicological opinion issued by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr 33 aluminum levels present in products consumed daily are considered safe for humans but several studies suggest the need for further investigation stephens and jolliff 28 observed that when the metal is absorbed into the bloodstream around 40 binds to bones and muscles and may even reach the brain aluminum may negatively affect bone mineralization and inhibit bone cell growth and activity 34 other researchers have investigated the relationship between aluminum and neurological diseases such as alzheimer s disease but studies with more conclusive results are still needed 35 37 in plants toxic effects caused by the accumulation of aluminum include deficiency in nutrient absorption and transport genotype changes and biomass reduction with roots being the most affected area excessive aluminum also considerably decreases cell respiration and the transport of water and other macronutrients such as calcium phosphorus and magnesium a condition that may be linked to competition between those metals and aluminum for active sites 32 soil acidification is a factor strictly linked to aluminum phytotoxicity initially the metal exists in the nature in a harmless form such as aluminosilicates or aluminum oxides in clays but when the ph of the soil reaches values below 5 0 this metal is solubilized in forms potentially toxic to plants such as al 3 38 organisms living in aquatic environments are also affected by the presence of aluminum in the form of al3 the effects on fish being the most widely addressed in the literature researchers report that concentrations of this ion form above 0 5 mg l may cause a high mortality rate in several species mainly affecting osmoregulation and the respiratory system 26 39 40 consequently worldwide local legislations standardize the maximum levels of aluminum in drinking water and effluents discharged in water bodies who for example sets its maximum level at 0 2 mg l in water for human consumption 41 3 water and wastewater treatment approaches for aluminum removal aiming to comply with the limits imposed by national and international legislation several treatment alternatives have been studied for the removal of aluminum present in aqueous systems processes such as precipitation ion exchange with resins membrane separation and adsorption have shown satisfactory results for the removal of this metal in the environmental sector 42 precipitation is still the simplest and most used process it consists of the precipitation of al3 ions recovering them in the form of hydroxides basic substances are used for this such as sodium hydroxide which raises the ph of the solution to an average range between 5 8 the precipitate is separated from the solution by filtration or sedimentation 43 however this process is not suitable for large volumes of effluents that contain toxic metals in low concentrations and moreover it produces large amounts of contaminated residual sludge 44 ion exchange is commonly applied for the uptake of toxic metals its mechanism use as basis the electrostatic interaction between the ion of the solution and the surface of the solid resin which consists of a polymeric matrix with functional groups linked to ion exchange resin that can be cationic or anionic 45 satisfactory results have been obtained using cationic resins that present the following order of selectivity 46 al3 pb2 sr2 ca2 cu2 zn2 mg2 k na h although these resins can be reused in several regenerative cycles their regeneration after each process requires large amounts of chemical reagents such as highly concentrated acids which generates polluting waste 47 membrane separation processes for the removal of toxic metals involve techniques such as electrodialysis ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis the process depends on the type of membrane used and the classification is based on the pore diameter of the material metal removal occurs through the percolation of the solution containing the metal ion which can be of the conventional type or parallel crossflow to the surface of the membrane the driving force of this process stems from applying greater pressure than the system s osmotic pressure 48 in the case of electrodialysis the membrane is electrically charged and the driving force is an electric field applied to the system membrane separation shows good results in removing al3 ions but there are disadvantages such as the high cost and complexity of the process 49 50 in addition aluminum tends to form encrustation layers on these types of membranes 51 52 removal of aluminum and toxic metals in general by adsorption has proved to be quite promising 53 adsorption is based on the process of diffusion and transfer of mass in which the adsorbate in an aqueous solution is transported to the surface of an adsorbent solid the main driving force behind this phenomenon is the difference in concentration between the two phases adhesion of the adsorbate to the solid surface can be governed by physical physisorption or chemical chemisorption interactions 17 54 56 a variety of different materials have been investigated as adsorbents for the uptake of aluminum ranging from the most commonly used ones such as activated carbon and zeolites to low cost alternative materials like wood charcoal clays and biomaterials like polymers and starch 57 60 4 biosorption general approaches 4 1 biosorbent materials biosorption can be defined as a type of adsorption in which the adsorbent is a material of biological origin either natural or waste from an agro industrial process according to vieira and volesky 61 biosorbents should preferably be industrial waste with no added value high bioavailability and a fast production growth cycle the combination of these factors reduces the cost of the biosorption process which is the main advantage of this approach high biosorption capacity rapid removal and resistance to friction are highly desirable features for the material to be considered as a potential biosorbent in general the most commonly used biosorbents for the uptake of toxic metals can be divided into three groups microorganisms algae and agro industrial waste 50 it is important to highlight that only research papers that uses biomass of deactivated microorganisms were discussed in this review since the definition of biosorption adopted here is that this is a metabolic independent process with passive removal of toxic metals 62 among the most used microorganisms biomasses are bacteria including streptomyces rimosus rhodococcus opacus pseudomonas luteola brochothrix thermosphacta and vibrio alginolyticus 63 66 however fungal biosorbents such as aspergillus niger are also very interesting due to their high contents of cell wall material which boost the assortment of functionalities available for metal binding 67 algae have high affinity with a wide variety of metals which is an advantage in their use as biosorbents the seaweeds are divided into three major groups red algae green algae and brown algae 68 71 brown algae stand out for having high rates of alginate in their composition a compound described as being mainly responsible by the uptake of metal ions in the biosorption of al3 algae such as padina pavonica sargassum fluitans and laminaria japonica presented satisfactory metal removal results 72 74 lee 75 also investigated the influence of chemical and physical pretreatments to modify the algae sargassum fluitans and improve aluminum removal waste materials produced by industrial or agro industrial processes have also been studied for the removal of al3 biomass such as sludge from wastewater treatment ponds 76 coconut husks 77 powdered eucalyptus bark 78 tea residue 79 and beach cast seaweed 80 have been investigated as promising biosorbents the main advantages are their low cost high availability and environmental sustainability 81 other biosorbent materials such as nanomaterials derived from alternative sources mainly from agro industrial waste and bacterial biomass have been increasingly investigated for the removal of toxic metals 82 these biosorbents are known to have a large surface area and high porosity which substantially improves the adsorptive capacity of these materials 83 studies on the use of nano adsorbents for the removal of toxic metals are recent and still in their early development but promising results have been reported for the uptake of metals such as copper cadmium chromium and lead 84 86 however specifically for the removal of aluminum there is still a lack of research that delves into the topic 4 2 biosorption mechanisms in the biosorption process contaminants are removed through adsorption onto the cell wall or active sites that exist on the surface of the biomaterial both the biosorbent material and the adsorbate must be evaluated in the case of metal contaminants biosorbent metal affinity should be the first factor to be investigated to assess the potential application of the process the effluent aspects to be evaluated are treated volume metal concentration ph temperature and presence of other contaminants that may compete for active sites for the biosorbent in turn one must analyze the features which directly influence the viability of the process such as its origin selectivity physical chemical and biological properties and reuse capacity 16 20 87 this process differs from bioaccumulation process in which metals are removed by the metabolic action of living cells 4 in this process metal ions are removed from the aqueous solution due to the affinity bond of the metal at the active sites and functional groups of the biomaterial structure studying the mechanisms that govern the biosorption of toxic metals can help elucidate the interaction between biosorbent and adsorbate as reported by robalds and collaborators 88 biosorption process may involve several mechanisms such as physisorption chemisorption which may include covalent bonds and complexation ion exchange and microprecipitation fig 3 depicts the main mechanisms involved in biosorption processes hydroxyl carboxyl sulfonate and amine functional groups have been identified in literature as those that can most favor the removal of metals from aqueous solutions 68 89 90 the hard and soft acids and bases hsab concept can help to understand the binding preferences between metals and certain functional groups in this theory metals are divided into groups those classified as type a al3 mg2 ca2 na among others have a strong tendency to bond with compounds containing oxygen such as oh hpo4 2 co while metals classified as type b ag hg2 pb2 zn2 and others form strong bonds with groups containing n or s such as cn nh2 sh moreover bonds containing type a metals tend to be ionic while for type b they tend to be covalent however this cannot be considered a determinant definition since many other factors such as metal concentration and biomass type may affect the system s behavior 91 92 studies reported in the literature suggest that the main mechanisms participating in the biosorption of al 3 ions are largely related to chemisorption but may also have several additional mechanisms like complexation and ion exchange understanding the biosorption of toxic metals especially aluminum requires studying the kinetics equilibrium and thermodynamics of the process 4 3 biosorption kinetics analysis of biosorption kinetics provides information regarding the uptake rate and the time required to reach equilibrium as well as insights about the controlling mechanisms of the overall process kinetic paremeters can be used to develop predictive modeling for continuous biosorption in fixed bed dynamic systems 93 the application of kinetic models is important to identify the rate limiting phase of the biosorption process the most commonly applied models to describe the kinetic rate of adsorption in biosorption studies of toxic metals including aluminum are pseudo first order pfo 94 and pseudo second order pso 95 models being both based on the adsorptive capacity of the solid phase besides these models others can be used to evaluate mass transfer behavior such as intraparticle diffusion 96 boyd s 97 elovich s 98 these models are based on the system s internal or external diffusion mechanism internal diffusion also called intraparticle describes the transport rate of ions via pores or on the adsorbent surface whereas external diffusion relates to the transport rate of the solution adsorbate across the outer film of the biomaterial 99 adsorption kinetics modeling is considered an important step to understand the phenomenon of mass transfer in biosorption and the dynamics of the adsorbate binding mechanism on the biosorbent surface 100 table 1 features the results of various works in the literature for kinetic modeling of al3 biosorption using different biosorbents in most studies the pso model best describes al3 removal indicating that the main mechanism involved in this process is the chemisorption since the derivation of this model was based on the classic equation of the langmuir equilibrium model in which adsorption is assumed to be governed by chemical reactions occurring on a energetically homogenous surface 101 102 although several authors supports this assumption tran et al 89 and other researchers 103 105 emphasize that the biosorption mechanism cannot be defined by kinetic analysis only for them it requires complementary analytical information determined by characterization techniques such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis tga dta and the examination of isotherm and thermodynamic data in addition the knowledge about the nature of the biosorbent is crucial to understand the process mechanism 4 4 biosorption equilibrium biosorption equilibrium described by the isotherms represents the dynamic equilibrium between the metal concentration present in the liquid phase and the adsorbate concentration in the biosorbent at constant temperature and ph the application of isotherm modeling provides important information regarding the affinity level of the biosorbent adsorbate system the properties of the biomaterial surface and the nature of the process therefore equilibrium parameters are essential for the design of a biosorption system 113 114 the isotherm models most commonly applied to analyze biosorption systems are langmuir 115 and freundlich 116 besides a few classic models such as dubinin radushkevich d r 117 langmuir freundlich 118 and temkin 119 the langmuir model assumes that biosorption is reversible and occurs in monolayers the biosorbent surface is homogeneous and has a fixed number of active sites and there is no interaction between the ions once they are bound to the surface 115 this model does not clarify aspects about the removal mechanism although it provides information about maximum removal capacity qmax which is useful to contrast the performance of distinct biosorbent materials 120 121 the freundlich model is recommended for systems with medium to low ion concentrations the main consideration is that it represents multilayer biosorption on a non homogeneous surface the d r model can be applied to investigate the nature of adsorption which may be chemical or physical 46 table 2 features the results of the fit of the models to the equilibrium experimental data of several studies of al3 biosorption with different biosorbents most systems are largely described by the langmuir model which may indicate that in general aluminum biosorption occurs with monolayer formation 4 5 thermodynamic aspects of biosorption thermodynamics of a biosorption process can be examined using the following parameters variation of gibbs energy δgº variation of enthalpy δhº and variation of entropy δsº analysis of δhº values indicates whether the process is endothermic δhº 0 or exothermic δhº 0 process spontaneity is verified by δgº and may be spontaneous δgº 0 or not δgº 0 δsº values in turn are related to the affinity of the metal by the biosorbent material which can be high δsº 0 or low δsº 0 some authors also associate this variable with the degree of disorder in the system s interface 15 127 the study of the value of enthalpy variation can also help in defining if the process is governed mostly by chemical or physical interactions values below 80 kj mol generally indicate that the adsorption mechanism is physical and reversible mostly governed by weak interactions as van der waals forces in irreversible chemical processes enthalpy variation values usually vary between 80 and 400 kj mol and for electrostatic interactions this values vary from 30 to 70 kj mol 128 129 table 3 features the thermodynamic data of several studies on al3 biosorption with different biosorbents the results show that the biosorption processes of al3 ions are largely spontaneous and endothermic as they present positive values for gibbs energy and enthalpy variation respectively entropy variation ranged from 164 4 j mol k to 207 6 j mol k depending on the system most studies presented positive values for δsº indicating increased disorder in the system s biosorbent adsorbate interface and high affinity of al3 ions for most of the biosorbents used however this cannot be fully confirmed since each type of biomass has its particularities such as different types of active sites which are strongly affected by temperature in some of the studies selected in this review although the thermodynamic quantities of the process were not determined considerable enhancement in aluminum uptake was noticed when the temperature was raised indicating that the adsorption is essentially endothermic 76 78 the main explanation for this behavior is that increased temperature leads the boundary layer to become less thick thus facilitating the transfer of metal ions to the biosorbent 130 in other works however the authors observed an opposite behavior a reduced metal uptake with increasing temperature indicating an exothermic process 64 5 biosorption of aluminum using biomaterials 5 1 using bacterial biomass as biosorbent of aluminum bacteria are ubiquitous able to spread under controlled conditions and highly resistant to variations in the medium therefore bacterium biomass is an advantageous biosorbent 122 the cell walls of bacteria present macromolecules such as enzymes lipo polysaccharides peptidoglycan and lipo proteins which are rich in functionalities like carboxyl sulfate phosphate and amino groups the coexistence of cationic and anionic groups grants the bacterial cell wall with an amphoteric behavior nevertheless van der wal et al 131 verified that the anionic groups prevail over cationic groups and so the isoelectric point of most bacterial biomasses does not exceed ph 4 consequently electrostatic interactions between bacteria and positively charged contaminants such as al3 may favor the biosorption process 64 the biomass of rhodococcus opacus strain gram positive was selected by cayllahua and torem 64 for removing aluminum from water first zeta potential measurements indicated an isoelectric point at ph 3 26 for r opacus which is consonant with the literature accordingly at ph conditions above 3 26 the net charge of r opacus bacterium is negative which can directly impact biosorption through electrostatic forces in fact the authors reported an increase in al3 removal efficiency from 11 to 92 by increasing the solution ph from 3 to 5 respectively hence ph 5 was selected as the optimum condition for al3 biosorption onto r opacus the key role of electrostatic attractions in the process was confirmed by ionic strength tests in which al3 uptake capacity augmented by decreasing electrolyte nacl concentration this last finding agrees with that observed in the study by tassit et al 63 who by calculating the activation energy of the process reached the same conclusion the kinetic study of al3 biosorption onto r opacus demonstrated that the system reached equilibrium after approximately 20 min with 100 removal efficiency pfo pso intraparticle diffusion and boyd s were the kinetic models applied to the results which were best represented by the pso model in the equilibrium study the authors observed a significant decrease in qmax with increasing temperature an indication that the system is exothermic comparatively to langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich models temkin model provided the best fit to the equilibrium data temkin isotherm by definition indicates that the adsorption heat reduces linearly with the raise of biosorbent surface coverage 132 ftir spectra showed that the biomass of r opacus bacterium is rich in hydroxyl amino carbonyl carboxyl and phosphate functional groups the shifts in their vibrational bands reveal the complexation coordination of al3 onto the biomass during the process more clear insights on al3 uptake mechanism depends on further characterizations and analysis tassist et al 63 proposed streptomyces rimosus which is a mycelial gram positive bacterium as biosorbent of al3 this bacterium is extensively used for the biosynthesis of oxytetracycline antibiotic the authors received s rimosus biomass from a local algerian pharmaceutical industry and after cleaning and grinding the material was sieved to obtain samples of different particle sizes ftir characterization of s rimosus biomass showed the presence of methyl carboxyl hydroxyl amino thiol and phosphate groups such functionalities agree with the chemistry of the wall and cellular membrane of the selected bacterium the al3 biosorption onto of s rimosus biomass was studied for the effects of particle size biosorbent dosage agitation speed temperature and ph remarkably there was a significant increase in al3 removal capacity with increasing temperature indicating an endothermic process moreover the increase in ph from 2 to 4 favored al3 biosorption onto s rimosus kinetics was better represented by pso model than pfo model the activation energy in the arrhenius equation was estimated as 52 18 kj mol according to aksu 133 activation energy in 8 4 83 7 kj mol range indicates an activated chemisorption process the authors also considered the involvement of ion exchange mechanisms in which the chemical biding between the metal and the biosorbent might be mainly of electrostatic nature equilibrium was better represented by langmuir model than freundlich or d r isotherms nevertheless the magnitude of mean free adsorption energy of d r isotherm 12 91 kj mol reinforced the fact that chemical ion exchange mechanisms governed al3 biosorption the thermodynamic parameters listed in table 3 indicates that the process is feasible endothermic and spontaneous at 10 80 c in the study of isotherms the authors also evaluated the influence of controlled ph they obtained qmax 11 76 mg g at fixed ph 4 and qmax 6 62 mg g at free ph the lower biosorption capacity at free ph was related to the fact that the solution ph diminished to 3 24 at equilibrium the number of anionic sites especially carboxyl groups available to bind al3 cations is lower at ph 3 24 than ph 4 on one hand al3 biosorption onto s rimosus presented the highest value of maximum biosorption capacity among the bacterial biomasses of table 2 but on the other hand it took a relatively long time of 150 min to reach equilibrium ozdemir and bayasal 65 innovated using chryseomonas luteola strain which is habitually found in activated sludge as metal biosorbent c luteola is a floc forming bacterium so it can form a polysaccharide capsule that binds and accumulates the contaminants al3 uptake by c luteola was examined in 1 0 7 0 ph range and the highest biosorption yield was verified at ph 5 0 according to langmuir isotherm the maximum biosorption capacity of al3 was 55 2 mg g the cell demonstrated a greater affinity for aluminum than chromium ions since the maximum cr6 biosorption capacity at ph 4 did not exceed qmax 3 mg g boeris et al 122 analyzed the potential of the non living non viable biomass of the gram negative bacterium pseudomonas putida a atcc 12633 as biosorbent of al3 for comparison purposes they also evaluated the removal capacity using the living viable biomass of p putida a atcc 12633 the effects of ph 2 12 biosorbent dosage 0 60 g l and contact time 1 15 min on al3 biosorption were evaluated for both types of biomass ph 4 3 provided the highest biosorption efficiency around 95 however lower quantities of biosorbent were required by the non viable p putida a atcc 12633 system to attain 100 removal of al3 resistance to mass transfer using either viable biomass 40 g l or non viable biomass 8 g l was negligible since only 1 min of contact time was sufficient to completely remove al3 from solution furthermore boeris et al 122 proved that the membrane phosphatidylcholine pc present in p putida a atcc 12633 plays a key role in the biosorption of al3 for that purpose they developed a mutant bacterium without pc and compared qmax values obtained using all kinds of biomass viable non viable and non viable without pc the biomass without pc showed the worst performance with fast saturation and low al3 removal capacity qmax 0 27 mg g conversely the non viable p putida a atcc 12633 showed the best results qmax 0 55 mg g this indicates that biosorbent performance may be associated with pre treatment by autoclaving which causes the destruction of cells and may promote enhanced surface area and greater availability of binding sites in the non living biomass thus efficiency could be mostly linked to quantitative characteristics of the biosorbent that is the number of active sites and qualitative factors such as metal biosorbent affinity had a secondary role 18 134 the exact interactions of aluminum ions onto non viable biomass could not be completely elucidated however the changes in ftir spectra before and after biosorption indicated the involvement of functional groups of the cells in the process including aluminum complexation with phosphate ester groups the biosorption isotherms were adjusted not only by the traditional langmuir model but also by the model proposed by bueno et al 135 which applies to systems that use microorganism derived biosorbents the parameters from the fitting of bueno et al 135 model confirmed the non viable p putida a atcc 12633 biomass as the most efficient biosorbent for al3 removal especially because it presents the highest amount of binding sites on the surface m 36 105 sites microorganism from table 2 it is noticeable that gram positive bacteria r opaccus and s rimosus show better removal results than gram negative bacteria p putida which some authors associate with the fact that the cell wall of gram positive bacteria presents a thicker peptidoglycan layer which favors the removal of metals 136 5 2 using fungal biomass as biosorbent of aluminum fungal biomass has also attracted great interest as a biosorbent because it offers several advantages first fungus can have up to 30 of its dry weight in the form of cell wall the high cell wall content elevates the variety of functional groups available for metal binding moreover fungus can be easily produced and has a fast life cycle with high yields of biomass to top that fungal biosorbents are mostly non pathogenic and can be safely applied many types of fungal biomass can be obtained from industrial wastes such as saccharomyces cerevisiae from brewery production and aspergillus niger from citric acid production 67 on the other hand research shows that the efficiencies of metal biosorption using fungal biomasses vary substantially this triggered by several reasons including differences in the chemical composition of the cell wall of fungal species boriová et al 137 examined four distinct wild type strains of a niger for al3 removal using living and non living microorganisms the results obtained by using non living a niger biomass were unsatisfactory since the biosorption efficiency did not exceed 9 in turn the al3 removal efficiency reached 53 using a strain of living a niger the living fungal biomass acts in passive biosorption and active uptake bioaccumulation of al3 the difference in effectiveness between the processes may be associated with several factors from the pre treatment method to obtain the biosorbent to the system s operating conditions 138 139 omeike et al 123 investigated al3 removal using aspergillus oryzae biomass obtained from an aluminum industry waste site in nigeria in comparison to other aspergillus ssp and trichoderma spp a oryzae strain showed the highest metal tolerance considering the inhibition zone around the colonies and so was selected for al3 biosorption the ph influence testing indicated that the biosorption process reaches 45 maximum removal at ph 6 moreover 24 h was determined as the optimum equilibrium time for al3 biosorption onto a oryzae biomass langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm were linearly adjusted to the experimental data but the adjustments had r² values lower than 0 85 of the works listed in table 2 this study presented the lowest values for qmax 0 071 mg g which shows the need to optimize the operating conditions of the biosorption process in order to achieve more satisfactory removal capacity values on the other hand naeemullah et al 106 achieved the greatest adsorption capacity 161 23 mg g among the fungal biomasses here presented demonstrating that this microorganism may have a higher affinity to al3 ions which can be associated to an improved metal bond capacity by the optimized batch conditions highlighting the importance of this step to obtain reasonable results in the biosorption process 5 3 using algal biomass as biosorbent of aluminum algae are among the most popular biosorbents because of their abundance all over the world and the ability to undergo pre treatment compared to microorganisms 140 another advantage is that algae have several potential metal binding groups in their cell wall such as carboxyl sulfate and hydroxyl which favors the uptake of toxic metals considering factors such as operating conditions for example one observes that metal biosorption onto algae shows favorable results for a wide range of concentrations using low amounts of biomass and at mild temperatures 141 brown algae are found to be excellent biosorbents for removing metal contaminants including al3 ions the cell wall of brown algae contains fucoidan and alginate alginate can make up 40 of the algae dry weight and holds almost three quarters of the total amount of functional groups 68 vijayaraghavan et al 100 explored the capacity of the brown algae turbinaria conoides to remove aluminum and cadmium ions from in mono and multicomponent systems first the ph effect was evaluated with al3 removal favored at ph 4 and cd2 removal at ph 5 the authors observed that t conoides has greater affinity for al3 ions than cd2 ions since at ph 4 the qmax value on a molar basis was around 3 times higher for aluminum in the binary solute system containing al3 and cd2 both ions compete strongly for the sites on the biosorbent surface the maximum biosorption capacities of al3 and cd2 reduced by approximately 56 and 27 respectively this verified that the presence of cadmium significantly affects the removal of aluminum by t conoides biomass regarding kinetic study vijayaraghavan et al 100 found that both pfo and pso models fitted well the experimental data with high r² values but the values of equilibrium removal capacity estimated by pfo model were closer to those collected experimentally the authors discussed the fact that pso model tends to overestimate the qe value while the pfo model tends to underestimate it the biosorption isotherms of al3 and cd2 onto t conoides algae were evaluated by two parameter models langmuir and freundlich and three parameter models toth and redlich peterson langmuir and toth models were the ones that best described the equilibrium data although the latter assumes that the biosorption system is heterogeneous going against what is suggested as a hypothesis in the langmuir model this contradictory result may be explained by the occurrence of multiple stages and mechanisms on the metal biosorbent binding still in depth analysis such as micrographs of the biomaterial surface or isosteric heat calculation may be necessary to support this hypothesis sari and tuzen 72 evaluated the efficiency of aluminum ion removal in aqueous solution by the brown algae padina pavonica which abundant in atlantic ocean and mediterranean sea and is customarily known as peacocks tail the authors obtained qmax 77 3 mg g at ph 4 5 with 60 min of contact time the equilibrium was well represented by the langmuir model indicating that al3 biosorption on the surface of p pavonica occurs with a monolayer formation in addition the d r model indicated that metal removal in this system may be occurring by chemical ion exchange the pso model fit well with the kinetic data showing that the possible controlling step of biosorption is chemisorption thermodynamic analysis revealed that al3 biosorption onto p pavonica is favorable viable and endothermic and there was also an increase in the disorder of the adsorbate biosorbent interface ftir characterization of the biosorbent before and after the process indicated that the ion exchange between al3 and h ions possibly occurred mainly in the carboxyl hydroxyl and amide groups this observation corroborates the analyses by davis et al 68 who found that brown algae s carboxyl groups are majorly involved in the removal of metals lodeiro et al 80 examined the use of beach cast seaweed from galician coast in spain as biosorbent of aluminum the main component of the biomass was identified as the brown seaweed cystoseira baccata the study was developed not only in batch but also in fixed bed systems the latter is discussed in section 5 6 in the finite bath assays synthetic aluminum solutions were used at initial concentrations of 10 and 100 mg l the authors verified that the biosorption onto beach cast seaweed was reasonably fast and reached equilibrium after about 60 min at the highest concentration biosorption isotherms were obtained at three acidic conditions ph 1 2 5 and 4 there was strong ph influence on the maximum removal capacity of aluminum at ph 4 the qmax value of 22 5 mg g was about twice as high as that obtained at ph 2 5 qmax 11 1 mg g langmuir isotherm model and langmuir freundlich three parameter model provided good fittings to the experimental data indicating monolayer formation on the surface of the seaweed from potentiometric titration assays in deionized water total amount of weak acid groups in the beach cast seaweed was estimated as 2 61 mmol g considering the much lower value of qmax 22 5 mg g 0 83 mmol g it was speculated that some of the weak acid groups were not ionized at ph 4 and that some of these groups were unavailable for binding aluminum because they were already occupied with cations such as na k and mg which are abundant in seawater shaaban et al 124 evaluated the performance of three different marine algae as biosorbents for the uptake of aluminum zinc and iron present in synthetic aqueous solutions and in real effluents the selected algae were gelidium latifolium red algae ulva lactuca green algae and colpomenia sinuosa brown algae the authors concluded that the brown algae c sinuosa showed better results in removing all the metals evaluated next in al3 biosorption efficiency came the red algae g latifolium followed by the green algae u lactuca this order is in agreement with that reached by romera et al 142 when comparing the performance of green red and brown algae in biosorption of different toxic metals noteworthy the excellence of brown algae as biosorbent for a wide variety of metals may be associated with the alginate present in the composition of their cell wall shaaban et al 124 also investigated the interaction between the marine algae and aluminum zinc and iron it was verified that al3 ions had the lowest biosorption affinity to the three algae which may be associated with the fact that zn2 and fe3 are heavier ions and so can bind more easily to the cell wall in addition other intrinsic factors of the metals for example ionic radius and electronegativity may also affect the bonding with the active sites of the biosorbent 143 144 however despite this result the three algae in question showed satisfactory capabilities of al3 removal in both low 0 5 mg l and high 1000 mg l concentrations varying on average between 0 437 and 60 2 mg g respectively by analyzing the thermodynamic parameters and equilibrium data the researchers concluded that the al3 biosorption process in all algae was endothermic δh 0 and that it occurred in an orderly manner at the interface with high affinity between the metal and the biosorbent δs 0 the satisfactory fit of the langmuir model to the experimental indicates a monolayer disposition on the biosorbent surface analyzing the biosorbent surfaces by scanning electron microscopy they observed that the brown algae c sinuosa had a stratified and extensively papillary surface thus having a greater contact surface corroborating the fact that this biomass had good removal results participation of the c n s group in the al removal mechanism was analyzed by ftir especially in c sinuosa where the band change was more pronounced the co group alcoholic group participated in al biosorption only in the red algae g latifolium groups co co and nh were present in all algae the oh group contributed to the removal of the metal in all algae except u lactuca overall one may conclude that biosorption processes of al3 ions using microorganisms i tend to be fast some authors claim that this may be linked to the fact that the cells are very small so resistance to mass transfer may be negligible 145 ii agitation generally does not directly affect the removal results only the time to reach equilibrium iii the cell walls contain functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl amino and phosphoric which are mainly involved in al3 removal by microorganisms iii the solution ph plays a pivotal role in al3 biosorption onto bacterial fungal and algal biomasses regarding this last point it is noteworthy that at low ph conditions phosphate and carboxyl groups are negatively charged due to pka between 3 and 5 this favors the binding of cations such as al3 conversely aluminum chemical speciation and solubility are function of ph high ph values are prohibitive for al biosorption because there is the formation of insoluble hydroxide species 122 5 4 using agro industrial waste as biosorbent of aluminum in the segment of biosorbents derived from agro industrial waste yurtsever and nalçak 77 evaluated the feasibility of using coconut shells to remove al3 in aqueous solutions the biosorbent was submitted to acid pre treatment with hno3 hcl and h2so4 this type of treatment is often used in biomass to remove impurities and assist in the exposure of active sites increasing the ability to remove metal ions however acid treatment tends to increase the amount of protons on the surface of the biomaterial potentially making it positive which could in theory hinder cation removal 146 however fairly satisfactory values of maximum removal capacity of al3 qmax were achieved using the acid treated coconut shells when compared to other biosorbents as shown in table 2 yurtsever and nalçak 77 observed that the biosorption kinetics of al3 onto acid treated coconut shell was initially fast and well defined by pso model system equilibrium was best expressed by freundlich isotherm it was noticed that the biosorbent surface showed several imperfections heterogeneous thermodynamic analysis table 3 verified that the process was endothermic remarkably the authors performed the experiments at ph 7 and claimed that aluminum is still in transition to its precipitated form at this ph value however according to the speciation diagram of fig 2 and several works in the literature above ph 6 aluminum forms the precipitated species al oh 3 metal precipitation can affect both the definition and the understanding of biosorption mechanisms 65 126 147 148 rosa et al 107 investigated the biosorption of aluminum using humin and ashes from its calcination in the kinetic study the authors observed that pso model fitted better to the biosorption using humin while the process using ashes was better represented by the pfo model table 1 from ftir spectra it was observed that groups such as oh cc and co were possibly involved in al3 removal using both biosorbents however small differences in the structure of the ashes compared to humin were identified such as bands indicating the presence of carbonates aliphatic ethers and polysaccharides or silicates these particularities may explain the fit of distinct models to the kinetic biosorption data using humin and its ashes considering that removal capacity may be influenced by the presence of certain components on the structure of the biomaterial and by the way they interact in the biosorption process which can occur through van der waals forces hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions zeta potential analysis indicated that at ph below 7 2 the surface of both biosorbents are positively charged a fact that can hinder the biosorption of aluminum cations as with kinetic modeling the biosorbents also differed in isotherm modeling the equilibrium of aluminum humin system was better represented by the langmuir model while the freundlich model showed an enhanced fit for aluminum ash system the satisfactory fit of freundlich isotherm using the ashes can be associated to the greater heterogeneity of their surface which is motivated by the fact that the calcination process of humin to obtain ashes cannot indeed be controlled the qmax values also reveal that the removal capacity of humin is about twice as high as that of its respective ashes the authors relate this to the presence of a greater number of complexing groups on the surface of humin rajamohan et al 78 analyzed the biosorbent applicability of powder made from the bark of eucalyptus camaldulensis a tree species widely used in pulp and paper industry e camaldulensis bark is mostly composed of cellulose 37 4 lignin 28 and hemicellulose 19 2 the biomaterial underwent acid treatment with c4h6o6 to remove impurities and improve the number of available sites on its surface the study analyzed the influence of the variation of important operating parameters such as amount of biosorbent ph and initial concentration of the metal solution temperature and agitation for the aluminum biosorption from aqueous solutions removal of metal ions was favored at ph 5 decreasing below 4 and above 6 the pso model was identified as the one that best fit the kinetic data at all studied concentrations and temperature while the intraparticle diffusion model did not fit satisfactorily under any experimental condition system equilibrium was explained by langmuir isotherm indicating that aluminum adsorption occurs through the formation of monolayers and that the biosorbent surface is homogeneous the increase in qmax and kl values with temperature indicated an endothermic process evaluation of the system s activation energy ea provided insights about the type of adsorption in this case ea 43 23 kj mol a value considered high indicated that aluminum biosorption using e camaldulensis residue is intrinsically a chemical process el houda larbi et al 76 researched the removal of aluminum and cadmium ions using sludge from treatment ponds as biosorption material as this is a complex organic material characterization was a key step it was found that the sludge was basically composed of a large fraction of organic matter high values of chemical e biological oxygen demand and also low percentages of phosphorus and metal elements such as zinc copper manganese nickel and iron ftir analysis showed the presence of oh ch aliphatic cooh and aromatic groups cc in kinetic and equilibrium studies the most favorable ph for aluminum removal was 4 the system reached equilibrium after 1 h obtaining a removal of 76 for al3 and only 18 for cd3 for monocomposite solutions with initial concentration of 50 mg l the kinetics of both systems was adequately described by the pso model while the equilibrium data of these processes were represented by the langmuir model moreover the qmax value of aluminum using the sludge was the highest among the works featured in table 2 however the preparation of this biosorbent as described by the authors is extremely time consuming since the sludge must undergo the humification process which takes about 180 days in this study a greater affinity of the biosorbent with aluminum than cadmium can be observed the opposite behavior was observed by seo et al 112 whom studied a similar biosorbent a biomass derived from sludge from a wastewater treatment plant for the removal of heavy metals in this study the authors evaluated the affinity and kinetic and equilibrium parameters for several cations among them aluminum was the metal with worst results of maximum removal capacity while cadmium presented one of the highest values for this variable abdel ghani et al 108 used typha domingensis leaves as biosorption material in a multi metal solution containing aluminum iron zinc and lead characterization of the material revealed that its composition contains mainly cellulose hemicellulose and other components such as carbon hydrogen and nitrogen by analyzing the ftir spectrum before and after biosorption functional groups such as oh nh and ch proved to be the main agents of metal removal all processes were carried out at the natural ph of the mixture 2 5 without any adjustment or control system equilibrium was reached after 120 min kinetics was described using the pso model while isotherms were described using the langmuir model analysis of qmax values showed that al removal was not favored this may be associated with the experimental conditions adopted such as very low ph and the presence of other more competitive ions in the solution to sum up like algae agro industrial waste is abundant and rapidly produced the main positive point of using such waste is the sustainability of the process since the biosorbents can be used in the same process plant where they are generated in general this waste has functional groups like oh co nh and ch which favor the removal of aluminum table 2 presents the highest adsorption capacity qmax of al3 ions given by residual sludge from treatment ponds which has no added value and often requires simple pre treatment to be used as a biosorbent however its use would be recommended to treat effluents rather than drinking water due to the total levels of organic carbon and the chemical and biological oxygen demand of the treated water which may result in the generation of compounds such as lignin tannin pectin etc thus resulting in secondary pollutants 89 5 5 biosorbent regeneration the capacity for regeneration and reuse is an important characteristic in selecting biosorbents given its substantial contribution to the economic and environmental viability of the biosorption process regeneration of saturated biomass and recovery of metals can be carried out using acidic or basic eluents chelating agents and even deionized water 149 150 approximately 90 of the works listed in table 2 did not perform biosorbent regeneration studies revealing a gap in this investigation table 4 features a summary of studies on the regeneration of different saturated biosorbents after al3 uptake two to ten adsorption desorption cycles were performed in these studies with biosorbents showing an average of 88 desorption efficiency in the first cycle and 58 5 in the last average aluminum removal efficiency in processes using regenerated biosorbents was 84 in the first cycle and 66 in the last the most commonly used eluent was hcl but some studies used reagents such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta and naoh the most promising results were obtained with hcl which may be associated with the reduced ph of the medium that favors metal desorption besides increasing competition between al3 and h ions for active sites on the biosorbent surface 151 however the use of acid solutions must be controlled as they can permanently damage the structure of the biomaterial 81 5 6 aluminum biosorption in fixed bed dynamic system aiming at large scale industrial applications continuous applications are more indicated to treat large volumes in this sense fixed bed configurations have to be inspected in laboratory and pilot scales to obtain information about the biosorbent saturation in the column and resistance to mass transfer which are important factors in analyzing the efficiency of the process in treating contaminated waters 152 despite the importance of the subject there are few studies in the literature addressing aluminum biosorption in fixed bed systems or using real wastewaters this review shows that the works addressing aluminum biosorption are largely restricted to discontinuous batch experiments and use synthetic solutions although these trials are the first step to understanding the process and defining the optimal operating conditions of biosorption assays using real effluents and fixed bed columns are necessary aiming at practical large scale applications of the technology in this section we will discuss some works available in literature that explores aluminum biosorption using real effluents and or fixed bed columns lodeiro et al 80 performed dynamic tests of al3 biosorption using beach cast seaweed rich in c baccata the authors worked with real effluent from a water treatment plant in which aluminum was the main constituent with a concentration of approximately 481 mg l with the goal of obtaining sufficient empty bed contact time to reach process equilibrium 26 min a system was developed using a column of 80 cm in length and 12 cm in diameter filled with 1100 g of seaweed and with an average flow rate of 250 ml min the maximum removal capacity was 14 mg g the authors carried out the same process using commercial activated charcoal as adsorbent and the maximum removal value achieved was only 1 6 mg g it was also observed that under the same conditions the system with activated charcoal reached the rupture point more quickly than with the beach cast seaweed 5 7 practical applications costa and coworkers 153 applied the alginate extraction waste from the brown algae sargassum filipendula for the treatment of real effluents four types of effluents were examined one from the wastewater from a tannery industry a1 one from the exit of the wastewater treatment facility of a leather industry a2 and two from the entrance and exit of a french urban water treatment station a3 and a4 respectively in strasbourg these effluents contain several metals including aluminum chromium lead and zinc but in different concentrations aluminum levels in a1 1 62 mg l and a2 0 31 mg l were above the recommended levels the biosorption process was initially carried out in discontinuous systems using the effluents at natural ph and also with ph controlled at 3 5 unlike what has been frequently observed for synthetic effluents in most cases al3 removal was hardly affected by the solution ph the removal percentages were mostly similar in the systems with or without ph control around 43 81 and 44 for a1 a2 and a3 respectively in a4 aluminum concentration was already very low 0 02 mg l and showed no variation whatsoever it is known that aluminum uptake may be inhibited in the presence of other metals 100 154 155 however aluminum removal percentages obtained by costa et al 153 were quite significant despite the coexistence of other metals in a1 a2 and a3 effluents it is important to mention that a2 effluent had natural ph around 7 85 it is known that at this value aluminum is in its precipitated form so the highest removal efficiency obtained for a2 can be also associated to chemical precipitation shaaban et al 124 analyzed the efficiency of three different types of algae for the al3 biosorption the best removal results in synthetic effluents were obtained by the brown algae c sinuosa which was selected to study the viability of biosorption using 21 types of wastewater from different industries in the city of borg el arab high concentrations of aluminum were found in effluents from food paper soap and metal processing industries where the levels were reduced from 39 03 mg l 3 13 mg l 9 09 mg l and 4 38 mg l to 12 67 mg l 0 964 mg l 3 21 mg l and 0 93 mg l respectively after biosorption onto brown algae c sinuosa remarkably aluminum concentrations in effluents from paper and metal processing industries were reduced to values below that required by egyptian legislation 3 mg l however the levels reached are still higher than who recommendation 0 2 mg l overall the biosorption process using brown algae c sinuosa was considered promising since it reached an average of 80 8 aluminum removal in all effluents despite not reaching the maximum concentration parameter defined by international bodies based on these results pretreatment is still recommended to reduce the initial concentration of aluminum before the biosorption process kumari and ravindhranath 109 evaluated the performance of biosorbents derived from the plant pongamia pinnata in removing aluminum from wastewater of alumina manufacturing industries the stems and leaves of p pinnata were evaluated in the form of powder and ash summing four types of biosorbents the initial concentration of aluminum in the samples varied between 10 and 16 mg l good aluminum removal percentages were obtained varying from 90 5 to 93 5 for the effluent with the lowest aluminum concentration and 91 5 96 5 for that with the highest concentration similar results were obtained under the same operating conditions using a biosorbent derived from the plant cassia occidentalis indicating that it can also be a viable biomaterial for the removal of aluminum present in real effluents 125 loiacono et al 156 investigated the removal of aluminum and other metals present in the wastewater of a metal finishing factory using hemp felt as biosorbent the samples were collected from exit of the precipitation process of the factory wastewater treatment plant aluminum concentration in samples varied between 1 1 and 9 6 mg l and removal efficiency was between 43 and 49 the authors suggested that factors such as ionic radius electronegativity and molar mass may affect the system s affinity and selectivity among the metals present in the effluent aluminum has the smallest ionic radius and molar mass which would explain its lower removal percentage as in the work by costa 153 removal percentages did not exceed 50 yet may be considered promising in view of the system s competitiveness 6 conclusion and prospects this work presented a review of studies on metal ion biosorption more specifically the removal of aluminum ions although the toxicity of this metal ion is not highlighted in a significant way in the literature compared to other toxic metals aluminum can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as well as water resources among the many processes used to remove aluminum in aqueous media biosorption stands out as one of the most viable in terms of cost benefit and efficiency the studies reviewed involved non conventional and low cost biosorbents for al3 uptake the performance of biosorbents based on bacteria fungus algae and agro industrial wastes was evaluated based on qmax values this article presented the mechanisms involved in the processes using different biosorbents addressing kinetics equilibrium and thermodynamics modeling revealed that most studies have kinetic data described by the pso model while the langmuir model best represents most equilibrium data biosorption of aluminum are in general spontaneous and endothermic processes factors such as temperature ph and initial metal concentration are those that most directly affect the processes the main functional groups involved in the removal of al3 by most of the investigated biosorbents regardless of their source are the carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups although fixed bed dynamic tests are essential to scale up the process few articles approached this system future studies related to aluminum biosorption from aqueous media could address other topics such as i process and product life cycle assessment of aluminum biosorption evaluating the impacts on humans fauna and flora ii studies involving other biosorbents and functionalization especially biomass derived from microorganisms iii application of bionanomaterials from alternative sources for al iii biosorption iv aluminum biosorption studies using real wastewaters in fixed bed dynamic systems v evaluation of biosorbent reuse with adsorption desorption cycles aimed

13624,the diffused aeration process is the most energy intensive operation of bioreactor treatment amounting to 45 75 of the plant energy costs to improve its efficiency it is essential to measure the oxygen transfer rate from the aerators to wastewater in this study a multiphase mixture computational fluid dynamics cfd model is developed using k ε turbulence closure equations along with a discrete population balance model pbm add on with specific bubble classes to predict the oxygen mass transfer the transfer of oxygen species from air to water is modeled using the species transport model the pbm is used to analyze the formation growth breakage and coalescence of air bubbles the validated model is then extended for sensitivity analysis for a diffused aeration system in a bench scale aeration tank results show that the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient increases by 15 with a decrease of air bubble size by 10 the air bubbles have a wider distribution with a larger diameter near the bottom of the bioreactor and a narrow distribution with a smaller bubble size at the top results show that in the bioreactor the dissolved oxygen concentration reaches the equilibrium or saturation value when the height by breadth ratio is 2 5 and does not increase further with increase in height of the water column also the air bubble size of 6 mm was the efficient bubble size for a fixed airflow rate of 1 45 m3 h 1 keywords bioreactor diffused aeration system oxygen mass transfer computational fluid dynamics population balance model 1 introduction aerobic treatment is one of the principle technologies used globally for treatment of wastewater 1 2 about 90 both in terms of the number of facilities and volume treated of municipal and industrial wastewater is treated using aerobic treatment systems 2 3 the present study is motivated by observing the poor efficiency of aeration systems the diffuse aeration system is an important part of the bioreactor mechanism in a wastewater treatment system in these systems the energy expenditure for aeration is very intensive amounting to 45 75 percent of the plant energy costs 4 hence to increase the efficiency of treatment and to reduce the energy cost of aeration it is essential to optimize the aeration system the key step in the evaluation of the efficiency of an aeration system is the measurement of the oxygen transfer rate 4 in diffused aeration systems oxygen mass transfer occurs through two interfaces a through the water air interface at the top water surface and b through the bubble water interface of the rising bubbles from the diffusers with the latter being the most prominent route many factors namely the rising bubble size distribution in the water 5 the flow pattern of the bubbles generated the surface to volume ratio of gas phase in water 5 and the depth of water column 6 8 affect the oxygen transfer rate in diffused aeration systems with the development of computational resources numerical models including computational fluid dynamics cfd models are replacing experimental procedures to analyze the flow pattern the aeration efficiency and other hydrodynamic aspects of bioreactors 9 16 however developing cfd models is challenging due to complex flow dynamics interactions between liquid gaseous and solid phases and complex rheology in bioreactors 17 another challenge is the accurate modelling of bubble size distribution and its effects on oxygen transfer rate many parameters such as airflow rate pore size and inlet air pressure affect the bubble size distribution 18 also the bubble size at any location in the bioreactor is dependent on local turbulence intensities which affect the bubble coalescence and break up 18 to address these challenges for cfd analysis many assumptions have been made one such assumption is to consider only two fluid flow i e air and water and assuming these fluids to be inter penetrating continua using the euler euler approach 18 24 though this approach gives reasonable results it does not take into consideration the effect of microbes sludge on oxygen transfer to address this rahimi et al 25 used a multiphase euler euler model to investigate the interphase oxygen mass transfer and phenomenological oxygen uptake rate our by microbes even though they were able to predict the gas hold up and oxygen concentration variations with aeration time accurately the model for our was over simplified which only included the growth mechanism of only one strain of microorganism using monod kinetics to account for the air bubble size distribution in aerators terashima et al 26 have used euler euler model to match volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla values of different types of diffusers they report an average bubble diameter from coarse fine and slitted diffusers as 7 8 mm 5 6 mm and 3 mm respectively but these bubble sizes were calculated indirectly from the kla leading to possible cumulative errors also this model had a limitation that the bubble sizes can only be assumed in an approximate range which is a simplification of the dynamic nature of the bubbles in bioreactors mcclure et al 27 developed a euler euler cfd model by including a measured kla to characterize the dynamic behavior in bioreactors they validated their model by comparing the kla and bubble size distribution for two bioreactors each having different diameters however as an input to their cfd model they assumed a single bubble size of 4 mm obtained experimentally by measuring the mean size across all operating conditions in real cases there is always a heterogeneous distribution of bubble sizes in bioreactors due to bubble coalescence and breakup another modelling approach reported is the use of euler lagrange method which involves tracking of individual bubbles in the liquid phase 28 but this approach is computationally intensive hence a combined cfd pbm population balance model model which couples equations of motion and population balance equations for bubble number density is considered to be a better approach than a two fluid model with constant bubble size 29 30 a summary of all the methods in studied literature for modelling mass transfer and bubble size distribution using pbm is given in table 1 in brief lehr and mewes 30 simplified the pbm equations into transport equations to simulate transient flow in a uniformly aerated cylindrical bubble column of volume 0 29 m3 initial bubble diameter of 4 mm and superficial gas velocity of 2 0 cms 1 they validated the model using experimental results and observed an axial bubble size variation between 3 mm and 5 5 mm but their work was limited to small bubble columns 0 3 m in diameter attarakih et al 31 used a reduced bivariate pbm model to compare the kla between cfd particulate population balance laboratory ppblab model and cfd opospm one primary and one secondary particle method model the limitation of their approach was that both their models relied on experimentally correlated kla for droplet interactions moilanen et al 32 utilized the multiple size group musig pbm technique and the bubble number density bnd pbm technique for simulating gas holdup and oxygen transfer in a stirred tank reactor of volume 0 2 m3 lane et al 33 and kerdouss et al 34 also employed the bnd pbm model to predict the local bubble size in gas liquid stirred tanks the bnd technique reported to give satisfactory prediction of the local bubble size but only after adjusting some of the empirical constants within the model such as drag correlation coefficient breakup and coalescence rate 34 the musig numerical technique with 10 bubble size classes predicted the local bubble size distribution statistics accurately and was found to be capable of handling polydisperse bubbly flow with large size variation 34 however musig technique needed higher computational power gimbun et al 35 used the quadrature method of moments qmom which is computationally less expensive relative to musig technique to simulate mass transfer in gas liquid stirred tank reactors of sizes 14 l and 200 l though their method provided an accurate prediction of bubble coalescence and breakup for the 14 l bioreactor it overestimated the kla for the scaled up 200 l bioreactor buffo et al 36 developed the dqmom model for simulation of turbulence in stirred bioreactors by considering only two nodes n 2 they were able to validate the model using local bubble size distribution and mass transfer rates obtained experimentally but they used a conservative approach by considering a constant terminal velocity for all bubbles over the entire reactor which is an oversimplification of the actual phenomenon zhang et al 37 investigated the gas holdup and the oxygen mass transfer in the internal airlift reactor using the discrete cfd pbm model this pbm model considered 30 bin classes for bubble size with a volume growth rate of 1 7 though a good agreement was found through the comparison between their simulation and an experimental result a drawback was that their model was based on arbitrary selection of the bubble classes azargoshasb et al 38 simulated a 5 l bioreactor using the discrete pbm equations with 11 bubble classes ranging from 0 5 mm to 8 mm and have validated their model predictions in summary these studies which attempt to combine the pbm with cfd have certain limitations such as poor scalability inability to evaluate the explicit bubble positions size distribution computationally demanding and need of arbitrary selection of bubble size classes as an input to the model they also simplify the complexities of local bubble size distributions with single distribution functions which affect the accuracy of modelling oxygen mass transfer in this study an attempt is made to address these limitations by developing a cfd multiphase mixture model that incorporates the discrete population balance equations to represent the evolution of bubbles and its impact on flow pattern the bubble classes of this discrete model which is an important input parameter are not allotted arbitrarily rather predetermined with the help of experimental observations the developed model is then used to investigate the dissolution of oxygen and efficiency of aeration system for synthetic water the model results are validated against several pilot scale literature experimental results and also with the results from bench scale experimental studies the variation of dissolved oxygen do concentration with i aeration time ii height of water column and iii bubble size distribution is studied the model is further extended for sensitivity analysis in a bench scale aeration tank equipped with single and three diffused aerators the sensitivity parameters that have direct effect on oxygen diffusion and transfer including height by breadth ratio h b of aeration tank height by spacing between aerators h s and bubble size are studied 2 model development and theory 2 1 oxygen mass transfer the asce standard for the measurement of oxygen transfer from diffused aerators in clean water which is based on the two film theory of lewis and whitman is applicable to laboratory scale and full scale aeration systems 39 40 according to this theory the oxygen transfer rate is expressed in terms of the overall oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla and resistance on either side of the interface between air and water for diffusible gases like oxygen the resistance of the liquid film is only considered and the gas film resistance is ignored this one zone mass transfer model was used to analyze the unsteady state re aeration in the aeration tank the mass balance for do in a well mixed reactor is given in eq 1 where otr is the oxygen transfer rate and our is the oxygen uptake rate 1 d c d t o t r o u r since synthetic water without any oxygen consuming species was considered the our 0 hence eq 1 was modified into eq 2 where kla is the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient s 1 cs is the saturation do concentration in water at specified temperature mgl 1 and ct is the do concentration in water at time t mgl 1 the left hand side of eq 2 represents the unsteady state rate of change of oxygen concentration in water and the right hand side represents the concentration gradient between air and water that drives the mass transfer 2 d c d t o t r k l a c s c t the exponential form of the eq 2 is given as eq 3 where t0 is the start time of aeration s and c0 mgl 1 is the initial do concentration in water at time t0 according to eq 3 the do concentration with time follows an increasing exponential function and the maximum amount of oxygen transfer is limited by the saturation concentration at system temperature and pressure the asce standard which uses a nonlinear regression analysis based on the gauss newton method was used to fit the model eq 3 to the re aeration experimental data 3 c t c s c s c 0 e k l a t t 0 using classical penetration theory 39 the mass transfer coefficient kl ms 1 was determined using eq 4 where dl is the diffusion coefficient of air m2s 1 vr is the velocity of the air bubble ms 1 and db is the diameter of the air bubble m 4 k l 2 d l v r π d b the transfer and diffusion of do with the height of water column was modelled as per the axial dispersion model theory 41 the axial dispersion of oxygen was expressed analogous to fick s law of diffusion and the longitudinal dispersion was assumed to be negligible 41 the transfer and diffusion of do with the height of water column was expressed as eq 5 where day is the dispersion coefficient m2s 1 ul is the superficial gas velocity ms 1 and y is the height of water column measured from the bottom of the tank m the first term of eq 5 represents the rate of change of oxygen concentration at different heights of water column due to dispersion the second term represents the rate of change due to advection and the third term represents the rate of change due to mass transfer 5 d a y d 2 c d y 2 u l d c d y k l a c s c t 0 the conditions for the lower and the upper boundaries proposed by langmuir and deckwer et al 42 as shown in eq 6 was imposed where l is the axial position of upper boundary for describing the lower zone boundary eq 6a was used it states that the oxygen concentration c o in liquid element below a zone boundary is equal to the difference of the oxygen concentration c o just above the zone boundary and that by axial dispersion for describing the upper zone boundary eq 6b was used it states that the oxygen concentration gradient is zero at the upper zone boundary 6a u l c o u l c o d a y d c d y o 6b d c d y l 0 the effect of pressure and height of the water column on the saturation do was given as eq 7 where p and q are coefficients derived from pressure readings at different heights of water column 7 c s p q y assuming constant value for kla and the axial dispersion coefficient over the entire water zone 50 the solution for the differential eq 5 was obtained as eq 8 where b1 b2 b3 b4 m and n are coefficients these coefficients are tabulated as table s1 in supplementary material 8 c b 1 exp n y b 2 exp m y b 3 y b 4 2 2 multiphase cfd model the hydrodynamics of flow and oxygen transfer in diffused aeration systems was modelled using cfd commercial package ansys fluent multiphase mixture model was used to model the flow characteristics and mixing of air and water though several turbulence models are available in ansys fluent package the standard k ε turbulence model was chosen because of its advantages such as computational stability and better convergence with lower utilization of cpu power 43 44 in the mixture model a single set of navier stokes equation was solved for the mixture phase and a separate equation was solved to identify the relative velocity of the dispersed phase the continuous phase consisting of water and air nitrogen and oxygen was considered as the secondary phase 45 46 the mass conservation and momentum conservation equations of the mixture was expressed as eqs 9 and 10 where g is the acceleration is due to gravity ms 2 f is a body force nm 3 α p is volume fraction of phase p ρ p is density of the phase p kg m 3 and v d r p is

balance equation to describe the changes in the bubble population was considered along with mass and momentum conservation equations the balance equation was then solved using the discrete method developed by hounslow et al litster et al and ramkrishna et al 47 50 using this method the particle population was discretized into a finite number of size intervals and the size distribution was then coupled with fluid dynamics for computation the discrete method provides the advantage of computing the particle size distribution of bubbles directly the balance equation in terms of volume fraction

to the procedure followed in the work by hounslow et al 51 and were given as eq 28 where vj 1 m3 is the bubble volume of class j 1 and vj m3 is the bubble volume of antecedent class j and n 2 28 v j 1 n v j methodology followed for the cfd pbm model development is shown in fig 1 the oxygen transfer efficiency for the experimental conditions was modeled using the multiphase mixture model using ansys fluent tool the bubble dynamics were simulated using the pbm add on module the geometry was created in fluent design modeller and a 2d mesh grid was generated in icem cfd tetrahedron meshes were generated with a mesh size of 0 001 m the advection and diffusion of oxygen from the air to water was modelled using the species transport model the do concentrations were inferred from simulation results and were compared with experimental observations 3 methods 3 1 experimental methods to validate the developed multiphase model oxygen transfer efficiency analysis experiments were carried out in a bench scale plexiglass tank of capacity 2352 l length width depth 1 4 m 1 4 m 1 2 m all tests were conducted using synthetic water deoxygenated water since asce standard procedure recommended using of synthetic water to conduct oxygen transfer tests rather than wastewater 40 52 53 several studies have indicated the use of synthetic water for oxygen transfer tests to obtain consistency and comparability of results 40 52 for batch reactors with mechanical stirrers for aeration the stirring speed was found to have a direct correlation with oxygen dissolution it was observed that higher stirrer speeds and higher gas flow rates improved the oxygen transfer capacity 54 because a higher stirring speed resulted in higher breakage and residence time of the air bubbles in the bioreactor 55 also higher number of blades in impellers of stirrers had noticeable effect on volumetric mass transfer of oxygen 55 an increase in kla value from 15 to 27 was observed by replacing a single impeller with twin impeller configuration 55 however in this study all the experiments were performed in a batch reactor without mechanical stirring which mimic the diffused aeration systems these kind of diffused aeration systems have several advantages over mechanical stirrers surface aerators such as a higher standard aeration efficiency sae of 7 8 kg o2 kwh while it is 2 kg o2 kwh for mechanical stirrers higher oxygen transfer rates higher flexibility with independent air flow control systems and submerged parts with little maintenance 56 58 given these advantages the diffused aerators have become the most preferred method in bioreactors especially with deep tanks where uniform aeration is difficult to achieve with mechanical aeration systems the diffused aeration was provided through three porous circular fine bubble diffusers please refer to fig s1 of supplementary material and the video of aeration system at an aeration intensity of 0 0065 m3 min before each experiment the tank was drained and cleaned to prevent salt accumulation 68 although many factors such as temperature 59 salinity 59 composition of water i e presence and nature of microorganisms 60 and operating pressure 59 affects the oxygen mass transfer in all experimental trials the temperature 25 c salinity 150 2 ppm ph 6 7 hardness 130 1 5 ppm pressure 1 atm and alkalinity 120 1 ppm were kept uniform also the airflow rate was measured using a pre calibrated airflow meter synthetic water having a do of 0 5 0 01 ppm was obtained by deoxygenating tap water using sodium sulfite na2so3 in the presence of cobalt as catalyst the amount of sodium sulfite to be added was calculated based on the theoretical demand 8 kg of na2so3 per kg of do to ensure initial do levels to be same in all experimental trials before the start of each experiment the initial do level was measured to ensure that it was always 0 5 0 01 ppm the synthetic water was aerated using submerged diffusers and the do values were recorded at regular intervals of 1 min the water was subjected to uniform aeration using diffused aerators given that the rising air bubbles created a well mixed condition in the reactor please refer to the video s1 of supplementary material this procedure of collecting a single sample was adopted as specified in apha standards 61 the do concentrations were determined using the modified winkler do titration procedure 40 even though use of in situ devices increases the ease of measurement of do levels the standard winkler s method is the most reliable and accepted method for the determination of dissolved oxygen in water and wastewater 62 63 the standard winkler s method has reported accuracy of 0 1 in measuring do levels in deoxygenated water columns 63 also the presence of an air bubble around the optical sensor in the do probe local pressure and temperature fluctuations around the sensor has been found to influence the measurements using in situ devices 64 given these difficulties the winkler s method was chosen the experiments were replicated thrice and calibration checks were conducted using distilled water of known do concentrations detailed information on the experimental procedure is given in table 2 3 2 bubble size distribution a highspeed video camera chronos 1 4 kron technologies equipped with canon ef s18 55 lens was used to capture the bubble size distribution at 1050 frames per second fps the lights were so arranged to obtain uniform illumination in all the frames fig 2 shows the schematics of the experimental setup the video was captured at different heights of the water column and the focus plane of the frames was approximately midway between the walls of the tank with depth of focus field 0 46 m assuming that the bubble size variation is considerably less across the lateral profile of the tank 65 a measuring tape was placed on the wall of the tank which served as a basis for comparison of bubble size the bubbles were observed not to be spherical but could be approximated by an oblate spheroid the images of the bubbles were processed using imagej 66 standard tool to obtain the maximum and minimum dimensions of individual bubbles 3 3 validation of cfd model the experimental results obtained from lab scale apparatus was validated using that from cfd pbm model further to prevent limitations associated with lab scale setup experimental results from literature studies which were from larger systems were selected for the validation of the multiphase cfd model results the simulation results were compared with the literature experimental results 41 67 71 and the percentage error was calculated for each case detailed description of each experimental case case 1 to case 6 is provided in the supplementary material s 1 all meshes generated in icem cfd are unstructured and composed of tetrahedrons and the grid was refined near the wall the simulations were carried out using transient solver in fluent the details of the simulation are summarized in table 3 the grid independence study as per richardson extrapolation method 72 was conducted to investigate numerical accuracy and reliability of the simulation results all the experimental cases were simulated using three mesh qualities namely coarse medium and fine the two criteria for mesh independence i e a the asymptotic order of convergence aoc 1 and b grid convergence index gci 5 were investigated at all the grid points the richardson extrapolation method was applied to estimate the value at zero grid spacing φext using medium and fine meshes the details of the mesh element density for the gci study for the literature experimental cases are given in supplementary material fig 3 shows the variation of do with aeration time for experimental case 2 67 with coarse medium fine grid refinement and richardson extrapolation values as seen from fig 3 the values of fine mesh and richardson extrapolation are found to be very close to each other indicating grid independency following the same procedure grid independency was established for all the other experimental cases it was also observed that both the criteria for grid independence including aoc 1 and gci 5 were achieved for all the grid points of each experimental case results obtained from fine mesh for all the experimental cases studied are reported 4 results and discussions 4 1 model validation with experimental observations 4 1 1 do variation with aeration time fig 4 shows the change of do with aeration time in fig 4 experimentally found values analytically calculated values using eq 1 and the results from cfd simulation are presented as shown in fig 4 with aeration time the do concentration in the water increases exponentially till it reaches the saturation value as can be seen from fig 4 the analytically calculated do values with aeration time coincide with the experimental observations also results from the simulation are matching closely with the experimental results with a maximum deviation of 5 the do profile vs depth for the experiments was examined but since the height of the water column was only 1 m there was no pronounced variation in do levels at different heights in the water column the saturation concentration of do in water is governed by the temperature of the system according to henry s law 40 with aeration time the do value increase exponentially till 42 min and reaches a saturation value of 8 15 mgl 1 as shown in fig 4 aeration beyond this time did not increase the do concentration in the water this result confirms that at equilibrium the maximum amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in water at a given temperature and pressure is the saturation do concentration but there are certain conditions under which water can be supersaturated since do increases with increase in pressure at higher hydrostatic pressures water can hold more do than the saturation concentration supersaturation can also occur under conditions of rapid temperature change and for highly agitated rapidly aerated bioreactors in this work all the experiments were conducted at standard temperature and pressure with uniform aeration and hence the chances of super saturation are eliminated for real wastewater there are many other factors that affect the oxygen mass transfer one of the major factors is temperature the solubility of oxygen decreases with increase in temperature the saturation do concentration in water is also different for different temperature for example at 25 c the amount of oxygen dissolved in water at 100 saturation will be 8 3 mgl 1 while at 20 c the saturation do concentration will be 9 1 mgl 1 the do levels decrease exponentially with increase in the salinity of water at the same temperature and pressure the do levels in saltwater will be 20 less than that in freshwater suspended solids are also known to affect the oxygen dissolution in water the suspended solids are known to adsorb at the air liquid interface causing reduction of bubble velocity and creating diffusion barriers leading to reduction in kla 73 the wastewater composition specifically the types of microorganism present has direct effect on the do levels as given in eq 1 the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water at a particular time is the difference between the oxygen transfer rate otr and the oxygen uptake rate our the our refers to the rate of consumption of oxygen from water by aerobic microorganisms according to the activated sludge model asm theory there are two kinds of microorganisms responsible for oxygen consumption in bioreactors the heterotrophs and the autotrophs the heterotrophs consume oxygen to biologically decompose the soluble substrate a percentage of cod in wastewater while the autotrophs consume oxygen to decompose ammonia for their growth the rate of growth and decay of these microbes expressed using monod kinetics and the oxygen uptake rates are modelled in detail in the asm models asm 1 asm 2 and asm 3 60 4 1 2 determination of kla the kla value was obtained graphically by fitting a linear regression equation modifying eq 2 to the experimental observations of do versus aeration time the slope of linear fit between ln cs ct cs c0 and effective time t t0 of aeration shown in supplementary material fig s2 gives the kla to be 0 0253 min 1 the obtained value of kla was used as the volumetric mass transfer coefficient for modeling and cfd simulations for diffused aerators the kla determined under different experimental conditions such as air flow rates and volume of water aerated from various literature studies is summarized in table 4 as seen from table 4 for experimental conditions with low water volume water depth 2 m the kla value is in the lower range 0 0121 0 175 min 1 whereas for studies with larger water depth 2 m it is in higher range 0 1 min 1 it is observed that kla increases with increase in air flow rate diffusion of pure oxygen instead of air is also found to have positive effect on kla given that for the present study as water depth was only 1 m the low kla 0 0253 min 1 was considered a reasonable estimate 4 1 3 bubble size distribution experimental studies were conducted to determine the axial bubble size distribution in the water column the initial bubble size from the sparger obtained experimentally was fed as an input to the pbm model and the bubble size evolution with time and height of the water column were simulated the cross sectional area of the initial bubbles was determined from analyzing the photographs using the imagej 66 tool and then the diameter of the bubbles was calculated the data on bubble size variation from bottom to the top of the water column was determined from the photographs on an average more than 120 individual bubbles per frame were analyzed from photographs to determine the mean diameter it was observed that the rising bubbles especially in swarms changed their shape size and their count due to contraction and expansion which matched the observations by akita k et al 82 fig 5 shows the distribution plot of bubble size count in the water column at different heights measured from the bottom of the tank observed experimentally and the simulation results obtained from the cfd pbm model as shown in fig 5 the experimental results matched with that from the simulations the maximum deviation between the simulation results and the experimental bubble sizes were 6 5 and this difference was attributed to the overestimation of bubble breakage kernel value as seen in fig 5 with increase in the height of water column from 0 15 m to 0 6 m the bubble size distribution curve is narrowing that is at the bottom of the tank 0 15 m the air bubble size ranged from 1 5 mm to 3 6 mm while at the top 0 6 m the bubble size varied between 1 mm and 1 5 mm fig 5 also shows that at the bottom of the tanks the bubble counts were lower whereas at the top the number of bubbles were higher this shows that there were many small diameter bubbles near the top of the tank whereas only a few larger diameter bubbles were present at the bottom of the tank the reduction in the bubble size with height of the water column was attributed to the increased rate of dispersion or breakage of bubble with height rather than bubble aggregation 41 the above result can also be validated indirectly using the axial dispersion theory eq 5 the size distribution of air bubbles in aeration systems depends on the balance between coalescence and breakup rates 81 the bubbles that just leave the diffuser initial bubbles are different in size and shape from those rising through the water column the do concentration at the top of the water column will be higher as compared to the bottom validated using literature experimental results fig 8 it is also proven in literature fig 7 that the do transfer is higher from smaller bubbles as compared to bigger bubbles so the higher do concentration at the top of the water column can be attributed to the high number of small bubbles at the top hence the inference that diffuse aeration results in high number of small diameter bubbles near the top and low number of big air bubbles near the bottom of the tank is reasonable 4 2 model validation with literature data further to establishing that the cfd multiphase model results were matching well with the experimentally observed values for synthetic water simulations were conducted on experimental conditions available in literature the model simulations were compared with literature experimental results on pilot scale and full scale reactors the geometry and mesh for simulation of each literature experimental case as given in table 3 was generated in ansys icem cfd the kla as obtained from the literature for each experimental case were included for modeling mass transfer from air to synthetic water fig 6 shows the do variation with aeration time for experimental cases 3 68 4 69 5 70 and 6 71 as expected for each case the do concentration followed an exponential curve with the maximum limit as the saturation do concentration at specified temperature the cfd simulation values were comparable with the literature experimental value with an error of 5 5 as seen from fig 6 in the study by andinet et al 71 the maximum saturation concentration of 10 1 ppm at 15 c was reached after 60 s of aeration but in the study by tsuyoshi et al 69 the maximum saturation do concentration of 8 3 ppm at 25 c was only attained after 1000 s of aeration even though the geometry of diffusers and the volume of water aerated are comparable in these two studies the difference in the aeration time for saturation of do can be attributed to the difference in the airflow rate thus this result shows that the flow rate of air plays an important role in the diffusion of oxygen in synthetic water fig 7 shows the do in synthetic water versus the bubble size at various height of synthetic water column as shown in fig 7 the do concentration is found to increase with decreasing air bubble size also the cfd multiphase model simulated values are in accordance with literature experimental values when the size of the air bubble decreases surface area for mass transfer of the bubble per unit volume of gas increases with the increase in surface area the mass transfer of oxygen species from air to synthetic water also increases the results show that when the bubble size decreases by 10 the kla increases by 15 conversely when the bubble diameter increases by 10 the kla decreases by 11 8 the transfer of oxygen from the air to water is dependent on bubble size the rate of ascent of the bubble pressure temperature bubble dispersion and coalescence 8 with an increase in height of synthetic water column there is an elongation of the path of air bubbles in synthetic water 41 an increase in the path of the bubble increases the chance of bubble breakage and reduces the bubble diameter this result in more do transfer and according to eq 5 the do concentration increases with the height of the water column until the saturation concentration is attained the saturation oxygen concentration is proportional to the pressure at different heights in the synthetic water column fig 8 shows the do variation with the height of the tank or synthetic water column for various literature experimental conditions 41 67 68 as seen in fig 8 the analytical solution obtained from eq 4 the experimental values and the multiphase numerical solutions of do variations are presented the analytical solution method tends to overestimate the do concentrations as compared to experimental observations this may be due to the assumption of constant kla along the longitudinal profile in the axial model theory the cfd model predicts the do concentration variation with height accurately and the variation was observed to be within 6 the experimental and numerical values were compared using mean absolute percentage error the variation of cfd results is attributed due to the averaging of lateral profile of do concentration in planes at different height of the water column 4 3 sensitivity analysis the validated multiphase cfd model was further extended for sensitivity analysis of the diffused aeration system in a bench scale aeration tank two simulation scenarios with a single aerator and a combination of three diffused aeration systems were considered for the sensitivity study the geometry of the aeration tank and diffuser operating parameters are given in table 5 the sensitivity parameters considered for the study were height by breadth ratio h b of aeration tank height by spacing between the diffusers h s and size of air bubbles the details of the parameters for sensitivity analysis are given in table 6 gci studies are performed for sensitivity analysis given in fig s3 of supplementary material and all results reported here were with fine mesh refinement fig 9 a and b shows the do variation with the aeration time and height of the tank for bubble sizes of 9 mm 6 mm and 3 mm respectively it can be observed from fig 9 a and b that the mass transfer of do from air to synthetic water was higher for the smaller bubble size hence at a fixed air flow rate it is efficient to use diffusers with smaller pore size to achieve better transfer of oxygen but achieving smaller bubble size by reducing the pore size is not practical because smaller pore size causes high backpressure in diffusers and requires higher compressor capacity which will lead to higher power consumption hence there is a need to identify an efficient pore size for the diffuser which results in minimum backpressure from fig 9 a and b it can be noticed that there was a significant difference in the concentration of do in synthetic water for bubble size of 9 mm and 6 mm after an aeration period of 90 min but the difference in do concentration of 6 mm and 3 mm bubble size for the same aeration period was negligible the inference was that the diffuser with 6 mm bubble size could dissolve more oxygen in synthetic water without significantly increasing the backpressure hence one can identify that 6 mm is the efficient pore size bubble size for the fixed airflow rate under the given conditions the variation of do with the height of the tank for different h b ratios is shown in fig 10 a b and c it can be observed from fig 10 a that for an h b ratio of 1 5 the do concentration increases with the height of the synthetic water column but does not reach the saturation concentration 9 1 mgl 1 for 20 c similarly from fig 10 b for h b ratio of 2 for the same aeration time of 50 s the do concentration has reached equilibrium but not saturation for the h b ratio of 2 5 from fig 10 c the concentration of do in synthetic water has clearly reached the saturation limit for 50 s of aeration time from these observations it can be inferred that a higher h b ratio can result in an increased rate of do saturation for a fixed aeration time fig 11 shows the results of do variation with height of the tank for h s ratio of 2 and h s ratio 6 the spacing between the diffusers is an important parameter since improper spacing of the diffusers leads to inefficient mixing of oxygen in water and forms dead zones regions in water column with no or little oxygen content as seen from fig 11 the maximum do concentration for h s ratio of 6 was 9 mgl 1 while for the same aeration time for h s ratio of 2 the maximum do concentration was 8 2 mgl 1 thus it can be inferred that the reduction in spacing between the diffusers have a positive effect on the do concentration in bioreactors less the spacing between the diffuser the more the need to increase the number of diffusers and more the energy consumption for aeration hence there should be an effective balance between diffuser number and the spacing for attaining economic efficiency 5 conclusion and perspectives the transfer and dissolution of oxygen from the air to synthetic water for a diffused aeration system was analyzed using a multiphase cfd model the dynamics of bubble flow and its influence on do concentrations were incorporated using the discrete population balance equations the developed cfd model was validated with bench scale experimental studies and several pilot scale literature experimental results the three major parameters that influence the do transfer namely 1 the aeration time 2 the height of water column and 3 bubble size or bubble diameter were analyzed using the multiphase model the key observations were the simulation result agreed reasonably with experimental results with a maximum deviation of 6 the kla was found to be 0 0253 min 1 and the do concentration in synthetic water is observed to increase exponentially with aeration time until the saturation oxygen concentration is reached diffuse aeration results in high number of small diameter bubbles near the top of bioreactors and low number of big air bubbles near the bottom of the tank at the bottom of the tank the air bubbles had a wide range between from 1 5 mm to 3 6 mm while at the top of the tank the bubble size distribution had a narrow range between 1 mm and 1 5 mm while observing the variation of do with the air bubble size or bubble diameter the do concentration is found to increase with a reduction in air bubble size due to the increase in the surface area of the bubbles also the kla was observed to increase by 15 when the bubble size reduces by 10 the axial variation of do from bottom to the top of the aeration tank also follows an exponential function with maximum do concentration at the top of the tank the increase in the do concentration with height of water is attributed to the distribution of smaller bubbles at the top of the water column this is confirmed by the numerical results from the multiphase model a higher h b ratio can result in an increased rate of do saturation for a fixed aeration time in our modeling case the equilibrium or saturation do concentration was achieved at the h b ratio of 2 5 and does not increase further the bubble size of 6 mm was perceived to be the efficient pore size bubble size which provides a balance between improved oxygen dissolution and optimum backpressure in diffusers the do concentration varying from bottom to top of the aeration tank for different h s ratios was also examined and it was seen that with an increase in the h s ratio or reduction in the spacing s between the diffused aerators there is an improvement in the oxygen mass transfer and increase in do concentration in synthetic water the developed multiphase model is proposed to be extended to evaluate the variation of other parameters including bod cod and nitrogen and phosphate compounds in full scale bioreactor systems this can be achieved by integrating the biokinetics of

13624,the diffused aeration process is the most energy intensive operation of bioreactor treatment amounting to 45 75 of the plant energy costs to improve its efficiency it is essential to measure the oxygen transfer rate from the aerators to wastewater in this study a multiphase mixture computational fluid dynamics cfd model is developed using k ε turbulence closure equations along with a discrete population balance model pbm add on with specific bubble classes to predict the oxygen mass transfer the transfer of oxygen species from air to water is modeled using the species transport model the pbm is used to analyze the formation growth breakage and coalescence of air bubbles the validated model is then extended for sensitivity analysis for a diffused aeration system in a bench scale aeration tank results show that the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient increases by 15 with a decrease of air bubble size by 10 the air bubbles have a wider distribution with a larger diameter near the bottom of the bioreactor and a narrow distribution with a smaller bubble size at the top results show that in the bioreactor the dissolved oxygen concentration reaches the equilibrium or saturation value when the height by breadth ratio is 2 5 and does not increase further with increase in height of the water column also the air bubble size of 6 mm was the efficient bubble size for a fixed airflow rate of 1 45 m3 h 1 keywords bioreactor diffused aeration system oxygen mass transfer computational fluid dynamics population balance model 1 introduction aerobic treatment is one of the principle technologies used globally for treatment of wastewater 1 2 about 90 both in terms of the number of facilities and volume treated of municipal and industrial wastewater is treated using aerobic treatment systems 2 3 the present study is motivated by observing the poor efficiency of aeration systems the diffuse aeration system is an important part of the bioreactor mechanism in a wastewater treatment system in these systems the energy expenditure for aeration is very intensive amounting to 45 75 percent of the plant energy costs 4 hence to increase the efficiency of treatment and to reduce the energy cost of aeration it is essential to optimize the aeration system the key step in the evaluation of the efficiency of an aeration system is the measurement of the oxygen transfer rate 4 in diffused aeration systems oxygen mass transfer occurs through two interfaces a through the water air interface at the top water surface and b through the bubble water interface of the rising bubbles from the diffusers with the latter being the most prominent route many factors namely the rising bubble size distribution in the water 5 the flow pattern of the bubbles generated the surface to volume ratio of gas phase in water 5 and the depth of water column 6 8 affect the oxygen transfer rate in diffused aeration systems with the development of computational resources numerical models including computational fluid dynamics cfd models are replacing experimental procedures to analyze the flow pattern the aeration efficiency and other hydrodynamic aspects of bioreactors 9 16 however developing cfd models is challenging due to complex flow dynamics interactions between liquid gaseous and solid phases and complex rheology in bioreactors 17 another challenge is the accurate modelling of bubble size distribution and its effects on oxygen transfer rate many parameters such as airflow rate pore size and inlet air pressure affect the bubble size distribution 18 also the bubble size at any location in the bioreactor is dependent on local turbulence intensities which affect the bubble coalescence and break up 18 to address these challenges for cfd analysis many assumptions have been made one such assumption is to consider only two fluid flow i e air and water and assuming these fluids to be inter penetrating continua using the euler euler approach 18 24 though this approach gives reasonable results it does not take into consideration the effect of microbes sludge on oxygen transfer to address this rahimi et al 25 used a multiphase euler euler model to investigate the interphase oxygen mass transfer and phenomenological oxygen uptake rate our by microbes even though they were able to predict the gas hold up and oxygen concentration variations with aeration time accurately the model for our was over simplified which only included the growth mechanism of only one strain of microorganism using monod kinetics to account for the air bubble size distribution in aerators terashima et al 26 have used euler euler model to match volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla values of different types of diffusers they report an average bubble diameter from coarse fine and slitted diffusers as 7 8 mm 5 6 mm and 3 mm respectively but these bubble sizes were calculated indirectly from the kla leading to possible cumulative errors also this model had a limitation that the bubble sizes can only be assumed in an approximate range which is a simplification of the dynamic nature of the bubbles in bioreactors mcclure et al 27 developed a euler euler cfd model by including a measured kla to characterize the dynamic behavior in bioreactors they validated their model by comparing the kla and bubble size distribution for two bioreactors each having different diameters however as an input to their cfd model they assumed a single bubble size of 4 mm obtained experimentally by measuring the mean size across all operating conditions in real cases there is always a heterogeneous distribution of bubble sizes in bioreactors due to bubble coalescence and breakup another modelling approach reported is the use of euler lagrange method which involves tracking of individual bubbles in the liquid phase 28 but this approach is computationally intensive hence a combined cfd pbm population balance model model which couples equations of motion and population balance equations for bubble number density is considered to be a better approach than a two fluid model with constant bubble size 29 30 a summary of all the methods in studied literature for modelling mass transfer and bubble size distribution using pbm is given in table 1 in brief lehr and mewes 30 simplified the pbm equations into transport equations to simulate transient flow in a uniformly aerated cylindrical bubble column of volume 0 29 m3 initial bubble diameter of 4 mm and superficial gas velocity of 2 0 cms 1 they validated the model using experimental results and observed an axial bubble size variation between 3 mm and 5 5 mm but their work was limited to small bubble columns 0 3 m in diameter attarakih et al 31 used a reduced bivariate pbm model to compare the kla between cfd particulate population balance laboratory ppblab model and cfd opospm one primary and one secondary particle method model the limitation of their approach was that both their models relied on experimentally correlated kla for droplet interactions moilanen et al 32 utilized the multiple size group musig pbm technique and the bubble number density bnd pbm technique for simulating gas holdup and oxygen transfer in a stirred tank reactor of volume 0 2 m3 lane et al 33 and kerdouss et al 34 also employed the bnd pbm model to predict the local bubble size in gas liquid stirred tanks the bnd technique reported to give satisfactory prediction of the local bubble size but only after adjusting some of the empirical constants within the model such as drag correlation coefficient breakup and coalescence rate 34 the musig numerical technique with 10 bubble size classes predicted the local bubble size distribution statistics accurately and was found to be capable of handling polydisperse bubbly flow with large size variation 34 however musig technique needed higher computational power gimbun et al 35 used the quadrature method of moments qmom which is computationally less expensive relative to musig technique to simulate mass transfer in gas liquid stirred tank reactors of sizes 14 l and 200 l though their method provided an accurate prediction of bubble coalescence and breakup for the 14 l bioreactor it overestimated the kla for the scaled up 200 l bioreactor buffo et al 36 developed the dqmom model for simulation of turbulence in stirred bioreactors by considering only two nodes n 2 they were able to validate the model using local bubble size distribution and mass transfer rates obtained experimentally but they used a conservative approach by considering a constant terminal velocity for all bubbles over the entire reactor which is an oversimplification of the actual phenomenon zhang et al 37 investigated the gas holdup and the oxygen mass transfer in the internal airlift reactor using the discrete cfd pbm model this pbm model considered 30 bin classes for bubble size with a volume growth rate of 1 7 though a good agreement was found through the comparison between their simulation and an experimental result a drawback was that their model was based on arbitrary selection of the bubble classes azargoshasb et al 38 simulated a 5 l bioreactor using the discrete pbm equations with 11 bubble classes ranging from 0 5 mm to 8 mm and have validated their model predictions in summary these studies which attempt to combine the pbm with cfd have certain limitations such as poor scalability inability to evaluate the explicit bubble positions size distribution computationally demanding and need of arbitrary selection of bubble size classes as an input to the model they also simplify the complexities of local bubble size distributions with single distribution functions which affect the accuracy of modelling oxygen mass transfer in this study an attempt is made to address these limitations by developing a cfd multiphase mixture model that incorporates the discrete population balance equations to represent the evolution of bubbles and its impact on flow pattern the bubble classes of this discrete model which is an important input parameter are not allotted arbitrarily rather predetermined with the help of experimental observations the developed model is then used to investigate the dissolution of oxygen and efficiency of aeration system for synthetic water the model results are validated against several pilot scale literature experimental results and also with the results from bench scale experimental studies the variation of dissolved oxygen do concentration with i aeration time ii height of water column and iii bubble size distribution is studied the model is further extended for sensitivity analysis in a bench scale aeration tank equipped with single and three diffused aerators the sensitivity parameters that have direct effect on oxygen diffusion and transfer including height by breadth ratio h b of aeration tank height by spacing between aerators h s and bubble size are studied 2 model development and theory 2 1 oxygen mass transfer the asce standard for the measurement of oxygen transfer from diffused aerators in clean water which is based on the two film theory of lewis and whitman is applicable to laboratory scale and full scale aeration systems 39 40 according to this theory the oxygen transfer rate is expressed in terms of the overall oxygen volumetric mass transfer coefficient kla and resistance on either side of the interface between air and water for diffusible gases like oxygen the resistance of the liquid film is only considered and the gas film resistance is ignored this one zone mass transfer model was used to analyze the unsteady state re aeration in the aeration tank the mass balance for do in a well mixed reactor is given in eq 1 where otr is the oxygen transfer rate and our is the oxygen uptake rate 1 d c d t o t r o u r since synthetic water without any oxygen consuming species was considered the our 0 hence eq 1 was modified into eq 2 where kla is the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient s 1 cs is the saturation do concentration in water at specified temperature mgl 1 and ct is the do concentration in water at time t mgl 1 the left hand side of eq 2 represents the unsteady state rate of change of oxygen concentration in water and the right hand side represents the concentration gradient between air and water that drives the mass transfer 2 d c d t o t r k l a c s c t the exponential form of the eq 2 is given as eq 3 where t0 is the start time of aeration s and c0 mgl 1 is the initial do concentration in water at time t0 according to eq 3 the do concentration with time follows an increasing exponential function and the maximum amount of oxygen transfer is limited by the saturation concentration at system temperature and pressure the asce standard which uses a nonlinear regression analysis based on the gauss newton method was used to fit the model eq 3 to the re aeration experimental data 3 c t c s c s c 0 e k l a t t 0 using classical penetration theory 39 the mass transfer coefficient kl ms 1 was determined using eq 4 where dl is the diffusion coefficient of air m2s 1 vr is the velocity of the air bubble ms 1 and db is the diameter of the air bubble m 4 k l 2 d l v r π d b the transfer and diffusion of do with the height of water column was modelled as per the axial dispersion model theory 41 the axial dispersion of oxygen was expressed analogous to fick s law of diffusion and the longitudinal dispersion was assumed to be negligible 41 the transfer and diffusion of do with the height of water column was expressed as eq 5 where day is the dispersion coefficient m2s 1 ul is the superficial gas velocity ms 1 and y is the height of water column measured from the bottom of the tank m the first term of eq 5 represents the rate of change of oxygen concentration at different heights of water column due to dispersion the second term represents the rate of change due to advection and the third term represents the rate of change due to mass transfer 5 d a y d 2 c d y 2 u l d c d y k l a c s c t 0 the conditions for the lower and the upper boundaries proposed by langmuir and deckwer et al 42 as shown in eq 6 was imposed where l is the axial position of upper boundary for describing the lower zone boundary eq 6a was used it states that the oxygen concentration c o in liquid element below a zone boundary is equal to the difference of the oxygen concentration c o just above the zone boundary and that by axial dispersion for describing the upper zone boundary eq 6b was used it states that the oxygen concentration gradient is zero at the upper zone boundary 6a u l c o u l c o d a y d c d y o 6b d c d y l 0 the effect of pressure and height of the water column on the saturation do was given as eq 7 where p and q are coefficients derived from pressure readings at different heights of water column 7 c s p q y assuming constant value for kla and the axial dispersion coefficient over the entire water zone 50 the solution for the differential eq 5 was obtained as eq 8 where b1 b2 b3 b4 m and n are coefficients these coefficients are tabulated as table s1 in supplementary material 8 c b 1 exp n y b 2 exp m y b 3 y b 4 2 2 multiphase cfd model the hydrodynamics of flow and oxygen transfer in diffused aeration systems was modelled using cfd commercial package ansys fluent multiphase mixture model was used to model the flow characteristics and mixing of air and water though several turbulence models are available in ansys fluent package the standard k ε turbulence model was chosen because of its advantages such as computational stability and better convergence with lower utilization of cpu power 43 44 in the mixture model a single set of navier stokes equation was solved for the mixture phase and a separate equation was solved to identify the relative velocity of the dispersed phase the continuous phase consisting of water and air nitrogen and oxygen was considered as the secondary phase 45 46 the mass conservation and momentum conservation equations of the mixture was expressed as eqs 9 and 10 where g is the acceleration is due to gravity ms 2 f is a body force nm 3 α p is volume fraction of phase p ρ p is density of the phase p kg m 3 and v d r p is

balance equation to describe the changes in the bubble population was considered along with mass and momentum conservation equations the balance equation was then solved using the discrete method developed by hounslow et al litster et al and ramkrishna et al 47 50 using this method the particle population was discretized into a finite number of size intervals and the size distribution was then

n v j methodology followed for the cfd pbm model development is shown in fig 1 the oxygen transfer efficiency for the experimental conditions was modeled using the multiphase mixture model using ansys fluent tool the bubble dynamics were simulated using the pbm add on module the geometry was created in fluent design modeller and a 2d mesh grid was generated in icem cfd tetrahedron meshes were generated with a mesh size of 0 001 m the advection and diffusion of oxygen from the air to water was modelled using the species transport model the do concentrations were inferred from simulation results and were compared with experimental observations 3 methods 3 1 experimental methods to validate the developed multiphase model oxygen transfer efficiency analysis experiments were carried out in a bench scale plexiglass tank of capacity 2352 l length width depth 1 4 m 1 4 m 1 2 m all tests were conducted using synthetic water deoxygenated water since asce standard procedure recommended using of synthetic water to conduct oxygen transfer tests rather than wastewater 40 52 53 several studies have indicated the use of synthetic water for oxygen transfer tests to obtain consistency and comparability of results 40 52 for batch reactors with mechanical stirrers for aeration the stirring speed was found to have a direct correlation with oxygen dissolution it was observed that higher stirrer speeds and higher gas flow rates improved the oxygen transfer capacity 54 because a higher stirring speed resulted in higher breakage and residence time of the air bubbles in the bioreactor 55 also higher number of blades in impellers of stirrers had noticeable effect on volumetric mass transfer of oxygen 55 an increase in kla value from 15 to 27 was observed by replacing a single impeller with twin impeller configuration 55 however in this study all the experiments were performed in a batch reactor without mechanical stirring which mimic the diffused aeration systems these kind of diffused aeration systems have several advantages over mechanical stirrers surface aerators such as a higher standard aeration efficiency sae of 7 8 kg o2 kwh while it is 2 kg o2 kwh for mechanical stirrers higher oxygen transfer rates higher flexibility with independent air flow control systems and submerged parts with little maintenance 56 58 given these advantages the diffused aerators have become the most preferred method in bioreactors especially with deep tanks where uniform aeration is difficult to achieve with mechanical aeration systems the diffused aeration was provided through three porous circular fine bubble diffusers please refer to fig s1 of supplementary material and the video of aeration system at an aeration intensity of 0 0065 m3 min before each experiment the tank was drained and cleaned to prevent salt accumulation 68 although many factors such as temperature 59 salinity 59 composition of water i e presence and nature of microorganisms 60 and operating pressure 59 affects the oxygen mass transfer in all experimental trials the temperature 25 c salinity 150 2 ppm ph 6 7 hardness 130 1 5 ppm pressure 1 atm and alkalinity 120 1 ppm were kept uniform also the airflow rate was measured using a pre calibrated airflow meter synthetic water having a do of 0 5 0 01 ppm was obtained by deoxygenating tap water using sodium sulfite na2so3 in the presence of cobalt as catalyst the amount of sodium sulfite to be added was calculated based on the theoretical demand 8 kg of na2so3 per kg of do to ensure initial do levels to be same in all experimental trials before the start of each experiment the initial do level was measured to ensure that it was always 0 5 0 01 ppm the synthetic water was aerated using submerged diffusers and the do values were recorded at regular intervals of 1 min the water was subjected to uniform aeration using diffused aerators given that the rising air bubbles created a well mixed condition in the reactor please refer to the video s1 of supplementary material this procedure of collecting a single sample was adopted as specified in apha standards 61 the do concentrations were determined using the modified winkler do titration procedure 40 even though use of in situ devices increases the ease of measurement of do levels the standard winkler s method is the most reliable and accepted method for the determination of dissolved oxygen in water and wastewater 62 63 the standard winkler s method has reported accuracy of 0 1 in measuring do levels in deoxygenated water columns 63 also the presence of an air bubble around the optical sensor in the do probe local pressure and temperature fluctuations around the sensor has been found to influence the measurements using in situ devices 64 given these difficulties the winkler s method was chosen the experiments were replicated thrice and calibration checks were conducted using distilled water of known do concentrations detailed information on the experimental procedure is given in table 2 3 2 bubble size distribution a highspeed video camera chronos 1 4 kron technologies equipped with canon ef s18 55 lens was used to capture the bubble size distribution at 1050 frames per second fps the lights were so arranged to obtain uniform illumination in all the frames fig 2 shows the schematics of the experimental setup the video was captured at different heights of the water column and the focus plane of the frames was approximately midway between the walls of the tank with depth of focus field 0 46 m assuming that the bubble size variation is considerably less across the lateral profile of the tank 65 a measuring tape was placed on the wall of the tank which served as a basis for comparison of bubble size the bubbles were observed not to be spherical but could be approximated by an oblate spheroid the images of the bubbles were processed using imagej 66 standard tool to obtain the maximum and minimum dimensions of individual bubbles 3 3 validation of cfd model the experimental results obtained from lab scale apparatus was validated using that from cfd pbm model further to prevent limitations associated with lab scale setup experimental results from literature studies which were from larger systems were selected for the validation of the multiphase cfd model results the simulation results were compared with the literature experimental results 41 67 71 and the percentage error was calculated for each case detailed description of each experimental case case 1 to case 6 is provided in the supplementary material s 1 all meshes generated in icem cfd are unstructured and composed of tetrahedrons and the grid was refined near the wall the simulations were carried out using transient solver in fluent the details of the simulation are summarized in table 3 the grid independence study as per richardson extrapolation method 72 was conducted to investigate numerical accuracy and reliability of the simulation results all the experimental cases were simulated using three mesh qualities namely coarse medium and fine the two criteria for mesh independence i e a the asymptotic order of convergence aoc 1 and b grid convergence index gci 5 were investigated at all the grid points the richardson extrapolation method was applied to estimate the value at zero grid spacing φext using medium and fine meshes the details of the mesh element density for the gci study for the literature experimental cases are given in supplementary material fig 3 shows the variation of do with aeration time for experimental case 2 67 with coarse medium fine grid refinement and richardson extrapolation values as seen from fig 3 the values of fine mesh and richardson extrapolation are found to be very close to each other indicating grid independency following the same procedure grid independency was established for all the other experimental cases it was also observed that both the criteria for grid independence including aoc 1 and gci 5 were achieved for all the grid points of each experimental case results obtained from fine mesh for all the experimental cases studied are reported 4 results and discussions 4 1 model validation with experimental observations 4 1 1 do variation with aeration time fig 4 shows the change of do with aeration time in fig 4 experimentally found values analytically calculated values using eq 1 and the results from cfd simulation are presented as shown in fig 4 with aeration time the do concentration in the water increases exponentially till it reaches the saturation value as can be seen from fig 4 the analytically calculated do values with aeration time coincide with the experimental observations also results from the simulation are matching closely with the experimental results with a maximum deviation of 5 the do profile vs depth for the experiments was examined but since the height of the water column was only 1 m there was no pronounced variation in do levels at different heights in the water column the saturation concentration of do in water is governed by the temperature of the system according to henry s law 40 with aeration time the do value increase exponentially till 42 min and reaches a saturation value of 8 15 mgl 1 as shown in fig 4 aeration beyond this time did not increase the do concentration in the water this result confirms that at equilibrium the maximum amount of oxygen that can be dissolved in water at a given temperature and pressure is the saturation do concentration but there are certain conditions under which water can be supersaturated since do increases with increase in pressure at higher hydrostatic pressures water can hold more do than the saturation concentration supersaturation can also occur under conditions of rapid temperature change and for highly agitated rapidly aerated bioreactors in this work all the experiments were conducted at standard temperature and pressure with uniform aeration and hence the chances of super saturation are eliminated for real wastewater there are many other factors that affect the oxygen mass transfer one of the major factors is temperature the solubility of oxygen decreases with increase in temperature the saturation do concentration in water is also different for different temperature for example at 25 c the amount of oxygen dissolved in water at 100 saturation will be 8 3 mgl 1 while at 20 c the saturation do concentration will be 9 1 mgl 1 the do levels decrease exponentially with increase in the salinity of water at the same temperature and pressure the do levels in saltwater will be 20 less than that in freshwater suspended solids are also known to affect the oxygen dissolution in water the suspended solids are known to adsorb at the air liquid interface causing reduction of bubble velocity and creating diffusion barriers leading to reduction in kla 73 the wastewater composition specifically the types of microorganism present has direct effect on the do levels as given in eq 1 the concentration of oxygen dissolved in water at a particular time is the difference between the oxygen transfer rate otr and the oxygen uptake rate our the our refers to the rate of consumption of oxygen from water by aerobic microorganisms according to the activated sludge model asm theory there are two kinds of microorganisms responsible for oxygen consumption in bioreactors the heterotrophs and the autotrophs the heterotrophs consume oxygen to biologically decompose the soluble substrate a percentage of cod in wastewater while the autotrophs consume oxygen to decompose ammonia for their growth the rate of growth and decay of these microbes expressed using monod kinetics and the oxygen uptake rates are modelled in detail in the asm models asm 1 asm 2 and asm 3 60 4 1 2 determination of kla the kla value was obtained graphically by fitting a linear regression equation modifying eq 2 to the experimental observations of do versus aeration time the slope of linear fit between ln cs ct cs c0 and effective time t t0 of aeration shown in supplementary material fig s2 gives the kla to be 0 0253 min 1 the obtained value of kla was used as the volumetric mass transfer coefficient for modeling and cfd simulations for diffused aerators the kla determined under different experimental conditions such as air flow rates and volume of water aerated from various literature studies is summarized in table 4 as seen from table 4 for experimental conditions with low water volume water depth 2 m the kla value is in the lower range 0 0121 0 175 min 1 whereas for studies with larger water depth 2 m it is in higher range 0 1 min 1 it is observed that kla increases with increase in air flow rate diffusion of pure oxygen instead of air is also found to have positive effect on kla given that for the present study as water depth was only 1 m the low kla 0 0253 min 1 was considered a reasonable estimate 4 1 3 bubble size distribution experimental studies were conducted to determine the axial bubble size distribution in the water column the initial bubble size from the sparger obtained experimentally was fed as an input to the pbm model and the bubble size evolution with time and height of the water column were simulated the cross sectional area of the initial bubbles was determined from analyzing the photographs using the imagej 66 tool and then the diameter of the bubbles was calculated the data on bubble size variation from bottom to the top of the water column was determined from the photographs on an average more than 120 individual bubbles per frame were analyzed from photographs to determine the mean diameter it was observed that the rising bubbles especially in swarms changed their shape size and their count due to contraction and expansion which matched the observations by akita k et al 82 fig 5 shows the distribution plot of bubble size count in the water column at different heights measured from the bottom of the tank observed experimentally and the simulation results obtained from the cfd pbm model as shown in fig 5 the experimental results matched with that from the simulations the maximum deviation between the simulation results and the experimental bubble sizes were 6 5 and this difference was attributed to the overestimation of bubble breakage kernel value as seen in fig 5 with increase in the height of water column from 0 15 m to 0 6 m the bubble size distribution curve is narrowing that is at the bottom of the tank 0 15 m the air bubble size ranged from 1 5 mm to 3 6 mm while at the top 0 6 m the bubble size varied between 1 mm and 1 5 mm fig 5 also shows that at the bottom of the tanks the bubble counts were lower whereas at the top the number of bubbles were higher this shows that there were many small diameter bubbles near the top of the tank whereas only a few larger diameter bubbles were present at the bottom of the tank the reduction in the bubble size with height of the water column was attributed to the increased rate of dispersion or breakage of bubble with height rather than bubble aggregation 41 the above result can also be validated indirectly using the axial dispersion theory eq 5 the size distribution of air bubbles in aeration systems depends on the balance between coalescence and breakup rates 81 the bubbles that just leave the diffuser initial bubbles are different in size and shape from those rising through the water column the do concentration at the top of the water column will be higher as compared to the bottom validated using literature experimental results fig 8 it is also proven in literature fig 7 that the do transfer is higher from smaller bubbles as compared to bigger bubbles so the higher do concentration at the top of the water column can be attributed to the high number of small bubbles at the top hence the inference that diffuse aeration results in high number of small diameter bubbles near the top and low number of big air bubbles near the bottom of the tank is reasonable 4 2 model validation with literature data further to establishing that the cfd multiphase model results were matching well with the experimentally observed values for synthetic water simulations were conducted on experimental conditions available in literature the model simulations were compared with literature experimental results on pilot scale and full scale reactors the geometry and mesh for simulation of each literature experimental case as given in table 3 was generated in ansys icem cfd the kla as obtained from the literature for each experimental case were included for modeling mass transfer from air to synthetic water fig 6 shows the do variation with aeration time for experimental cases 3 68 4 69 5 70 and 6 71 as expected for each case the do concentration followed an exponential curve with the maximum limit as the saturation do concentration at specified temperature the cfd simulation values were comparable with the literature experimental value with an error of 5 5 as seen from fig 6 in the study by andinet et al 71 the maximum saturation concentration of 10 1 ppm at 15 c was reached after 60 s of aeration but in the study by tsuyoshi et al 69 the maximum saturation do concentration of 8 3 ppm at 25 c was only attained after 1000 s of aeration even though the geometry of diffusers and the volume of water aerated are comparable in these two studies the difference in the aeration time for saturation of do can be attributed to the difference in the airflow rate thus this result shows that the flow rate of air plays an important role in the diffusion of oxygen in synthetic water fig 7 shows the do in synthetic water versus the bubble size at various height of synthetic water column as shown in fig 7 the do concentration is found to increase with decreasing air bubble size also the cfd multiphase model simulated values are in accordance with literature experimental values when the size of the air bubble decreases surface area for mass transfer of the bubble per unit volume of gas increases with the increase in surface area the mass transfer of oxygen species from air to synthetic water also increases the results show that when the bubble size decreases by 10 the kla increases by 15 conversely when the bubble diameter increases by 10 the kla decreases by 11 8 the transfer of oxygen from the air to water is dependent on bubble size the rate of ascent of the bubble pressure temperature bubble dispersion and coalescence 8 with an increase in height of synthetic water column there is an elongation of the path of air bubbles in synthetic water 41 an increase in the path of the bubble increases the chance of bubble breakage and reduces the bubble diameter this result in more do transfer and according to eq 5 the do concentration increases with the height of the water column until the saturation concentration is attained the saturation oxygen concentration is proportional to the pressure at different heights in the synthetic water column fig 8 shows the do variation with the height of the tank or synthetic water column for various literature experimental conditions 41 67 68 as seen in fig 8 the analytical solution obtained from eq 4 the experimental values and the multiphase numerical solutions of do variations are presented the analytical solution method tends to overestimate the do concentrations as compared to experimental observations this may be due to the assumption of constant kla along the longitudinal profile in the axial model theory the cfd model predicts the do concentration variation with height accurately and the variation was observed to be within 6 the experimental and numerical values were compared using mean absolute percentage error the variation of cfd results is attributed due to the averaging of lateral profile of do concentration in planes at different height of the water column 4 3 sensitivity analysis the validated multiphase cfd model was further extended for sensitivity analysis of the diffused aeration system in a bench scale aeration tank two simulation scenarios with a single aerator and a combination of three diffused aeration systems were considered for the sensitivity study the geometry of the aeration tank and diffuser operating parameters are given in table 5 the sensitivity parameters considered for the study were height by breadth ratio h b of aeration tank height by spacing between the diffusers h s and size of air bubbles the details of the parameters for sensitivity analysis are given in table 6 gci studies are performed for sensitivity analysis given in fig s3 of supplementary material and all results reported here were with fine mesh refinement fig 9 a and b shows the do variation with the aeration time and height of the tank for bubble sizes of 9 mm 6 mm and 3 mm respectively it can be observed from fig 9 a and b that the mass transfer of do from air to synthetic water was higher for the smaller bubble size hence at a fixed air flow rate it is efficient to use diffusers with smaller pore size to achieve better transfer of oxygen but achieving smaller bubble size by reducing the pore size is not practical because smaller pore size causes high backpressure in diffusers and requires higher compressor capacity which will lead to higher power consumption hence there is a need to identify an efficient pore size for the diffuser which results in minimum backpressure from fig 9 a and b it can be noticed that there was a significant difference in the concentration of do in synthetic water for bubble size of 9 mm and 6 mm after an aeration period of 90 min but the difference in do concentration of 6 mm and 3 mm bubble size for the same aeration period was negligible the inference was that the diffuser with 6 mm bubble size could dissolve more oxygen in synthetic water without significantly increasing the backpressure hence one can identify that 6 mm is the efficient pore size bubble size for the fixed airflow rate under the given conditions the variation of do with the height of the tank for different h b ratios is shown in fig 10 a b and c it can be observed from fig 10 a that for an h b ratio of 1 5 the do concentration increases with the height of the synthetic water column but does not reach the saturation concentration 9 1 mgl 1 for 20 c similarly from fig 10 b for h b ratio of 2 for the same aeration time of 50 s the do concentration has reached equilibrium but not saturation for the h b ratio of 2 5 from fig 10 c the concentration of do in synthetic water has clearly reached the saturation limit for 50 s of aeration time from these observations it can be inferred that a higher h b ratio can result in an increased rate of do saturation for a fixed aeration time fig 11 shows the results of do variation with height of the tank for h s ratio of 2 and h s ratio 6 the spacing between the diffusers is an important parameter since improper spacing of the diffusers leads to inefficient mixing of oxygen in water and forms dead zones regions in water column with no or little oxygen content as seen from fig 11 the maximum do concentration for h s ratio of 6 was 9 mgl 1 while for the same aeration time for h s ratio of 2 the maximum do concentration was 8 2 mgl 1 thus it can be inferred that the reduction in spacing between the diffusers have a positive effect on the do concentration in bioreactors less the spacing between the diffuser the more the need to increase the number of diffusers and more the energy consumption for aeration hence there should be an effective balance between diffuser number and the spacing for attaining economic efficiency 5 conclusion and perspectives the transfer and dissolution of oxygen from the air to synthetic water for a diffused aeration system was analyzed using a multiphase cfd model the dynamics of bubble flow and its influence on do concentrations were incorporated using the discrete population balance equations the developed cfd model was validated with bench scale experimental studies and several pilot scale literature experimental results the three major parameters that influence the do transfer namely 1 the aeration time 2 the height of water column and 3 bubble size or bubble diameter were analyzed using the multiphase model the key observations were the simulation result agreed reasonably with experimental results with a maximum deviation of 6 the kla was found to be 0 0253 min 1 and the do concentration in synthetic water is observed to increase exponentially with aeration time until the saturation oxygen concentration is reached diffuse aeration results in high number of small diameter bubbles near the top of bioreactors and low number of big air bubbles near the bottom of the tank at the bottom of the tank the air bubbles had a wide range between from 1 5 mm to 3 6 mm while at the top of the tank the bubble size distribution had a narrow range between 1 mm and 1 5 mm while observing the variation of do with the air bubble size or bubble diameter the do concentration is found to increase with a reduction in air bubble size due to the increase in the surface area of the bubbles also the kla was observed to increase by 15 when the bubble size reduces by 10 the axial variation of do from bottom to the top of the aeration tank also follows an exponential function with maximum do concentration at the top of the tank the increase in the do concentration with height of water is attributed to the distribution of smaller bubbles at the top of the water column this is confirmed by the numerical results from the multiphase model a higher h b ratio can result in an increased rate of do saturation for a fixed aeration time in our modeling case the equilibrium or saturation do concentration was achieved at the h b ratio of 2 5 and does not increase further the bubble size of 6 mm was perceived to be the efficient pore size bubble size which provides a balance between improved oxygen dissolution and optimum backpressure in diffusers the do concentration varying from bottom to top of the aeration tank for different h s ratios was also examined and it was seen that with an increase in the h s ratio or reduction in the spacing s between the diffused aerators there is an improvement in the oxygen mass transfer and increase in do concentration in synthetic water the developed multiphase model is proposed to be extended to evaluate the variation of other parameters including bod cod and nitrogen and phosphate compounds in full scale bioreactor systems this can be achieved by integrating the biokinetics of
