advection dispersion equation s ade inability to capture such experimental observations to the presence of small scale zones or domains i e relative to the measurement scale that are immobile with respect to bulk flow where advection controls the transport e g ceriotti et al 2019 these immobile domains are the result of the natural physical and chemical property variability of porous media across a range of scales and flow rates harvey et al 1994 haggerty and gorelick 1995 liu and kitanidis 2012 bouquain et al 2012 their importance can be explicitly quantified in terms of a local peclet number a dimensionless number that represents the ratio of advective and diffusive transport rates the accessibility of solutes to immobile domains is thought to be velocity dependent and can be inferred from the analysis of the damkohler dai number a dimensionless number that relates the physical mass transfer rate of solutes between the mobile and immobile domains to the advective transport rate mass transfer between the two domains can be assumed to be instantaneous for dai 1 and the mobile and immobile domains treated as single domain for values of dai 1 advection dominates and the contribution of the immobile pore space to total transport may be small even though long tails may still exist bahr and rubin 1987 quantifying the contributions and volume of the immobile pore space is important as they likely control the presence of secondary contaminant sources that render remediation processes inefficient and slow e g haggerty and gorelick 1994 harvey et al 1994 wilson 1997 one of the simplest groups of models capable of representing immobile pathways are dual domain mass transfer ddmt models developed as a modification of the ade these types of models represent the non equilibrium conditions between two domains coats and smith 1964 van genuchten and wierenga 2010 ma and zheng 2011 which cannot be captured through the use of a retardation coefficient which assumes instantaneous equilibrium between mobile and immobile regions in the ade lab scale mm to m e g coats and smith 1964 swanson et al 2012 2015 field scale m to km e g feehley et al 2000 zheng et al 2011 briggs et al 2018 and numerical studies e g haggerty and gorelick 1995 wheaton and singha 2010 liu and kitanidis 2012 baratelli et al 2014 have shown that ddmt models can match observations better than the traditional ade under a variety of conditions ddmt models have even been successfully applied in systems where velocity differences between the mobile and immobile domains are small e g baratelli et al 2011 and in fractured rock where diffusion was considered negligible e g becker and shapiro 2000 ddmt conceptually treats one domain as immobile with respect to flow the mass transfer between mobile and immobile domains is generally modeled as a first order exchange process mimicking diffusive mass transfer although more complex higher order exchange processes can also readily be represented e g haggerty and gorelick 1995 carrera et al 1998 the resulting transport of a solute through the mobile and immobile domains can be described according to 1 θ m c m t θ m d m c m θ m v c m r where θ m is the porosity of the mobile domain c m is the dissolved species concentration in the mobile domain kg m3 v is the velocity in the mobile domain m s and d m is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor m2 s r is a source sink term where r im is an exchange reaction term kg m3s that is a component of r which for a single rate ddmt model is expressed as 2 r im θ im α c m c im where θ im is the porosity of the immobile domain c im is the dissolved species concentration in the immobile domain kg m3 and α is a first order single rate constant 1 s and along with other parameters within these transport models is largely treated as a fitting parameter in reality concentration within immobile pore space may just have low advective velocities compared to the primary flowpaths while some previous work has shown that these mass transfer parameters may be correlated to hydraulic conductivity or fracture length scales e g benson et al 2001 reeves et al 2008 the physical meanings are generally considered to be difficult to correlate to anything meaningful in the field e g zhang et al 2007 willmann et al 2008 additionally it has been recognized that velocity may control the estimated mass transfer parameters e g haggerty and gorelick 1995 and they therefore display local peclet number dependency ceriotti et al 2019 while immobile zones are often conceptualized at the pore scale field observations have indicated that they can be caused by large scale heterogeneity as well e g briggs et al 2018 recently geophysical methods have been used to help constrain the mass transfer parameters in eq 2 specifically θ im and α during ionic tracer tests in the field given co located fluid σ f and bulk electrical conductivity σ b measurements e g singha et al 2007 hampton et al 2019 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 2019 the σ f measurements preferentially sample well connected pore spaces i e the mobile domain whereas σ b measurements are thought to collectively capture both the mobile and immobile domains singha et al 2007 the σ b measurements provide a way to see into the immobile domain and estimate the parameters from eq 2 at particular locations in a single domain medium co located σ f and σ b measurements are expected to respond similarly to an ionic tracer in a dual domain medium on the other hand co located σ f and σ b will deviate from one another due to differences in the solute loading and unloading rate s between the mobile and immobile domains this difference allows these key mass transfer parameters to be estimated while many column experiments have been used to calculate the parameters from eq 2 e g swanson et al 2012 2015 briggs et al 2014 there are currently no larger scale controlled experiments reported in the literature that robustly explore the estimation of immobile porosity in the presence of large scale heterogeneity here we similarly look to explore estimates of θ im in a mesoscale 3 d sand tank with large impermeable blocks emplaced that produce a nonuniform flow field these barriers produce low local velocities that result in tank scale immobile zones this work is motivated in part by that of briggs et al 2018 who hypothesized that their immobile porosity estimates were controlled by largely stagnant zones downgradient of large cobbles within glacially deposited lake sediments at their field site we additionally explore the controls of density dependent tracers typically neglected in field tracer tests but clearly a process that affects transport in many settings e g beinhorn et al 2005 co located measurements of σ f and σ b were collected at a variety of locations within the tank and those data were then used with graphical and numerical models to estimate θ im throughout the tank inverted maps of σ b were also used to image the transport of the tracer a numerical model of the soil tank was also created as part of this work to support the experimental efforts flow velocities were varied in the model to control the global peclet number to provide insight into how θ im estimates and the contributions of advective and diffusive transport change in the presence of large scale heterogeneities as the generation of accurate data needed under controlled conditions is not feasible in the field this study used an existing intermediate scale test tank where the boundary and initial conditions can be controlled and the soil conditions are accurately known 2 experimental methods a 429 244 36 cm intermediate scale synthetic aquifer at the center for experimental study of subsurface environmental processes cesep was used for the tracer testing and geophysical tracking fig 1 the tank was packed with dry unimin granusil 70 sand around four impermeable plastic barriers to create stagnant zones the sand used in these experiments was previously characterized experimentally to have a hydraulic conductivity of 0 864 cm min sakaki and illangasekare 2007 and was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the porosity was equal to 0 45 based on calibration for the system from previous tracer experiments schulte 2009 a total of 14 end reservoirs seven located on each end of the tank were connected to constant head devices with individual water supply lines to maintain a constant 0 03 m m 1 head gradient and a constant flow rate across the aquifer a total of 44 observation wells 2 5 cm internal diameter were installed within the synthetic aquifer in eight rows fig 1 the wells were screened across the entire depth of the aquifer additional specifications and details regarding the construction packing configuration and wells can be found in schulte 2009 the tank experiments were conducted in three separate phases in preparing the experiments a 1 m3 external tank was filled with domestic tap water and exposed to the atmosphere for approximately 72 h to allow for removal of as much dissolved gas as possible as air trapping would result in reduction of permeability the water from the tank was then passed through a 5 μm sediment filter 5 μm activated carbon filter and a 0 011 m3 min capacity ultraviolet uv light treatment in series to remove impurities in the water entering the aquifer and limit biological growth in the sand the water level in the test aquifer was increased by 1 cm per day over a one month period to prevent air entrapment while saturating the tank after saturating the aquifer with tap water σ f 580 us cm corrected to 25 c the tracer solution injection system was initiated to deliver a nacl solution 1210 us cm made with tap water corrected to 25 c there is an unsaturated zone in the tank of approximately 8 cm so the tracer solution was injected directly into the porous media at the water table at a rate of 5 ml min over a 72 h period at three locations and not injected into the wellbores the total discharge through the tank was 255 ml min during the tracer injection the experiment was concluded 10 days after the injection after σ b reached pre tracer injection values for this study the synthetic aquifer was outfitted with electrodes to measure σ b four surface lines were installed one parallel and three perpendicular to the primary flow direction using 45 1 9 cm long stainless steel screws inserted into the sand surface with an approximate 22 cm spacing fig 1 the survey type for the surface lines was dipole dipole selected for its data collection speed with a multi channel control unit a total of 48 nested subsurface electrodes were also installed at six locations near wells 3 14 20 19 25 and 36 at depths of 16 and 26 cm below the sand surface to help monitor the solute plume depth and co locate the subsurface σ f and σ b measurements spacing between current electrodes and potential electrodes in these arrays were set at 7 and 4 cm respectively all data were collected from the nested electrodes using a schlumberger array to estimate σ b from the measured resistances for each set of nested electrode quadripoles geometric factors g commonly used in electrical geophysics were approximated using 3 g 4 π 1 am 1 ami 1 an 1 ani 1 bm 1 nmi 1 bn 1 bni

overbar above the electrode pairs represents the distance between the two electrodes values of 0 13 m were calculated for all quadripoles prior to starting the tracer injection background resistance measurements were taken continuously over a 16 5 h period for all surface lines and subsurface quadripoles 165 measurements were made in each dataset this number of measurements was made as a trade off between spatial resolution and temporal smearing with the selected measurements each dataset took 10 min to complete the median percent difference of replicate resistances for the quadripoles in the sequence was 0 14 σ f was recorded in all reservoirs and observation wells at three different depths 16 26 and 36 cm depth from the surface 1 3 times daily using a handheld orionstar a322 electrical conductivity probe most modern σ f sensors will correct measurements to 25 c following hayashi 2004 4 σ f σ f 25 c 1 δ t fluid 25 where σ f is the measured fluid conductivity us cm σ f 25 c is the fluid conductivity at 25 c us cm δ is a constant related to the specific ionic salt temperature relationship and t fluid is the effluent temperature oc here we used the uncorrected σ f calculated from eq 4 using a δ value of 0 019 eaton et al 1998 hayashi 2004 to ensure that any observed offset between σ f and σ b was not the result of applied temperature corrections density effects have previously been observed in this synthetic aquifer system during low conductivity i e low concentration tracer tests schulte 2009 suggested that the sinking of the tracer was caused by the presence of the open observation wells given this concern effort was made to select a tracer concentration that would minimize density effects during the experiments by considering stability ratio oostrom et al 1992 5 a s k q ρ t ρ b ρ b where ρ t is the density of the tracer solution kg m3 ρ b is the density of the background solution kg m3 k is the hydraulic conductivity m s and q is the specific discharge m s density instabilities are expected to occur for values of a s 0 3 barth et al 2001 schulte 2009 to calculate the stability ratio an approximation for the specific discharge was determined using dupuit forchheimer 6 q k h i h 0 2 h f 2 2 l where h 0 is the upstream hydraulic head m h f is the downstream head m h i is the head at the location of tracer injection m and l is the length of the aquifer m given an a s value of 0 3 the maximum allowable tracer density was calculated to be 1004 25 kg m3 the average density of the background and tracer solutions were 996 32 0 19 kg m3 and 997 33 0 19 kg m3 respectively this resulted in a density instability ratio of 0 04 below the limit where density was expected to be highly important 3 numerical modeling because the tank experiments were time consuming requiring months of time to prepare and execute exploring how velocity affects the estimates of immobile porosity was conducted with numerical models water flow and solute transport were simulated in six tracer scenarios table 1 and coupled with electrical flow modeling in r3t binley 2019 which was also used to invert the experimental data to create tomograms of tracer movement hydraulic gradients matching those of the tank experiment and an order of magnitude lower were simulated transient flow and transport in the sand tank were simulated with seawat version 4 a block centered finite difference code langevin et al 2007 that couples modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 a total variation diminishing tvd scheme was used to reduce numerical dispersion introduced by the finite difference solver cox and nishikawa 1991 zheng and wang 1999 goswami et al 2011 density dependency was toggled on and off in the different scenarios to explore its effect on estimated ddmt parameters when including density driven flow seawat incorporates the density change as a function of the concentration under isothermal conditions appropriate for the laboratory conditions here 7 ρ n ρ o εc where ρ n is the fluid density as a function of concentration kg m3 ρ o is the original density of the fluid kg m3 ε is an empirical constant and c is the solute concentration kg m3 the empirical constant ε was taken as 0 7143 langevin et al 2007 the initial and boundary conditions of the numerical models were defined so as to be representative of those of the physical tank system the up and downstream boundaries were assigned constant head conditions the impermeable barriers were included as no flow boundaries within the model domain the hydraulic conductivity and total effective porosity of the sand were set to match the experimental conditions although no model calibration was conducted to estimate dispersivity a range of values were explored given a transient simulation to account for the injection a specific yield of 0 40 was assigned to the aquifer sand material the wells were assigned a hydraulic conductivity that was three orders of magnitude larger than the aquifer the specific yield and porosity of the wells were both set to 0 9999 to isolate the slow flow pathways introduced by the impermeable barriers from other possible sources of stagnant flow zones quantified as immobile pore space it was assumed that the porous medium itself contained no intragranular or immobile pore spaces and the total porosity was equal to that calibrated in previous studies on the same aquifer configuration and packing schulte 2009 the tracer injection was modeled as a continuous 72 h pulse injected at a rate of 5 ml min directly into the aquifer at a concentration of 670 mg l σ f 1210 us cm at three locations explicitly following the experimental setup as in the experiments the tracer solution was injected directly into the porous media at the water table at a rate of 5 ml min over a 72 h period at three locations the background solution in the tank was 320 mg l σ f 580 us cm which had a density of 996 32 mg l given the tank size the base case longitudinal dispersivity was assumed to be 0 3 cm as a starting point as was similarly done in previous studies specific to this tank schulte 2009 transverse and vertical dispersivities were assumed to be 10 and 1 of the longitudinal dispersivity respectively gelhar et al 1992 zheng and wang 1999 the transport model was also run with dispersivities both an order of magnitude higher and lower than the base case the diffusion coefficient for cl was assumed to be 1 10 9 m2 s yuan hui and gregory 1974 the model domain was spatially discretized at a 1 cm resolution in the horizontal directions and 4 cm in the vertical this resulted in a total of 942 084 individual cells fig 2 and a grid peclet number of 5 for the slow flow simulations and up to 40 for the fast flow simulations a temporal time step of 30 s was determined automatically by the tvd solver scheme to link the predicted concentrations to the σ b in r3t σ f was estimated from simulated total dissolved solids tds mg l following 8 σ f tds c where c is a dimensionless constant assumed to be 0 55 a value previously used for natural waters with σ f ranging from approximately 500 3000 us cm hem 1985 rusydi 2018 seawat concentration breakthrough curves converted to σ f were compared to observed σ f at all 44 observation wells and 14 up and downgradient reservoirs to confirm this conversion to simulate the electrical resistivity measurements from the tank experiment in r3t the values of σ f were then converted to σ b using archie s law archie 1942 9 σ b θ w σ f where θ is the total porosity and w is the dimensionless cementation exponent of the porous medium assumed to be 1 45 so as to be consistent with unconsolidated quartz sand friedman 2005 friedman and robinson 2002 the resulting values of σ b were used as the input to r3t elements at selected simulated timesteps for reasonable inversion computation times gmsh a 3 d finite element mesh generator geuzaine and remacle 2009 was used to create the r3t electrical flow model triangular prism mesh the electrical flow model domain had a nominal element size of 5 cm local mesh refinement was performed around the electrodes the final r3t model domain contained 64 280 elements in the presence of an immobile domain hysteresis was expected between the forward model estimated or measured σ b and σ f singha et al 2007 θ im was estimated through graphical analysis of σ b σ f hysteresis curves following briggs et al 2014 where hinge points σ b n fig 3 for each hysteresis curve were selected to calculate β the ratio of the mobile and immobile porosities including the values on both the rising and falling limbs all hinge points can be used to estimate β according to 10 β 1 2 σ b 2 σ b 1 σ b 1 σ b 0 σ b 3 σ b 0 σ b 2 σ b 3 calculations can also be conducted looking at the rising and falling limbs independently this approach was adopted herein so as to provide some error estimate hinge points σ b 0 and σ b 1 were determined by fitting a line to the rising limb of the tracer injection and σ b 2 was determined from the equilibrium σ b value measured during the tracer injection plateau hinge point σ b 3 was determined by fitting a line to the falling limb of the tracer btc θ im is calculated as the product of β and the measured θ m taken to be 0 45 while the mass transfer rate α has previously been estimated with the briggs method in other systems rounded hinge points and non equilibrium tracer conditions in the experimental data and consequently numerical models made the method insensitive to parameter estimation and was subsequently not used here we found that this method was quite robust to estimates of θ im even when the hinge points were manually translated by 10 the σ b data were also inverted to make images of the tracer movement over 32 timesteps difference inversions were performed in r3t e g labrecque and yang 2009 where the data from each time step were inverted with respect to background measurements prior to the tracer injection averaged across 99 background surveys each consisting of 165 individual measurements the iterative inversion process was continued until a target root mean square error rmse tolerance of 1 was reached based on the rmse between observed and simulated data with respect to noise the no flow barriers were explicitly simulated in the electrical forward models but not in the inversions as they could be located without assistance 4 results and discussion when barriers were included in the flow and transport models the magnitude of peak concentrations from the numerical simulations matched observed data in the upper portion of the synthetic aquifer as the dispersivity increased at the selected wells 14 19 20 25 and 36 both with and without density dependence considered however the model often underpredicted the magnitude of σ f at the bottom of the synthetic aquifer fig si 1 this observation likely indicates that the vertical sinking of the plume within the open wellbores was not captured well in the model density driven transport is also directly observed within some of the wells themselves particularly well 14 where σ f increases with depth within the wellbore tracer concentrations are generally highest in the lowest portions of the aquifer fig 4 the tracer sinking is also seen in the differenced electrical resistivity inversions fig 5 especially upgradient of the largest impermeable barrier due to the tracer injection at the top of the free water surface these results supports density driven flow in the well bores the presence of barriers played an important role density effects were observed in well 25 but not wells 19 and 20 fig 4 even though the latter two are closer to the tracer injection the difference in behavior between these three wells is likely the result of impermeable barrier 2 wells 19 and 20 are in a faster pathway when compared to well 25 fig si 1 the observed σ f plume maps fig 4 show that solute concentrations persisted behind the no flow barriers as solute stagnated in those locations both up and downgradient of the largest impermeable barrier the barriers produce long slow flow pathways directly downgradient fig si 2a similar to the observations observed downstream of cobbles in field studies briggs et al 2018 there is a close match of measured and modeled heads prior to tracer injection consequently velocities between the measured and modeled systems should be similar fig si 2b while the injected mass in the numerical models was constrained to the experimental value the experimental tracer was also likely impacted by preferential pathways from packing schulte 2009 although the tank was packed homogeneously compaction during packing and some settling of sand undoubtedly resulted in inadvertent heterogeneities as has been seen in other work e g levy and berkowitz 2003 sherman et al 2018 one other reason for differences in measured and simulated concentrations is the estimated dimensionless constant c in eq 8 which converts concentration to σ f no uniform value would allow the models to fit the data in the tank experiment despite the differences in concentration timing between experimental data and model predictions the model allows us to explore the role of the barriers and density dependent flow and the importance of both individually and collectively with respect to estimating immobile porosity the observed hysteresis between σ b and σ f measurements is generally larger directly up and downgradient of the largest no flow barrier barrier 2 at wells 14 19 and 20 implying large immobile porosity and becomes smaller farther downgradient from the barrier e g wells 25 and 36 fig 6 hysteresis is also observed to be larger in the shallow observations 16 cm below sand surface when compared to the deeper ones at 26 cm below sand surface due to larger measured changes in measured σ b these results generally match those observed in the numerical simulations with wells 14 19 and 20 showing greater hysteresis especially at the higher flow rates slightly stronger hysteresis is observed at shallow depths fig 7 note that the barriers create the immobile zones driving the hysteresis the model scenarios show no σ f σ b hysteresis before the barriers are included in the simulations fig 7 the hysteresis in the model increases slightly when density effects were added as the head gradient and thus velocity is decreased in the model the simulated hysteresis decreases as smaller changes in σ f are simulated fig 7 given the co located σ f and σ b θ im was estimated for the rising and falling limbs of the tank tracer experiments assuming a mobile porosity of 0 45 fig 8 estimates of θ im are similar at most locations in the tank within standard error although slightly higher in well 20 at shallow depth interestingly the estimated θ im in well 20 does not show a similar value to well 19 this likely has to do with slight asymmetry in the barrier placement in the tank and sand packing irregularities in our numerical models little θ im is estimated in the absence of barriers as would be expected fig 9 the estimated immobile pore space is not exactly zero in these simulations this result is likely due to how the wells were simulated as highly permeable conduits which drove heterogeneities within the system that can look like immobile porosity e g wheaton and singha 2010 the introduction of barriers increased the amount of estimated immobile pore space in all scenarios generally again increasing slightly with the addition of density dependent flow fig 9 the values of θ im between these three sets of simulations is significantly different deep in the tank although not at shallow depths p 0 056 at 16 cm p 0 0013 at 26 cm however differences in estimated θ im with gradient are not statistically different p 0 7885 in systems that are more heterogeneous than the one investigated here flow rates may have more of a control on the estimated θ im as the difference between faster and slower flow domains may be more notable with changing flow measured and modeled θ im match well at some locations wells 19 and 20 although there are some locations where the model estimated larger θ im and smaller θ im wells 14 25 and 26 fig si 3 we also explored the effects of differing dispersivities on our results our base case models used longitudinal transverse and vertical dispersivity values of 0 3 0 03 and 0 003 cm simulations with dispersivities at 0 1 and 10 times those values were also run while the changes in hysteresis associated with changing the dispersivity are less notable than the introduction of the barriers or density effects there is a discernable impact fig 10 considering well 14 for example which has the most notable hysteresis in the tank and modeled scenarios increasing the assumed dispersivity in the model leads to the hysteresis collapsing toward a straight line conversely decreasing the dispersivity in the model leads to larger hysteresis given that increasing dispersivity in the model leads to a more disperse plume the results are not surprising more spreading as mandated by the model minimizes the importance of the mobile immobile transport this in turn implies that in a field system with more spreading mechanisms due to natural variability or other factors θ im estimated via the briggs method will generally decrease fig 11 while there is no rigorous physical definition of what exactly θ im is it is important to provide some physical context to assist in the interpretation of these results to this end we rely on the work of porta et al 2015 and ceriotti et al 2019 who explicitly define the immobile region as a region where velocities fall below a given threshold the actual value of this threshold is problem specific but loosely it can be thought of as the velocity where solute is more likely to escape regions by diffusive dispersive effects than it is by advection which can be tied to a peclet number although the appropriate length scale is again not clearly defined indeed while much of the velocity field in the system can be several orders of magnitude smaller than this threshold from a practical perspective it may as well be treated as zero since its influence is negligible on the large scale behavior of the system both of these papers consider pore scale flow and transport but these ideas hold equally for the kinds of scales discussed here the inclusion of heterogeneity in the physical and numerical models broadens the distribution of velocities in the system thus enhancing both the most mobile portions but also introducing slower regions that will fall into this immobile category 5 conclusions barriers velocity and density dependent flow control the observed hysteresis between σ b versus σ f in 3 d tank experiments and associated models and thus the estimates of θ im estimated θ im was found to increase in numerical models in the presence of impermeable barriers which produced stagnant zones with relatively slow flow velocities estimates of θ im increased slightly with density dependence however there was no statistically significant difference in estimating θ im under simulated flow rate variations based on varying dispersivities in our models we expect that in field scenarios with more plume spreading that less θ im will be estimated in the tank experiment we found that estimated θ im were generally larger downgradient of the largest impermeable barrier in the upper portion of the synthetic aquifer although discrepancies were observed between experimental and modeled hysteresis and estimated θ im the numerical investigations provided a time feasible way to explore how large scale heterogeneity impacts aquifer characterization using a dual domain mass transfer model implications of this work are that estimates of θ im are affected by macroscopic heterogeneity and also the particular condition of that system in time the issue in the field or in the tank system adopted in this study is that it is not clear as to how to define an effective parameter for a model in a system where θ im is controlled by heterogeneity at the large scale as well as pore scale heterogeneity buoyancy effects which will be nonstationary in time or processes and parameters that control plume spreading may also create additional θ im this means that field tracers at high concentrations may be poorly simulated with a ddmt model in this work we have not explored the many different reaction mechanisms that can create immobile zones such as sorption or grain surface boundary layer speciation reactions harvey et al 1994 these would introduce additional dimensionless damkohler numbers e g sherman et al 2019 and one might expect similar effects to what was observed here consequently defining θ im remains difficult in heterogeneous environments and an effective θ im may be difficult to estimate in the field estimates may not be usable even from one field season to the next at some field sites declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

across a range of scales and flow rates harvey et al 1994 haggerty and gorelick 1995 liu and kitanidis 2012 bouquain et al 2012 their importance can be explicitly quantified in terms of a local peclet number a dimensionless number that represents the ratio of advective and diffusive transport rates the accessibility of solutes to immobile domains is thought to be velocity dependent and can be inferred from the analysis of the damkohler dai number a dimensionless number that relates the physical mass transfer rate of solutes between the mobile and immobile domains to the advective transport rate mass transfer between the two domains can be assumed to be instantaneous for dai 1 and the mobile and immobile domains treated as single domain for values of dai 1 advection dominates and the contribution of the immobile pore space to total transport may be small even though long tails may still exist bahr and rubin 1987 quantifying the contributions and volume of the immobile pore space is important as they likely control the presence of secondary contaminant sources that render remediation processes inefficient and slow e g haggerty and gorelick 1994 harvey et al 1994 wilson 1997 one of the simplest groups of models capable of representing immobile pathways are dual domain mass transfer ddmt models developed as a modification of the ade these types of models represent the non equilibrium conditions between two domains coats and smith 1964 van genuchten and wierenga 2010 ma and zheng 2011 which cannot be captured through the use of a retardation coefficient which assumes instantaneous equilibrium between mobile and immobile regions in the ade lab scale mm to m e g coats and smith 1964 swanson et al 2012 2015 field scale m to km e g feehley et al 2000 zheng et al 2011 briggs et al 2018 and numerical studies e g haggerty and gorelick 1995 wheaton and singha 2010 liu and kitanidis 2012 baratelli et al 2014 have shown that ddmt models can match observations better than the traditional ade under a variety of conditions ddmt models have even been successfully applied in systems where velocity differences between the mobile and immobile domains are small e g baratelli et al 2011 and in fractured rock where diffusion was considered negligible e g becker and shapiro 2000 ddmt conceptually treats one domain as immobile with respect to flow the mass transfer between mobile and immobile domains is generally modeled as a first order exchange process mimicking diffusive mass transfer although more complex higher order exchange processes can also readily be represented e g haggerty and gorelick 1995 carrera et al 1998 the resulting transport of a solute through the mobile and immobile domains can be described according to 1 θ m c m t θ m d m c m θ m v c m r where θ m is the porosity of the mobile domain c m is the dissolved species concentration in the mobile domain kg m3 v is the velocity in the mobile domain m s and d m is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor m2 s r is a source sink term where r im is an exchange reaction term kg m3s that is a component of r which for a single rate ddmt model is expressed as 2 r im θ im α c m c im where θ im is the porosity of the immobile domain c im is the dissolved species concentration in the immobile domain kg m3 and α is a first order single rate constant 1 s and along with other parameters within these transport models is largely treated as a fitting parameter in reality concentration within immobile pore space may just have low advective velocities compared to the primary flowpaths while some previous work has shown that these mass transfer parameters may be correlated to hydraulic conductivity or fracture length scales e g benson et al 2001 reeves et al 2008 the physical meanings are generally considered to be difficult to correlate to anything meaningful in the field e g zhang et al 2007 willmann et al 2008 additionally it has been recognized that velocity may control the estimated mass transfer parameters e g haggerty and gorelick 1995 and they therefore display local peclet number dependency ceriotti et al 2019 while immobile zones are often conceptualized at the pore scale field observations have indicated that they can be caused by large scale heterogeneity as well e g briggs et al 2018 recently geophysical methods have been used to help constrain the mass transfer parameters in eq 2 specifically θ im and α during ionic tracer tests in the field given co located fluid σ f and bulk electrical conductivity σ b measurements e g singha et al 2007 hampton et al 2019 mahmoodpoor dehkordy et al 2018 2019 the σ f measurements preferentially sample well connected pore spaces i e the mobile domain whereas σ b measurements are thought to collectively capture both the mobile and immobile domains singha et al 2007 the σ b measurements provide a way to see into the immobile domain and estimate the parameters from eq 2 at particular locations in a single domain medium co located σ f and σ b measurements are expected to respond similarly to an ionic tracer in a dual domain medium on the other hand co located σ f and σ b will deviate from one another due to differences in the solute loading and unloading rate s between the mobile and immobile domains this difference allows these key mass transfer parameters to be estimated while many column experiments have been used to calculate the parameters from eq 2 e g swanson et al 2012 2015 briggs et al 2014 there are currently no larger scale controlled experiments reported in the literature that robustly explore the estimation of immobile porosity in the presence of large scale heterogeneity here we similarly look to explore estimates of θ im in a mesoscale 3 d sand tank with large impermeable blocks emplaced that produce a nonuniform flow field these barriers produce low local velocities that result in tank scale immobile zones this work is motivated in part by that of briggs et al 2018 who hypothesized that their immobile porosity estimates were controlled by largely stagnant zones downgradient of large cobbles within glacially deposited lake sediments at their field site we additionally explore the controls of density dependent tracers typically neglected in field tracer tests but clearly a process that affects transport in many settings e g beinhorn et al 2005 co located measurements of σ f and σ b were collected at a variety of locations within the tank and those data were then used with graphical and numerical models to estimate θ im throughout the tank inverted maps of σ b were also used to image the transport of the tracer a numerical model of the soil tank was also created as part of this work to support the experimental efforts flow velocities were varied in the model to control the global peclet number to provide insight into how θ im estimates and the contributions of advective and diffusive transport change in the presence of large scale heterogeneities as the generation of accurate data needed under controlled conditions is not feasible in the field this study used an existing intermediate scale test tank where the boundary and initial conditions can be controlled and the soil conditions are accurately known 2 experimental methods a 429 244 36 cm intermediate scale synthetic aquifer at the center for experimental study of subsurface environmental processes cesep was used for the tracer testing and geophysical tracking fig 1 the tank was packed with dry unimin granusil 70 sand around four impermeable plastic barriers to create stagnant zones the sand used in these experiments was previously characterized experimentally to have a hydraulic conductivity of 0 864 cm min sakaki and illangasekare 2007 and was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the porosity was equal to 0 45 based on calibration for the system from previous tracer experiments schulte 2009 a total of 14 end reservoirs seven located on each end of the tank were connected to constant head devices with individual water supply lines to maintain a constant 0 03 m m 1 head gradient and a constant flow rate across the aquifer a total of 44 observation wells 2 5 cm internal diameter were installed within the synthetic aquifer in eight rows fig 1 the wells were screened across the entire depth of the aquifer additional specifications and details regarding the construction packing configuration and wells can be found in schulte 2009 the tank experiments were conducted in three separate phases in preparing the experiments a 1 m3 external tank was filled with domestic tap water and exposed to the atmosphere for approximately 72 h to allow for removal of as much dissolved gas as possible as air trapping would result in reduction of permeability the water from the tank was then passed through a 5 μm sediment filter 5 μm activated carbon filter and a 0 011 m3 min capacity ultraviolet uv light treatment in series to remove impurities in the water entering the aquifer and limit biological growth in the sand the water level in the test aquifer was increased by 1 cm per day over a one month period to prevent air entrapment while saturating the tank after saturating the aquifer with tap water σ f 580 us cm corrected to 25 c the tracer solution injection system was initiated to deliver a nacl solution 1210 us cm made with tap water corrected to 25 c there is an unsaturated zone in the tank of approximately 8 cm so the tracer solution was injected directly into the porous media at the water table at a rate of 5 ml min over a 72 h period at three locations and not injected into the wellbores the total discharge through the tank was 255 ml min during the tracer injection the experiment was concluded 10 days after the injection after σ b reached pre tracer injection values for this study the synthetic aquifer was outfitted with electrodes to measure σ b four surface lines were installed one parallel and three perpendicular to the primary flow direction using 45 1 9 cm long stainless steel screws inserted into the sand surface with an approximate 22 cm spacing fig 1 the survey type for the surface lines was dipole dipole selected for its data collection speed with a multi channel control unit a total of 48 nested subsurface electrodes were also installed at six locations near wells 3 14 20 19 25 and 36 at depths of 16 and 26 cm below the sand surface to help monitor the solute plume depth and co locate the subsurface σ f and σ b measurements spacing between current electrodes and potential electrodes in these arrays were set at 7 and 4 cm respectively all data were collected from the nested electrodes using a schlumberger array to estimate σ b from the measured resistances for each set of nested electrode quadripoles geometric factors g commonly used in electrical geophysics were approximated using 3 g 4 π 1 am 1 ami 1 an 1 ani 1 bm 1 nmi 1 bn 1 bni

overbar above the electrode pairs represents the distance between the two electrodes values of 0 13 m were calculated for all quadripoles prior to starting the tracer injection background resistance measurements were taken continuously over a 16 5 h period for all surface lines and subsurface quadripoles 165 measurements were made in each dataset this number of measurements was made as a trade off between spatial resolution and temporal smearing with the selected measurements each dataset took 10 min to complete the median percent difference of replicate resistances for the quadripoles in the sequence was 0 14 σ f was recorded in all reservoirs and observation wells at three different depths 16 26 and 36 cm depth from the surface 1 3 times daily using a handheld orionstar a322

is the fluid conductivity at 25 c us cm δ is a constant related to the specific ionic salt temperature relationship and t fluid is the effluent temperature oc here we used the uncorrected σ f calculated from eq 4 using a δ value of 0 019 eaton et al 1998 hayashi 2004 to ensure that any observed offset between σ f and σ b was not the result of applied temperature corrections density effects have previously been observed in this synthetic aquifer system during low conductivity i e low concentration tracer tests schulte 2009 suggested that the sinking of the tracer was caused by the presence of the open observation wells given this concern effort was made to select a tracer concentration that would minimize density effects during the experiments by considering stability ratio oostrom et al 1992 5 a s k q ρ t ρ b ρ b where ρ t is the density of the tracer solution kg m3 ρ b is the density of the background solution kg m3 k is the hydraulic conductivity m s and q is the specific discharge m s density instabilities are expected to occur for values of a s 0 3 barth et al 2001 schulte 2009 to calculate the stability ratio an approximation for the specific discharge was determined using dupuit forchheimer 6 q k h i h 0 2 h f 2 2 l where h 0 is the upstream hydraulic head m h f is the downstream head m h i is the head at the location of tracer injection m and l is the length of the aquifer m given an a s value of 0 3 the maximum allowable tracer density was calculated to be 1004 25 kg m3 the average density of the background and tracer solutions were 996 32 0 19 kg m3 and 997 33 0 19 kg m3 respectively this resulted in a density instability ratio of 0 04 below the limit where density was expected to be highly important 3 numerical modeling because the tank experiments were time consuming requiring months of time to prepare and execute exploring how velocity affects the estimates of immobile porosity was conducted with numerical models water flow and solute transport were simulated in six tracer scenarios table 1 and coupled with electrical flow modeling in r3t binley 2019 which was also used to invert the experimental data to create tomograms of tracer movement hydraulic gradients matching those of the tank experiment and an order of magnitude lower were simulated transient flow and transport in the sand tank were simulated with seawat version 4 a block centered finite difference code langevin et al 2007 that couples modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 a total variation diminishing tvd scheme was used to reduce numerical dispersion introduced by the finite difference solver cox and nishikawa 1991 zheng and wang 1999 goswami et al 2011 density dependency was toggled on and off in the different scenarios to explore its effect on estimated ddmt parameters when including density driven flow seawat incorporates the density change as a function of the concentration under isothermal conditions appropriate for the laboratory conditions here 7 ρ n ρ o εc where ρ n is the fluid density as a function of concentration kg m3 ρ o is the original density of the fluid kg m3 ε is an empirical constant and c is the solute concentration kg m3 the empirical constant ε was taken as 0 7143 langevin et al 2007 the initial and boundary conditions of the numerical models were defined so as to be representative of those of the physical tank system the up and downstream boundaries were assigned constant head conditions the impermeable barriers were included as no flow boundaries within the model domain the hydraulic conductivity and total effective porosity of the sand were set to match the experimental conditions although no model calibration was conducted to estimate dispersivity a range of values were explored given a transient simulation to account for the injection a specific yield of 0 40 was assigned to the aquifer sand material the wells were assigned a hydraulic conductivity that was three orders of magnitude larger than the aquifer the specific yield and porosity of the wells were both set to 0 9999 to isolate the slow flow pathways introduced by the impermeable barriers from other possible sources of stagnant flow zones quantified as immobile pore space it was assumed that the porous medium itself contained no intragranular or immobile pore spaces and the total porosity was equal to that calibrated in previous studies on the same aquifer configuration and packing schulte 2009 the tracer injection was modeled as a continuous 72 h pulse injected at a rate of 5 ml min directly into the aquifer at a concentration of 670 mg l σ f 1210 us cm at three locations explicitly following the experimental setup as in the experiments the tracer solution was injected directly into the porous media at the water table at a rate of 5 ml min over a 72 h period at three locations the background solution in the tank was 320 mg l σ f 580 us cm which had a density of 996 32 mg l given the tank size the base case longitudinal dispersivity was assumed to be 0 3 cm as a starting point as was similarly done in previous studies specific to this tank schulte 2009 transverse and vertical dispersivities were assumed to be 10 and 1 of the longitudinal dispersivity respectively gelhar et al 1992 zheng and wang 1999 the transport model was also run with dispersivities both an order of magnitude higher and lower than the base case the diffusion coefficient for cl was assumed to be 1 10 9 m2 s yuan hui and gregory 1974 the model domain was spatially discretized at a 1 cm resolution in the horizontal directions and 4 cm in the vertical this resulted in a total of 942 084 individual cells fig 2 and a grid peclet number of 5 for the slow flow simulations and up to 40 for the fast flow simulations a temporal time step of 30 s was determined automatically by the tvd solver scheme to link the predicted concentrations to the σ b in r3t σ f was estimated from simulated total dissolved solids tds mg l following 8 σ f tds c where c is a dimensionless constant assumed to be 0 55 a value previously used for natural waters with σ f ranging from approximately 500 3000 us cm hem 1985 rusydi 2018 seawat concentration breakthrough curves converted to σ f were compared to observed σ f at all 44 observation wells and 14 up and downgradient reservoirs to confirm this conversion to simulate the electrical resistivity measurements from the tank experiment in r3t the values of σ f were then converted to σ b using archie s law archie 1942 9 σ b θ w σ f where θ is the total porosity and w is the dimensionless cementation exponent of the porous medium assumed to be 1 45 so as to be consistent with unconsolidated quartz sand friedman 2005 friedman and robinson 2002 the resulting values of σ b were used as the input to r3t elements at selected simulated timesteps for reasonable inversion computation times gmsh a 3 d finite element mesh generator geuzaine and remacle 2009 was used to create the r3t electrical flow model triangular prism mesh the electrical flow model domain had a nominal element size of 5 cm local mesh refinement was performed around the electrodes the final r3t model domain contained 64 280 elements in the presence of an immobile domain hysteresis was expected between the forward model estimated or measured σ b and σ f singha et al 2007 θ im was estimated through graphical analysis of σ b σ f hysteresis curves following briggs et al 2014 where hinge points σ b n fig 3 for each hysteresis curve were selected to calculate β the ratio of the mobile and immobile porosities including the values on both the rising and falling limbs all hinge points can be used to estimate β according to 10 β 1 2 σ b 2 σ b 1 σ b 1 σ b 0 σ b 3 σ b 0 σ b 2 σ b 3 calculations can also be conducted looking at the rising and falling limbs independently this approach was adopted herein so as to provide some error estimate hinge points σ b 0 and σ b 1 were determined by fitting a line to the rising limb of the tracer injection and σ b 2 was determined from the equilibrium σ b value measured during the tracer injection plateau hinge point σ b 3 was determined by fitting a line to the falling limb of the tracer btc θ im is calculated as the product of β and the measured θ m taken to be 0 45 while the mass transfer rate α has previously been estimated with the briggs method in other systems rounded hinge points and non equilibrium tracer conditions in the experimental data and consequently numerical models made the method insensitive to parameter estimation and was subsequently not used here we found that this method was quite robust to estimates of θ im even when the hinge points were manually translated by 10 the σ b data were also inverted to make images of the tracer movement over 32 timesteps difference inversions were performed in r3t e g labrecque and yang 2009 where the data from each time step were inverted with respect to background measurements prior to the tracer injection averaged across 99 background surveys each consisting of 165 individual measurements the iterative inversion process was continued until a target root mean square error rmse tolerance of 1 was reached based on the rmse between observed and simulated data with respect to noise the no flow barriers were explicitly simulated in the electrical forward models but not in the inversions as they could be located without assistance 4 results and discussion when barriers were included in the flow and transport models the magnitude of peak concentrations from the numerical simulations matched observed data in the upper portion of the synthetic aquifer as the dispersivity increased at the selected wells 14 19 20 25 and 36 both with and without density dependence considered however the model often underpredicted the magnitude of σ f at the bottom of the synthetic aquifer fig si 1 this observation likely indicates that the vertical sinking of the plume within the open wellbores was not captured well in the model density driven transport is also directly observed within some of the wells themselves particularly well 14 where σ f increases with depth within the wellbore tracer concentrations are generally highest in the lowest portions of the aquifer fig 4 the tracer sinking is also seen in the differenced electrical resistivity inversions fig 5 especially upgradient of the largest impermeable barrier due to the tracer injection at the top of the free water surface these results supports density driven flow in the well bores the presence of barriers played an important role density effects were observed in well 25 but not wells 19 and 20 fig 4 even though the latter two are closer to the tracer injection the difference in behavior between these three wells is likely the result of impermeable barrier 2 wells 19 and 20 are in a faster pathway when compared to well 25 fig si 1 the observed σ f plume maps fig 4 show that solute concentrations persisted behind the no flow barriers as solute stagnated in those locations both up and downgradient of the largest impermeable barrier the barriers produce long slow flow pathways directly downgradient fig si 2a similar to the observations observed downstream of cobbles in field studies briggs et al 2018 there is a close match of measured and modeled heads prior to tracer injection consequently velocities between the measured and modeled systems should be similar fig si 2b while the injected mass in the numerical models was constrained to the experimental value the experimental tracer was also likely impacted by preferential pathways from packing schulte 2009 although the tank was packed homogeneously compaction during packing and some settling of sand undoubtedly resulted in inadvertent heterogeneities as has been seen in other work e g levy and berkowitz 2003 sherman et al 2018 one other reason for differences in measured and simulated concentrations is the estimated dimensionless constant c in eq 8 which converts concentration to σ f no uniform value would allow the models to fit the data in the tank experiment despite the differences in concentration timing between experimental data and model predictions the model allows us to explore the role of the barriers and density dependent flow and the importance of both individually and collectively with respect to estimating immobile porosity the observed hysteresis between σ b and σ f measurements is generally larger directly up and downgradient of the largest no flow barrier barrier 2 at wells 14 19 and 20 implying large immobile porosity and becomes smaller farther downgradient from the barrier e g wells 25 and 36 fig 6 hysteresis is also observed to be larger in the shallow observations 16 cm below sand surface when compared to the deeper ones at 26 cm below sand surface due to larger measured changes in measured σ b these results generally match those observed in the numerical simulations with wells 14 19 and 20 showing greater hysteresis especially at the higher flow rates slightly stronger hysteresis is observed at shallow depths fig 7 note that the barriers create the immobile zones driving the hysteresis the model scenarios show no σ f σ b hysteresis before the barriers are included in the simulations fig 7 the hysteresis in the model increases slightly when density effects were added as the head gradient and thus velocity is decreased in the model the simulated hysteresis decreases as smaller changes in σ f are simulated fig 7 given the co located σ f and σ b θ im was estimated for the rising and falling limbs of the tank tracer experiments assuming a mobile porosity of 0 45 fig 8 estimates of θ im are similar at most locations in the tank within standard error although slightly higher in well 20 at shallow depth interestingly the estimated θ im in well 20 does not show a similar value to well 19 this likely has to do with slight asymmetry in the barrier placement in the tank and sand packing irregularities in our numerical models little θ im is estimated in the absence of barriers as would be expected fig 9 the estimated immobile pore space is not exactly zero in these simulations this result is likely due to how the wells were simulated as highly permeable conduits which drove heterogeneities within the system that can look like immobile porosity e g wheaton and singha 2010 the introduction of barriers increased the amount of estimated immobile pore space in all scenarios generally again increasing slightly with the addition of density dependent flow fig 9 the values of θ im between these three sets of simulations is significantly different deep in the tank although not at shallow depths p 0 056 at 16 cm p 0 0013 at 26 cm however differences in estimated θ im with gradient are not statistically different p 0 7885 in systems that are more heterogeneous than the one investigated here flow rates may have more of a control on the estimated θ im as the difference between faster and slower flow domains may be more notable with changing flow measured and modeled θ im match well at some locations wells 19 and 20 although there are some locations where the model estimated larger θ im and smaller θ im wells 14 25 and 26 fig si 3 we also explored the effects of differing dispersivities on our results our base case models used longitudinal transverse and vertical dispersivity values of 0 3 0 03 and 0 003 cm simulations with dispersivities at 0 1 and 10 times those values were also run while the changes in hysteresis associated with changing the dispersivity are less notable than the introduction of the barriers or density effects there is a discernable impact fig 10 considering well 14 for example which has the most notable hysteresis in the tank and modeled scenarios increasing the assumed dispersivity in the model leads to the hysteresis collapsing toward a straight line conversely decreasing the dispersivity in the model leads to larger hysteresis given that increasing dispersivity in the model leads to a more disperse plume the results are not surprising more spreading as mandated by the model minimizes the importance of the mobile immobile transport this in turn implies that in a field system with more spreading mechanisms due to natural variability or other factors θ im estimated via the briggs method will generally decrease fig 11 while there is no rigorous physical definition of what exactly θ im is it is important to provide some physical context to assist in the interpretation of these results to this end we rely on the work of porta et al 2015 and ceriotti et al 2019 who explicitly define the immobile region as a region where velocities fall below a given threshold the actual value of this threshold is problem specific but loosely it can be thought of as the velocity where solute is more likely to escape regions by diffusive dispersive effects than it is by advection which can be tied to a peclet number although the appropriate length scale is again not clearly defined indeed while much of the velocity field in the system can be several orders of magnitude smaller than this threshold from a practical perspective it may as well be treated as zero since its influence is negligible on the large scale behavior of the system both of these papers consider pore scale flow and transport but these ideas hold equally for the kinds of scales discussed here the inclusion of heterogeneity in the physical and numerical models broadens the distribution of velocities in the system thus enhancing both the most mobile portions but also introducing slower regions that will fall into this immobile category 5 conclusions barriers velocity and density dependent flow control the observed hysteresis between σ b versus σ f in 3 d tank experiments and associated models and thus the estimates of θ im estimated θ im was found to increase in numerical models in the presence of impermeable barriers which produced stagnant zones with relatively slow flow velocities estimates of θ im increased slightly with density dependence however there was no statistically significant difference in estimating θ im under simulated flow rate variations based on varying dispersivities in our models we expect that in field scenarios with more plume spreading that less θ im will be estimated in the tank experiment we found that estimated θ im were generally larger downgradient of the largest impermeable barrier in the upper portion of the synthetic aquifer although discrepancies were observed between experimental and modeled hysteresis and estimated θ im the numerical investigations provided a time feasible way to explore how large scale heterogeneity impacts aquifer characterization using a dual domain mass transfer model implications of this work are that estimates of θ im are affected by macroscopic heterogeneity and also the particular condition of that system in time the issue in the field or in the tank system adopted in this study is that it is not clear as to how to define an effective parameter for a model in a system where θ im is controlled by heterogeneity at the large scale as well as pore scale heterogeneity buoyancy effects which will be nonstationary in time or processes and parameters that control plume spreading may also create additional θ im this means that field tracers at high concentrations may be poorly simulated with a ddmt model in this work we have not explored the many different reaction mechanisms that can create immobile zones such as sorption or grain surface boundary layer speciation reactions harvey et al 1994 these would introduce additional dimensionless damkohler numbers e g sherman et al 2019 and one might expect similar effects to what was observed here consequently defining θ im remains difficult in heterogeneous environments and an effective θ im may be difficult to estimate in the field estimates may not be usable even from one field season to the next at some field sites declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

1416,diffusion through a water saturated silty clay soil column was measured for six perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos an aqueous pore diffusion model which incorporated linear adsorption parameters measured independently in batch tests and a tortuosity factor determined independently using a bromide tracer test was used to describe the experimental diffusion data the diffusion model substantially underpredicted pfaa diffusion through the soil column for the more strongly sorbing pfaas most notably pfos instead application of a diffusion model that included a surface diffusion like process provided substantially improved prediction of pfaa diffusion through the soil the ratio of the observed pore diffusion coefficient to the observed surface diffusion coefficient ranged from 13 for perfluorohexane sulfonate to 0 88 for pfos these results suggest that surface diffusion serves a potentially important role for strongly sorbing pfaas in clay rich soils and highlights the need for additional studies into the coupled adsorption and diffusion of pfaas in low permeability media graphical abstract unlabelled image 1 introduction soil and groundwater impacted by perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have become a well recognized environmental concern pfaas can enter soil and groundwater systems via the release of aqueous film forming foams from fire training activities backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 anderson et al 2019 nickerson et al 2020 landfill leachate benskin et al 2012 lang et al 2017 or other industrial releases clara et al 2008 pfaa concentrations near 1 μm have been observed in groundwater within fire training areas backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 pfaa sources can persist in soil and groundwater systems for decades even after treatment has been performed to address co contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbons houtz et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 guo et al 2020 the persistence of pfaas in soil and groundwater systems allows time for diffusion into low permeability materials such as silts clays and rock matrices such uptake as well as the subsequent slow diffusive release of other classes of contaminants has been observed shapiro 2001 wanner and hunkeler 2015 several studies have highlighted the importance of such diffusion processes in sustaining dissolved plumes and for developing accurate conceptual site models mundle et al 2007 parker et al 2008 schaefer et al 2018 berns et al 2019 a relatively small number of studies have examined pfaa adsorption in clays and clay minerals in general these studies have shown that pfaa adsorption increases with perfluorinated chain length hellsing et al 2016 that perfluorinated sulfonates sorb more strongly than perfluorinated carboxylates zhao et al 2014 and that ph and ionic strength impact sorption zhao et al 2014 alves et al 2020 mussabek et al 2020 also has shown that mineral content e g fe pb rb as is correlated to pfaa sorption both electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding have been suggested as pfaa sorption mechanisms to clay minerals zhao et al 2014 hellsing et al 2016 alves et al 2020 as pfaas are typically present in anionic form xiao et al 2011 in experiments performed using kaolinite showed that pfaa adsorption was well described by a linear isotherm and that competitive adsorption among the pfaas occurred to our knowledge studies investigating the coupled adsorption and diffusion of pfaas through natural clays or clay rich soils have not been examined recent work has provided experimental measurements of pfaa aqueous diffusivities schaefer et al 2019 but no corresponding measurements of pfaa diffusion through clays are available diffusion through liquid filled micropores can occur through both aqueous phase or pore diffusion and also via a surface diffusion mechanism yoshida et al 1991 ocampo pérez et al 2013 the latter generally is more pronounced as the extent of adsorption increases yoshida et al 1991 do and rice 1987 gimmi and kosakowski 2011 it is recognized that what is attributed to surface diffusion may in fact be solute migration within mineral interlayers or other near surface electrical boundaries glaus et al 2020 appelo et al 2010 bourg and sposito 2011 molecular dynamic simulations performed by tinnacher et al 2016 also suggest that solute diffusion in the near surface regions is an important mechanism in contrast oscarson 1994 concluded that surface diffusion of cations in clays was not a significant diffusive transport mechanism and that adsorption coefficients determined independently in batch experiments which typically employ much lower clay water ratios than in porewater were a likely cause for underpredictions of solute diffusion through bulk clay while the surface diffusion contribution for the uptake of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate sdbs in activated carbon has been observed leyva ramos et al 2020 the extent to which such surface diffusion mechanisms impact anionic pfaas in clay remains unclear it is reasonable to expect that surface diffusion could substantially impact pfaa migration through clays especially considering that clay minerals such as kaolinite can have positively charged surfaces and readily adsorb anionic species such as pfaas xiao et al 2011 vasconcelos et al 2007 such enhanced diffusion through clays would likely impact pfaa migration and persistence in heterogeneous groundwater systems the purpose of this study was to measure the coupled adsorption and diffusion of pfaas through a water saturated natural silty clay soil specifically using a combination of experimental data and transport models the ability to predict the net diffusion of pfaas through the soil was evaluated with an emphasis on the potential role of surface diffusion processes results presented herein demonstrate that pfaa diffusion through the silty clay soil was reasonably predicted when surface diffusion was appropriately considered particularly for the more strongly adsorbing compounds 2 experimental 2 1 materials pfaas used for this study included perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa cas 307 24 4 perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa cas 375 85 9 perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa cas 335 67 1 perfluorononanoic acid pfna cas 375 95 1 perfluorohexane sulfonic acid sodium salt pfhxs cas 3871 99 6 and perflurooctane sulfonic acid potassium salt pfos cas 1763 23 1 all pfaas were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo an electrolyte solution consisting of 50 mm cacl2 was used in the batch and column experiments this elevated ionic strength was selected to reflect the elevated ionic strength often observed in clay porewaters de craen et al 2004 joseph et al 2011 leroy et al 2007 a natural silty clay soil was used which was collected from a shallow depth 6 0 to 7 4 m below ground surface in puerto rico that had no known pfaa impacts soil properties are provided in table 1 the soil was homogenized manually by repeatedly mixing and interfolding the bulk soil 2 2 batch adsorption experiments batch adsorption testing was performed to determine adsorption of the pfaa mixture on to the soil experiments were prepared in 0 25 l high density polyethylene bottles each containing 10 g of wet 16 moisture content soil and 0 04 l of cacl2 solution a total of four pfaa mixtures were evaluated ranging from approximately 0 8 to 0 002 μm of each pfaa and each bottle was amended with a pfaa mixture to attain the target pfaa concentrations samples were equilibrated at room temperature 20 c with gentle shaking at 100 rpm a kinetic adsorption test showed that 24 h were sufficient for equilibration for each compound based on the measured sorptive losses from the aqueous phase at 24 h compared to those measured at 48 and 96 h the supernatant was sampled at 24 h for pfaa analysis each of the four pfaa mixture concentrations were prepared in duplicate in addition a set of controls were prepared identically to those previously described but without the addition of soil two additional sets of adsorption experiments with controls were prepared in triplicate to evaluate potential impacts of competitive adsorption one set was prepared with pfhxa only approximately 0 2 μm while another was prepared with pfhxa pfos approximately 0 2 μm each comparison of pfhxa adsorption with and without pfos the most strongly adsorbing pfaa measured in this study in this single point sorption test was used as a screening tool to assess the extent to which competitive adsorption was relevant in the experimental system 2 3 saturated column diffusion experiments the observed pfaa diffusion coefficients through the water saturated soil were determined using the diffusion tube technique schaefer et al 1995 schaefer et al 1999 briefly experiments were performed using 60 ml polypropylene syringe tubes with the needle end cut off and replaced by a neoprene stopper fig 1 duplicate columns were prepared the clay rich soil was wetted with cacl2 solution where the solution was added slowly and homogenized by repeatedly mixing and folding the homogenized soil was then manually packed a few grams at a time into the tube under water saturated conditions to create the packed soil bed attaining column length of approximately 4 4 cm to ensure a pfaa constant concentration boundary condition a slug of water 10 mls of cacl2 solution with approximately 0 1 μm of each pfaa was placed on top of the soil column approximately 4 h after the cacl2 solution was added to the soil this water was replaced every 1 to 3 days during the 20 day incubation period so that the pfaa concentration in the water never decreased by more than 5 based on the extent and rate of pfaa uptake into the clay the top of the column was sealed with parafilm to limit water evaporation at 20 days the water and stopper were removed and the soil was slowly extruded through the end where the stopper had been inserted fig 1 approximately 15 slices were collected from each column for analysis of pfaas thereby obtaining a measurement of the diffusion profile of each pfaa through the soil parallel experiments were performed using a bromide tracer solution instead of a pfaa spike solution bromide served as a non sorbing diffusive tracer for the soil verified to be non sorbing via a batch adsorption experiment as described in the model development these experiments were used to determine the aqueous diffusion tortuosity 2 4 analytical methods bromide was analyzed using epa method 300 1 using a metrohm ion chromatography ic system and analyzed using the magic net version 3 2 pfaa aqueous analysis was performed via sample dilution and direct injection for analysis by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc qtof ms sciex x500r solvents were added directly to the 15 ml conical tubes containing 7 ml of sample murray et al 2019 to minimize potential loss of analytes due to subsampling then 1 5 ml of each sample was transferred to an autosampler vial and 1 ml injected into the instrument alongside a calibration curve method blank and spiked blanks table s1 for information on analytes pfaa soil analysis was performed via extraction of each slice of soil and analysis by lc qtof ms prior to extraction isotopically labeled standards table s1 were spiked onto each soil sample with 4 to 75 ng of each pfaa per sample depending on expected soil concentrations the modified extraction method from sepulvado et al 2011 involved four rounds of extraction with 0 1 m ammonium hydroxide in methanol 4 ml each round for a total of 16 ml the combined extract was evaporated under nitrogen in a heated bath reconstituted with 1 5 ml of 1 by volume acetic acid in methanol and passed through envi carb sigma aldrich 250 mg solid phase extraction cartridges for matrix clean up a 100 μl aliquot of each extract was diluted to 400 μl in autosampler vials of 80 methanol 20 organic composition chromatography ms parameters and qa qc criteria were identical to nickerson et al 2020 3 model development pfaa diffusion through soil assuming a constant pfaa concentration at the top of the diffusion column z 0 no pfaas initially in the soil and a no flux boundary condition at the bottom of the column the observed diffusion coefficient for each pfaa through the saturated soil is described as follows crank 1995 1 c c 0 n 0 1 n erfc 2 n 1 l z 2 d obs t c 0 n 0 1 n erfc 2 n 1 l z 2 d obs t where c is the pfaa aqueous concentration μmol cm 3 c0 is the pfaa aqueous concentration at z 0 μmol cm 3 l is the length of the soil column cm z is the distance along the soil column from the pfaa source cm t is the time s and dobs is the observed diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 assuming that dobs consists of contributions from both aqueous diffusion in the pores and clay surface diffusion dobs is defined for each pfaa as follows for a system described by a linear equilibrium adsorption isotherm yoshida et al 1991 schaefer and kosson 2000 gimmi and kosakowski 2011 2 d obs d obs p d obs s d aq τ 1 ρ k d ε ρk d d s ε where dobs p and dobs s are the observed pfaa pore and surface diffusion coefficients respectively cm2 s 1 daq is the aqueous diffusivity cm2 s 1 τ is an empirical dimensionless tortuosity factor to account for the reduction in diffusivity in porous media relative to water only ρ is the dry soil bulk density directly measured in the soil columns 1 04 g cm 3 kd is the pfaa linear adsorption coefficient determined from the batch adsorption isotherm cm3 g 1 ε is the water filled porosity 0 31 based on the saturated soil moisture content and volume of the soil column and ds is the pfaa surface diffusivity cm2 s 1 values for daq are based on measurement of pfaa aqueous diffusivities performed by schaefer et al 2019b the value for τ was determined based on the bromide diffusion experiments where τ was calculated by dividing the daq for bromide 2 1 10 5 cm2 s 1 cussler 1994 by the dobs measured for bromide in the diffusion columns the value of τ calculated from the bromide diffusion experiments and used in eq 2 was 2 6 results from one of the replicate bromide diffusion tests are provided in the supplemental materials fig s1 with all terms in eq 2 determined for each pfaa except for ds the value of ds was fit to the experimental diffusion curve for pfos pfos was selected for this regression because ds is expected to be most pronounced for the most strongly sorbing pfaa consistent with previously developed models do and rice 1987 yoshida et al 1991 to estimate ds for the other pfaas it is assumed that ds scales with the value for daq for each pfaa which is a reasonable assumption based on previously observed relationships between daq and ds miyabe and takeuchi 1998 miyabe and guiochon 1999 thus for the 6 pfaas used in the diffusion study only a single parameter ds for pfos was regressed to the experimental diffusion data 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption experiments results of the batch adsorption isotherms for each of the pfaas are shown in fig 2 also shown are the linear regressions to the data providing an estimate of kd for each pfaa the adsorption data are well described by a linear adsorption isotherm consistent with previous studies that showed linear pfaa adsorption on to kaolinite xiao et al 2011 and near linear pfaa adsorption to a sandy clay loam soil with an organic carbon content less than 1 guelfo and higgins 2013 comparison of pfhxa adsorption with and without pfos present showed that pfhxa was not measurably impacted by the presence of pfos data not shown as pfhxa adsorption on the soil was identical whether pfos was present or not while this single point falls far short of an exhaustive assessment of pfaa sorptive competition on the soil comparison of the most strongly sorbing compound pfos to one of the more weakly sorbing compounds pfhxa suggests that competitive adsorption effects are likely minimal at the concentrations examined herein while xiao et al 2011 observed competitive adsorption on to kaolinite the pfaa concentrations used herein were at least 10 times less than those used by xiao et al which may have mitigated the observation of competitive adsorption effects consistent with previous studies on soils li et al 2018 guelfo and higgins 2013 and minerals hellsing et al 2016 pfaa kd values observed generally increased with increasing chain length the notable exception was pfhpa which had a kd value that was greater than that measured for pfoa comparing pfos to pfna which both have the same perfluorinated chain length but differ in head group the sulfonate had a greater kd than the carboxylate this is consistent with previous findings with respect to pfaa adsorption to clay minerals zhao et al 2014 however comparison of pfhxs to pfhpa shows that the kd values are statistically identical for the sulfonate and the carboxylate suggesting that increased adsorption of perfluorinated sulfonates relative to perfluorinated carboxylates of the same perfluorinated chain length may not be true for all chain lengths for the soil examined herein based on the fraction of organic carbon in the soil foc in table 1 koc values for each pfaa also are calculated table s2 calculated koc values range from 7 to 50 times greater than the koc values measured by guelfo and higgins 2013 and zhao et al 2012 this result suggests that pfaa uptake to the soil likely is controlled by mineral interactions rather than by interactions with soil organic carbon 4 2 diffusion experiments the measured pfaa soil concentrations μmoles per kg of wet soil are shown as a function of distance from the top of the column in fig 3 for all pfaas evaluated measurable diffusion into the soil column over the 20 day incubation period occurred the simulated pfaa soil concentrations ct are calculated based on eq 2 as follows 3 c t c v w 1000 k d cs 1 θ s where vw is the volume of water calculated based on a measured moisture content of 23 s is the wet soil mass kg and θ is the measured soil moisture content 0 23 kg water g wet soil the solid lines shown in fig 3 represent the model eqs 1 and 2 prediction considering aqueous diffusion only i e dobs s ds 0 values of dobs p and daq used for this model prediction are shown in table 2 all other values in table 2 apply to the model which includes coupled aqueous and surface diffusion the dobs values 11 to 23 10 7 cm2 s 1 observed for benzene and toluene in natural soils containing 12 to 20 clay schaefer and kosson 2000 are with the exception of pfhxa and pfhpa 2 to 3 times greater than the dobs values for pfaas shown in table 2 this discrepancy is primarily due to the relatively small daq values for the pfaas schaefer et al 2019 evaluation of the dashed line model predictions in fig 3 shows that neglecting surface diffusion results in a visible 10 times underprediction of predicted pfos aqueous concentrations beginning at approximately a 2 cm distance from the top of the soil column similarly for pfna model predictions underestimate aqueous concentrations by approximately 10 times by z 3 cm fig s2 shows that the error between predicted neglecting surface diffusion and measured pfaa concentrations increases with kd based on a log normalized root mean square error rmse 4 log normalized rmse i 1 q log c i log c m i 2 q where ci and cm i are the measured and modeled aqueous pfaa concentration respectively and q is the number of datapoints or soil slices use of log normalized concentrations serves to more evenly weight data at both high and low aqueous pfaa concentrations the trend in fig s2 is expected as modeling efforts have shown that surface diffusion increasingly contributes to dobs as kd increases yoshida et al 1991 do and rice 1987 thus fig s2 highlights the need for including surface diffusion for pfos and pfna which have the highest kd values fig 1 for the pfaas and soil examined herein surface diffusion contributions become important 10 of the overall diffusion at kd values greater than approximately 0 5 l kg 1 the dashed lines in fig 3 represent the model eqs 1 and 2 considering both aqueous pore dobs p and surface diffusion ds contributions diffusion coefficient values used in the model are provided in table 2 the value of ds for pfos was regressed to the data using logarithmic values of the measured and modeled pfos aqueous concentrations with a regressed value of 5 3 0 1 10 8 cm2 s 1 as discussed in the model development ds values for the other pfaas subsequently were scaled by the ratio of their values of daq table 2 the value of ds for pfos was within the range of ds values measured for phenol phenol has a daq value within approximately a factor of two of that for pfos bhatia et al 1990 on activated carbon by ocampo pérez et al 2013 visual inspection of the models relative to the experimental data readily indicates that for pfos and pfna inclusion of surface diffusion resulted in substantial improvement in the model predictions this improvement is most apparent at large values of z i e as diffusion distance increases comparison of the log normalized rmse with and without inclusion of surface diffusion confirms the visual observations particularly for pfos and pfna table 2 inclusion of surface diffusion results in a decrease in the rmse for all pfaas with the exception of pfhxa where surface simulated surface diffusion impacts are minimal the ratio dobs p dobs s is greatest for pfhxs and generally decreases with increasing kd table 2 this observation is consistent with previously developed models yoshida et al 1991 do and rice 1987 gimmi and kosakowski 2011 and eq 2 for pfos which has the largest kd 1 8 l kg 1 among the pfaas examined herein surface diffusion processes account for approximately 53 of the overall diffusive flux for pfna which has the second largest kd 0 91 l kg 1 surface diffusion processes account for approximately 24 of the overall diffusive flux in addition for the anionic surfactant sdbs surface diffusion accounted for 45 70 of the overall observed diffusion coefficient in activated carbon this is in reasonable agreement with the surface contribution observed for pfos 52 the fraction ds daq is approximately 10 2 for all the pfaas examined herein this value is well within the range determined by gimmi and kosakowski 2011 for a wide range of clay rock and clay sediment although gimmi and kosakowski examined cations rather than the anionic pfaas examined herein while inclusion of a surface diffusion mechanism generally provides improvement to the model prediction for the diffusion column data rigorous molecular dynamic simulations or tools such as those performed by tinnacher et al 2016 have not been performed to confirm such behavior for the system studied herein and such efforts are beyond the scope of this current study however the argument for the relevance of the appropriateness of the model eqs 1 and 2 is supported by additional lines of evidence first inclusion of the surface diffusion component does not substantially impact the diffusional flux for the pfaas with relatively low kd values with regressing only a single value of ds for pfos the applied model was effective for predicting the diffusion concentration profiles for all six pfaas evaluated thus the model was shown to be consistent with the theoretical impacts of surface diffusion as a function of kd and daq among the pfaas tested second as discussed by oscarson 1994 batch experiments similar to those employed here can result in overpredictions of kd values that occur in actual clay porewater which subsequently result in greater solute diffusion through packed beds than what is predicted by equilibrium transport models if surface diffusion was neglected a pfos kd value of approximately 0 8 l kg 1 would be needed for the model to accurately describe the diffusion data this is less than half the value measured in the batch experiments to confirm the kd value in the diffusion column was well described by the kd measured in the batch experiments the top slice approximately 0 1 cm from the constant concentration interface and pfaa reservoir was analyzed at 20 days when the column was extruded and sliced the porewater pfos concentration in this top slice should be equal to the constant pfos concentration in the bulk water reservoir even if dobs varies one order of magnitude from that measured in the diffusion column the porewater concentration in the top 0 1 cm of the column should be within 10 of the reservoir water concentration at t 20 days with this pfos porewater concentration eq 3 was then solved to determine the observed value of kd in the packed soil column the resultant value for kd was 1 9 l kg 1 which is in excellent agreement with the value of 1 8 l kg 1 measured in the batch experiments thus the enhanced pfos diffusion was not attributable to an overprediction of kd in the batch experiments finally it has been shown that the use of an anionic tracer can lead to an underestimation of dobs due to anion exclusion for clay with negative surface charge glaus et al 2010 this mechanism likely is not responsible for the underprediction of dobs for pfos and pfna because both these pfaas are also present as anions the tortuosity determined using the bromide tracer resulted in very reasonable predictions of pfaa diffusion for the shorter chained compounds suggesting that the bromide was in fact an appropriate diffusion tracer for the pfaas and the underprediction of dobs for pfna and pfos was likely related to their adsorption and subsequent surface diffusion if the tortuosity for pfna and pfos was underpredicted based on bromide due to steric or electrical effects of the much larger pfna or pfos molecules then the model in absence of the surface diffusion term would have overpredicted pfna and pfos diffusion however the model underpredicted pfna and pfos diffusion in absence of the surface diffusion term indicating the issue likely was not related to a tortuosity factor based on bromide while the data and model present evidence to suggest that a surface diffusion like mechanism is relevant for the pfaas and soil used in this study it is recognized that rigorous experimental evidence for the systems examined herein are lacking such evidence would require further insights into pfaa sorption mechanisms with respect to the complex mineral and organic carbon interactions that likely control pfaa uptake on to the soils as well as further insight into the complex heterogeneous mineral surfaces of the natural silty clay soil used in this study further studies including molecular simulation efforts that are beyond the scope of this investigation are required to attain these mechanistic insights however a reasonable case is presented that enhanced diffusion processes e g surface diffusion facilitate migration of the more strongly sorbing pfaas for the system studied herein and that predictions of dobs cannot be explained via an aqueous phase diffusion mechanism alone 5 conclusions enhanced diffusive migration of pfos and pfna through clay rich soils could have a substantial impact on their overall migration in heterogeneous groundwater systems enhanced diffusion into low permeability clays would likely serve to mitigate downgradient pfaa migration for cases where pfaa persistence in groundwater is due to pfaa back diffusion from clays that have been fully penetrated by the pfaas the rate at which pfaas are released from the clay would be enhanced as would the rate of pfaa attenuation from the aquifer the results observed herein provide motivation for additional studies into pfaa diffusion in a wider range of environmental clays to further assess the potential role of surface diffusion

1416,diffusion through a water saturated silty clay soil column was measured for six perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos an aqueous pore diffusion model which incorporated linear adsorption parameters measured independently in batch tests and a tortuosity factor determined independently using a bromide tracer test was used to describe the experimental diffusion data the diffusion model substantially underpredicted pfaa diffusion through the soil column for the more strongly sorbing pfaas most notably pfos instead application of a diffusion model that included a surface diffusion like process provided substantially improved prediction of pfaa diffusion through the soil the ratio of the observed pore diffusion coefficient to the observed surface diffusion coefficient ranged from 13 for perfluorohexane sulfonate to 0 88 for pfos these results suggest that surface diffusion serves a potentially important role for strongly sorbing pfaas in clay rich soils and highlights the need for additional studies into the coupled adsorption and diffusion of pfaas in low permeability media graphical abstract unlabelled image 1 introduction soil and groundwater impacted by perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have become a well recognized environmental concern pfaas can enter soil and groundwater systems via the release of aqueous film forming foams from fire training activities backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 anderson et al 2019 nickerson et al 2020 landfill leachate benskin et al 2012 lang et al 2017 or other industrial releases clara et al 2008 pfaa concentrations near 1 μm have been observed in groundwater within fire training areas backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 pfaa sources can persist in soil and groundwater systems for decades even after treatment has been performed to address co contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbons houtz et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 guo et al 2020 the persistence of pfaas in soil and groundwater systems allows time for diffusion into low permeability materials such as silts clays and rock matrices such uptake as well as the subsequent slow diffusive release of other classes of contaminants has been observed shapiro 2001 wanner and hunkeler 2015 several studies have highlighted the importance of such diffusion processes in sustaining dissolved plumes and for developing accurate conceptual site models mundle et al 2007 parker et al 2008 schaefer et al 2018 berns et al 2019 a relatively small number of studies have examined pfaa adsorption in clays and clay minerals in general these studies have shown that pfaa adsorption increases with perfluorinated chain length hellsing et al 2016 that perfluorinated sulfonates sorb more strongly than perfluorinated carboxylates zhao et al 2014 and that ph and ionic strength impact sorption zhao et al 2014 alves et al 2020 mussabek et al 2020 also has shown that mineral content e g fe pb rb as is correlated to pfaa sorption both electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding have been suggested as pfaa sorption mechanisms to clay minerals zhao et al 2014 hellsing et al 2016 alves et al 2020 as pfaas are typically present in anionic form xiao et al 2011 in experiments performed using kaolinite showed that pfaa adsorption was well described by a linear isotherm and that competitive adsorption among the pfaas occurred to our knowledge studies investigating the coupled adsorption and diffusion of pfaas through natural clays or clay rich soils have not been examined recent work has provided experimental measurements of pfaa aqueous diffusivities schaefer et al 2019 but no corresponding measurements of pfaa diffusion through clays are available diffusion through liquid filled micropores can occur through both aqueous phase or pore diffusion and also via a surface diffusion mechanism yoshida et al 1991 ocampo pérez et al 2013 the latter generally is more pronounced as the extent of adsorption increases yoshida et al 1991 do and rice 1987 gimmi and kosakowski 2011 it is recognized that what is attributed to surface diffusion may in fact be solute migration within mineral

rounds of extraction with 0 1 m ammonium hydroxide in methanol 4 ml each round for a total of 16 ml the combined extract was evaporated under nitrogen in a heated bath reconstituted with 1 5 ml of 1 by volume acetic acid in methanol and passed through envi carb sigma aldrich 250 mg solid phase extraction cartridges for matrix clean up a 100 μl aliquot of each extract was diluted to 400 μl in autosampler vials of 80 methanol 20 organic composition chromatography ms parameters and qa qc criteria were identical to nickerson et al 2020 3 model development pfaa diffusion through soil assuming a constant pfaa concentration at the top of the diffusion column z 0 no pfaas initially in the soil and a no flux boundary condition at the bottom of the column the observed diffusion coefficient for each pfaa through the saturated soil is described as follows crank 1995 1 c c 0 n 0 1 n erfc 2 n 1 l z 2 d obs t c 0 n 0 1 n erfc 2 n 1 l z 2 d obs t where c is the pfaa aqueous concentration μmol cm 3 c0 is the pfaa aqueous concentration at z 0 μmol cm 3 l is the length of the soil column cm z is the distance along the soil column from the pfaa source cm t is the time s and dobs is the observed diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 assuming that dobs consists of contributions from both aqueous diffusion in the pores and clay surface diffusion dobs is defined for each pfaa as follows for a system described by a linear equilibrium adsorption isotherm yoshida et al 1991 schaefer and kosson 2000 gimmi and kosakowski 2011 2 d obs d obs p d obs s d aq τ 1 ρ k d ε ρk d d s ε where dobs p and dobs s are the observed pfaa pore and surface diffusion coefficients respectively cm2 s 1 daq is the aqueous diffusivity cm2 s 1 τ is an empirical dimensionless tortuosity factor to account for the reduction in diffusivity in porous media relative to water only ρ is the dry soil bulk density directly measured in the soil columns 1 04 g cm 3 kd is the pfaa linear adsorption coefficient determined from the batch adsorption isotherm cm3 g 1 ε is the water filled porosity 0 31 based on the saturated soil moisture content and volume of the soil column and ds is the pfaa surface diffusivity cm2 s 1 values for daq are based on measurement of pfaa aqueous diffusivities performed by schaefer et al 2019b the value for τ was determined based on the bromide diffusion experiments where τ was calculated by dividing the daq for bromide 2 1 10 5 cm2 s 1 cussler 1994 by the dobs measured for bromide in the diffusion columns the value of τ calculated from the bromide diffusion experiments and used in eq 2 was 2 6 results from one of the replicate bromide diffusion tests are provided in the supplemental materials fig s1 with all terms in eq 2 determined for each pfaa except for ds the value of ds was fit to the experimental diffusion curve for pfos pfos was selected for this regression because ds is expected to be most pronounced for the most strongly sorbing pfaa consistent with previously developed models do and rice 1987 yoshida et al 1991 to estimate ds for the other pfaas it is assumed that ds scales with the value for daq for each pfaa which is a reasonable assumption based on previously observed relationships between daq and ds miyabe and takeuchi 1998 miyabe and guiochon 1999 thus for the 6 pfaas used in the diffusion study only a single parameter ds for pfos was regressed to the experimental diffusion data 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption experiments results of the batch adsorption isotherms for each of the pfaas are shown in fig 2 also shown are the linear regressions to the data providing an estimate of kd for each pfaa the adsorption data are well described by a linear adsorption isotherm consistent with previous studies that showed linear pfaa adsorption on to kaolinite xiao et al 2011 and near linear pfaa adsorption to a sandy clay loam soil with an organic carbon content less than 1 guelfo and higgins 2013 comparison of pfhxa adsorption with and without pfos present showed that pfhxa was not measurably impacted by the presence of pfos data not shown as pfhxa adsorption on the soil was identical whether pfos was present or not while this single point falls far short of an exhaustive assessment of pfaa sorptive competition on the soil comparison of the most strongly sorbing compound pfos to one of the more weakly sorbing compounds pfhxa suggests that competitive adsorption effects are likely minimal at the concentrations examined herein while xiao et al 2011 observed competitive adsorption on to kaolinite the pfaa concentrations used herein were at least 10 times less than those used by xiao et al which may have mitigated the observation of competitive adsorption effects consistent with previous studies on soils li et al 2018 guelfo and higgins 2013 and minerals hellsing et al 2016 pfaa kd values observed generally increased with increasing chain length the notable exception was pfhpa which had a kd value that was greater than that measured for pfoa comparing pfos to pfna which both have the same perfluorinated chain length but differ in head group the sulfonate had a greater kd than the carboxylate this is consistent with previous findings with respect to pfaa adsorption to clay minerals zhao et al 2014 however comparison of pfhxs to pfhpa shows that the kd values are statistically identical for the sulfonate and the carboxylate suggesting that increased adsorption of perfluorinated sulfonates relative to perfluorinated carboxylates of the same perfluorinated chain length may not be true for all chain lengths for the soil examined herein based on the fraction of organic carbon in the soil foc in table 1 koc values for each pfaa also are calculated table s2 calculated koc values range from 7 to 50 times greater than the koc values measured by guelfo and higgins 2013 and zhao et al 2012 this result suggests that pfaa uptake to the soil likely is controlled by mineral interactions rather than by interactions with soil organic carbon 4 2 diffusion experiments the measured pfaa soil concentrations μmoles per kg of wet soil are shown as a function of distance from the top of the column in fig 3 for all pfaas evaluated measurable diffusion into the soil column over the 20 day incubation period occurred the simulated pfaa soil concentrations ct are calculated based on eq 2 as follows 3 c t c v w 1000 k d cs 1 θ s where vw is the volume of water calculated based on a measured moisture content of 23 s is the wet soil mass kg and θ is the measured soil moisture content 0 23 kg water g wet soil the solid lines shown in fig 3 represent the model eqs 1 and 2 prediction considering aqueous diffusion only i e dobs s ds 0 values of dobs p and daq used for this model prediction are shown in table 2 all other values in table 2 apply to the model which includes coupled aqueous and surface diffusion the dobs values 11 to 23 10 7 cm2 s 1 observed for benzene and toluene in natural soils containing 12 to 20 clay schaefer and kosson 2000 are with the exception of pfhxa and pfhpa 2 to 3 times greater than the dobs values for pfaas shown in table 2 this discrepancy is primarily due to the relatively small daq values for the pfaas schaefer et al 2019 evaluation of the dashed line model predictions in fig 3 shows that neglecting surface diffusion results in a visible 10 times underprediction of predicted pfos aqueous concentrations beginning at approximately a 2 cm distance from the top of the soil column similarly for pfna model predictions underestimate aqueous concentrations by approximately 10 times by z 3 cm fig s2 shows that the error between predicted neglecting surface diffusion and measured pfaa concentrations increases with kd based on a log normalized root mean square error rmse 4 log normalized rmse i 1 q log c i log c m i 2 q where ci and cm i are the measured and modeled aqueous pfaa concentration respectively and q is the number of datapoints or soil slices use of log normalized concentrations serves to more evenly weight data at both high and low aqueous pfaa concentrations the trend in fig s2 is expected as modeling efforts have shown that surface diffusion increasingly contributes to dobs as kd increases yoshida et al 1991 do and rice 1987 thus fig s2 highlights the need for including surface diffusion for pfos and pfna which have the highest kd values fig 1 for the pfaas and soil examined herein surface diffusion contributions become important 10 of the overall diffusion at kd values greater than approximately 0 5 l kg 1 the dashed lines in fig 3 represent the model eqs 1 and 2 considering both aqueous pore dobs p and surface diffusion ds contributions diffusion coefficient values used in the model are provided in table 2 the value of ds for pfos was regressed to the data using logarithmic values of the measured and modeled pfos aqueous concentrations with a regressed value of 5 3 0 1 10 8 cm2 s 1 as discussed in the model development ds values for the other pfaas subsequently were scaled by the ratio of their values of daq table 2 the value of ds for pfos was within the range of ds values measured for phenol phenol has a daq value within approximately a factor of two of that for pfos bhatia et al 1990 on activated carbon by ocampo pérez et al 2013 visual inspection of the models relative to the experimental data readily indicates that for pfos and pfna inclusion of surface diffusion resulted in substantial improvement in the model predictions this improvement is most apparent at large values of z i e as diffusion distance increases comparison of the log normalized rmse with and without inclusion of surface diffusion confirms the visual observations particularly for pfos and pfna table 2 inclusion of surface diffusion results in a decrease in the rmse for all pfaas with the exception of pfhxa where surface simulated surface diffusion impacts are minimal the ratio dobs p dobs s is greatest for pfhxs and generally decreases with increasing kd table 2 this observation is consistent with previously developed models yoshida et al 1991 do and rice 1987 gimmi and kosakowski 2011 and eq 2 for pfos which has the largest kd 1 8 l kg 1 among the pfaas examined herein surface diffusion processes account for approximately 53 of the overall diffusive flux for pfna which has the second largest kd 0 91 l kg 1 surface diffusion processes account for approximately 24 of the overall diffusive flux in addition for the anionic surfactant sdbs surface diffusion accounted for 45 70 of the overall observed diffusion coefficient in activated carbon this is in reasonable agreement with the surface contribution observed for pfos 52 the fraction ds daq is approximately 10 2 for all the pfaas examined herein this value is well within the range determined by gimmi and kosakowski 2011 for a wide range of clay rock and clay sediment although gimmi and kosakowski examined cations rather than the anionic pfaas examined herein while inclusion of a surface diffusion mechanism generally provides improvement to the model prediction for the diffusion column data rigorous molecular dynamic simulations or tools such as those performed by tinnacher et al 2016 have not been performed to confirm such behavior for the system studied herein and such efforts are beyond the scope of this current study however the argument for the relevance of the appropriateness of the model eqs 1 and 2 is supported by additional lines of evidence first inclusion of the surface diffusion component does not substantially impact the diffusional flux for the pfaas with relatively low kd values with regressing only a single value of ds for pfos the applied model was effective for predicting the diffusion concentration profiles for all six pfaas evaluated thus the model was shown to be consistent with the theoretical impacts of surface diffusion as a function of kd and daq among the pfaas tested second as discussed by oscarson 1994 batch experiments similar to those employed here can result in overpredictions of kd values that occur in actual clay porewater which subsequently result in greater solute diffusion through packed beds than what is predicted by equilibrium transport models if surface diffusion was neglected a pfos kd value of approximately 0 8 l kg 1 would be needed for the model to accurately describe the diffusion data this is less than half the value measured in the batch experiments to confirm the kd value in the diffusion column was well described by the kd measured in the batch experiments the top slice approximately 0 1 cm from the constant concentration interface and pfaa reservoir was analyzed at 20 days when the column was extruded and sliced the porewater pfos concentration in this top slice should be equal to the constant pfos concentration in the bulk water reservoir even if dobs varies one order of magnitude from that measured in the diffusion column the porewater concentration in the top 0 1 cm of the column should be within 10 of the reservoir water concentration at t 20 days with this pfos porewater concentration eq 3 was then solved to determine the observed value of kd in the packed soil column the resultant value for kd was 1 9 l kg 1 which is in excellent agreement with the value of 1 8 l kg 1 measured in the batch experiments thus the enhanced pfos diffusion was not attributable to an overprediction of kd in the batch experiments finally it has been shown that the use of an anionic tracer can lead to an underestimation of dobs due to anion exclusion for clay with negative surface charge glaus et al 2010 this mechanism likely is not responsible for the underprediction of dobs for pfos and pfna because both these pfaas are also present as anions the tortuosity determined using the bromide tracer resulted in very reasonable predictions of pfaa diffusion for the shorter chained compounds suggesting that the bromide was in fact an appropriate diffusion tracer for the pfaas and the underprediction of dobs for pfna and pfos was likely related to their adsorption and subsequent surface diffusion if the tortuosity for pfna and pfos was underpredicted based on bromide due to steric or electrical effects of the much larger pfna or pfos molecules then the model in absence of the surface diffusion term would have overpredicted pfna and pfos diffusion however the model underpredicted pfna and pfos diffusion in absence of the surface diffusion term indicating the issue likely was not related to a tortuosity factor based on bromide while the data and model present evidence to suggest that a surface diffusion like mechanism is relevant for the pfaas and soil used in this study it is recognized that rigorous experimental evidence for the systems examined herein are lacking such evidence would require further insights into pfaa sorption mechanisms with respect to the complex mineral and organic carbon interactions that likely control pfaa uptake on to the soils as well as further insight into the complex heterogeneous mineral surfaces of the natural silty clay soil used in this study further studies including molecular simulation efforts that are beyond the scope of this investigation are required to attain these mechanistic insights however a reasonable case is presented that enhanced diffusion processes e g surface diffusion facilitate migration of the more strongly sorbing pfaas for the system studied herein and that predictions of dobs cannot be explained via an aqueous phase diffusion mechanism alone 5 conclusions enhanced diffusive migration of pfos and pfna through clay rich soils could have a substantial impact on their overall migration in heterogeneous groundwater systems enhanced diffusion into low permeability clays would likely serve to mitigate downgradient pfaa migration for cases where pfaa persistence in groundwater is due to pfaa back diffusion from clays that have been fully penetrated by the pfaas the rate at which pfaas are released from the clay would be enhanced as would the rate of pfaa attenuation from the aquifer the results observed herein provide motivation for additional studies into pfaa diffusion in a wider range of environmental clays to further assess the potential role of surface diffusion

1417,nitrate contamination of groundwater remains a major concern despite all the measures and efforts undertaken over the last decades to protect water resources we focused on a small catchment in brittany france facing nitrate pollution with concentrations over the european drinking water standard of 50 mg l 1 this is a common situation in catchments where supposedly effective measures were applied for reducing the transfer of n to groundwater at the scale of this small 100 ha basement aquifer nitrate concentrations are very heterogeneous in the groundwater sampled up to 15 20 m below the soil surface in several observation wells hereafter referred as piezometers and up to 110 m deep in a borehole drilled through a faulted area near the spring outlet of the catchment we used complementary and robust approaches for exploring and constraining the driving parameters of nitrate transfer and distribution in groundwater detailed geological work and a geophysical electrical resistivity tomography survey identified the lithologies tectonic structures and weathering layers this highlighted a complex geological structure with several compartments delimited by faults as well as the highly variable thickness of the weathered layer it also illustrated the heterogeneity of the hydrosystem some compartments appearing to be disconnected from the general groundwater flow this was confirmed by geochemical analyses and by the mean apparent groundwater residence time based on cfcs sf6 and noble gas analyses locally revealing old and nitrate free groundwater and very old water with a recharge temperature below than the current average temperature in the area reflecting water dating back to the last period of glaciation 19 to 17 ky nitrate isotopes clearly showed denitrification processes in a few piezometers which was generally supported by microbiology and molecular biology results this highlighted the presence of functional genes involved in denitrification as well as a capacity of the groundwater microbial community to denitrify when in situ conditions are favourable this type of combined approach covering chemistry isotopic methods dissolved gases microbiological activity geophysics and hydrogeology appears to be indispensable for implementing the most relevant programme of measures and for accurately assessing their effectiveness notably by considering the timeframe between implementation of the measures and their impact on groundwater quality keywords nitrate contamination basement aquifer nitrate isotopes groundwater residence time microbiological activity electrical resistivity tomography geophysics plourhan catchment 1 introduction nitrate contamination of groundwater remains a major concern despite all the efforts to protect aquifers against nitrate pollution such as implementation of the european council directive 91 676 eec adopted in 1991 european commission 1991 and of the european water framework directive 2000 60 ec european commission 2000 and its daughter directive 2006 118 ec european commission 2006 in addition to agronomic measures a key issue is to arrive at better understanding the driving parameters of nitrate transfer towards and distribution in groundwater i e the geological structures and the hydrogeological functioning the correlation between an increased use of synthetic and organic fertilizers and the increase of nitrate concentrations in groundwater has been known for a long time e g aquilina et al 2012 but uncertainties remain concerning the transit time between topsoil and aquifer in particular the immobilization remobilization processes of n governing nitrogen cycling and nitrate transfer through soil are still poorly constrained in terms of delay effect sebilo et al 2013 who investigated the fate of a single application of an isotopically labelled nitrogen fertilizers for three decades in an experimental field concluded that attempts for reducing agricultural nitrate contamination of aquatic systems must consider the long term legacy of past applications of synthetic fertilizer and the nitrogen retention capacity of agricultural soils in addition to nitrogen retention and cycling processes in soil the n stock mainly nitrate in the unsaturated aquifer zone must be considered baran et al 2007 nitrate being highly soluble it is generally considered that it will transfer through the unsaturated zone towards groundwater at the same rate as infiltrating water this implies that a good understanding of the subsurface geology and its geometry as well as of the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer system is essential as they at least partly govern pollutant transfer time at the catchment scale a proper understanding of the hydrogeological functioning can be obtained from groundwater residence time assessment using chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulphur hexafluoride sf6 gases for studying modern 60 yr groundwater dynamics and mixing processes these anthropogenic gases have been released into the atmosphere since the 1950s and are now found in natural waters with atmospheric equilibria that allow groundwater dating based on their atmospheric concentrations chronicles e g busenberg and plummer 1992 ayraud et al 2008 aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 chatton et al 2016 furthermore part of the n can leave the nitrogen cycle as gases n2o and n2 resulting from denitrification governed by heterotrophic or autotrophic denitrifying bacteria transforming no3 to n2 stein and klotz 2016 this process affects the global n budget especially the nitrate one and must be considered as a major process when evaluating of the fate of n from soil to groundwater nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are frequently used as tracers of nitrate sources in groundwater as the various synthetic organic n fertilizers have different isotopic compositions kendall et al 2007 however nitrate isotopes also are ideal tools for tracing n transformation processes such as denitrification böttcher et al 1990 as no3 reduction to n2 is a highly fractionating process kendall and aravena 2000 leading to a joint increase of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 whereas simple dilution also leading to a decrease in no3 concentration does not modify the isotopic signatures we designed and implemented an innovative interdisciplinary study coupling complementary and robust approaches for defining the spatio temporal nitrate distribution in a small catchment of a basement rock aquifer for that purpose we had to answer the following questions 1 how is groundwater quality especially for nitrate controlled spatially and temporarily by natural water rock interactions and by anthropogenic input related to agricultural practises and its evolution over the past decades hydrogeological geophysical and chemical approaches 2 what are the nitrate sources and their potential attenuation as shown by n and o isotopes of no3 fingerprinting and through assessing the denitrification potential by monitoring nitrate reducing bacteria genes isotopic and microbiological approaches 3 what is the groundwater residence time distribution in order to evaluate the hydrodynamics and the potential spatial variability of the aquifer and as a supplementary constraint to support the hypothesis regarding the chemical and isotopic compositions cfc sf6 and rare dissolved gases approach 2 site description the plourhan site we studied is a small 1 26 km2 hydrogeological catchment in 2006 a potentiometric map was drawn for resource protection purposes relying on different hydrogeological approaches such as the drilling of 12 piezometers and a deep borehole it is located 10 km from the coast in brittany northwest france geologically it is underlain by brioverian basement composed of metasedimentary pelite and sandstone and amphibolite both overlain by an 8 to 20 m thick saprolite layer the basement that can be highly fractured especially the amphibolite a major fault forms the boundary between metasediments and amphibolite with a potentially wide fracture zone fig 1 this description based on the 1 50 000 scale geological map was not precise enough in view of the small catchment size for this reason a detailed geological survey of the catchment was part of this study as was a geophysical survey providing a better definition of the detailed geology and its geometry see supplementary material in addition a pedological study carried out during delineation of the area to be protected showed relative soil uniformity of the site the soil is brown and moderately deep 40 cm on average in the east of the site and about 80 cm in the southwest under the forest to the northwest a particular pedogenesis is observed the soil being pseudo gley a natural spring emerges near the major fault and has been exploited since 1968 via a 4 4 m deep borehole that taps the water coming from the saprolite layer this spring hereafter referred to as spring feeds a small stream that exits the basin to the east in 2006 12 piezometers pz1 to pz12 between 10 and 22 m depth were drilled mainly for delineating the catchment in these piezometers the groundwater level is few metres below the soil level bsl they are screened all along the weathered layer down to the top of the fresh basement the saturated zone is only a few metres thick a few measurements before our study showed strong heterogeneity of the groundwater quality monthly monitored water levels between october 2006 and march 2008 were used for drawing potentiometric maps thus defining the hydrogeological contours of the catchment and identifying flow directions fig 1 not surprisingly the hydrological and topographic catchments have different boundaries thus for the piezometers accessible during this study pz3 6 and 8 are located upstream respectively south and north of the spring while pz5 and pz9 are located in the middle of the catchment the others pz10 and pz7 lie outside the catchment in addition to these 12 piezometers tapping water in the saprolite a deep borehole sr1 drilled at about 30 m from the natural spring within the fault zone has a total depth of 133 m it is screened below 50 m bsl and intersected paragneiss and metamorphic sandstone and pelite the water supply for the 2000 inhabitants is based on the water pumped from the spring fig 1 which must be diluted in order to fulfil the drinking water quality standards for nitrate indeed the spring has nitrate concentrations exceeding the 50 mg l drinking water standard and the dilution takes place at the treatment plant with water from another borehole a protection area for the groundwater catchment was administratively defined in 2010 along parcel boundaries it specified the regulation of agricultural land use maintaining plots in forest or meadow areas and plots where annual crops were allowed with specific agronomic recommendations as of 2013 annual crops were no longer allowed and were replaced by meadows fig 2 historically the studied site has been subject to strong agricultural pressure from 1980 to 1990 vegetable production dominated in the mid 1990s land use was mainly dedicated to market gardening with a significant surface for peas potatoes and cauliflower from the mid 1990s to the present in an effort to improve groundwater quality farmers significantly reduced the vegetable areas fig 2 compensated by an increase in wheat maize and especially grass despite these efforts nitrate concentrations in spring water only decreased slowly and still remain above the 50 mg l standard fig 2 in the area historically and until recently nitrogen was applied in both mineral and organic form depending on the cultivated plot detailed information is not available but it is known that in 2014 in the protection area four of the seven farms produced animal excrements cattle pigs poultry and five had plots on which animal excrements green waste compost and or household waste were spread côtes d armor chamber of agriculture 2014 a detailed knowledge of land use allows addressing the issue of why groundwater quality is spatially heterogeneous such groundwater catchment is representative of lithology basement soil and climate of france and western europe 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling strategy the study site was monitored for two distinct periods the spring was sampled on a monthly basis from august 2009 to june 2010 10 campaigns 1st period and from october 2016 to july 2019 28 campaigns 2nd period whereas piezometers were only sampled twice and four times during the 1st and 2nd periods respectively it should be noted that some piezometers were no longer accessible during the 2nd period prior to sampling several field parameters were measured including electrical conductivity ph redox and oxygen content table s1 supplementary material major ions were analysed for all samples microbiological parameters were measured in each samples from the 2nd period as was groundwater dating isotopic investigations only concerned samples from april 2017 3 2 chemical and isotopic investigations 3 2 1 analytical methods for both sampling periods the groundwater samples were collected in polyethylene bottles and filtered through 0 45 μm pvdf filters for chemical and nitrate isotopes analysis bottles dedicated to cation analysis were acidified with 15 n ultrapure hno3 to ph 2 physicochemical parameters of each sample were measured on site including the electrical

laboratories by icp aes ca na k mg uncertainty 10 ion chromatography cl so4 no3 uncertainty 10 and titration method according to n en iso 9963 1 hco3 co3 2 uncertainty 5 both δ15n and δ18o of no3 were measured by the agno3 method at brgm according to the following procedure the filtered water is chemically purified through cationic and anionic ion exchange columns nitrate is recovered as hno3 by hcl elution the eluate is converted to agno3 by addition of silver oxide ag2o hcl hno3 ag2o agcl s agno3 h2o the filtrate containing the nitrate once freed from the other oxygenated compounds by adding bacl2 is lyophilized to obtain solid agno3 chang et al 1999 silva et al 2000 the solid agno3 precipitate is then weighed into silver capsules that are inserted separately into a furnace composed of a glassy carbon reactor heated to 1450 c the n2 and co gases resulting from high temperature combustion are driven by a helium flow to a chromatographic column this separates the gas peaks before their introduction into the source of the mass spectrometer for determining the nitrate δ18o and δ15n isotopic ratios the analytical accuracy is 0 5 for δ15n and δ18o water samples for chlorofluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride cfcs and sf6 analyses were collected in stainless steel ampoules 40 ml and 300 ml respectively after rinsing them with at least three times the sample volume without any contact with atmospheric air during sampling the cfcs and sf6 concentrations used for calculating the groundwater residence times were measured using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector gc ecd labasque et al 2014 ayraud et al 2008 at the plateforme condate eau osur university of rennes 1 france for the 2nd period the concentrations of cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc

model pfm an exponential model em and a binary mixing model bmm were systematically tested to determine the apparent groundwater residence time matoszewski and zuber 1996 the overall uncertainty of derived groundwater age estimates including sampling biases and analytical errors as well as the errors resulting from uncertainty of the recharge temperature and considering dispersion adsorption effects is estimated to be 3 years labasque et al 2014 for the 1st sampling period 2009 2011 a simplified sample collection method was used iaea 2006 the analyses were made by spurenstofflabor at wachenheim germany using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector after pre concentration using the purge and trap technique the detection limit was 10 4 pmol allowing the measurement of cfc concentrations down to 0 01 pmol l 1 and of sf6 concentrations to 0 1 fmol l 1 reproducibility was about 5 for water samples major and noble gases were measured throughout the sampling campaign using a gc tcd cg 3000 sra instrument after headspace extraction with a he gas phase following the sugisaki and taki 1987 the analytical error for ne and ar n2 measurements was 3 and 2 respectively the analysis of ne ar ratios allows calculating excess air and recharge temperatures heaton and vogel 1981 3 2 2 n and o isotopes of nitrate theoretical background since the 2000s nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrates δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are used for tracing nitrate sources in surface and groundwaters widory et al 2005 2013 kendall et al 2007 fenech et al 2012 puig et al 2017 nevertheless n sources discrimination is often not straightforward as nitrate is not a conservative molecule and thus the n transformation process has to be considered for properly tracing n sources n and o isotopes are also valuable tracers for better constraining the n cycle from soil to groundwater i e immobilization mineralization nitrification and denitrification these different processes may thus lead to a loss of the original δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopic signatures through isotopic fractionation zhang et al 2019 however such isotopic fractionations is an excellent tool for identifying these processes and thus for better constraining n mobility denitrification by oxidation of pyrite fes2 i e during chemoautotrophic respiration of sulphur oxidizing thiobacillus denitrificans has been identified as an important denitrification pathway in basement aquifers where pyrite is abundant pauwels et al 2000 note that aquilina et al 2018 suggested another type of autotrophic denitrification biotite dissolution with the oxidation of fe ii contained in biotite denitrification is a highly fractionating process böttcher et al 1990 kendall and aravena 2000 following a rayleigh distillation model leading to a joint increase of the isotope ratios δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of the residual no3 the n cycle in soil further modifies the isotopic signature of the nitrate leached out and transported towards groundwater mengis et al 2001 sebilo et al 2013 the newly formed nitrate through ammonium nitrification is generally assumed to take nitrogen from nh4 and or no2 while one oxygen comes from atmospheric o2 and two from water h2o considering a simple stoichiometric relationship eq 1 kumar et al 1983 kendall 1998 and references therein note that buchwald and casciotti 2010 added constraints

real time quantitative pcr qpcr according to bru et al 2007 in order to assess potential denitrification activity batch experiments were run on waters sampled in april 2017 in the pz3 pz6 pz8 pz9 and pz10 piezometers briefly duplicate 300 ml flasks were filled in with 150 ml of water under anaerobic conditions nitrogen atmosphere acetate c2h3nao2 was added as a carbon source in each flask at a final concentration of 100 mg l considering nitrate concentration in each well nitrate was added to the flasks to reach a final no3 concentration of 100 mg l abiotic tests in the presence of sodium azide cabrol et al 2017 were also performed the flasks were incubated for 20 days in the dark at 25 c under stirring 100 rpm every 4 to 5 days 8 ml of water was sampled for nitrate nitrite and acetate quantification and 5 ml of the gas phase was sampled for n2o analysis nitrate and acetate were quantified by ionic chromatography dionex ic3000 sp eg dc system equipped with an as50 autosampler and a

kruskal wallis test p 0 05 4 results and discussions 4 1 improving the hydrogeological model geological investigations consisted in accurately identifying the rock types tectonic structures and degree of weathering in order to refine the geological map at the scale of this small catchment and to better understand the hydrogeological functioning this field work confirmed that the catchment is located on a brioverian anticlinal axis oriented n100 110 intersected by faults oriented n150 sub n s and n050 the weathering profile forms a paleosurface at an altitude of about 80 m above mean sealevel and seems to be affected by faulting geophysical results showed major horizontal resistivity contrasts with two distinct domains separated by a significant vertical discontinuity f5 fig s1 supplementary material the western resistive domain corresponds to amphibolite while the conductive eastern unit corresponds to metamorphic sandstone and pelite egal et al 1996 fig 1 and 3a to the west a vertical resistivity gradient is interpreted as a signature of the amphibolite weathering profile consisting of alterite c0 fig s1 at the top followed by a fractured layer r1 and fresh basement rock r2 these results are coherent with those observed in other basement contexts dewandel et al 2006 belle et al 2019 comte et al 2012 in the sandstone and pelite domain despite the complexity of the electrical pattern the sr1 geological log distinguishes the alterite from the sandstone and pelite c1 c2 fig s1 that overlie a highly conductive c3 paragneiss derived from the sandstone and pelite forming a metamorphic halo egal et al 1995 and being an aquifer formation this suggests that the high conductivity values observed are caused by strong and connected fracturing of the rock and thus that the paragneiss is the main aquifer formation of the catchment the amphibolite seems more impermeable than the sandstone and pelite and the alterite forms a surface aquifer fig 3 further details are presented in the supplementary material to complete the geological and geophysical investigations and improve preliminary conclusions chemical data were examined fig 4 the total mineralization of the water can be assessed through its electrical conductivity ec μs cm 1 and the total dissolved solids tds mg l 1 both parameters being correlated the tds values of the spring samples natural outlet of the hydrogeological system show small variations over the two sampling periods 205 257 mg l 1 as do most groundwater samples within the catchment 182 235 mg l 1 pz1 pz2 pz3 pz4 pz7 pz9 and pz10 nevertheless four groundwater samples pz6 pz8 pz12 and sr1 have clearly higher tds values ranging between 274 and 675 mg l 1 varying both throughout the sampling periods and according to the sampling depth fig 4b groundwater presents very heterogeneous chemical types at this small catchment scale from ca hco3 to ca so4 cation proportions vary between a sodic end member 50 na k in pz10 and a calcic end member up to 60 ca in pz6 and pz8 fig 4a when comparing the revised structural scheme fig 3 and the geochemical data it appears that samples with the higher calcium concentrations i e pz6 pz8 pz12 and sr1 which also have the highest tds reflect water rock interactions with the weathered sandstone and pelite compartment the other samples with low tds values and lower calcium concentrations seems to results from water rock interaction with the weathered amphibolite compartment this chemical variability also reflects the complex geological settings of this small area only 0 6 km2 in terms of both weathering profile and geological entities it is worth noting that water in the deep borehole sr1 has an increasing ca load with depth probably related to water rock interaction with fractured sandstone in addition pz4 and pz7 in the weathered sandstone and pelite compartment present geochemical signatures very similar to that of groundwater in the amphibolite compartment the geological and geophysical investigations allowed refining the contours of each geological formation on the 1 50 000 scale geological map these contours being coherent with the geochemical groundwater signatures howerver interrogations remain for some piezometers that are too far from the two geophysical profiles for making sufficiently reliable projections 4 2 temporal and spatial anthropogenic pressure a focus on nitrate as mentioned above despite all efforts made to reduce nitrogen transfer to groundwater nitrate concentrations only decrease slowly at the spring and remain above the 50 mg l 1 standard fig 2 the increase in no3 concentrations has stopped in the early 2000s reaching a plateau over five years before starting a decrease that continues today this type of evolution is typical of what is commonly observed in europe since the implementation of various programmes of measures for recovering a good chemical status of the groundwater bodies even though the response time can be quite different european commission 2018 this anthropogenic pressure is clearly shown in the small plourhan catchment where nitrate concentrations in groundwater can be as high as 88 mg l 1 pz1 oct 2009 however the nitrate concentrations in the piezometers sampled during the two sampling periods 2009 2010 and 2016 2018 showed quite different values from one piezometer to the next for instance the spring and pz7 showed a no3 decrease between the 1st and 2nd periods from 80 to 61 mg l 1 spring and from 77 to 62 mg l 1 pz7 fig 2 fig 5b table s1 supplementary material pz8 has the largest decrease in nitrate concentrations from 39 to 10 mg l 1 on average between the two sampling periods the temporal variations between 1st and 2nd periods are less pronounced for pz3 and pz6 most of the groundwater samples from piezometers pz5 and pz9 and borehole sr1 have nitrate concentrations below 10 mg l 1 fig 5a shows the sodium versus chloride concentrations in groundwater of the study area in the absence of evaporites in the local geological formations chloride may derive from atmospheric meybeck 1983 or anthropogenic agriculture wastewater effluents etc inputs and thus may have the same origin as nitrate significant amounts of chloride 80 mg l 1 were measured in many groundwaters of the brittany basement 80 m deep that were shown to be related to the last marine mio pliocene transgressions while shallow and modern groundwater has lower cl concentrations 50 mg l 1 aquilina et al 2015 in this study groundwater samples were taken at 10 to 22 m depth in the weathered layer and at the top of the basement except in the sr1 borehole that is 133 m deep the cl concentrations are generally less than 60 mg l 1 including in borehole sr1 only pz12 presents a clearly higher cl concentration of 140 mg l 1 two samples in 2009 as does pz5 with cl concentrations of 72 mg l 1 the specific case of pz5 is further discussed in section 4 3 for most groundwater samples fig 5a shows an excess of sodium relative to the na cl marine ratio reflecting na release in solution through interaction of groundwater with silicate minerals of the aquifer matrix only pz12 has an excess of chloride compared to the na cl ratio of the seawater dilution line which may indicate anthropogenic input of cl both na and cl concentrations being higher than in the other samples manure and sewage effluents are known to be rich in cl kloppmann 2003 and kcl is used as fertilizers or road salts the no3 cl ratios of manure and sewage are generally lower than in mineral fertilizers and can thus help distinguishing various anthropogenic sources lu et al 2015 moreover the no3 cl ratio may indicate a dilution effect versus nitrate removal through denitrification as cl behaves conservatively chen et al 2009 widory et al 2013 fig 5b shows no3 vs cl concentrations part of the groundwater samples with the highest nitrate concentrations spring pz7 pz3 pz2 and pz1 defining a straight line correlating no3 and cl concentrations trend 1 fig 5b suggesting a common origin of both elements i e that at least part of the cl is anthropogenic for the spring and pz7 that were sampled during both sampling campaigns no3 and cl concentrations decrease jointly between the two sampling periods confirming this hypothesis pz12 with high no3 concentrations 75 80 mg l 1 has a different no3 cl ratio with a higher cl proportion this may reflect a different anthropogenic source with a lower no3 cl than previous samples which could be related to manure input trend 2 fig 5b note that as pz12 is no longer accessible it was not possible to resample this well during the 2nd period fig 5b also shows groundwater samples that clearly differ from the previous group with similar cl but lower no3 concentrations two sub groups occur a first one with no3 20 mg l 1 and cl 40 mg l 1 pz4 pz5 pz9 sr1 which may result from nitrate loss through denitrification or even no nitrate input note that cl concentrations are in the range 40 75 mg l 1 except pz9 sampled in april 2017 with 18 mg l 1 the second sub group shows intermediate nitrate concentrations 30 50 mg l 1 in pz6 and pz10 and one sr1 sample at 60 m depth in november 2009 together with cl ranging from 40 to 75 mg l 1 such characteristics may result from two distinct scenarios 1 partial denitrification in water with similar cl and higher no3 concentrations i e similar to the spring signature or 2 mixing between a groundwater component with an anthropogenic impact similar to that described for pz12 and a groundwater component with low no3 and low cl typical of recharge by rainwater finally the pz8 groundwater samples have no3 and cl concentrations that strongly decreased between the two sampling periods in the same proportions that were observed for the spring group moreover the 2018 samples which have similar cl concentrations have no3 concentrations that decrease with the sampling depth reflecting a stratification of the local groundwater to summarize the joint decrease of no3 and cl concentrations between the two sampling periods could result from a positive impact of the mitigation measures applied on the catchment since about two decades while a net decrease of nitrate alone should result from a chemical microbiological process like denitrification 4 3 evidence of denitrification processes based on n and o isotopes of no3 microbiology and molecular approaches denitrification leads to a decrease or even disappearance below the analytical quantification limit of nitrate concentrations in groundwater denitrification by oxidation of pyrite has been identified as an important denitrification pathway in the brittany basement rock aquifers where pyrite is abundant pauwels et al 2000 pyrite oxidation releases dissolved sulphate in solution except for samples pz5 and pz9 discussed later fig 6 shows an overall trend of increasing sulphate content when the nitrate content decreases which is typically the case for sr1 samples pz8 samples were sampled at various depths and over both sampling periods they had the highest so4 concentrations and medium to low no3 concentrations even pz6 samples could indicate denitrification through pyrite oxidation note that pyrite was observed in fractures of the sandstone and pelite during drilling of pz6 and pz8 in the spring and pz7 samples while nitrate concentrations dropped significantly between the two sampling periods there was no significant increase in sulphate contents the dual approach of n and o isotopes of nitrate was applied to a selection of samples from each major group defined above fig 5b among these samples from april 2017 ten were analysed to determine their no3 isotopic compositions table s2 supplementary material note that the three samples from borehole sr1 could not be isotopically analysed because nitrate concentrations were below the quantification limit the δ15n no3 isotopic ratios of all samples ranged from 7 to 17 with nitrate concentrations ranging from 1 to 74 mg l 1 in pz5 and pz3 respectively for the samples with the highest nitrate concentrations the spring and pz7 had a δ15n no3 of 7 7 5 that could reflect a mixed influence of mineral and organic fertilizers while pz3 with a δ15n no3 of 10 8 appears to be more influenced by organic fertilizer nitrate input fig 7 both types of fertilizer being used in the catchment fig 7 also shows that with the exception of pz5 and pz9 the samples present an increasing δ15n no3 when no3 concentrations decrease which is a typical trend of denitrification according to the rayleigh model here we chose to apply a denitrification model starting from the sample signatures with the highest nitrate concentration and assumed not to be impacted by denitrification as shown by their chemical composition the denitrification model is thus based on the signature of spring and pz7 samples δ15n no3 7 no3 62 mg l 1 with an enrichment factor ε 5 it explains a partial denitrification for samples pz6 pz10 and pz8 at different depths as these samples plot along the calculated denitrification curve fig 7 the relatively low ε value 5 is similar to the one found by pauwels et al 2000 in the deep aquifer of the pyrite bearing brioverian schist at the naizin site se brittany and suggests a relatively rapid denitrification process mariotti et al 1988 in full agreement with the results of pauwels et al 1998 in the same area note that a low ε value 4 was further confirmed in the same site during an artificial tracer test along a fracture in the pyrite bearing brioverian schist basement petelet giraud et al 2017 all isotopic data of the april 2017 sampling campaign are shown in fig 8 coupling δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 firstly it should be noted that the original δ18o no3 isotope signature of synthetic mineral fertilizers δ18o no3 20 is not found in groundwater samples even before any denitrification spring and pz7 samples the initial 18o isotopic signature seems to have been lost due to immobilization and mineralization processes of nitrogen in the soil mengis et al 2001 sebilo et al 2013 among the three oxygen atoms associated with nitrogen of the newly formed no3 two come from local water and one from atmospheric o2 δ18o o2 23 eq 1 the isotopic signature of the local groundwater can be approximated using the mean isotopic signature of the local rainfall weighted average of the precipitation amounts according to the french national map by millot et al 2010 the local groundwater signature is estimated to be δ18o h2o 6 according to eq 1 the theoretical δ 18 o value of the newly formed nitrate in the soil is thus δ18o no3 4 which agrees with the measured values of the spring and pz7 samples 4 1 and 4 6 respectively and considering an analytical accuracy of 0 5 the dual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopic approach confirms a denitrification process for several samples with a joint increase in the δ15n and δ18o isotopic ratios of the residual nitrate fig 8 the slope of the relation between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 for the samples undergoing denitrification is 0 78 r2 0 85 indicative of denitrification activity aravena and robertson 1998 in more details samples can plot along a 0 5 slope e g pz6 and along a 1 slope e g pz8 14 compilation of a large number of environmental studies showed that denitrification increases δ18o and δ15n in a ratio of about 0 5 which corresponds to a 15nε about twice as large as 18oε mengis et al 1999 a lower slope between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 of nearly 0 5 was also reported from field studies and another of nearly 1 0 from laboratory studies otero et al 2009 critchley et al 2014 margalef marti et al 2019 ceballos et al 2020 the main hypothesis now recognized for this flatter slope in field data sets compared to that in laboratory data is the oxidation of the intermediates products no2 and or nh4 to no3 granger and wankel 2016 margalef marti et al 2019 while a direct no2 reduction to gaseous n products might lead to values close to the theoretical 1 1 line thus it is generally accepted that when isotopic nitrate data plot along a slope from 0 5 to 1 the trend can be interpreted as a denitrification process samples pz6 pz10 and the three pz8 samples 14 16 and 18 m deep are clearly marked by a denitrification with an alignment describing a slope between 0 5 and 1 fig 8 in addition pz6 and pz10 samples show dissolved n2o intermediate denitrification product depending on the sampling campaigns at concentrations that can reach 200 μg l 1 it should be noted that pz3 although in the same alignment is not affected by denitrification but rather by a different source of nitrate more organic in this case fig 7 and fig 8 with the highest no3 concentration measured during the study pz5 and pz9 with low nitrate contents and low sulphate contents and have δ15n no3 isotope signatures that do not indicate any denitrification isotopic analyses thus suggested a microbial nitrate reduction activity in some piezometers i e pz6 pz8 and pz10 but not all the piezometers in the catchment in water samples of 2017 the relative abundance of copies of narg and napa genes encoding nitrate reductases involved in nitrate reduction by denitrifying bacteria was higher in pz6 pz8 and pz10 than in other piezometers such as pz3 pz5 and pz7 for which isotopic investigation suggested no nitrate reduction fig 9 a and b results obtained from isotopic investigation and molecular analyses agree showing higher nitrate reductase gene abundances in piezometers where nitrate reduction was highlighted by isotopic signatures abundance of gene copies was also assessed over a period of two years through the four sampling campaigns including april 2017 revealing the presence of both narg and napa genes in all piezometers of the catchment thus showing a potential for microbial nitrate reduction in all studied piezometers of the plourhan site data not shown spatio temporal variations in gene abundance were highlighted according to the sampling time and location this agrees with earlier results that showed a temporal variation in the abundance of denitrification genes in groundwater and a wide ranging spatial distribution of these genes in a single catchment hernández del amo et al 2018 to complete the isotopic and molecular approaches for nitrate reduction characterization in samples collected in april 2017 the potential nitrate reduction activity of microbial communities sampled from several piezometers was measured in batch experiments run under standardized conditions for denitrification nitrate reduction activity was found in all the tested wells fig 9c this agrees with the quantification of functional genes that were also detected albeit at different relative abundances in all piezometers fig 9 a and b showing a spatially widespread potential of the groundwater microbial communities for reducing nitrate these results agree with earlier work showing the wide distribution of microbial communities involved in denitrification in groundwater hernández del amo et al 2018 batch experiments showed a high heterogeneity among the piezometers as nitrate reduction rates can be high pz7 and pz10 or low pz6 and pz9 they also showed that the complete denitrification pathway occurred as nitrite no2 and n2o were detected as well data not shown this strongly suggested that a complete denitrification can occur in the different groundwater of the catchment provided that in situ conditions are favourable intermediate and high potential nitrate reduction rates found in batch experiments for pz8 at two depths and pz10 respectively agree with the denitrification activity showed by isotopic data and the narg and napa genes abundance results found for these piezometers the low potential nitrate reductase activities found for pz9 and sr1 also agree with the isotopic results suggesting no denitrification for pz9 the results were inconclusive for sr1 as the nitrate concentration was too low and because of the low abundance of genes encoding the nitrate reductase enzymes the results from the batch experiments for these four waters thus agreed with the isotopic and molecular approaches however no relation was found for the other piezometers for pz3 and pz7 intermediate to high activity was measured in batch experiments but isotopic and molecular approaches both suggested a low nitrate reduction potential for pz6 whereas the isotopic and molecular approaches suggested nitrate reduction activity and a potential for such activity respectively batch experiments only showed a weak nitrate reduction potential these differences could be due to unsuitable in situ conditions for denitrification compared to batch experiments in the case where batch experiments showed a high potential but no nitrate reduction was detected using isotopes another explanation might be that the in situ nitrate reduction shown by isotopic work is actually ancient explaining why only a weak activity was detected in batch experiments therefore according to geochemistry isotopic tools and or biomolecular characterization the pz5 pz9 and sr1 wells highlight different water origins and or mechanisms than in other piezometers this is further investigated in the following section 4 4 groundwater residence time assessment cfcs sf6 and noble dissolved gases dissolved gases cfcs and sf6 were analysed during the two sampling periods 2009 2011 and 2016 2018 to assess the groundwater residence time and the local aquifer dynamics table s3 supplementary material in this type of aquifer the exponential model reflecting a diffuse recharge at the catchment scale resulting in a mixture of old and young groundwater components at the outlet generally is the most appropriate one here however the binary mixing model that mixes different reservoirs could be also suitable for reflecting the structure of the basement aquifer consisting of fractured bedrock overlain by a weathered layer the spring samples appear to be systematically contaminated with cfc 11 and cfc 12 howerever as cfcs have been used worldwide in a wide range of activities this type of contamination is common near urban areas or landfills höhener et al 2003 and both tracers are unsuitable for dating purposes only cfc 113 and sf6 can be used thus increasing the uncertainty associated with estimating a mean residence time according to the chemical characteristics of the spring water and its relative stability during the year groundwater dating tracers are interpreted with exponential model based on these two tracers the mean τ value characteristic time needed for the two thirds renewal of the aquifer water according to the exponential model of the spring waters is about 20 5 years for the other piezometers pz and borehole sr1 in the catchment area different groups can be used a first group of samples is marked by lower recharge temperatures than the present day one of 11 12 c in brittany ayraud et al 2008 the noble gas concentrations ar and ne fig 10 measured in the sr1 borehole showed a recharge temperature of around 3 4 c i e 7 to 9 c lower than the present day one indicating the presence of old groundwater in the system that could be related to the last glaciation period of 19 to 17 ky aquilina et al 2015 in addition the cfc and sf6 measurements also indicate a long residence time mean 230 40 yr using an exponential model with a possible contribution of a recent component not exceeding 10 that may reflect water inflow resulting from the pumping for groundwater sampling fig 11 this recent component contained nitrate in some sr1 samples from the first sampling period 2009 with no3 reaching 38 mg l 1 at 60 m depth versus 3 7 mg l 1 at 110 m depth in addition during the second sampling period 2017 2018 an excess of 50 to 100 dissolved n2 was determined compared to ne and ar concentrations with concentrations reaching 1 2 10 3 to 1 4 10 3 mol l 1 compared to 7 10 4 to 8 10 4 mol l 1 in the spring samples this may be a result from the denitrification of the incoming nitrate no no3 being detected lq during the second sampling period in a second location pz5 tapping the saprolite and the upper part of the fractured amphibolite noble gas analyses n 2 fig 10 also showed a low recharge temperature of around 6 c while no nitrate was detected during the first sampling period about 1 mg l 1 was measured during the second sampling period which could corroborate the cfc sf6 analyses indicating between 70 and 85 of old water i e cfc sf6 free and thus a small contribution of recent water possibly enriched in nitrate fig 11 above we also pointed out a relatively high cl concentration of up to 72 mg l 1 i e the highest concentration in the studied area except pz12 with both high cl and no3 concentrations an anthropogenic cl contribution is unlikely as there is no nitrate and no denitrification process was detected pz5 samples are the only ones with a na cl ratio close to that of seawater fig 5a combining the low recharge temperature the absence of nitrate and the relatively high cl concentration considered to be natural this sampling point could reflect the legacy of marine transgressions over the past 5 millions years armandine les landes et al 2015 considered that cl of marine origin not supplied by precipitation 40 mg l 1 is likely related to marine transgressions that flooded the armorican massif since the messinian the large quantities of cl injected during each transgression were then diluted by meteoric recharge after the end of the transgression period this includes recharge during the last glaciation shown by a low recharge temperature indicated by noble gases in pz5 at 18 m depth the water comes from the upper part of the amphibolite basement and from the lower part of the overlying weathered material this old water preserved from anthropogenic impact is disconnected from the groundwater feeding the spring about 500 m distant relatively disconnected from present day recharge and only remobilized by pumping for sampling a second group represented by pz9 has a long mean residence time of over 60 years fig 11 with a large proportion 80 90 of old water and no cfc sf6 but no evidence of low recharge temperatures these waters thus appear to be younger than the ones of pz5 and sr1 but old enough not to have received anthropogenic nitrate the other groundwater samples have apparent ages of about 30 years such as pz10 and pz3 pz6 shows a variability between the two samples analysed for dating purposes this can reflect mixing in various proportions between old and present day waters fig 11 according to the period of the hydrological cycle the apparent age being slightly older in may 2018 than in october 2017 this variability was also observed for the major elements which is typical of the sandstone and pelite aquifer that has different aquifer dynamics than the amphibolite aquifer pz7 has a high sf6 contamination based on the other tracers the waters could correspond to a mixing between a large proportion of recent water 70 80 and a 30 40 years old water such different groundwater residence times are known from other parts of brittany evidence of past climatic and geological event was found in groundwater from lanleff monitoring station 10 km west of plourhan armandine les landes et al 2015 and in various other parts of brittany by aquilina et al 2015 most shallow groundwater at a regional scale however is strongly impacted by anthropogenic activity and has mean apparent residence times of 10 to 30 years ayraud et al 2008 all earlier studies studied different regions which raises questions about the functioning and connectivity of the aquifer systems studied questions that might be answered by detailed geological studies of the sites 5 conclusions and perspectives the plourhan catchment 100 ha contains a main spring that still exceeds the limit of 50 mg l no3 despite the numerous remedial measures implemented since the 1990s we investigated the catchment with complementary and robust geological and hydrogeological approaches better to constrain the driving parameters of nitrate transfer and distribution in groundwater and thus to improve our understanding of how the hydrosystem functions first geochemical water sampling over about 10 years showed a quite high variability in groundwater quality 1 a temporal variability especially regarding nitrate and 2 a spatial variability despite the small size of the catchment though a link with agricultural practices and land use is one of the key factors controlling nitrate fate in groundwater other factors must be considered as well such as the hydro biochemical functioning of the aquifer system which can also largely control water quality secondly the study of nitrate isotopes n and o clearly demonstrated denitrification in some piezometers of the catchment area such processes were generally demonstrated by microbiology and molecular biology studies highlighting the presence of functional genes involved in denitrification as well as the capacity of the groundwater microbial community for denitrifying when in situ anoxic and or nutritive conditions are favourable other groundwater samples had low nitrate contents even below the quantification limit without any denitrification process occurring study of the average groundwater residence time based on dissolved cfcs and sf6 and on rare gases locally discovered old waters particularly in nitrate free piezometers demonstrating that such waters never received any anthropogenic nitrate one piezometer contained old water with a recharge temperature well below the current average temperature in the area reflecting water from the last glaciation period 19 to 17 ky third the presence of such very old groundwater in the catchment area raises questions about the structure of the aquifer system at the scale of the recharge area the detailed geological and geophysical work especially with electric tomography profiles led to improvement of the local structural model a large number of compartments delimited by faults was shown to exist as was a highly variable thickness of soil and weathered rock in the study area this better undestanding of the geological structure has shown the heterogeneity of the hydrosystem where some compartments appear to be disconnected from the general groundwater flow this may explain the presence of old residual groundwater not affected by the agricultural activity in the catchment the plourhan site has shown the relevance and necessity of using an integrated approach for significantly improving our knowledge in terms of the functioning of complex hydrosystems such as basement ones and its impact on groundwater quality this approach can be advantageously applied to other sites especially in basement domains where denitrification processes can deeply modify the local water quality and where the geological structure may be quite complex the various methods of such an approach can be implemented independently and successively steered by gradually improving knowledge or in a coupled manner as done here the understanding of hydrodynamic functioning sensulato is as important as that of nitrate reduction both are paramount for implementing the most relevant programmes of measures as required by the european water framework directive fifth wfd and fd

1417,nitrate contamination of groundwater remains a major concern despite all the measures and efforts undertaken over the last decades to protect water resources we focused on a small catchment in brittany france facing nitrate pollution with concentrations over the european drinking water standard of 50 mg l 1 this is a common situation in catchments where supposedly effective measures were applied for reducing the transfer of n to groundwater at the scale of this small 100 ha basement aquifer nitrate concentrations are very heterogeneous in the groundwater sampled up to 15 20 m below the soil surface in several observation wells hereafter referred as piezometers and up to 110 m deep in a borehole drilled through a faulted area near the spring outlet of the catchment we used complementary and robust approaches for exploring and constraining the driving parameters of nitrate transfer and distribution in groundwater detailed geological work and a geophysical electrical resistivity tomography survey identified the lithologies tectonic structures and weathering layers this highlighted a complex geological structure with several compartments delimited by faults as well as the highly variable thickness of the weathered layer it also illustrated the heterogeneity of the hydrosystem some compartments appearing to be disconnected from the general groundwater flow this was confirmed by geochemical analyses and by the mean apparent groundwater residence time based on cfcs sf6 and noble gas analyses locally revealing old and nitrate free groundwater and very old water with a recharge temperature below than the current average temperature in the area reflecting water dating back to the last period of glaciation 19 to 17 ky nitrate isotopes clearly showed denitrification processes in a few piezometers which was generally supported by microbiology and molecular biology results this highlighted the presence of functional genes involved in denitrification as well as a capacity of the groundwater microbial community to denitrify when in situ conditions are favourable this type of combined approach covering chemistry isotopic methods dissolved gases

european commission 2000 and its daughter directive 2006 118 ec european commission 2006 in addition to agronomic measures a key issue is to arrive at better understanding the driving parameters of nitrate transfer towards and distribution in groundwater i e the geological structures and the hydrogeological functioning the correlation between an increased use of synthetic and organic fertilizers and the increase of nitrate concentrations in groundwater has been known for a long time e g aquilina et al 2012 but uncertainties remain concerning the transit time between topsoil and aquifer in particular the immobilization remobilization processes of n governing nitrogen cycling and nitrate transfer through soil are still poorly constrained in terms of delay effect sebilo et al 2013 who investigated the fate of a single application of an isotopically labelled nitrogen fertilizers for three decades in an experimental field concluded that attempts for reducing agricultural nitrate contamination of aquatic systems must consider the long term legacy of past applications of synthetic fertilizer and the nitrogen retention capacity of agricultural soils in addition to nitrogen retention and cycling processes in soil the n stock mainly nitrate in the unsaturated aquifer zone must be considered baran et al 2007 nitrate being highly soluble it is generally considered that it will transfer through the unsaturated zone towards groundwater at the same rate as infiltrating water this implies that a good understanding of the subsurface geology and its geometry as well as of the hydrogeological functioning of the aquifer system is essential as they at least partly govern pollutant transfer time at the catchment scale a proper understanding of the hydrogeological functioning can be obtained from groundwater residence time assessment using chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and sulphur hexafluoride sf6 gases for studying modern 60 yr groundwater dynamics and mixing processes these anthropogenic gases have been released into the atmosphere since the 1950s and are now found in natural waters with atmospheric equilibria that allow groundwater dating based on their atmospheric concentrations chronicles e g busenberg and plummer 1992 ayraud et al 2008 aeschbach hertig and solomon 2013 chatton et al 2016 furthermore part of the n can leave the nitrogen cycle as gases n2o and n2 resulting from denitrification governed by heterotrophic or autotrophic denitrifying bacteria transforming no3 to n2 stein and klotz 2016 this process affects the global n budget especially the nitrate one and must be considered as a major process when evaluating of the fate of n from soil to groundwater nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are frequently used as tracers of nitrate sources in groundwater as the various synthetic organic n fertilizers have different isotopic compositions kendall et al 2007 however nitrate isotopes also are ideal tools for tracing n transformation processes such as denitrification böttcher et al 1990 as no3 reduction to n2 is a highly fractionating process kendall and aravena 2000 leading to a joint increase of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 whereas simple dilution also leading to a decrease in no3 concentration does not modify the isotopic signatures we designed and implemented an innovative interdisciplinary study coupling complementary and robust approaches for defining the spatio temporal nitrate distribution in a small catchment of a basement rock aquifer for that purpose we had to answer the following questions 1 how is groundwater quality especially for nitrate controlled spatially and temporarily by natural water rock interactions and by anthropogenic input related to agricultural practises and its evolution over the past decades hydrogeological geophysical and chemical approaches 2 what are the nitrate sources and their potential attenuation as shown by n and o isotopes of no3 fingerprinting and through assessing the denitrification potential by monitoring nitrate reducing bacteria genes isotopic and microbiological approaches 3 what is the groundwater residence time distribution in order to evaluate the hydrodynamics and the potential spatial variability of the aquifer and as a supplementary constraint to support the hypothesis regarding the chemical and isotopic compositions cfc sf6 and rare dissolved gases approach 2 site description the plourhan site we studied is a small 1 26 km2 hydrogeological catchment in 2006 a potentiometric map was drawn for resource protection purposes relying on different hydrogeological approaches such as the drilling of 12 piezometers and a deep borehole it is located 10 km from the coast in brittany northwest france geologically it is underlain by brioverian basement composed of metasedimentary pelite and sandstone and amphibolite both overlain by an 8 to 20 m thick saprolite layer the basement that can be highly fractured especially the amphibolite a major fault forms the boundary between metasediments and amphibolite with a potentially wide fracture zone fig 1 this description based on the 1 50 000 scale geological map was not precise enough in view of the small catchment size for this reason a detailed geological survey of the catchment was part of this study as was a geophysical survey providing a better definition of the detailed geology and its geometry see supplementary material in addition a pedological study carried out during delineation of the area to be protected showed relative soil uniformity of the site the soil is brown and moderately deep 40 cm on average in the east of the site and about 80 cm in the southwest under the forest to the northwest a particular pedogenesis is observed the soil being pseudo gley a natural spring emerges near the major fault and has been exploited since 1968 via a 4 4 m deep borehole that taps the water coming from the saprolite layer this spring hereafter referred to as spring feeds a small stream that exits the basin to the east in 2006 12 piezometers pz1 to pz12 between 10 and 22 m depth were drilled mainly for delineating the catchment in these piezometers the groundwater level is few metres below the soil level bsl they are screened all along the weathered layer down to the top of the fresh basement the saturated zone is only a few metres thick a few measurements before our study showed strong heterogeneity of the groundwater quality monthly monitored water levels between october 2006 and march 2008 were used for drawing potentiometric maps thus defining the hydrogeological contours of the catchment and identifying flow directions fig 1 not surprisingly the hydrological and topographic catchments have different boundaries thus for the piezometers accessible during this study pz3 6 and 8 are located upstream respectively south and north of the spring while pz5 and pz9 are located in the middle of the catchment the others pz10 and pz7 lie outside the catchment in addition to these 12 piezometers tapping water in the saprolite a deep borehole sr1 drilled at about 30 m from the natural spring within the fault zone has a total depth of 133 m it is screened below 50 m bsl and intersected paragneiss and metamorphic sandstone and pelite the water supply for the 2000 inhabitants is based on the water pumped from the spring fig 1 which must be diluted in order to fulfil the drinking water quality standards for nitrate indeed the spring has nitrate concentrations exceeding the 50 mg l drinking water standard and the dilution takes place at the treatment plant with water from another borehole a protection area for the groundwater catchment was administratively defined in 2010 along parcel boundaries it specified the regulation of agricultural land use maintaining plots in forest or meadow areas and plots where annual crops were allowed with specific agronomic recommendations as of 2013 annual crops were no longer allowed and were replaced by meadows fig 2 historically the studied site has been subject to strong agricultural pressure from 1980 to 1990 vegetable production dominated in the mid 1990s land use was mainly dedicated to market gardening with a significant surface for peas potatoes and cauliflower from the mid 1990s to the present in an effort to improve groundwater quality farmers significantly reduced the vegetable areas fig 2 compensated by an increase in wheat maize and especially grass despite these efforts nitrate concentrations in spring water only decreased slowly and still remain above the 50 mg l standard fig 2 in the area historically and until recently nitrogen was applied in both mineral and organic form depending on the cultivated plot detailed information is not available but it is known that in 2014 in the protection area four of the seven farms produced animal excrements cattle pigs poultry and five had plots on which animal excrements green waste compost and or household waste were spread côtes d armor chamber of agriculture 2014 a detailed knowledge of land use allows addressing the issue of why groundwater quality is spatially heterogeneous such groundwater catchment is representative of lithology basement soil and climate of france and western europe 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling strategy the study site was monitored for two distinct periods the spring was sampled on a monthly basis from august 2009 to june 2010 10 campaigns 1st period and from october 2016 to july 2019 28 campaigns 2nd period whereas piezometers were only sampled twice and four times during the 1st and 2nd periods respectively it should be noted that some piezometers were no longer accessible during the 2nd period prior to sampling several field parameters were measured including electrical conductivity ph redox and oxygen content table s1 supplementary material major ions were analysed for all samples microbiological parameters were measured in each samples from the 2nd period as was groundwater dating isotopic investigations only concerned samples from april 2017 3 2 chemical and isotopic investigations 3 2 1 analytical methods for both sampling periods the groundwater samples were collected in polyethylene bottles and filtered through 0 45 μm pvdf filters for chemical and nitrate isotopes analysis bottles dedicated to cation analysis were acidified with 15 n ultrapure hno3 to ph 2 physicochemical parameters of each sample were measured on site including the electrical conductivity ec standardized to 25 c water temperature ph dissolved oxygen o2 diss and redox potential eh samples were stored at 4 c in the dark prior to analysis this took place in the brgm laboratories by icp aes ca na k mg uncertainty 10 ion chromatography cl so4 no3 uncertainty 10 and titration method according to n en iso 9963 1 hco3 co3 2 uncertainty 5 both δ15n and δ18o of no3 were measured by the agno3 method at brgm according to the following procedure the filtered water is chemically purified through cationic and anionic ion exchange columns nitrate is recovered as hno3 by hcl elution the eluate is converted to agno3 by addition of silver oxide ag2o hcl hno3 ag2o agcl s agno3 h2o the filtrate containing the nitrate once freed from the other oxygenated compounds by adding bacl2 is lyophilized to obtain solid agno3 chang et al 1999 silva et al 2000 the solid agno3 precipitate is then weighed into silver capsules that are inserted separately into a furnace composed of a glassy carbon reactor heated to 1450 c the n2 and co gases resulting from high temperature combustion are driven by a helium flow to a chromatographic column this separates the gas peaks before their introduction into the source of the mass spectrometer for determining the nitrate δ18o and δ15n isotopic ratios the analytical accuracy is 0 5 for δ15n and δ18o water samples for chlorofluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride cfcs and sf6 analyses were collected in stainless steel ampoules 40 ml and 300 ml respectively after rinsing them with at least three times the sample volume without any contact with atmospheric air during sampling the cfcs and sf6 concentrations used for calculating the groundwater residence times were measured using a gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector gc ecd labasque et al 2014 ayraud et al 2008 at the plateforme condate eau osur university of rennes 1 france for the 2nd period the concentrations of cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 were measured with an analytical uncertainty of 1 and the sf6 with an uncertainty of 5 labasque et al 2006 ayraud et al 2008 gas concentrations were used for calculating atmospheric mixing ratios pptv and compared to the atmospheric evolution curve noaa hats program to determine the apparent groundwater piston age for each sampling point three hypothetical lump parametric models a piston flow model pfm an exponential model em and a binary mixing model bmm were systematically tested to determine the apparent groundwater residence time matoszewski and zuber 1996 the overall uncertainty of derived groundwater age estimates including sampling biases and analytical errors as well as the errors resulting from uncertainty of the recharge temperature and considering dispersion adsorption effects is estimated to be 3 years labasque et al 2014 for the 1st sampling period 2009 2011 a simplified sample collection method was used iaea 2006 the analyses were made by spurenstofflabor at wachenheim germany using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector after pre concentration using the purge and trap technique the detection limit was 10 4 pmol allowing the measurement of cfc concentrations down to 0 01 pmol l 1 and of sf6 concentrations to 0 1 fmol l 1 reproducibility was about 5 for water samples major and noble gases were measured throughout the sampling campaign using a gc tcd cg 3000 sra instrument after headspace extraction with a he gas phase following the sugisaki and taki 1987 the analytical error for ne and ar n2 measurements was 3 and 2 respectively the analysis of ne ar ratios allows calculating excess air and recharge temperatures heaton and vogel 1981 3 2 2 n and o isotopes of nitrate theoretical background since the 2000s nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrates δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are used for tracing nitrate sources in surface and groundwaters widory et al 2005 2013 kendall et al 2007 fenech et al 2012 puig et al 2017 nevertheless n sources discrimination is often not straightforward as nitrate is not a conservative molecule and thus the n transformation process has to be considered for properly tracing n sources n and o isotopes are also valuable tracers for better constraining the n cycle from soil to groundwater i e immobilization mineralization nitrification and denitrification these different processes may thus lead to a loss of the original δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopic signatures through isotopic fractionation zhang et al 2019 however such isotopic fractionations is an excellent tool for identifying these processes and thus for better constraining n mobility denitrification by oxidation of pyrite fes2 i e during chemoautotrophic respiration of sulphur oxidizing thiobacillus denitrificans has been identified as an important denitrification pathway in basement aquifers where pyrite is abundant pauwels et al 2000 note that aquilina et al 2018 suggested another type of autotrophic denitrification biotite dissolution with the oxidation of fe ii contained in biotite denitrification is a highly fractionating process böttcher et al 1990 kendall and aravena 2000 following a rayleigh distillation model leading to a joint increase of the isotope ratios δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of the residual no3 the n cycle in soil further modifies the isotopic signature of the nitrate leached out and transported towards groundwater mengis et al 2001 sebilo et al 2013 the newly formed nitrate through ammonium nitrification is generally assumed to take nitrogen from nh4 and or no2 while one oxygen comes from atmospheric o2 and two from water h2o considering a simple stoichiometric relationship eq 1 kumar et al 1983 kendall 1998 and references therein note that buchwald and casciotti 2010 added constraints to this simple model considering oxygen isotope exchanges of intermediate species with ambient water during nitrite oxidation corresponding to the final step of nitrification process δ 18 o no 3 ⅔ δ

measurements of nitrate reductase encoding genes narg and napa copies in november 2016 april and october 2017 and may 2018 water 6 l was collected from each piezometer and filtered 0 22 μm to collect biomass microbial dna was extracted from the filters using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa according to manufacturer s recommendations with a fastprep 24 at a speed of 5 m s 1 during 30 s and quantified with a quantifluor dsdna sample kit and the quantus fluorimeter according to the manufacturer s instructions promega usa the abundances of narg and napa gene copies was determined by real time quantitative pcr qpcr according to bru et al 2007 in order to assess potential denitrification activity batch experiments were run on waters sampled in april 2017 in the pz3 pz6 pz8 pz9 and pz10 piezometers briefly duplicate 300 ml flasks were filled in with 150 ml of water under anaerobic conditions nitrogen atmosphere acetate c2h3nao2 was added as a carbon source in each flask at a final concentration of 100 mg l considering nitrate concentration in each well nitrate was added to the flasks to reach a final no3 concentration of 100 mg l abiotic tests in the presence of sodium azide cabrol et al 2017 were also performed the flasks were incubated for 20 days in the dark at 25 c under stirring 100 rpm every 4 to 5 days 8 ml of water was sampled for nitrate nitrite and acetate quantification and 5 ml of the gas phase was sampled for n2o analysis nitrate and acetate were quantified by ionic chromatography dionex ic3000 sp eg dc system equipped with an as50 autosampler and a conductimetric detector according to the nf en iso 10304 1 2009 method nitrite was analysed by colorimetry according to the nf iso 15923 1 2014 method n2o was analysed by gas chromatography varian cp 3800 gc equipped with a gas injection valve and an electron capture detector for statistical analysis boxplots were calculated using r4 0 1 and rstudio n 2 data were analysed by the non parametric kruskal wallis test p 0 05 4 results and discussions 4 1 improving the hydrogeological model geological investigations consisted in accurately identifying the rock types tectonic structures and degree of weathering in order to refine the geological map at the scale of this small catchment and to better understand the hydrogeological functioning this field work confirmed that the catchment is located on a brioverian anticlinal axis oriented n100 110 intersected by faults oriented n150 sub n s and n050 the weathering profile forms a paleosurface at an altitude of about 80 m above mean sealevel and seems to be affected by faulting geophysical results showed major horizontal resistivity contrasts with two distinct domains separated by a significant vertical discontinuity f5 fig s1 supplementary material the western resistive domain corresponds to amphibolite while the conductive eastern unit corresponds to metamorphic sandstone and pelite egal et al 1996 fig 1 and 3a to the west a vertical resistivity gradient is interpreted as a signature of the amphibolite weathering profile consisting of alterite c0 fig s1 at the top followed by a fractured layer r1 and fresh basement rock r2 these results are coherent with those observed in other basement contexts dewandel et al 2006 belle et al 2019 comte et al 2012 in the sandstone and pelite domain despite the complexity of the electrical pattern the sr1 geological log distinguishes the alterite from the sandstone and pelite c1 c2 fig s1 that overlie a highly conductive c3 paragneiss derived from the sandstone and pelite forming a metamorphic halo egal et al 1995 and being an aquifer formation this suggests that the high conductivity values observed are caused by strong and connected fracturing of the rock and thus that the paragneiss is the main aquifer formation of the catchment the amphibolite seems more impermeable than the sandstone and pelite and the alterite forms a surface aquifer fig 3 further details are presented in the supplementary material to complete the geological and geophysical investigations and improve preliminary conclusions chemical data were examined fig 4 the total mineralization of the water can be assessed through its electrical conductivity ec μs cm 1 and the total dissolved solids tds mg l 1 both parameters being correlated the tds values of the spring samples natural outlet of the hydrogeological system show small variations over the two sampling periods 205 257 mg l 1 as do most groundwater samples within the catchment 182 235 mg l 1 pz1 pz2 pz3 pz4 pz7 pz9 and pz10 nevertheless four groundwater samples pz6 pz8 pz12 and sr1 have clearly higher tds values ranging between 274 and 675 mg l 1 varying both throughout the sampling periods and according to the sampling depth fig 4b groundwater presents very heterogeneous chemical types at this small catchment scale from ca hco3 to ca so4 cation proportions vary between a sodic end member 50 na k in pz10 and a calcic end member up to 60 ca in pz6 and pz8 fig 4a when comparing the revised structural scheme fig 3 and the geochemical data it appears that samples with the higher calcium concentrations i e pz6 pz8 pz12 and sr1 which also have the highest tds reflect water rock interactions with the weathered sandstone and pelite compartment the other samples with low tds values and lower calcium concentrations seems to results from water rock interaction with the weathered amphibolite compartment this chemical variability also reflects the complex geological settings of this small area only 0 6 km2 in terms of both weathering profile and geological entities it is worth noting that water in the deep borehole sr1 has an increasing ca load with depth probably related to water rock interaction with fractured sandstone in addition pz4 and pz7 in the weathered sandstone and pelite compartment present geochemical signatures very similar to that of groundwater in the amphibolite compartment the geological and geophysical investigations allowed refining the contours of each geological formation on the 1 50 000 scale geological map these contours being coherent with the geochemical groundwater signatures howerver interrogations remain for some piezometers that are too far from the two geophysical profiles for making sufficiently reliable projections 4 2 temporal and spatial anthropogenic pressure a focus on nitrate as mentioned above despite all efforts made to reduce nitrogen transfer to groundwater nitrate concentrations only decrease slowly at the spring and remain above the 50 mg l 1 standard fig 2 the increase in no3 concentrations has stopped in the early 2000s reaching a plateau over five years before starting a decrease that continues today this type of evolution is typical of what is commonly observed in europe since the implementation of various programmes of measures for recovering a good chemical status of the groundwater bodies even though the response time can be quite different european commission 2018 this anthropogenic pressure is clearly shown in the small plourhan catchment where nitrate concentrations in groundwater can be as high as 88 mg l 1 pz1 oct 2009 however the nitrate concentrations in the piezometers sampled during the two sampling periods 2009 2010 and 2016 2018 showed quite different values from one piezometer to the next for instance the spring and pz7 showed a no3 decrease between the 1st and 2nd periods from 80 to 61 mg l 1 spring and from 77 to 62 mg l 1 pz7 fig 2 fig 5b table s1 supplementary material pz8 has the largest decrease in nitrate concentrations from 39 to 10 mg l 1 on average between the two sampling periods the temporal variations between 1st and 2nd periods are less pronounced for pz3 and pz6 most of the groundwater samples from piezometers pz5 and pz9 and borehole sr1 have nitrate concentrations below 10 mg l 1 fig 5a shows the sodium versus chloride concentrations in groundwater of the study area in the absence of evaporites in the local geological formations chloride may derive from atmospheric meybeck 1983 or anthropogenic agriculture wastewater effluents etc inputs and thus may have the same origin as nitrate significant amounts of chloride 80 mg l 1 were measured in many groundwaters of the brittany basement 80 m deep that were shown to be related to the last marine mio pliocene transgressions while shallow and modern groundwater has lower cl concentrations 50 mg l 1 aquilina et al 2015 in this study groundwater samples were taken at 10 to 22 m depth in the weathered layer and at the top of the basement except in the sr1 borehole that is 133 m deep the cl concentrations are generally less than 60 mg l 1 including in borehole sr1 only pz12 presents a clearly higher cl concentration of 140 mg l 1 two samples in 2009 as does pz5 with cl concentrations of 72 mg l 1 the specific case of pz5 is further discussed in section 4 3 for most groundwater samples fig 5a shows an excess of sodium relative to the na cl marine ratio reflecting na release in solution through interaction of groundwater with silicate minerals of the aquifer matrix only pz12 has an excess of chloride compared to the na cl ratio of the seawater dilution line which may indicate anthropogenic input of cl both na and cl concentrations being higher than in the other samples manure and sewage effluents are known to be rich in cl kloppmann 2003 and kcl is used as fertilizers or road salts the no3 cl ratios of manure and sewage are generally lower than in mineral fertilizers and can thus help distinguishing various anthropogenic sources lu et al 2015 moreover the no3 cl ratio may indicate a dilution effect versus nitrate removal through denitrification as cl behaves conservatively chen et al 2009 widory et al 2013 fig 5b shows no3 vs cl concentrations part of the groundwater samples with the highest nitrate concentrations spring pz7 pz3 pz2 and pz1 defining a straight line correlating no3 and cl concentrations trend 1 fig 5b suggesting a common origin of both elements i e that at least part of the cl is anthropogenic for the spring and pz7 that were sampled during both sampling campaigns no3 and cl concentrations decrease jointly between the two sampling periods confirming this hypothesis pz12 with high no3 concentrations 75 80 mg l 1 has a different no3 cl ratio with a higher cl proportion this may reflect a different anthropogenic source with a lower no3 cl than previous samples which could be related to manure input trend 2 fig 5b note that as pz12 is no longer accessible it was not possible to resample this well during the 2nd period fig 5b also shows groundwater samples that clearly differ from the previous group with similar cl but lower no3 concentrations two sub groups occur a first one with no3 20 mg l 1 and cl 40 mg l 1 pz4 pz5 pz9 sr1 which may result from nitrate loss through denitrification or even no nitrate input note that cl concentrations are in the range 40 75 mg l 1 except pz9 sampled in april 2017 with 18 mg l 1 the second sub group shows intermediate nitrate concentrations 30 50 mg l 1 in pz6 and pz10 and one sr1 sample at 60 m depth in november 2009 together with cl ranging from 40 to 75 mg l 1 such characteristics may result from two distinct scenarios 1 partial denitrification in water with similar cl and higher no3 concentrations i e similar to the spring signature or 2 mixing between a groundwater component with an anthropogenic impact similar to that described for pz12 and a groundwater component with low no3 and low cl typical of recharge by rainwater finally the pz8 groundwater samples have no3 and cl concentrations that strongly decreased between the two sampling periods in the same proportions that were observed for the spring group moreover the 2018 samples which have similar cl concentrations have no3 concentrations that decrease with the sampling depth reflecting a stratification of the local groundwater to summarize the joint decrease of no3 and cl concentrations between the two sampling periods could result from a positive impact of the mitigation measures applied on the catchment since about two decades while a net decrease of nitrate alone should result from a chemical microbiological process like denitrification 4 3 evidence of denitrification processes based on n and o isotopes of no3 microbiology and molecular approaches denitrification leads to a decrease or even disappearance below the analytical quantification limit of nitrate concentrations in groundwater denitrification by oxidation of pyrite has been identified as an important denitrification pathway in the brittany basement rock aquifers where pyrite is abundant pauwels et al 2000 pyrite oxidation releases dissolved sulphate in solution except for samples pz5 and pz9 discussed later fig 6 shows an overall trend of increasing sulphate content when the nitrate content decreases which is typically the case for sr1 samples pz8 samples were sampled at various depths and over both sampling periods they had the highest so4 concentrations and medium to low no3 concentrations even pz6 samples could indicate denitrification through pyrite oxidation note that pyrite was observed in fractures of the sandstone and pelite during drilling of pz6 and pz8 in the spring and pz7 samples while nitrate concentrations dropped significantly between the two sampling periods there was no significant increase in sulphate contents the dual approach of n and o isotopes of nitrate was applied to a selection of samples from each major group defined above fig 5b among these samples from april 2017 ten were analysed to determine their no3 isotopic compositions table s2 supplementary material note that the three samples from borehole sr1 could not be isotopically analysed because nitrate concentrations were below the quantification limit the δ15n no3 isotopic ratios of all samples ranged from 7 to 17 with nitrate concentrations ranging from 1 to 74 mg l 1 in pz5 and pz3 respectively for the samples with the highest nitrate concentrations the spring and pz7 had a δ15n no3 of 7 7 5 that could reflect a mixed influence of mineral and organic fertilizers while pz3 with a δ15n no3 of 10 8 appears to be more influenced by organic fertilizer nitrate input fig 7 both types of fertilizer being used in the catchment fig 7 also shows that with the exception of pz5 and pz9 the samples present an increasing δ15n no3 when no3 concentrations decrease which is a typical trend of denitrification according to the rayleigh model here we chose to apply a denitrification model starting from the sample signatures with the highest nitrate concentration and assumed not to be impacted by denitrification as shown by their chemical composition the denitrification model is thus based on the signature of spring and pz7 samples δ15n no3 7 no3 62 mg l 1 with an enrichment factor ε 5 it explains a partial denitrification for samples pz6 pz10 and pz8 at different depths as these samples plot along the calculated denitrification curve fig 7 the relatively low ε value 5 is similar to the one found by pauwels et al 2000 in the deep aquifer of the pyrite bearing brioverian schist at the naizin site se brittany and suggests a relatively rapid denitrification process mariotti et al 1988 in full agreement with the results of pauwels et al 1998 in the same area note that a low ε value 4 was further confirmed in the same site during an artificial tracer test along a fracture in the pyrite bearing brioverian schist basement petelet giraud et al 2017 all isotopic data of the april 2017 sampling campaign are shown in fig 8 coupling δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 firstly it should be noted that the original δ18o no3 isotope signature of synthetic mineral fertilizers δ18o no3 20 is not found in groundwater samples even before any denitrification spring and pz7 samples the initial 18o isotopic signature seems to have been lost due to immobilization and mineralization processes of nitrogen in the soil mengis et al 2001 sebilo et al 2013 among the three oxygen atoms associated with nitrogen of the newly formed no3 two come from local water and one from atmospheric o2 δ18o o2 23 eq 1 the isotopic signature of the local groundwater can be approximated using the mean isotopic signature of the local rainfall weighted average of the precipitation amounts according to the french national map by millot et al 2010 the local groundwater signature is estimated to be δ18o h2o 6 according to eq 1 the theoretical δ 18 o value of the newly formed nitrate in the soil is thus δ18o no3 4 which agrees with the measured values of the spring and pz7 samples 4 1 and 4 6 respectively and considering an analytical accuracy of 0 5 the dual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopic approach confirms a denitrification process for several samples with a joint increase in the δ15n and δ18o isotopic ratios of the residual nitrate fig 8 the slope of the relation between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 for the samples undergoing denitrification is 0 78 r2 0 85 indicative of denitrification activity aravena and robertson 1998 in more details samples can plot along a 0 5 slope e g pz6 and along a 1 slope e g pz8 14 compilation of a large number of environmental studies showed that denitrification increases δ18o and δ15n in a ratio of about 0 5 which corresponds to a 15nε about twice as large as 18oε mengis et al 1999 a lower slope between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 of nearly 0 5 was also reported from field studies and another of nearly 1 0 from laboratory studies otero et al 2009 critchley et al 2014 margalef marti et al 2019 ceballos et al 2020 the main hypothesis now recognized for this flatter slope in field data sets compared to that in laboratory data is the oxidation of the intermediates products no2 and or nh4 to no3 granger and wankel 2016 margalef marti et al 2019 while a direct no2 reduction to gaseous n products might lead to values close to the theoretical 1 1 line thus it is generally accepted that when isotopic nitrate data plot along a slope from 0 5 to 1 the trend can be interpreted as a denitrification process samples pz6 pz10 and the three pz8 samples 14 16 and 18 m deep are clearly marked by a denitrification with an alignment describing a slope between 0 5 and 1 fig 8 in addition pz6 and pz10 samples show dissolved n2o intermediate denitrification product depending on the sampling campaigns at concentrations that can reach 200 μg l 1 it should be noted that pz3 although in the same alignment is not affected by denitrification but rather by a different source of nitrate more organic in this case fig 7 and fig 8 with the highest no3 concentration measured during the study pz5 and pz9 with low nitrate contents and low sulphate contents and have δ15n no3 isotope signatures that do not indicate any denitrification isotopic analyses thus suggested a microbial nitrate reduction activity in some piezometers i e pz6 pz8 and pz10 but not all the piezometers in the catchment in water samples of 2017 the relative abundance of copies of narg and napa genes encoding nitrate reductases involved in nitrate reduction by denitrifying bacteria was higher in pz6 pz8 and pz10 than in other piezometers such as pz3 pz5 and pz7 for which isotopic investigation suggested no nitrate reduction fig 9 a and b results obtained from isotopic investigation and molecular analyses agree showing higher nitrate reductase gene abundances in piezometers where nitrate reduction was highlighted by isotopic signatures abundance of gene copies was also assessed over a period of two years through the four sampling campaigns including april 2017 revealing the presence of both narg and napa genes in all piezometers of the catchment thus showing a potential for microbial nitrate reduction in all studied piezometers of the plourhan site data not shown spatio temporal variations in gene abundance were highlighted according to the sampling time and location this agrees with earlier results that showed a temporal variation in the abundance of denitrification genes in groundwater and a wide ranging spatial distribution of these genes in a single catchment hernández del amo et al 2018 to complete the isotopic and molecular approaches for nitrate reduction characterization in samples collected in april 2017 the potential nitrate reduction activity of microbial communities sampled from several piezometers was measured in batch experiments run under standardized conditions for denitrification nitrate reduction activity was found in all the tested wells fig 9c this agrees with the quantification of functional genes that were also detected albeit at different relative abundances in all piezometers fig 9 a and b showing a spatially widespread potential of the groundwater microbial communities for reducing nitrate these results agree with earlier work showing the wide distribution of microbial communities involved in denitrification in groundwater hernández del amo et al 2018 batch experiments showed a high heterogeneity among the piezometers as nitrate reduction rates can be high pz7 and pz10 or low pz6 and pz9 they also showed that the complete denitrification pathway occurred as nitrite no2 and n2o were detected as well data not shown this strongly suggested that a complete denitrification can occur in the different groundwater of the catchment provided that in situ conditions are favourable intermediate and high potential nitrate reduction rates found in batch experiments for pz8 at two depths and pz10 respectively agree with the denitrification activity showed by isotopic data and the narg and napa genes abundance results found for these piezometers the low potential nitrate reductase activities found for pz9 and sr1 also agree with the isotopic results suggesting no denitrification for pz9 the results were inconclusive for sr1 as the nitrate concentration was too low and because of the low abundance of genes encoding the nitrate reductase enzymes the results from the batch experiments for these four waters thus agreed with the isotopic and molecular approaches however no relation was found for the other piezometers for pz3 and pz7 intermediate to high activity was measured in batch experiments but isotopic and molecular approaches both suggested a low nitrate reduction potential for pz6 whereas the isotopic and molecular approaches suggested nitrate reduction activity and a potential for such activity respectively batch experiments only showed a weak nitrate reduction potential these differences could be due to unsuitable in situ conditions for denitrification compared to batch experiments in the case where batch experiments showed a high potential but no nitrate reduction was detected using isotopes another explanation might be that the in situ nitrate reduction shown by isotopic work is actually ancient explaining why only a weak activity was detected in batch experiments therefore according to geochemistry isotopic tools and or biomolecular characterization the pz5 pz9 and sr1 wells highlight different water origins and or mechanisms than in other piezometers this is further investigated in the following section 4 4 groundwater residence time assessment cfcs sf6 and noble dissolved gases dissolved gases cfcs and sf6 were analysed during the two sampling periods 2009 2011 and 2016 2018 to assess the groundwater residence time and the local aquifer dynamics table s3 supplementary material in this type of aquifer the exponential model reflecting a diffuse recharge at the catchment scale resulting in a mixture of old and young groundwater components at the outlet generally is the most appropriate one here however the binary mixing model that mixes different reservoirs could be also suitable for reflecting the structure of the basement aquifer consisting of fractured bedrock overlain by a weathered layer the spring samples appear to be systematically contaminated with cfc 11 and cfc 12 howerever as cfcs have been used worldwide in a wide range of activities this type of contamination is common near urban areas or landfills höhener et al 2003 and both tracers are unsuitable for dating purposes only cfc 113 and sf6 can be used thus increasing the uncertainty associated with estimating a mean residence time according to the chemical characteristics of the spring water and its relative stability during the year groundwater dating tracers are interpreted with exponential model based on these two tracers the mean τ value characteristic time needed for the two thirds renewal of the aquifer water according to the exponential model of the spring waters is about 20 5 years for the other piezometers pz and borehole sr1 in the catchment area different groups can be used a first group of samples is marked by lower recharge temperatures than the present day one of 11 12 c in brittany ayraud et al 2008 the noble gas concentrations ar and ne fig 10 measured in the sr1 borehole showed a recharge temperature of around 3 4 c i e 7 to 9 c lower than the present day one indicating the presence of old groundwater in the system that could be related to the last glaciation period of 19 to 17 ky aquilina et al 2015 in addition the cfc and sf6 measurements also indicate a long residence time mean 230 40 yr using an exponential model with a possible contribution of a recent component not exceeding 10 that may reflect water inflow resulting from the pumping for groundwater sampling fig 11 this recent component contained nitrate in some sr1 samples from the first sampling period 2009 with no3 reaching 38 mg l 1 at 60 m depth versus 3 7 mg l 1 at 110 m depth in addition during the second sampling period 2017 2018 an excess of 50 to 100 dissolved n2 was determined compared to ne and ar concentrations with concentrations reaching 1 2 10 3 to 1 4 10 3 mol l 1 compared to 7 10 4 to 8 10 4 mol l 1 in the spring samples this may be a result from the denitrification of the incoming nitrate no no3 being detected lq during the second sampling period in a second location pz5 tapping the saprolite and the upper part of the fractured amphibolite noble gas analyses n 2 fig 10 also showed a low recharge temperature of around 6 c while no nitrate was detected during the first sampling period about 1 mg l 1 was measured during the second sampling period which could corroborate the cfc sf6 analyses indicating between 70 and 85 of old water i e cfc sf6 free and thus a small contribution of recent water possibly enriched in nitrate fig 11 above we also pointed out a relatively high cl concentration of up to 72 mg l 1 i e the highest concentration in the studied area except pz12 with both high cl and no3 concentrations an anthropogenic cl contribution is unlikely as there is no nitrate and no denitrification process was detected pz5 samples are the only ones with a na cl ratio close to that of seawater fig 5a combining the low recharge temperature the absence of nitrate and the relatively high cl concentration considered to be natural this sampling point could reflect the legacy of marine transgressions over the past 5 millions years armandine les landes et al 2015 considered that cl of marine origin not supplied by precipitation 40 mg l 1 is likely related to marine transgressions that flooded the armorican massif since the messinian the large quantities of cl injected during each transgression were then diluted by meteoric recharge after the end of the transgression period this includes recharge during the last glaciation shown by a low recharge temperature indicated by noble gases in pz5 at 18 m depth the water comes from the upper part of the amphibolite basement and from the lower part of the overlying weathered material this old water preserved from anthropogenic impact is disconnected from the groundwater feeding the spring about 500 m distant relatively disconnected from present day recharge and only remobilized by pumping for sampling a second group represented by pz9 has a long mean residence time of over 60 years fig 11 with a large proportion 80 90 of old water and no cfc sf6 but no evidence of low recharge temperatures these waters thus appear to be younger than the ones of pz5 and sr1 but old enough not to have received anthropogenic nitrate the other groundwater samples have apparent ages of about 30 years such as pz10 and pz3 pz6 shows a variability between the two samples analysed for dating purposes this can reflect mixing in various proportions between old and present day waters fig 11 according to the period of the hydrological cycle the apparent age being slightly older in may 2018 than in october 2017 this variability was also observed for the major elements which is typical of the sandstone and pelite aquifer that has different aquifer dynamics than the amphibolite aquifer pz7 has a high sf6 contamination based on the other tracers the waters could correspond to a mixing between a large proportion of recent water 70 80 and a 30 40 years old water such different groundwater residence times are known from other parts of brittany evidence of past climatic and geological event was found in groundwater from lanleff monitoring station 10 km west of plourhan armandine les landes et al 2015 and in various other parts of brittany by aquilina et al 2015 most shallow groundwater at a regional scale however is strongly impacted by anthropogenic activity and has mean apparent residence times of 10 to 30 years ayraud et al 2008 all earlier studies studied different regions which raises questions about the functioning and connectivity of the aquifer systems studied questions that might be answered by detailed geological studies of the sites 5 conclusions and perspectives the plourhan catchment 100 ha contains a main spring that still exceeds the limit of 50 mg l no3 despite the numerous remedial measures implemented since the 1990s we investigated the catchment with complementary and robust geological and hydrogeological approaches better to constrain the driving parameters of nitrate transfer and distribution in groundwater and thus to improve our understanding of how the hydrosystem functions first geochemical water sampling over about 10 years showed a quite high variability in groundwater quality 1 a temporal variability especially regarding nitrate and 2 a spatial variability despite the small size of the catchment though a link with agricultural practices and land use is one of the key factors controlling nitrate fate in groundwater other factors must be considered as well such as the hydro biochemical functioning of the aquifer system which can also largely control water quality secondly the study of nitrate isotopes n and o clearly demonstrated denitrification in some piezometers of the catchment area such processes were generally demonstrated by microbiology and molecular biology studies highlighting the presence of functional genes involved in denitrification as well as the capacity of the groundwater microbial community for denitrifying when in situ anoxic and or nutritive conditions are favourable other groundwater samples had low nitrate contents even below the quantification limit without any denitrification process occurring study of the average groundwater residence time based on dissolved cfcs and sf6 and on rare gases locally discovered old waters particularly in nitrate free piezometers demonstrating that such waters never received any anthropogenic nitrate one piezometer contained old water with a recharge temperature well below the current average temperature in the area reflecting water from the last glaciation period 19 to 17 ky third the presence of such very old groundwater in the catchment area raises questions about the structure of the aquifer system at the scale of the recharge area the detailed geological and geophysical work especially with electric tomography profiles led to improvement of the local structural model a large number of compartments delimited by faults was shown to exist as was a highly variable thickness of soil and weathered rock in the study area this better undestanding of the geological structure has shown the heterogeneity of the hydrosystem where some compartments appear to be disconnected from the general groundwater flow this may explain the presence of old residual groundwater not affected by the agricultural activity in the catchment the plourhan site has shown the relevance and necessity of using an integrated approach for significantly improving our knowledge in terms of the functioning of complex hydrosystems such as basement ones and its impact on groundwater quality this approach can be advantageously applied to other sites especially in basement domains where denitrification processes can deeply modify the local water quality and where the geological structure may be quite complex the various methods of such an approach can be implemented independently and successively steered by gradually improving knowledge or in a coupled manner as done here the understanding of hydrodynamic functioning sensulato is as important as that of nitrate reduction both are paramount for implementing the most relevant programmes of measures as required by the european water framework directive fifth wfd and fd

1418,in the contaminant remediation of groundwater the release history of contaminant sources and hydraulic conductivity field are two key parameters that need to know but their actual values are difficult to obtain and can only be inversely identified by limited measured data however the process of solving the inverse problem needs to repeatedly call the forward model of contaminant transport which is very time consuming especially for the high dimensional inverse problems in this study based on the training data generated from a prior range of parameters the release strength of contaminant sources and hydraulic conductivity at pilot points the self organizing maps som algorithm was employed to construct the surrogate model for the numerical model of contaminant transport in a simplified hypothetical aquifer then the surrogate model was used to retrieve jointly the contaminant strength of sources and the hydraulic conductivity at pilot points and the kriging method of geostatistics was further used to process the estimated k values at pilot points to obtain the hydraulic conductivity field also to investigate the ability of the som based surrogate model for retrieving both contaminant source strengths and hydraulic conductivity we gradually expanded the prior range and increased the number of inversion terms in each prior range moreover the robustness of the som based surrogate model for inversion was illustrated by proposing the scarcity of data and different degrees of measurement error in the limited actual observation data when the actual observation data is reduced by 2 3 the root mean square error rmse of retrieving source strengths and hydraulic conductivity at pilot points are 1 07 and 0 09 respectively the results indicated the som based surrogate model shows remarkable inversion precision and robustness and an accurate estimation of the actual hydraulic conductivity field could be obtained by the kriging method based on that keywords self organizing maps kriging method surrogate model contaminant source identification hydraulic conductivity estimation 1 introduction to implement the remediation strategy in the contaminated groundwater it is critical to accurately estimate the key parameters of the groundwater pollutant transport model such as the location and release history of the pollution sources the hydraulic conductivity field usually also needs to be identified because of its close relationship with the transport of pollutants those parameters are usually identified by the inversion method the trail and error manual calibration is the earliest inverse method but now the most commonly used methods are optimization method yeh 2015 and stochastic inverse method zhou et al 2014 that is the information of pollutant release history and pollutant source location as well as hydraulic conductivity field can be retrieved through limited observation data for the optimization method the model parameters are adjusted by multiple iterations to ultimately obtain the optimal combination of these parameters that minimize objective functions vrugt et al 2008 the commonly used simulation optimization methods in groundwater inverse modeling include gauss newton cooley 1977 levenberg marquardt levenberg 1944 ant colony algorithm li et al 2006 particle swarm optimization guneshwor et al 2018 simulated annealing jha and datta 2013 prakash and datta 2015 genetic algorithm ayvaz 2016 mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 xia et al 2019a harmony search jiang et al 2013 etc besides some developed programs can directly perform the inversion such as ucode poeter and hill 1999 and pest doherty 2004 which are developed based on gauss newton and levenberg marquardt respectively in the stochastic inverse method the parameters of the groundwater model are considered as random variables rather than updating the specific values of the model parameters in the optimization method the probability distribution used to characterize these random variables is updated with the observation data starting with glue generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 many stochastic inverse methods have been applied for the estimation of groundwater model parameters including markov chain monte carlo mcmc shen et al 2014 ensemble kalman filter huang et al 2009 erdal and cirpka 2016 ensemble smoother bailey and baù 2010 li et al 2018 and their modified algorithms for improving computational efficiency and precision cao et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in order to reduce computational cost in the process of inversing groundwater model parameters the surrogate model is often used to replace the original numerical model in the surrogate model the main features of the original model can be extracted and characterized to represent the relationship between the input and output of the original numerical model according to different construction principles the surrogate models can be divided into three categories project based surrogates multi fidelity based surrogates and data driven surrogates asher et al 2015 the methods generally used in constructing a data driven surrogate model include radial basis function rbf support vector machine svm chaotic polynomial expansion pce gaussian process gp and neural networks razavi et al 2012 for instance yi et al 2012 use the rbf to establish the surrogate model of groundwater numerical simulation model based on pumping input and water level drawdown output dataset raghavendra and deka 2014 review the state of the art and focus on a wide range of applications of svms in hydrology zhang et al 2016 integrate gaussian process gp and mcmc to adaptively construct locally accurate surrogates to solve groundwater contaminant source identification problems in recent years due to rapid improvement of computing power such as the emerging of graphics processing units gpu many neural network architectures gain increasing popularity to construct surrogate models for supervised learning zhu and zabaras 2018 propose a bayesian approach of convolutional neural nets to construct the surrogate models for uncertainty quantification mo et al 2019 use deep autoregressive neural networks to provide an accurate approximation for the contaminant transport model to help efficiently inverse the high dimensional problem of contaminant source identification for unsupervised learning hazrati and datta hazrati and datta 2017a hazrati and datta 2017b use the self organizing maps som to construct a surrogate model to replace the contaminant transport model for contaminant source identification considering the higher heterogeneity for hydraulic conductivity field and some disturbance circumstances the som algorithm is employed by xia et al 2019b to construct the surrogate model to identify the release history i e contaminant flux of contaminant sources and the results demonstrate that the som based surrogate model can give an accurate estimation for the source release strength that varies in a fixedly narrow prior range however the range is always changed in different circumstances and the hydraulic conductivity field should be estimated simultaneously with the release history in more practical cases in this paper the identification of contaminant sources and estimation of hydraulic conductivity are simultaneously carried out because the parameter dimension is too high the whole hydraulic conductivity field cannot be retrieved directly we thus estimate the hydraulic conductivity at selected pilot points ramarao et al 1995 and calculate the hydraulic conductivity field by kriging interpolation subsequently undoubtedly the interpolated hydraulic conductivity field is closer to the actual field with the increase of the number of pilot points while the increase of inversion terms becomes challenging for accurate estimation of the som based surrogate model therefore to explore the ability of som for identifying the contaminant sources and estimating the conductivity field we gradually expand the prior range of contaminant source strengths and hydraulic conductivity values at pilot points and increase the number of pilot points in each prior range the lack of information and varying degrees of measurement error regarding the observation data are further considered to validate the robustness of the som based surrogate model 2 methodology and hypothetical aquifer setup 2 1 self organizing maps 2 1 1 principles of the self organizing maps the self organizing maps som is a clustering algorithm proposed by kohonen kohonen 1982 which can reflect the complex high dimensional input data to the low dimensional grid through nonlinear mapping and retain the topological relationship of the data to effectively cluster the input data the som model consists of the input layer and the output layer that represents the grid topology and each neuron in the input layer connects with neurons of the output layer through a weight vector briefly the core idea of the som algorithm can be described as follow firstly the weight vector of each neuron in the output layer is initialized by either a random or a linear initialization method the learning rate and type of neighborhood function are further determined then the euclidean distance between input data and each weight vector is calculated the neuron corresponds to the smallest euclidean distance together with its surrounding neurons will be activated and the corresponding weight vectors are adjusted to move towards the input data repeat the steps above until the learning rate decays to zero finally a network output layer is obtained to represent the topological relationship between input data where each neuron in the output layer symbolizes an obtained cluster therefore the som algorithm can be employed to construct the surrogate model for the contaminant transport model specifically the input data that consists of input and output of the original contaminant transport model is classified to get the cluster groups where each cluster represents a sort of relationship between the input and output and all clusters consequently constitute the surrogate model for the original contaminant transport model for the classical sequential som algorithm seq som only one input data point x t is processed at a time euclidean distance is used to find the winner neuron by eq 1 then the weight vector of the winner neuron will be updated by eq 2 kohonen 2013 1 c arg min i x k t m i t 2 m i t 1 m i t h ci t x k t m i t where i is the index of neuron in the grid c is the index of winner neuron in the grid t signifies a step in the input data sequence x k t k 1 2 n m i t is the weight vector of neuron i at step t h ci t is the neighborhood function that affects the way of adjusting the surrounding weight vector of the winner neuron compared to seq som the batch som training algorithm batch som updates weight vectors using all input data together by eq 3 resulting in higher computational efficiency 3 m i k n h ki x k h ki imputation som training algorithm imp som proposed by vatanen in 2015 vatanen et al 2015 is an improved version of batch som instead of ignoring the missing data in input vectors imp som fill them with their expected values according to the best matching units of the corresponding data vectors and the equation is given as follows 4 x ki miss e x k miss m i m i the previous research work xia et al 2019b has indicated that imp som performs better than batch som in the construction of surrogate models for groundwater pollutant transport thus in this study imp som that implemented by som toolbox 2 1 is adopted and the output layer of the som algorithm is referred to as codebook a matrix in the toolbox consequently the codebook equals the surrogate model of the original contaminant transport model introduced in section 2 3 for this paper furthermore the som algorithm has the ability to search for the most matching vector in the codebook for a group of input data that contains unknown parts and the corresponding part in the most matching vector is the estimation for the unknown parts therefore the surrogate model of contaminant transport constructed by the som algorithm not merely replaces the complex original numerical model but also has the ability to inverse model parameters which means that other aforementioned inverse solution methods are no longer needed and computational cost is subsequently reduced besides the training algorithm the most important parameter is the number of the neuron i e map units in the som toolbox 2 1 because it represents the desired number of clusters it is worth noting that a unified standard has not been proposed for the determination of the neuron number in the output layer melssen et al 1994 believed that the number of neurons in the output layer should be more than twice the expected number of clustering groups and far less than the number of input data lin and chen 2006 hold the view that the number of neurons in the output layer should be as large as possible to ensure the maximum classification abrahart and see 2000 and parasuraman et al 2006 used trial and error to select the number of neurons in the output layer in this study the trial and error method is used to determine the number of output neurons in addition other parameters need to be determined in the application of the som algorithm such as the lattice shape map shape and aforementioned initialization method neighborhood function learning rate etc the adopted values of these som parameters are listed in table 1 2 1 2 steps for building a som based surrogate model of groundwater contaminant transport model in this study a surrogate model is constructed through the som algorithm to replace the original numerical model of groundwater contaminant transport introduced in section 2 3 the constructed surrogate model further estimates the unknown release history of contaminant sources i e contaminant source fluxes and values of hydraulic conductivity at pilot points the main procedures for building a som based surrogate model are simply described as follows step 1 generation of input samples of original model a large amount of training data is needed to obtain an accurate surrogate model in this study the training data consists of the input and output of the original model where the input refers to the contaminant fluxes of sources and the hydraulic conductivity at pilot points and the output is the contaminant concentration at observation wells the first step is thus to generate enough input samples with the latin hypercube sampling method helton and davis 2003 on account of that it can efficiently across the given range of each sampled variable for each sample the kriging method is employed to get their interpolated field of hydraulic conductivity that is used for the next step step 2 generation of training data based on the input samples and corresponding interpolated field generated in step 1 the original numerical model is solved by modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to get the output i e solution the input samples grouped with the contaminant concentration at specific monitoring wells in the solution are treated as the training data to construct the som based surrogate model step 3 generation of validation data after generating the training data the same steps are employed to obtain the validation data to evaluate the precision of surrogate models and further to select the optimal one in this study the input of validation data shares the same range as the input of training data and the validation data size is one tenth of training data step 4 construction of surrogate model as previously mentioned the map unit is the key parameter that affects the precision of the surrogate model besides the impact of training data size i e input data size for som is also important therefore ten values from 10 to 100 are set for map units in this study which means to take one value at each interval of 10 similarly the minimum size of training data is 500 and the size is increased evenly to 4000 by the interval of 500 the varying combinations of these values are tested in the following training process carried out by som toolbox 2 1 and the validation data generates in step 3 is used to select the optimal combination of map units and training data size by which the map codebook generated is the optimal surrogate model that used for the next application step 5 application of surrogate model finally the constructed surrogate model is used for estimating the unknown components in the input vector where the known components are utilized to search for the best matching unit bmu in the map codebook and the estimated values of unknown components can be then read directly from the corresponding vector of bmu in the codebook fig 1 in this study the constructed surrogate model is applied to retrieve parameters of the contaminant transport model where the contaminant concentration at the observation wells are the known parts and the contaminant source fluxes coupled with hydraulic conductivity at pilot points are the unknown components 2 2 kriging in this study matlab toolbox dace lophaven et al 2002 was used to implement the kriging interpolation the kriging model consists of a stochastic process and regression model in the toolbox the relationship between the predictive response y x and the independent variable x is defined as sacks et al 1989 5 y x f t x β z x where z x is the random process that is assumed to be with mean zero and covariance σ 2 β is the regression parameter f x is the regression function which is usually composed of polynomials for the random process the covariance between two points x i and x j in the site can be expressed as 6 cov z x i z x j σ 2 r θ x i x j where r θ x i x j is the correlation model with parameter θ representing the spatial correlation between x i and x j given a set of known data includes sites s x 1 x m t and responses y y 1 y m t then the predictive response of the rest arbitrary site x k can be calculated by 7 y x k f t x k β r x k r 1 y f β 8 r x k r θ x k x 1 r θ x k x m 9 β f t r 1 f f t r 1 y where r 1 is the inverse matrix of correlation model r θ s f is the abbreviation of the regression model f β s based on the condition of keeping predictive response unbiased β can be figured out by eq 9 through lagrange multiplier method then the predictive response can be obtained by putting β into eq 7 thus there are three parameters to be artificially given when using the kriging method for interpolation where the first two are the type of regression function and correlation function and the last one is the correlation function parameter θ the type of regression function determines the type of kriging method for instance simple kriging assumes the regression function to be a known constant ordinary kriging also assumes a constant but unknown regression function the type of correlation function includes gaussian cubic spherical exponential function etc if the physical phenomenon is continuously differentiable the correlation function will tend to show a parabolic behavior near the origin which means that the gaussian and cubic should be chosen conversely the exponential and spherical function should be selected when physical phenomena show a linear behavior near the origin isaaks and srivastava 1991 the correlation model parameter describes the influence sphere of a point on nearby points for each dimension the kriging method based on the two point correlation model i e the variogram can only be used to describe the hydraulic conductivity field that obeys the gaussian distribution i e the aquifer is composed of single facies such as the hypothetical aquifer used in this paper for the aquifer in geological structures such as fluvial deposits there exist a highly permeable preferential flow path which leads to the aquifer is composed of multiple facies and the hydraulic conductivity not obey the gaussian distribution hence the kriging method cannot be applicable in such case caers and zhang 2004 zovi et al 2017 2 3 a hypothetical aquifer site the transport of contaminant in the saturated aquifer may involve diffusion advection dispersion absorption and desorption in this study advection and dispersion are dominated processes in a two dimensional contaminant transport system under steady state groundwater flow conditions the governing equation of the steady state groundwater flow is solved by numerical simulator modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and the advection dispersion equation of contaminant transport is solved by mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the hypothetical aquifer is a saturated and confined aquifer with a 2d steady state groundwater flow specifically the aquifer size is 500 m in the x direction and 300 m in the y direction the top and bottom boundary is no flux the constant hydraulic heads of 15 m and 10 m are the west and east boundary respectively and the aquifer thickness was 5 m the values for aquifer parameters are listed in table 2 the hypothetical aquifer is anisotropic and heterogeneous in this paper no matter in the process of building or applying the som based surrogate model the actual hydraulic conductivity field is unknown and can only be obtained by kriging interpolation on the basis of known hydraulic conductivity of sparse points in the field the sparse points include observation wells and pilot points fig 2 and the hydraulic conductivity at observation wells is the fixed known part for the pilot point the number and prior range for hydraulic conductivity are varying specifically three values for number 20 40 60 and its locations are gradually distributed from the middle area of the aquifer site to the boundaries three prior ranges for hydraulic conductivity 25 50 75 of actual values the actual hydraulic conductivity field fig 2 obeys lognormally distribution with mean 5 5 and variation 1 2 and the correlation length in x direction and y direction are 125 l and 75 l respectively two contaminant sources s1 and s2 are placed in this hypothetical aquifer fig 2 and the contaminant is only released at the first seven periods for both sources as listed in table 3 consequently 14 unknown source fluxes and hydraulic conductivities at pilot points need to be estimated the whole simulation time is 100 days that equally divided into 10 stress periods that is 10 days for each period the simulation mode for modflow and mt3dms is steady state and transient respectively the detection of pollution is always lagging in the practical situation thus there are 16 observation wells fig 2 to gather the concentration data of contaminant only in the last six stress periods sp5 sp10 2 4 assessment criteria 2 4 1 evaluation indicator of optimal som based surrogate model as mentioned in section 2 1 self organizing maps each group of training data has its corresponding validation data for the selection of an optimal combination of map unit units and training data size tds and the corresponding codebook is the optimal surrogate model after each training the ss combined with kpp and the observation data abbr obs in the validation data were separately treated as missing parts and estimated by the corresponding surrogate model the estimation of ss and kpp belongs to the inverse problem of groundwater while the estimation of obs is the problem of groundwater prediction the normalized absolute error of estimation naee is used to assess the precision of the estimation result the naee is defined as follows 10 naee i 1 n d est i d act i i 1 n d act i 100 for the naee of estimating obs i e naeeobs where d est is the estimated obs d act is the actual obs n is the product of the number of observation wells and the number of specified stress periods for gathering observation data for the naee of estimating ss i e naeess where d est is the estimated ss d act is the actual ss n is the sum of stress periods when the contaminant is released to two contaminant sources for the naee of estimating kpp i e naeekpp where d est is the estimated kpp d act is the actual kpp n is the number of pilot points based on the above three evaluation indicators the general selection principles for the optimal surrogate model are given on the premise of ensuring certain estimation precision of obs the optimal surrogate model will be the codebook trained by the combination of tds and units that obtains the highest precision minimum naee for estimating ss and kpp especially the indicator that varies in a small range will be ignored and the optimal surrogate model is selected according to the remaining indicators 2 4 2 assessment of inversion performance of constructed surrogate model the constructed surrogate model was used to estimate the actual values of ss and kpp based on known observation data the normalized absolute error of estimation naee and root mean square error rmse were employed to quantify the performance of the constructed surrogate model in estimation the definition of naee is the same as eq 14 and the definition of rmse is expressed as follows 11 rmse i 1 n d est i d act i 2 n for the rmse of estimating ss i e rmsess where d est is the estimated ss d act is the actual ss n is the sum of stress periods that contaminant is released to two contaminant sources for the rmse of estimating kpp i e rmsekpp where d est is the estimated kpp d act is the actual kpp n is the number of pilot points 3 discussion and results in this section the surrogate model was established firstly then used to estimate the actual values of contaminant flux of sources abbr ss and hydraulic conductivity at pilot point abbr kpp as explained in section 2 2 2 and the estimation to hydraulic conductivity field abbr k field was further interpolated by kriging method based on the estimated kpp abbreviations in here and the next two paragraphs were used for the conciseness of expression because they will be mentioned repeatedly in the following sections to explore the ability of the som based surrogate model to inverse ss and kpp different prior ranges were used to generate the input samples where the number of ss was constant and the number of kpp gradually increased specifically there are three discussion scenarios that ranges were set to 25 50 and 75 of actual values for each range the number of kpp increased from 20 to 40 and finally to 60 thus there are a total of nine discussion cases for all scenarios table 4 in each case the training data size abbr tds was given as follows 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 and the validation data size is 1 10 of training data size that is from 50 to 400 and the number of units was similarly set as follows 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 the parameters for kriging interpolation in the process of building and applying the som based surrogate model were listed in table 5 the initial values of the correlation parameter θ that corresponds to the correlation length of k field were 50 l and 30 l in x direction and y direction respectively furthermore taking the error of artificial knowledge to the field into account the boundaries in both directions are between 10 l and 100 l to cover the real correlation length mentioned in section 2 3 a hypothetical aquifer site in the y direction rather than in the x direction 3 1 scenario 1 in this scenario the prior range of the input sample is 25 for case 1 3 3 1 1 construction of som based surrogate model for case 1 3 according to the selection principles the naeekpp was ignored for all three cases in this scenario because of its quite low variation range within 0 08 3 1 1 1 case 1 to select the optimal surrogate model the validation results of each training in case 1 are compared in fig 3 the naee of estimating ss and obs are incremental with units precision decreased with increased units fig 3b and the optimal surrogate model is one of the codebooks generated by units 10 with different tds there are no significant variations of naeess for different tds with units 10 fig 3a therefore the optimal surrogate model is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 3000 with units 10 because of its minimum naee for estimating obs fig 3c 3 1 1 2 case 2 as the validation results depicted in fig 4 the optimal surrogate model of case 2 is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 2500 with units 10 because of its best performance minimum naee on the estimation of ss and obs fig 4a and c 3 1 1 3 case 3 the validation results of case 3 in fig 5 show that the naeess and naeekpp share a similar change trend with units as selection principles suggested the optimal surrogate model is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 1500 with units 10 where the highest precision of ss estimation fig 5a and good performance on obs estimation fig 5c were obtained simultaneously 3 1 2 application for constructed som surrogate model the naee and rmse for estimating ss and kpp are listed in table 6 in the prior range of 25 the estimation precision is fairly high for both ss and kpp which is explicitly shown in fig 6 and fig 7 specifically for estimation of ss the maximum value of naee and rmse is 1 02 and 0 30 respectively and that is 0 11 and 0 09 for kpp further the estimation precision of ss and kpp does not decrease linearly with the increase of the total number of missing components i e the sum of the amount of ss and kpp such as the naee increases from 0 99 to 1 02 and then decreases to 0 90 for ss in case 1 3 because of the high estimation precision of kpp the interpolated k field based on estimated kpp become increasingly closer to the actual k field from case 1 to case 3 fig 8 3 2 scenario 2 in this scenario the prior range of the input sample is 50 for case 4 6 3 2 1 construction of som based surrogate model for case 4 6 the naeekpp is still ignored for all three cases in this scenario because of its fairly low variation range within 0 3 3 2 1 1 case 4 the validation results of case 4 are presented in fig 9 the combinations of tds 1500 with units 10 and tds 1500 with units 30 show the worst performance on the estimation of obs despite its high precision for estimation of ss by contrast the combination of tds 3000 with units 10 performs better in estimating obs and almost provides the same estimation precision of ss fig 9a and c therefore the codebook trained with tds 3000 and units 10 is selected as the optimal surrogate model on account of the selection principles 3 2 1 2 case 5 as shown in fig 10 the validation results of each training in case 5 indicate that the optimal surrogate model should be the codebook trained by the combination of tds 2000 and units 20 because it gets the highest precision minimum naee in estimating ss and also guarantees a good precision for estimating obs fig 10a and c 3 2 1 3 case 6 by comparing the validation results displayed in fig 11 and combined with the selection principles the optimal surrogate model for case 6 is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 1000 and units 10 because it has the highest precision minimum naee in estimating ss and also shows a good performance on the estimation of obs fig 11a and c 3 2 2 application for constructed som surrogate model the naee and rmse for estimating ss and actual kpp are listed in table 7 although the results are slightly worse than scenario 1 the estimation precision of ss and kpp is still high under the prior range of 50 fig 12 and fig 13 specifically for ss the maximum value of naee and rmse is 1 98 and 0 60 respectively and that is 0 42 and 0 03 for kpp similar to scenario 1 the estimation precision of ss and kpp shows no linear relationship with the total number of missing components i e the sum of quantities of ss and kpp for instance the naee decreases from 1 98 to 1 19 and then increases to 1 61 for ss in case 4 6 and the naee of kpp increases from 0 16 to 0 42 and then decreases again to 0 26 due to the high estimation precision of kpp the interpolated k field based on estimated kpp also give an increasingly accurate representation of the actual k field from case 4 to case 6 fig 14 3 3 scenario 3 in this scenario the prior range of the input sample is 75 for case 7 9 3 3 1 construction of som based surrogate model for case 7 9 as the selection principles figured out the naeekpp which varied in a very small range within 0 4 was not considered for all three cases in this scenario 3 3 1 1 case 7 as shown in fig a 1 there are two candidates for optimal combination because of their high estimation precision of ss tds 500 with units 10 and tds 1000 with units 10 compared to the first candidates the latter one has the slight difference in estimation precision of ss but displays a much better performance for estimating obs fig a 1a and c therefore according to the selection principles the optimal surrogate model is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 1000 with units 10 3 3 1 2 case 8 similar to case 7 three candidate optimal combinations in this case for their good estimation performance on ss tds 1000 with units 10 tds 1500 with units 10 and tds 1000 with units 30 the validation results depicted in fig a 2 a and c indicate little difference exists in the three candidates for the precision of estimating ss but the last candidate has an obviously better performance on estimating obs than the first two thus obeyed with the selection principles the codebook trained by the combination of tds 1000 with units 30 is the optimal surrogate model 3 3 1 3 case 9 as shown in fig a 3 the validation results of training clearly indicate the optimal surrogate model is the codebook generated by the combination of tds 3500 with units 20 for the reason that it has the highest precision minimum naee for estimating ss and also performs well in the estimation of obs 3 3 2 application for constructed som surrogate model as summarized in table a 1 the maximum value of naee for estimation of ss and kpp is 3 16 and 1 30 respectively and that of rmse for them is 1 07 and 0 09 although the performance of the som surrogate model is inferior a little to that in scenario 2 the estimation precision is comparatively high for both ss and kpp under the prior range of 75 as demonstrated clearly in fig a 4 and fig a 5 similar to scenario 2 nonlinearity in the relationship between the estimation precision of ss and kpp and the increase of the total number of missing components i e the sum of the quantities of ss and kpp where the naee increases from 2 68 to 3 16 and then decreases to 2 06 for ss in case 7 9 and the naee of kpp increase from 0 51 to 1 30 and then decreases again to 0 54 accurate estimation of kpp resulted in better representation of the actual k field by interpolation of kpp from case 7 to case 9 fig a 6 as the number of kpp increased 3 4 summary for the scenario 1 3 the overall performance denoted by naee of estimating ss and kpp for scenario 1 3 is compared in fig 15 the estimation precision of the som based surrogate model to actual ss and kpp is fairly high for all cases in three scenarios the reason for such high precision might be that the number of map units inclined to small in this study the maximum of optimal units is 30 in scenario 1 3 and the estimation precision ought to decline as map units increases which clearly shows in the step of validation for som based surrogate model in each scenario fig 3 5 fig 9 11 fig a 1 a 3 consequently because the optimal surrogate model of case 8 is performed worst in estimating ss and kpp with the maximum of units in all of the cases the estimation precision of the surrogate models that constructed by the optimal training data size in case 8 1000 combined with other numbers of units except 30 to ss and kpp was further calculated to investigate the impact of units number on estimating ss and kpp as the estimation results displayed in fig 16 though not monotonically the precision of estimation does overall decrease with the increasing number of units as expected naee and rmse gradually increase for both of actual ss and kpp to be more specific firstly as the prior range expanded from scenario 1 to 3 the estimation precision for both ss and kpp was decreased increased naee however there is no clear linear relationship between the estimation precision and the number of missing components of ss and kpp the estimation precision was fluctuant when more missing components are considered the small interval between pilot points might be the cause of this result so the number of kpp was gradually increased to 100 200 with the prior range of 25 and 50 then the training and validation data are regenerated to construct surrogate model that was further used to inversion the estimation performance of ss and kpp displayed in fig 17 shows that the estimation accuracy generally decreases with the increase of the number of missing components but the decrease process is not strictly monotonical secondly when the number of pilot points were above 40 the key features of the actual k field could be depicted by kriging interpolation because of the high estimation precision of the surrogate model to kpp fig 8 fig 14 fig a 6 with prior range of 25 and 50 3 5 scenario 4 to test the robustness of constructed som based surrogate model the actual observation data from the 5th to the 8th time period were gradually regarded as unknown in other words only a small amount of observation data is available for estimating the actual ss and kpp and different degrees of measurement errors were also taken into account for the limited available observation data the measurement errors were assumed to follow a normal distribution where the expectation was zero and the standard deviation gradually increased from 10 20 to 30 likewise the surrogate model constructed in case 8 of scenario 3 was selected to test the robustness in this scenario due to the minimum estimation precision of ss and kpp in all cases the estimation results represented by naee and rmse remain 3 16 and 1 07 kept stable with the increasing scarcity of actual observation data table 8 i e the som based surrogate model still could estimate the ss and kpp accurately even though half of the observed data were missing fig 18 shows the estimation results on that varying degree errors were added to the limited actual observation data with lack in sp5 8 it is worth noting that to avoid the contingency estimation was repeated ten times and then calculated average for each combination of lack of data and varying degree errors for ss the naee rmse of estimation results were slightly increased from 3 16 1 07 4 92 1 64 to 5 08 1 69 when measurement error was below 20 while the naee rmse abruptly came to 9 46 2 96 when measurement error increased to 30 similarly the naee and rmse of estimation results for kpp barely changed 1 30 1 31 1 35 0 09 0 09 0 09 when measurement error under 20 but it increased from 1 35 0 09 to 1 69 0 12 when measurement error reached to 30 however the performance of the surrogate model to estimate actual kpp was still at a high level which ensures the precision of interpolated k field in summary the surrogate model constructed by the som algorithm not only could make a fairly accurate estimation for ss and kpp when observation data were insufficient but also performs well when both insufficiency and measurement errors up to 20 existed in actual observation data 4 conclusions 1 in this study the kriging method in geostatistics and self organizing maps algorithm were combined to realize the simultaneous inversion of contaminant sources and hydraulic conductivity field specifically the self organizing maps algorithm was used to construct a surrogate model to accurately replace the complex numerical model of groundwater contaminant transport and was further applied to inverse the contaminant strength of sources and hydraulic conductivity at pilot points which were used for the kriging method of geostatistics to obtain the entire hydraulic conductivity field 2 when ignoring the influence of training data size the surrogate model built by som with the units of small number overall has the higher inversion precision for both contaminant source strengths and hydraulic conductivity at pilot points 3 under the condition that there was error free and sufficient measurement data the surrogate model of contaminant transport constructed by som gains quite high precision for identifying contaminant source strengths and estimating pilot points of hydraulic conductivity consequently based on the precise estimation of sufficient pilot points the hydraulic conductivity field could be depicted accurately by the kriging method 4 although the estimation of both contaminant flux and hydraulic conductivity was fairly accurate the estimation precision of the som based surrogate model decreases obviously with the expansion of prior range under the condition that the number of pilot points was constant similarly the estimation precision generally decreases as the number of pilot points increases but the decrease process is not strictly monotonic 5 the surrogate model constructed by som for contaminant transport shows remarkable robustness even though there was a lack of more than half of the actual observation data the estimation precision was almost the same as that without missing besides varying degrees of measurement error was added to the limited available observation data and the estimation performance was still well and stable when the error level was under 20 the estimation precision begins to decrease obviously as the error reaches 30 but still at a high level

1418,in the contaminant remediation of groundwater the release history of contaminant sources and hydraulic conductivity field are two key parameters that need to know but their actual values are difficult to obtain and can only be inversely identified by limited measured data however the process of solving the inverse problem needs to repeatedly call the forward model of contaminant transport which is very time consuming especially for the high dimensional inverse problems in this study based on the training data generated from a prior range of parameters the release strength of contaminant sources and hydraulic conductivity at pilot points the self organizing maps som algorithm was employed to construct the surrogate model for the numerical model of contaminant transport in a simplified hypothetical aquifer then the surrogate model was used to retrieve jointly the contaminant strength of sources and the hydraulic conductivity at pilot points and the kriging method of geostatistics was further used to process the estimated k values at pilot points to obtain the hydraulic conductivity field also to investigate the ability of the som based surrogate model for retrieving both contaminant source strengths and hydraulic conductivity we gradually expanded the prior range and increased the number of inversion terms in each prior range moreover the robustness of the som based surrogate model for inversion was illustrated by proposing the scarcity of data and different degrees of measurement error in the limited actual observation data when the actual observation data is reduced by 2 3 the root mean square error rmse of retrieving source strengths and hydraulic conductivity at pilot points are 1 07 and 0 09 respectively the results indicated the som based surrogate model shows remarkable inversion precision and robustness and an accurate estimation of the actual hydraulic conductivity field could be obtained by the kriging method based on that keywords self organizing maps kriging method surrogate model contaminant source identification hydraulic conductivity estimation 1 introduction to implement the remediation strategy in the contaminated groundwater it is critical to accurately estimate the key parameters of the groundwater pollutant transport model such as the location and release history of the pollution sources the hydraulic conductivity field usually also needs to be identified because of its close relationship with the transport of pollutants those parameters are usually identified by the inversion method the trail and error manual calibration is the earliest inverse method but now the most commonly used methods are optimization method yeh 2015 and stochastic inverse method zhou et al 2014 that is the information of pollutant release history and pollutant source location as well as hydraulic conductivity field can be retrieved through limited observation data for the optimization method the model parameters are adjusted by multiple iterations to ultimately obtain the optimal combination of these parameters that minimize objective functions vrugt et al 2008 the commonly used simulation optimization methods in groundwater inverse modeling include gauss newton cooley 1977 levenberg marquardt levenberg 1944 ant colony algorithm li et al 2006 particle swarm optimization guneshwor et al 2018 simulated annealing jha and datta 2013 prakash and datta 2015 genetic algorithm ayvaz 2016 mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 xia et al 2019a harmony search jiang et al 2013 etc besides some developed programs can directly perform the inversion such as ucode poeter and hill 1999 and pest doherty 2004 which are developed based on gauss newton and levenberg marquardt respectively in the stochastic inverse method the parameters of the groundwater model are considered as random variables rather than updating the specific values of the model parameters in the optimization method the probability distribution used to characterize these random variables is updated with the observation data starting with glue generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 many stochastic inverse methods have been applied for the estimation of groundwater model parameters including markov chain monte carlo mcmc shen et al 2014 ensemble kalman filter huang et al 2009 erdal and cirpka 2016 ensemble smoother bailey and baù 2010 li et al 2018 and their modified algorithms for improving computational efficiency and precision cao et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in order to reduce computational cost in the process of inversing groundwater model parameters the surrogate model is often used to replace the original numerical model in the surrogate model the main features of the original model can be extracted and characterized to represent the relationship between the input and output of the original numerical model according to different construction principles the surrogate models can be divided into three categories project based surrogates multi fidelity based surrogates and data driven surrogates asher et al 2015 the methods generally used in constructing a data driven surrogate model include radial basis function rbf support vector machine svm chaotic polynomial expansion pce gaussian process gp and neural networks razavi et al 2012 for instance yi et al 2012 use the rbf to establish the surrogate model of groundwater numerical simulation model based on pumping input and water level drawdown output dataset raghavendra and deka 2014 review the state of the art and focus on a wide range of applications of svms in hydrology zhang et al 2016 integrate gaussian process gp and mcmc to adaptively construct locally accurate surrogates to solve groundwater contaminant source identification problems in recent years due to rapid improvement of computing power such as the emerging of graphics processing units gpu many neural network architectures gain increasing popularity to construct surrogate models for supervised learning zhu and zabaras 2018 propose a bayesian approach of convolutional neural nets to construct the surrogate models for uncertainty quantification mo et al 2019 use deep autoregressive neural networks to provide an accurate approximation for the contaminant transport model to help efficiently inverse the high dimensional problem of contaminant source identification for unsupervised learning hazrati and datta hazrati and datta 2017a hazrati and datta 2017b use the self organizing maps som to construct a surrogate model to replace the contaminant transport model for contaminant source identification considering the higher heterogeneity for hydraulic conductivity field and some disturbance circumstances the som algorithm is employed by xia et al 2019b to construct the surrogate model to identify the release history i e contaminant flux of contaminant sources and the results demonstrate that the som based surrogate model can give an accurate estimation for the source release strength that varies in a fixedly narrow prior range however the range is always changed in different circumstances and the hydraulic conductivity field should be estimated simultaneously with the release history in more practical cases in this paper the identification of contaminant sources and estimation of hydraulic conductivity are simultaneously carried out because the parameter dimension is too high the whole hydraulic conductivity field cannot be retrieved directly we thus estimate the hydraulic conductivity at selected pilot points ramarao et al 1995 and calculate the hydraulic conductivity field by kriging interpolation subsequently undoubtedly the interpolated hydraulic conductivity field is closer to the actual field with the increase of the number of pilot points while the increase of inversion terms becomes challenging for accurate estimation of the som based surrogate model therefore to explore the ability of som for identifying the contaminant sources and estimating the conductivity field we gradually expand the prior range of contaminant source strengths and hydraulic conductivity values at pilot points and increase the number of pilot points in each prior range the lack of information and varying degrees of measurement error regarding the observation data are further considered to validate the robustness of the som based surrogate model 2 methodology and hypothetical aquifer setup 2 1 self organizing maps 2 1 1 principles of the self organizing maps the self organizing maps som is a clustering algorithm proposed by kohonen kohonen 1982 which can reflect the complex high dimensional input data to the low dimensional grid through nonlinear mapping and retain the topological relationship of the data to effectively cluster the input data the som model consists of the input layer and the output layer that represents the grid topology and each neuron in the input layer connects with neurons of the output layer through a weight vector briefly the core idea of the som algorithm can be described as follow firstly the weight vector of each neuron in the output layer is initialized by either a random or a linear initialization method the learning rate and type of neighborhood function are further determined then the euclidean distance between input data and each weight vector is calculated the neuron corresponds to the smallest euclidean distance together with its surrounding neurons will be activated and the corresponding weight vectors are adjusted to move towards the input data repeat the steps above until the learning rate decays to zero finally a network output layer is obtained to represent the topological relationship between input data where each neuron in the output layer symbolizes an obtained cluster therefore the som algorithm can be employed to construct the surrogate model for the contaminant transport model specifically the input data that consists of input and output of the original contaminant transport model is classified to get the cluster groups where each cluster represents a sort of relationship between the input and output and all clusters consequently constitute the surrogate model for the original contaminant transport model for the classical sequential som algorithm seq som only one input data point x t is processed at a time euclidean distance is used to find the winner neuron by eq 1 then the weight vector of the winner neuron will be updated by eq 2 kohonen 2013 1 c arg min i x k t m i t 2 m i t 1 m i t h ci t x k t m i t where i is the index of neuron in the grid c is the index of winner neuron in the grid t signifies a step in the input data sequence x k t k 1 2 n m i t is the weight vector of neuron i at step t h ci t is the neighborhood function that affects the way of adjusting the surrounding weight vector of the winner neuron compared to seq som the batch som training algorithm batch som updates weight vectors using all input data together by eq 3 resulting in higher computational efficiency 3 m i k n h ki x k h ki imputation som training algorithm imp som proposed by vatanen in 2015 vatanen et al 2015 is an improved version of batch som instead of ignoring the missing data in input vectors imp som fill them with their expected values according to the best matching units of the corresponding data vectors and the equation is given as follows 4 x ki miss e x k miss m i m i the previous research work xia et al 2019b has indicated that imp som performs better than batch som in the construction of surrogate models for groundwater pollutant transport thus in this study imp som that implemented by som toolbox 2 1 is adopted and the output layer of the som algorithm is referred to as codebook a matrix in the toolbox consequently the codebook equals the surrogate model of the original contaminant transport model introduced in section 2 3 for this paper furthermore the som algorithm has the ability to search for the most matching vector in the codebook for a group of input data that contains unknown parts and the corresponding part in the most matching vector is the estimation for the unknown parts therefore the surrogate model of contaminant transport constructed by the som algorithm not merely replaces the complex original numerical model but also has the ability to inverse model parameters which means that other aforementioned inverse solution methods are no longer needed and computational cost is subsequently reduced besides the training algorithm the most important parameter is the number of the neuron i e map units in the som toolbox 2 1 because it represents the desired number of clusters it is worth noting that a unified standard has not been proposed for the determination of the neuron number in the output layer melssen et al 1994 believed that the number of neurons in the output layer should be more than twice the expected number of clustering groups and far less than the number of input data lin and chen 2006 hold the view that the number of neurons in the output layer should be as large as possible to ensure the maximum classification abrahart and see 2000 and parasuraman et al 2006 used trial and error to select the number of neurons in the output layer in this study the trial and error method is used to determine the number of output neurons in addition other parameters need to be determined in the application of the som algorithm such as the lattice shape map shape and aforementioned initialization method neighborhood function learning rate etc the adopted values of these som parameters are listed in table 1 2 1 2 steps for building a som based surrogate model of groundwater contaminant transport model in this study a surrogate model is constructed through the som algorithm to replace the original numerical model of groundwater contaminant transport introduced in section 2 3 the constructed surrogate model further estimates the unknown release history of contaminant sources i e contaminant source fluxes and values of hydraulic conductivity at pilot points the main procedures for building a som based surrogate model are simply described as follows step 1 generation of input samples of original model a large amount of training data is needed to obtain an accurate surrogate model in this study the training data consists of the input and output of the original model where the input refers to the contaminant fluxes of sources and the hydraulic conductivity at pilot points and the output is the contaminant concentration at observation wells the first step is thus to generate enough input samples with the latin hypercube sampling method helton and davis 2003 on account of that it can efficiently across the given range of each sampled variable for each sample the kriging method is employed to get their interpolated field of hydraulic conductivity that is used for the next step step 2 generation of training data based on the input samples and corresponding interpolated field generated in step 1 the original numerical model is solved by modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to get the output i e solution the input samples grouped with the contaminant concentration at specific monitoring wells in the solution are treated as the training data to construct the som based surrogate model step 3 generation of validation data after generating the training data the same steps are employed to obtain the validation data to evaluate the precision of surrogate models and further to select the optimal one in this study the input of validation data shares the same range as the input of training data and the validation data size is one tenth of training data step 4 construction of surrogate model as previously mentioned the map unit is the key parameter that affects the precision of the surrogate model besides the impact of training data size i e input data size for som is also important therefore ten values from 10 to 100 are set for map units in this study which means to take one value at each interval of 10 similarly the minimum size of training data is 500 and the size is increased evenly to 4000 by the interval of 500 the varying combinations of these values are tested in the following training process carried out by som toolbox 2 1 and the validation data generates in step 3 is used to select the optimal combination of map units and training data size by which the map codebook generated is the optimal surrogate model that used for the next application step 5 application of surrogate model finally the constructed surrogate model is used for estimating the unknown components in the input vector where the known components are utilized to search for the best matching unit bmu in the map codebook and the estimated values of unknown components can be then read directly from the corresponding vector of bmu in the codebook fig 1 in this study the constructed surrogate model is applied to retrieve parameters of the contaminant transport model where the contaminant concentration at the observation wells are the known parts and the contaminant source fluxes coupled with hydraulic conductivity at pilot points are the unknown components 2 2 kriging in this study matlab toolbox dace lophaven et al 2002 was used to implement the kriging interpolation the kriging model consists of a stochastic process and regression model in the toolbox the relationship between the predictive response y x and the independent variable x is defined as sacks et al 1989 5 y x f t x β z x where z x is the random process that is assumed to be with mean zero and covariance σ 2 β is the regression parameter f x is the regression function which is usually composed of polynomials for the random process the covariance between two points x i and x j in the site can be expressed as 6 cov z x i z x j σ 2 r θ x i x j where r θ x i x j is the correlation model with parameter θ representing the spatial correlation between x i and x j given a set of known data includes sites s x 1 x m t and responses y y 1 y m t then the predictive response of the rest arbitrary site x k can be calculated by 7 y x k f t x k β r x k r 1 y f β 8 r x k r θ x k x 1 r θ x k x m 9 β f t r 1 f f t r 1 y where r 1 is the inverse matrix of correlation model r θ s f is the abbreviation of the regression model f β s based on the condition of keeping predictive response unbiased β can be figured out by eq 9 through lagrange multiplier method then the predictive response can be obtained by putting β into eq 7 thus there are three parameters to be artificially given when using the kriging method for interpolation where the first two are the type of regression function and correlation function and the last one is the correlation function parameter θ the type of regression function determines the type of kriging method for instance simple kriging assumes the regression function to be a known constant ordinary kriging also assumes a constant but unknown regression function the type of correlation function includes gaussian cubic spherical exponential function etc if the physical phenomenon is continuously differentiable the correlation function will tend to show a parabolic behavior near the origin which means that the gaussian and cubic should be chosen conversely the exponential and spherical function should be selected when physical phenomena show a linear behavior near the origin isaaks and srivastava 1991 the correlation model parameter describes the influence sphere of a point on nearby points for each dimension the kriging method based on the two point correlation model i e the variogram can only be used to describe the hydraulic conductivity field that obeys the gaussian distribution i e the aquifer is composed of single facies such as the hypothetical aquifer used in this paper for the aquifer in geological structures such as fluvial deposits there exist a highly permeable preferential flow path which leads to the aquifer is composed of multiple facies and the hydraulic conductivity not obey the gaussian distribution hence the kriging method cannot be applicable in such case caers and zhang 2004 zovi et al 2017 2 3 a hypothetical aquifer site the transport of contaminant in the saturated aquifer may involve diffusion advection dispersion absorption and desorption in this study advection and dispersion are dominated processes in a two dimensional contaminant transport system under steady state groundwater flow conditions the governing equation of the steady state groundwater flow is solved by numerical simulator modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and the advection dispersion equation of contaminant transport is solved by mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the hypothetical aquifer is a saturated and confined aquifer with a 2d steady state groundwater flow specifically the aquifer size is 500 m in the x direction and 300 m in the y direction the top and bottom boundary is no flux the constant hydraulic heads of 15 m and 10 m are the west and east boundary respectively and the aquifer thickness was 5 m the values for aquifer parameters are listed in table 2 the hypothetical aquifer is anisotropic and heterogeneous in this paper no matter in the process of building or applying the som based surrogate model the actual hydraulic conductivity field is unknown and can only be obtained by kriging interpolation on the basis of known hydraulic conductivity of sparse points in the field the sparse points include observation wells and pilot points fig 2 and the hydraulic conductivity at observation wells is the fixed known part for the pilot point the number and prior range for hydraulic conductivity are varying specifically three values for number 20 40 60 and its locations are gradually distributed from the middle area of the aquifer site to the boundaries three prior ranges for hydraulic conductivity 25 50 75 of actual values the actual hydraulic conductivity field fig 2 obeys lognormally distribution with mean 5 5 and variation 1 2 and the correlation length in x direction and y direction are 125 l and 75 l respectively two contaminant sources s1 and s2 are placed in this hypothetical aquifer fig 2 and the contaminant is only released at the first seven periods for both sources as listed in table 3 consequently 14 unknown source fluxes and hydraulic conductivities at pilot points need to be estimated the whole simulation time is 100 days that equally divided into 10 stress periods that is 10 days for each period the simulation mode for modflow and mt3dms is steady state and transient respectively the detection of pollution is always lagging in the practical situation thus there are 16 observation wells fig 2 to gather the concentration data of contaminant only in the last six stress periods sp5 sp10 2 4 assessment criteria 2 4 1 evaluation indicator of optimal som based surrogate model as mentioned in section 2 1 self organizing maps each group of training data has its corresponding validation data for the selection of an optimal combination of map unit units and training data size tds and the corresponding codebook is the optimal surrogate model after each training the ss combined with kpp and the observation data abbr obs in the validation data were separately treated as missing parts and estimated by the corresponding surrogate model the estimation of ss and kpp belongs to the inverse problem of groundwater while the estimation of obs is the problem of groundwater prediction the normalized absolute error of estimation naee is used to assess the precision of the estimation result the naee is defined as follows 10 naee i 1 n d est i d act i i 1 n d act i 100 for the naee of estimating obs i e naeeobs where d est is the estimated obs d act is the actual obs n is the product of the number of observation wells and the number of specified stress periods for gathering observation data for the naee of estimating ss i e naeess where d est is the estimated ss d act is the actual ss n is the sum of stress periods when the contaminant is released to two contaminant sources for the naee of estimating kpp i e naeekpp where d est is the estimated kpp d act is the actual kpp n is the number of pilot points based on the above three evaluation indicators the general selection principles for the optimal surrogate model are given on the premise of ensuring certain estimation precision of obs the optimal surrogate model will be the codebook trained by the combination of tds and units that obtains the highest precision minimum naee for estimating ss and kpp especially the indicator that varies in a small range will be ignored and the optimal surrogate model is selected according to the remaining indicators 2 4 2 assessment of inversion performance of constructed surrogate model the constructed surrogate model was used to estimate the actual values of ss and kpp based on known observation data the normalized absolute error of estimation naee and root mean square error rmse were employed to quantify the performance of the constructed surrogate model in estimation the definition of naee is the same as eq 14 and the definition of rmse is expressed as follows 11 rmse i 1 n d est i d act i 2 n for the rmse of estimating ss i e rmsess where d est is the estimated ss d act is the actual ss n is the sum of stress periods that contaminant is released to two contaminant sources for the rmse of estimating kpp i e rmsekpp where d est is the estimated kpp d act is the actual kpp n is the number of pilot points 3 discussion and results in this section the surrogate model was established firstly then used to estimate the actual values of contaminant flux of sources abbr ss and hydraulic conductivity at pilot point abbr kpp as explained in section 2 2 2 and the estimation to hydraulic conductivity field abbr k field was further interpolated by kriging method based on the estimated kpp abbreviations in here and the next two paragraphs were used for the conciseness of expression because they will be mentioned repeatedly in the following sections to explore the ability of the som based surrogate model to inverse ss and kpp different prior ranges were used to generate the input samples where the number of ss was constant and the number of kpp gradually increased specifically there are three discussion scenarios that ranges were set to 25 50 and 75 of actual values for each range the number of kpp increased from 20 to 40 and finally to 60 thus there are a total of nine discussion cases for all scenarios table 4 in each case the training data size abbr tds was given as follows 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 and the validation data size is 1 10 of training data size that is from 50 to 400 and the number of units was similarly set as follows 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 the parameters for kriging interpolation in the process of building and applying the som based surrogate model were listed in table 5 the initial values of the correlation parameter θ that corresponds to the correlation length of k field were 50 l and 30 l in x direction and y direction respectively furthermore taking the error of artificial knowledge to the field into account the boundaries in both directions are between 10 l and 100 l to cover the real correlation length mentioned in section 2 3 a hypothetical aquifer site in the y direction rather than in the x direction 3 1 scenario 1 in this scenario the prior range of the input sample is 25 for case 1 3 3 1 1 construction of som based surrogate model for case 1 3 according to the selection principles the naeekpp was ignored for all three cases in this scenario because of its quite low variation range within 0 08 3 1 1 1 case 1 to select the optimal surrogate model the validation results of each training in case 1 are compared in fig 3 the naee of estimating ss and obs are incremental with units precision decreased with increased units fig 3b and the optimal surrogate model is one of the codebooks generated by units 10 with different tds there are no significant variations of naeess for different tds with units 10 fig 3a therefore the optimal surrogate model is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 3000 with units 10 because of its minimum naee for estimating obs fig 3c 3 1 1 2 case 2 as the validation results depicted in fig 4 the optimal surrogate model of case 2 is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 2500 with units 10 because of its best performance minimum naee on the estimation of ss and obs fig 4a and c 3 1 1 3 case 3 the validation results of case 3 in fig 5 show that the naeess and naeekpp share a similar change trend with units as selection principles suggested the optimal surrogate model is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 1500 with units 10 where the highest precision of ss estimation fig 5a and good performance on obs estimation fig 5c were obtained simultaneously 3 1 2 application for constructed som surrogate model the naee and rmse for estimating ss and kpp are listed in table 6 in the prior range of 25 the estimation precision is fairly high for both ss and kpp which is explicitly shown in fig 6 and fig 7 specifically for estimation of ss the maximum value of naee and rmse is 1 02 and 0 30 respectively and that is 0 11 and 0 09 for kpp further the estimation precision of ss and kpp does not decrease linearly with the increase of the total number of missing components i e the sum of the amount of ss and kpp such as the naee increases from 0 99 to 1 02 and then decreases to 0 90 for ss in case 1 3 because of the high estimation precision of kpp the interpolated k field based on estimated kpp become increasingly closer to the actual k field from case 1 to case 3 fig 8 3 2 scenario 2 in this scenario the prior range of the input sample is 50 for case 4 6 3 2 1 construction of som based surrogate model for case 4 6 the naeekpp is still ignored for all three cases in this scenario because of its fairly low variation range within 0 3 3 2 1 1 case 4 the validation results of case 4 are presented in fig 9 the combinations of tds 1500 with units 10 and tds 1500 with units 30 show the worst performance on the estimation of obs despite its high precision for estimation of ss by contrast the combination of tds 3000 with units 10 performs better in estimating obs and almost provides the same estimation precision of ss fig 9a and c therefore the codebook trained with tds 3000 and units 10 is selected as the optimal surrogate model on account of the selection principles 3 2 1 2 case 5 as shown in fig 10 the validation results of each training in case 5 indicate that the optimal surrogate model should be the codebook trained by the combination of tds 2000 and units 20 because it gets the highest precision minimum naee in estimating ss and also guarantees a good precision for estimating obs fig 10a and c 3 2 1 3 case 6 by comparing the validation results displayed in fig 11 and combined with the selection principles the optimal surrogate model for case 6 is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 1000 and units 10 because it has the highest precision minimum naee in estimating ss and also shows a good performance on the estimation of obs fig 11a and c 3 2 2 application for constructed som surrogate model the naee and rmse for estimating ss and actual kpp are listed in table 7 although the results are slightly worse than scenario 1 the estimation precision of ss and kpp is still high under the prior range of 50 fig 12 and fig 13 specifically for ss the maximum value of naee and rmse is 1 98 and 0 60 respectively and that is 0 42 and 0 03 for kpp similar to scenario 1 the estimation precision of ss and kpp shows no linear relationship with the total number of missing components i e the sum of quantities of ss and kpp for instance the naee decreases from 1 98 to 1 19 and then increases to 1 61 for ss in case 4 6 and the naee of kpp increases from 0 16 to 0 42 and then decreases again to 0 26 due to the high estimation precision of kpp the interpolated k field based on estimated kpp also give an increasingly accurate representation of the actual k field from case 4 to case 6 fig 14 3 3 scenario 3 in this scenario the prior range of the input sample is 75 for case 7 9 3 3 1 construction of som based surrogate model for case 7 9 as the selection principles figured out the naeekpp which varied in a very small range within 0 4 was not considered for all three cases in this scenario 3 3 1 1 case 7 as shown in fig a 1 there are two candidates for optimal combination because of their high estimation precision of ss tds 500 with units 10 and tds 1000 with units 10 compared to the first candidates the latter one has the slight difference in estimation precision of ss but displays a much better performance for estimating obs fig a 1a and c therefore according to the selection principles the optimal surrogate model is the codebook trained by the combination of tds 1000 with units 10 3 3 1 2 case 8 similar to case 7 three candidate optimal combinations in this case for their good estimation performance on ss tds 1000 with units 10 tds 1500 with units 10 and tds 1000 with units 30 the validation results depicted in fig a 2 a and c indicate little difference exists in the three candidates for the precision of estimating ss but the last candidate has an obviously better performance on estimating obs than the first two thus obeyed with the selection principles the codebook trained by the combination of tds 1000 with units 30 is the optimal surrogate model 3 3 1 3 case 9 as shown in fig a 3 the validation results of training clearly indicate the optimal surrogate model is the codebook generated by the combination of tds 3500 with units 20 for the reason that it has the highest precision minimum naee for estimating ss and also performs well in the estimation of obs 3 3 2 application for constructed som surrogate model as summarized in table a 1 the maximum value of naee for estimation of ss and kpp is 3 16 and 1 30 respectively and that of rmse for them is 1 07 and 0 09 although the performance of the som surrogate model is inferior a little to that in scenario 2 the estimation precision is comparatively high for both ss and kpp under the prior range of 75 as demonstrated clearly in fig a 4 and fig a 5 similar to scenario 2 nonlinearity in the relationship between the estimation precision of ss and kpp and the increase of the total number of missing components i e the sum of the quantities of ss and kpp where the naee increases from 2 68 to 3 16 and then decreases to 2 06 for ss in case 7 9 and the naee of kpp increase from 0 51 to 1 30 and then decreases again to 0 54 accurate estimation of kpp resulted in better representation of the actual k field by interpolation of kpp from case 7 to case 9 fig a 6 as the number of kpp increased 3 4 summary for the scenario 1 3 the overall performance denoted by naee of estimating ss and kpp for scenario 1 3 is compared in fig 15 the estimation precision of the som based surrogate model to actual ss and kpp is fairly high for all cases in three scenarios the reason for such high precision might be that the number of map units inclined to small in this study the maximum of optimal units is 30 in scenario 1 3 and the estimation precision ought to decline as map units increases which clearly shows in the step of validation for som based surrogate model in each scenario fig 3 5 fig 9 11 fig a 1 a 3 consequently because the optimal surrogate model of case 8 is performed worst in estimating ss and kpp with the maximum of units in all of the cases the estimation precision of the surrogate models that constructed by the optimal training data size in case 8 1000 combined with other numbers of units except 30 to ss and kpp was further calculated to investigate the impact of units number on estimating ss and kpp as the estimation results displayed in fig 16 though not monotonically the precision of estimation does overall decrease with the increasing number of units as expected naee and rmse gradually increase for both of actual ss and kpp to be more specific firstly as the prior range expanded from scenario 1 to 3 the estimation precision for both ss and kpp was decreased increased naee however there is no clear linear relationship between the estimation precision and the number of missing components of ss and kpp the estimation precision was fluctuant when more missing components are considered the small interval between pilot points might be the cause of this result so the number of kpp was gradually increased to 100 200 with the prior range of 25 and 50 then the training and validation data are regenerated to construct surrogate model that was further used to inversion the estimation performance of ss and kpp displayed in fig 17 shows that the estimation accuracy generally decreases with the increase of the number of missing components but the decrease process is not strictly monotonical secondly when the number of pilot points were above 40 the key features of the actual k field could be depicted by kriging interpolation because of the high estimation precision of the surrogate model to kpp fig 8 fig 14 fig a 6 with prior range of 25 and 50 3 5 scenario 4 to test the robustness of constructed som based surrogate model the actual observation data from the 5th to the 8th time period were gradually regarded as unknown in other words only a small amount of observation data is available for estimating the actual ss and kpp and different degrees of measurement errors were also taken into account for the limited available observation data the measurement errors were assumed to follow a normal distribution where the expectation was zero and the standard deviation gradually increased from 10 20 to 30 likewise the surrogate model constructed in case 8 of scenario 3 was selected to test the robustness in this scenario due to the minimum estimation precision of ss and kpp in all cases the estimation results represented by naee and rmse remain 3 16 and 1 07 kept stable with the increasing scarcity of actual observation data table 8 i e the som based surrogate model still could estimate the ss and kpp accurately even though half of the observed data were missing fig 18 shows the estimation results on that varying degree errors were added to the limited actual observation data with lack in sp5 8 it is worth noting that to avoid the contingency estimation was repeated ten times and then calculated average for each combination of lack of data and varying degree errors for ss the naee rmse of estimation results were slightly increased from 3 16 1 07 4 92 1 64 to 5 08 1 69 when measurement error was below 20 while the naee rmse abruptly came to 9 46 2 96 when measurement error increased to 30 similarly the naee and rmse of estimation results for kpp barely changed 1 30 1 31 1 35 0 09 0 09 0 09 when measurement error under 20 but it increased from 1 35 0 09 to 1 69 0 12 when measurement error reached to 30 however the performance of the surrogate model to estimate actual kpp was still at a high level which ensures the precision of interpolated k field in summary the surrogate model constructed by the som algorithm not only could make a fairly accurate estimation for ss and kpp when observation data were insufficient but also performs well when both insufficiency and measurement errors up to 20 existed in actual observation data 4 conclusions 1 in this study the kriging method in geostatistics and self organizing maps algorithm were combined to realize the simultaneous inversion of contaminant sources and hydraulic conductivity field specifically the self organizing maps algorithm was used to construct a surrogate model to accurately replace the complex numerical model of groundwater contaminant transport and was further applied to inverse the contaminant strength of sources and hydraulic conductivity at pilot points which were used for the kriging method of geostatistics to obtain the entire hydraulic conductivity field 2 when ignoring the influence of training data size the surrogate model built by som with the units of small number overall has the higher inversion precision for both contaminant source strengths and hydraulic conductivity at pilot points 3 under the condition that there was error free and sufficient measurement data the surrogate model of contaminant transport constructed by som gains quite high precision for identifying contaminant source strengths and estimating pilot points of hydraulic conductivity consequently based on the precise estimation of sufficient pilot points the hydraulic conductivity field could be depicted accurately by the kriging method 4 although the estimation of both contaminant flux and hydraulic conductivity was fairly accurate the estimation precision of the som based surrogate model decreases obviously with the expansion of prior range under the condition that the number of pilot points was constant similarly the estimation precision generally decreases as the number of pilot points increases but the decrease process is not strictly monotonic 5 the surrogate model constructed by som for contaminant transport shows remarkable robustness even though there was a lack of more than half of the actual observation data the estimation precision was almost the same as that without missing besides varying degrees of measurement error was added to the limited available observation data and the estimation performance was still well and stable when the error level was under 20 the estimation precision begins to decrease obviously as the error reaches 30 but still at a high level

1419,a novel form of sodalite was synthesized from muscovite m sd as low cost softening material for both ca2 and mg2 ions from real groundwater in batch and column studies the sodalite sample showed significant surface area 105 m2 g and ion exchange capacity 87 3 meq 100 g which qualifies it strong for softening applications the incorporation of the m sd as a fixed bed in column system at a fixed thickness of 4 cm and flow rates of 5 ml min resulted in removal percentages of 90 5 and 92 2 for ca2 and mg2 respectively at ph 7 6 considering the real concentrations of the ions ca2 233 mg l and mg2 114 mg l the m sd bed has the ability to reduce their concentrations according to the recommended limits 75 mg l for ca2 and 50 mg l for mg2 these conditions resulted in purification of about 8 1 l and 8 7 l with breakthrough intervals of 1380 min and 1440 min and saturation interval more than 1620 min for ca2 and mg2 respectively the m sd columns performances were described considering the assumption of the thomas model adams bohart model and yoon nelson model the batch studies demonstrate the uptake of both ca2 and mg2 ions according to the pseudo first order kinetics and langmuir equilibrium behaviour considering the values of gaussian energies 0 77 kj mol ca2 and 1 36 kj mol mg2 the uptake of these ions occurred by homogenous reactions of monolayer form and physical nature the thermodynamic studies declared the spontaneous properties of the reactions and their exothermic properties keywords muscovite sodalite hardness adsorption batch fixed bed 1 introduction the groundwater resources consider an essential freshwater supplier for a safe drink and urban use in most of the world countries zeeshan et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 leaching of different species elements from natural rocks minerals and soil profile during the quarrying and the agricultural processes resulted in hazardous contamination of the water resources abukhadra et al 2019a the essential reason for the hard water is the over concentrations of ca2 and mg2 above 60 mg l abd aziz 2019 the world health organization recommended preserving the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ions lower than 75 mg l and 50 mg l in the drinking water respectively rabeh et al 2019 it was reported that the increase in the total hardness ca2 mg2 was associated with numerous environmental health and economic side effects it commonly causes scaling in the pipes as well as the water heaters which resulted in operational complications and adverse effects on machine performance the over deposition of ca2 and mg2 as carbonate layers with thickness more than 1 mm within the machines causing an increase in the consumption of the energy by 12 and a significant declination in its efficiency alghamdi et al 2019 szymanek et al 2020 regarding the health side effects the ca2 and mg2 hardness can cause diarrheal disease dermatitis pancreatic cancer cerebrovascular mortality cardiovascular disease alzheimer s disease diabetes malformations of the central nervous system childhood atopic dermatitis kidney stones digestive health constipation reproductive health and bone mineral density ghadamnan et al 2019 this problem was reported extensively in several localities in egypt including beni suef city the presence of the main groundwater aquifers in the carbonate rocks causes over increases in the ca2 and mg2 and the related hardness effect causes several health problems for the population in this area as reported in beba city rabeh et al 2019 accordingly great focus has been drawn toward the softening of the hard water from the ca2 and mg2 hardness therefore the researchers introduced various softening technologies includes evaporation chemical precipitation chemical reduction flocculation solvent extraction filtration ion exchange and adsorption szymanek et al 2020 el nahasa et al 2020 innovative adsorbents and ion exchangers based on the natural aluminosilicate structure were assessed as promising products that are of high affinity for the different metal ions abukhadra and mostafa 2019 pourshadlou et al 2020 alshameri et al 2018 the zeolitic materials either the natural or the

distinguished nanoporous structure significant surface area ion exchange capacity mechanical stability chemical flexibility surface reactivity and eco friendly properties shaban et al 2017 manto et al 2018 liu et al 2018 numerous species of synthetic zeolites were produced from different natural aluminosilicate structures especially the clay minerals of kaolinite and bentonite in addition to other chemical precursors kankrej et al 2018 xue et al 2014 malonda et al 2019 the incorporated raw materials as well as the synthetic conditions are of strong impact in controlling the technical properties of the resulted zeolite especially the porous structure the surface area the adsorption capacity and the ion exchange properties shaban et al 2017 abukhadra et al 2019b the synthetic zeolite phases from clay minerals were recommended for the commercial and availability considerations however other forms of layered aluminosilicate structure of lower cost and different technical properties can be investigated to enhance the properties of the synthetic zeolite abukhadra and mostafa 2019 muscovite is a known phyllosilicate natural mineral of hydrous aluminosilicate composition the layered structure of muscovite is saturated with potassium ions in its structure either as free or occupying the inter unit spaces jia et al 2015 selim et al 2018 muscovite in the raw form is of excellent adsorption capacity in the decontamination of arsenite arsenate and ammonia from water chakraborty et al 2007 bentabol and cruz 2016 recently muscovite proved promising qualification as a precursor in the production of novel forms of cancrinite and phillipsite as synthetic zeolites by the alkaline hydrothermal transformation of its crystals selim et al 2018 abukhadra and mostafa 2019 the adsorption of ca2 as well as mg2 by zeolite involved the operation of two controlling processes the first process is the ion exchange process or the outer surface complexation mechanism this process involved replacement reactions for the ca2 and mg2 ions with the free ions within the structural channels of sodalite in addition to partial substitution reactions with some of the exchangeable ions within the structural units abukhadra and mohamed 2019 doula and ioannou 2003 this occurs rapidly and characterizes the initiation stages of the reactions and sometimes of reversible properties morali 2006 after that the influence of the ion exchange process in inducing the capturing of both ca2 and mg2 ions declined systematically demonstrating the dominance of another uptake mechanism that is known as inner complexation normal adsorption the adsorption processes might include electrostatic attraction coulombic attractive forces chemical complexation and chemical binding morali 2006 shaban and abukhadra 2017 there are other mechanisms that were reported as a secondary or assistant process that is of considerable effect during the uptake reactions shaban and abukhadra 2017 the precipitation was detected as a secondary mechanism during the adsorption of both ca2 and mg2 as a common assistant mechanism for zeolite especially at high concentrations this mechanism is of an effective role after the complete saturation of all the present active receptors of sodalite by the ca2 and mg2 ions inglezakis et al 2005 the systematic studies about the synthesis of innovative forms of synthetic zeolite from muscovite as potential adsorbents and ion exchangers for the different water pollutants were not covered by satisfying studies yet therefore the introduced study involved the synthesis of new forms of muscovite based sodalite as a potential adsorbent in the softening of hard real groundwater samples enriched in both ca2 and mg2 ions the synthetic sodalite was assessed as a novel fixed bed in column system for the softening of groundwater from ca2 and mg2 total hardness the column performances as well as the adsorption mechanism were evaluated deeply in the study 2 hydro geochemical

groundwater sample in this manuscript is a representative sample for 5 groundwater wells in the beni suef area with ca2 and mg2 concentrations of 233 mg l and 114 mg l respectively 3 experimental work 3 1 materials muscovite was obtained as a raw mineral from wadi mubarak mine of feldspars in the eastern desert egypt and naoh pellets 97 alfa aesar company was applied in the production of sodalite raw groundwater samples were collected from some closed groundwater wells in beni suef governorate egypt the collected water samples from the wells were preserved using polypropylene bottles after the acidification of them using diluted nitric acid to avoid the possible precipitation of the dissolved ions finally the water samples were kept in a refrigerator at 2 c for further studies 3 2 synthesis of the sodalite the muscovite sample was ground using a home blender to reduce the size to size range from 20 μm to 100 μm the ground product was thermally activated at 950 c for 4 h and then mixed 3

of ca2 and mg2 ions from the groundwater sample was addressed using a column system composed of a borosilicate cylinder 15 cm length 2 cm internal diameter containing a fixed bed of sodalite the sodalite powder was packed carefully using a sheet of polyethylene wool and a sheet of plastic mesh which were used to avoid the expected leaching of the sodalite powder with the influent water a peristaltic pump was applied to control the flow rate of the effluent water in the system the performance of the sodalite bed was followed by the chemical analysis of the treated water effluent after regular intervals of 60 min the ph was considered at the same value of the groundwater sample without modification ph 7 6 and the other factors were studied within the range from 1 cm to 4 cm for the

naoh the alkaline solution was delivered to the column system at an adjusted flow rate of 1 5 ml min and this step was triplicated to confirm the successful rinsing of the sodalite bed then the sd bed was reused again in new decontamination runs for the ca2 and mg2 hardness and its recyclability properties were assessed as a function of the obtained breakthrough parameters the addressed regeneration tests were completed considering the previously estimated conditions of the sodalite bed thickness as well as the studied flow rate 3 6 batch adsorption studies the batch tests were completed based on two essential factors of the sodalite dosage in g l and the contact time in min the concentration was fixed at its natural value 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 and the ph was fixed

were completely converted into the octahedron habit of sodalite fig 2c the sodalite crystals also appeared in twinning form in which prismatic sodalite grains intersect with each other producing flower like shapes fig 2c as a result of the significant changes in the structural and morphological features the formation of sodalite associated with noticeable changes in the textural properties table 1 the surface area and pore volume increased from 6 2 m2 g and 0 173 cm3 g for muscovite to 105 m2 g and 0 220 cm3 g for sodalite respectively table 1 the average diameter of the pores declined from 18 3 nm for the muscovite flakes to 8 3 nm for the sodalite crystals additionally the ion exchange capacities increased strongly from 3 12 meq 100 g for muscovite to 87 3 meq 100 g for the synthetic sodalite table 1 chemically the alteration from muscovite to sodalite resulted in considerable changes in the chemical composition based on the edx analysis the raw muscovite composed of 16

both al and si after the transformation reaction which might be related to the expected leaching or substitution of them by the na ion of the naoh solution which was supported by the increase in the sodium content of sodalite abukhadra et al 2020a this also is of a noticeable effect on the structural chemical groups the functional groups of muscovite were identified at 3620 1 cm oh 1650 1 cm

into sodalite the ft ir spectrum showed the same peaks but at deviated sites reflected significant changes in the essential structural units fig 3b b moreover the oh related bands appeared with higher intensification than muscovite this revealed the role of the naoh solution in exposing the siloxane groups by its etching effect shaban et al 2018 fig 3b b 4 2 fixed bed column studies 4 2 1 effect of the column s parameters 4 2 1 1 influence of m sd bed height the direct influence of the thickness of the used m sd bed in the adsorption performance of the designed column systems for both ca2 and mg2 was assessed within a studied range from 1 cm up to 4 cm fig 4 the controlling factors of the column were considered at the real ph value ph 7 6 the real concentration of the ions 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 and the adjusted flow rate of 5 ml min for total flow interval of 1620 min the incorporation of the m sd bed at high thickness is of strong positive effect in inducing the lifetime of the column as well as its performance during the decontamination of both ca2 and mg2 ions from the groundwater sample fig 4a and b table 2 during the decontamination of the ca2 hardness the recognized time intervals of breakthrough induced by 660 min 1080 min 1200 min and 1380 min after incorporating the m sd bed at adjusted thicknesses of 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm respectively fig 4a table 2 moreover the ca2 exhausted or the saturated time interval expanded significantly by 1200 min 1440 min 1560 min and 1620 min with testing the previously reported thicknesses for the m sd bed in order fig 4a table 2 this associated with strong enhancement in the achieved ca2 removal percentages by 32 1 cm 58 5 2 cm 69 7 3 cm and 90 5 4 cm the estimated parameters for the column during the reduction of ca2 hardness using m sd bed of 4 cm thickness declared achieving total removal percentage r of 90 5 after treating about 8 liter of the groundwater sample fig 4a table 2 the total pumped ca2 ions at this test is 47 854 8 m total mg and the total adsorbed calcium during the test is 43 330 1 mg q total and this associated with 10 784 6 as adsorption capacity for m sd as a bed cad table 2 the maximum ca2 adsorption capacity of the m sd particles in the bed is 12 782 3 mg g qeq considering the experimental conditions this was reported also for the reduction of the mg2 hardness from the studied groundwater sample fig 4b table 2 the lifetime as well as the saturation time was expanded by testing the m sd bed at a high thickness from 1 cm up to 4 cm fig 4b table 2 they achieved breakthrough time increased from 900 min up to 1440 min with the regular increase in the m sd thickness from 1 cm to 4 cm also the saturation time also was induced from 1260 min to more than 1620 min with increasing the thickness of the testing bed from 1 cm to 4 cm table 2 such positive effects in enhancing the removal performances of m sd bed for mg2 prompted by 43 2 1 cm 69 2 2 cm 76 7 3 cm and 92 2 4 cm fig 4b table 2 the used m sd bed of 4 cm thickness achieved a total mg2 removal percentage of 92 2 after treating about 8 7 liter of the groundwater sample fig 4b table 2 the total pumped mg2 ions at this condition is 18 790 4 mg m total and the total adsorbed mg2 ions during the test is 17 322 mg q total this associated with 4277 5 mg l cad as adsorption capacity for m sd as a bed table 2 the maximum mg2 adsorption capacity of the m sd particles in the bed is 6771 mg g qeq considering the experimental conditions table 2 the observed improvement in the performance of the n sd bed as a function of its lifetime saturated time and the reduction percentages of both ca2 and mg2 was credited essentially to the expected declination in the occurred axial dispersion of the mass transfer which is of strong positive influence in inducing the diffusion rate of the ca2 and mg2 ions within the particles of the m sd bed mohan et al 2017 additionally the presence of the sodalite particles in high thickness provides the diffused ions high residence interval for ca2 and mg2 in contact with the active sites of the m sd grains which will induce the capturing performances of them abukhadra et al 2019c using the m sd bed at the thickness of 3 cm and 4 cm resulted in a significant reduction in the concentrations of ca2 from 233 mg l in the raw sample to 70 59 mg l and 22 mg l respectively which are within the acceptable limit for its concentration in water according to who 75 mg l for mg 2 the incorporation of the m sd bed at the thicknesses of 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm reduced its concentration from 114 mg l in the water sample to 35 mg l 26 5 mg l and 8 9 mg l respectively which are acceptable concentrations according to the standards of who 50 mg l 4 2 1 2 influence of flow rate the predicted impact of the adjusted flow rates on the technical performance of the m sd based column system was inspected within an experimental range from 5 ml min to 20 ml min fig 4c and d table 2 the controlling factors of the column were considered at the real ph value ph 7 6 the real concentration of the ions 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 adjusted m sd thickness of 4 cm and total flow interval of 1620 min based on the ca2 and mg2 breakthrough curves and the estimated parameters the flow rates of the pumped water is of strong influence in reducing the efficiency of the m sd bed as well as its lifetime fig 4c and d table 2 the required interval to attend the breakthrough point during the decontamination of ca2 hardness declined to 1380 min 1080 min 780 min and 600 min after inducing the flow rates of the pumped groundwater by 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively fig 4c table 2 also the saturation points for these flow rates were obtained at descending values of more than 1620 min 1500 min 1140 min and 1020 min in order fig 4c table 2 however there is a noticeable increment in the volumes of the treated water with pumping the polluted water at high rates the recognized parameters for the performance of the column declared negative effect of such high flow rates the percentages of the total declination in the present ca2 ions decrease by 90 5 59 2 33 7 and 25 3 for the studied flow rates of 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively table 2 also the adsorption capacity of m sd as a fixed bed cad declined regularly to 10 784 6 mg l 8629 9 mg l 6426 2 mg l 6426 2 mg l and 5484 7 mg l for the previous flow rates in order table 2 this was observed also for the decontamination of mg2 hardness the recorded breakthrough points are of strong declination to 1440 min 960 min 780 min and 600 min with raising the flow rates to 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively fig 4d table 2 also the saturation points were observed in descending values of more than 1620 min 1370 min 1140 min and 1020 min for the previously studied flow rates in order fig 4d table 2 also the recognized mg2 removal percentage declined strongly by 92 2 45 9 33 3 and 23 by inducing the flow rates of the pumped water to 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively fig 4d table 2 this was reported also in the significant declination in the capacity of m sd bed cad as its mg2 adsorption capacity at these values of the flow rates are 4277 5 mg l 2981 7 mg l 2519 5 mg l and 2064 6 mg l in order table 2 such observations and the followed behaviour of the m sd bed as a function of the flow rates related to the strong impact of the high flow rates in reducing the satisfy residence time which provides the adsorbent the required interval for effective capturing of the pumped ions in the water sample abukhadra et al 2019c this in turn affects negatively the performance of the column system as the used bed cannot attend to its uptake capacity nazari et al 2016 abdolali et al 2017 additionally the higher flow rates associated with a strong increase in the quantities of the pumped ions into the system causing fast saturation of the particles of the sodalite bed 4 2 1 3 regeneration properties of m sd bed the performance of the m sd bed in the three regeneration or reusing cycles was assessed considering the thickness of the sodalite bed at 4 cm the flow rate at 5 ml min and the other factors at their natural values of ph 7 6 the real concentration of the ions 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 respectively and total flow interval of 1620 min fig 4e and f table 2 based on the plotted curves as well as the calculated parameters the synthetic muscovite based sodalite as fixed bed in a continuous column system is of promising recyclability properties either in the decontamination of ca2 and mg2 ions fig 4e and f table 2 during the regeneration tests for the removal of ca2 ions the observed total removal percentages at cycle 1 cycle 2 and cycle 3 are 90 5 50 79 and 25 74 respectively fig 4e table 2 for the decontamination of mg2 hardness the observed removal percentages on the three regeneration cycles are 92 4 cycle 1 49 6 cycle 2 and 26 9 cycle 3 fig 4f table 2 such declination in the removal percentages associated with a decrease in the saturation time to 1620 min cycle 1 1380 min cycle 2 and 1020 min cycle 3 for ca2 also the treated volumes declined to 1200 ml cycle 1 1000 ml cycle 2 and 800 ml cycle 3 fig 4e table 2 for mg2 the saturation time declined to 1620 min cycle 1 1320 min cycle 2 and 1080 min cycle 3 for ca2 and the treated volumes also declined to 1200 ml cycle 1 1000 ml cycle 2 and 800 ml cycle 3 fig 4f table 2 the observed declination in the performance of the sodalite fixed bed as well as its lifetime with repeating the regeneration cycles was assigned to several reasons including a the predicted leaching of m sd grains with the water effluents b the continuous complexing between the adsorbed ca2 as well as mg2 ions and the active functional groups of sodalite reduce the performance of the bed with repeating the test and c the continuous replacement of the exchangeable ions by ca2 and mg2 ions reduce the role of this mechanism during the adsorption processes abukhadra and mohamed 2019 4 2 2 modeling of the m sd column system the study involved three kinetic models to describe the dynamic properties of the sodalite based column system including the performance as well the breakthrough adsorption behaviour the studied models are thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson kinetic models generally the theoretical assumption of both adam bohart and yoon nelson kinetic models applied in the prediction of the breakthrough activity of the incorporated fixed bed and its adsorption affinity toward the dissolved pollutants in the groundwater influents especially at the initial stages of the decontamination process mohan et al 2017 negrea et al 2020 the determined parameters of these kinetic models are of promising scientific indications about the actual performance of the bed based on the calculated saturation concentration the bed adsorption capacity and the required interval to attend 50 of the breakthrough value abukhadra et al 2020b the kinetic properties of the m sd bed were evaluated considering the nonlinear fitting processes with thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson kinetic models the three models were described by their linear equations of eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 respectively 7 ln c o c t 1 k th q 0 m f k th c o t 8 ln c t c o k ab c o t k ab n o z u o 9 ln c t c o c t k yn t τ k yn 4 2 2 1 thomas model the assumption of the thomas model suggested the retention of the ca2 and mg2 ions within the m sd bed according to second order adsorption kinetic the column systems which can be described by this model involved adsorption reactions of reversible properties with the langmuir equilibrium behaviour without observable effect for the dispersion axial and without limitation for the effect of the internal and or the external diffusion of the ca2 and mg2 ions nazari et al 2016 soto et al 2017 the obtained determination coefficient values either for the effect of the sd thickness or for the applied flow rates reflected strong agreement between the occurred adsorption reactions within the bed and the assumption of this model for both ca2 and mg2 ions fig 5a b c and d table 3 the presented parameters demonstrated a reduction in the m sd equilibrium capacities with raising its thickness as a fixed bed from 1 cm to 4 cm for both ca2 and mg2 ions the applied flow rate resulted in inducing the m sd equilibrium capacity from 5 ml min to 20 ml min table 3 the obtained values for ca2 are 747 8 mg g 5 ml min 1072 mg g 10 ml min 1179 mg g 15 ml min and 1356 mg g 20 ml min table 3 for mg2 the recognized values are 291 mg g 5 ml min 370 mg g 10 ml min 468 3 mg g 15 ml min and 512 87 mg g 20 ml min table 3 4 2 2 2 adams bohart model adams bohart s model as a kinetic model is of valuable contribution in explaining the transport behaviours of the ca2 and mg2 ions within the m sd fixed bed of the column the assumption of this model suggests constant adsorption capacities for the ca2 and mg2 ions within the m sd bed by adsorption processes of stepping isotherm properties de franco et al 2017 the breakthrough data are of observable agreement with the assumption of the adams bohart model either at the different studied m sd thicknesses or the different flow rates fig 5e f g and h table 3 as theoretical parameters the saturation concentrations no of both ca2 and mg2 ions declined regularly with increasing the thickness of the sodalite bed this behaviour shows reversible properties with upgrading the applied flow rates the theoretical values of the saturation concentrations no increased noticeably with pumping the water at high flow rates table 3 4 2 2 3 yoon nelson model the yoon nelson model used essentially to predict the saturation interval of the m sd bed during the decontamination of both ca2 and mg2 ions as well as the nature of their adsorption reactions considering the experimental concentrations at certain values abukhadra et al 2020a the column systems that are of yoon nelson kinetic behaviour the breakthrough properties of the m sd fixed bed controlled the uptake rates of both ca2 and mg2 ions mohan et al 2017 generally the reported determination coefficient values r2 demonstrate the agreement between the m sd column data and the yoon nelson kinetic properties fig 5i j k and l table 3 as a theoretical parameter the m sd bed can attend 50 of its saturation capacity after 897 min 1206 min 1347 min and 1704 min reflecting a significant increase with increasing the bed thickness by 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm respectively for ca2 for mg2 the obtained values increased to 1019 min 1338 min 1432 min and 1686 8 min in order table 3 this reflects the possible enhancement in the column lifetime by incorporating the m sd bed at a high thickness table 3 the higher flow rates appeared to be of negative effect on the lifetime of the m sd based column as the required time to achieve 50 of the saturation capacity declined to 1604 min 1212 min 894 min and 722 min with testing the flow rates at 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively for ca2 ions table 3 also this was observed for mg2 the values were reduced to 1686 8 min 1081 6 min 910 min and 669 min in order table 3 adjusting both the thickness and the flow rate at suitable values can result in promising decontamination values for both ca2 and mg2 ions with significant volumes 4 3 batch adsorption studies 4 3 1 kinetic studies 4 3 1 1 influence of time the influence of the contact time on the batch uptake behaviours of both ca2 and mg2 ions by m sd was assessed from 30 min to 720 min considering the experimental factors at 0 02 g l as m sd dosage 500 ml as volume ph 7 6 233 mg l and 114 mg l as the natural concentrations of ca2 and mg2 respectively fig 6a generally the reported capacities of m sd for both ca2 and mg2 ions display curves of two segments fig 6a these two segments identify two different uptake rates for them by the receptors of m sd firstly the uptake of both ca2 and mg2 ions occurred at a very fast rate and abrupt changes in the values which were categorized as the first segment fig 6a then the uptake rates declined significantly and the changes in the ca2 and mg2 uptake capacities appeared to be limited or of negligible values declaring stages of equilibration fig 6a this behaviour is common in the adsorption systems and related to the extensive availability of the free receptors with starting the reactions with time such receptors occupied regularly by the ca2 and mg2 ions which reduce their uptake rates as the adsorption reactions became restricted to the residual receptors jiang et al 2020 the identified equilibration intervals of ca2 and mg2 ions are 240 in and 360 min respectively and the obtained equilibrium capacities are 522 mg g ca2 and 360 mg g mg2 4 3 1 2 kinetic modeling the kinetic properties of m sd during the realistic uptake of ca2 and mg2 ions were described based on the assumption of intra particle diffusion pseudo first order and pseudo second order models and their equations were presented in table s1 the intra particle diffusion curves for both ca2 and mg2 ions are of segmental properties demonstrating different mechanisms rather than the diffusion effect of the ions salam et al 2020 fig 6b these three observable segments the first segment which is the dominant segment and cover the initial stages of the reactions related to external adsorption processes by surficial receptors abukhadra et al 2020b fig 6b the kinetic properties of m sd during the realistic uptake of ca2 and mg2 ions were described based on the assumption of intra particle diffusion pseudo first order and pseudo second order models and their equations were presented in table s1 the intra particle diffusion curves for both ca2 and mg2 ions are of segmental properties demonstrating different mechanisms rather than the diffusion effect of the ions salam et al 2020 fig 6b these three observable segments the first segment which is the dominant segment and cover the initial stages of the reactions related to external adsorption processes by surficial receptors abukhadra et al 2020b fig 6b the second segment declares diminishing for the role of the external receptors after their occupation with the ca2 and mg2 ions and all the uptake reactions controlled by layered adsorption processes huang et al 2014 fig 6b this process is of assistant effect during the capturing of ca2 as well as mg2 ions finally the third segment was detected after the equilibration interval and of negligible effect on the efficiency of the reactions fig 6b the recognizing of this segment reveals the creation of thick ca2 and mg2 layers on the surface of m sd by interionic attraction and or molecular association processes huang et al 2014 the fitting degrees between the ca2 and mg2 adsorption results and the other kinetic models of pseudo first order and pseudo second order were assessed based on chi squared χ2 and determination coefficient r2 of the nonlinear fitting table 4 fig 6c and d the ca2 and mg2 adsorption behaviours using m sd follow the kinetic assumption of the pseudo first order fig 6c table 4 model that suggests physisorption properties tu et al 2019 the observed very good fitting with the pseudo second order model fig 6d table 4 emphasizes the presence of some chemical mechanisms during the uptake reactions that might be involved in electron exchange surface complexation electron sharing and ion exchange process abukhadra et al 2021 sherlala et al 2019 4 3 2 equilibrium studies 4 3 2 1 effect of concentration the influence of the ca2 and mg2 concentrations were asses as an essential step to understanding the equilibrium behaviour of the m sd as an adsorbent for them the concentration influence was studied by the systematic dilution of the ca2 and mg2 concentrations the ca2 concentration was studied within the range from 35 mg l to 245 mg l and the mg2 concentration was studied from 25 mg l to 125 mg l fig 6e and f the other factors were inspected at 720 min as the time of equilibration ph 7 6 as natural ph 500 ml as volume and 0 02 g l of m sd as dosage the reported ca2 and mg2 uptake capacities using m sd induced strongly with addressing the higher concentrations of them fig 6e and f the high driving forces which can be acquired by the ca2 and mg2 ions under the saturation of the solutions by them prompt the interaction probabilities with the m sd surface and in turn the capturing efficiency jiang et al 2020 shaban et al 2018 at 210 mg l and 100 mg l the adsorption equilibrium of m sd was attended for ca2 and mg2 ions respectively declaring its maximum capacities for them ca2 522 mg g and mg2 360 mg g fig 6e and f 4 3 2 2 isotherm modeling the isotherm properties of the ca2 and mg2 uptake system using the synthetic sodalite were followed considering three equilibrium models of langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r based on the obtained nonlinear fitting degree table s1 the estimated values of both correlation coefficients r2 and chi squared x2 were presented to evaluate the fitting degree table 4 based on the fitting parameters the equilibrium behaviours of the m sd adsorption systems for both ca2 and mg2 ions follow the langmuir behaviour rather than the freundlich equilibrium behaviour fig 6g and h table 4 this suggested the uptake of them homogeneously by the receptor sites in a monolayer form abukhadra and mostafa 2019 also the rl values as a parameter for the langmuir fitting declared the favorable properties for the occurred adsorption reactions table 4 moreover based on the model the expected maximum adsorption capacities of m sd for ca2 and mg2 ions in the batch studies are 630 mg g and 427 mg g respectively table 4 the fitting parameters of the d r model were used to describe the nature of the ca2 and mg2 adsorption reactions by m sd fig 6g and h table 4 the calculated gaussian energies for the uptake of ca2 and mg2 ions are 0 77 kj mol and 1 36 kj mol respectively these values are within the range of reported gaussian energies for the physical adsorption processes less than 8 kj mol as well as the reported values for the zeolitic ion exchange reactions uğurlu and karaoğlu 2011 salam et al 2020 fig 6g and h table 4 4 3 3 thermodynamic properties the thermodynamic properties of m sd adsorption systems for ca2 and mg2 ions were assessed within a temperature range from 20 c to 50 c the experimental parameters were adjusted at 720 min contact time 500 ml studied volume 0 02 g l sodalite dosage the real concentration of the ions 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 and ph 7 6 the main parameters which were used to describe the thermodynamics of the m sd adsorption systems are gibbs free energy go which was obtained from eq 10 in addition to the enthalpy δh and entropy δs the values of both δh and δs were obtained as fitting parameters with van t hof formula eq 11 abukhadra et al 2019d fig 6i 10 g 0 rtin k c 11 in k c s o r h o rt the free energies for both ca2 and mg2 ions are of negative values declaring spontaneous and favorable uptake of them by m sd salam et al 2020 table 4 their enthalpies also were estimated as negative values which suggest the exothermic behaviour of their adsorption reactions by m sd table 4 detecting the entropy at positive values reflects a significant increment in the randomness of the reactions with the regular rising temperature salam et al 2020 moreover the presented values of both go and δh related to reactions of more physical properties 4 4 comparison study the adsorption capacities of the m sd for both ca2 and mg2 at different concentrations of them were investigated without the existence of other competitive ions the obtained maximum capacities for ca2 and mg2 as experimental values are 732 4 mg g and 563 6 mg g respectively these values in addition to the obtained adsorption capacity for the real groundwater in the batch and the column studies were compared with other studied adsorbents in literature table 5 the synthetic muscovite based sodalite m sd is of higher capacities than several studied adsorbents including natural zeolite different species of

1419,a novel form of sodalite was synthesized from muscovite m sd as low cost softening material for both ca2 and mg2 ions from real groundwater in batch and column studies the sodalite sample showed significant surface area 105 m2 g and ion exchange capacity 87 3 meq 100 g which qualifies it strong for softening applications the incorporation of the m sd as a fixed bed in column system at a fixed thickness of 4 cm and flow rates of 5 ml min resulted in removal percentages of 90 5 and 92 2 for ca2 and mg2 respectively at ph 7 6 considering the real concentrations of the ions ca2 233 mg l and mg2 114 mg l the m sd bed has the ability to reduce their concentrations according to the recommended limits 75 mg l for ca2 and 50 mg l for mg2 these conditions resulted in purification of about 8 1 l and 8 7 l with breakthrough intervals of 1380 min and 1440 min and saturation interval more than 1620 min for ca2 and mg2 respectively the m sd columns performances were described considering the assumption of the thomas model adams bohart model and yoon nelson model the batch studies demonstrate the uptake of both ca2 and mg2 ions according to the pseudo first order kinetics and langmuir equilibrium behaviour considering the values of gaussian energies 0 77 kj mol ca2 and 1 36 kj mol mg2 the uptake of these ions occurred by homogenous reactions of monolayer form and physical nature the thermodynamic studies declared the spontaneous properties of the reactions and their exothermic properties keywords muscovite sodalite hardness adsorption batch fixed bed 1 introduction the groundwater resources consider an essential freshwater supplier for a safe drink and urban use in most of the world countries zeeshan et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 leaching of different species elements from natural rocks minerals and soil profile during the quarrying and the agricultural processes resulted in hazardous contamination of the water resources abukhadra et al 2019a the essential reason for the hard water is the over concentrations of ca2 and mg2 above 60 mg l abd aziz 2019 the world health organization recommended preserving the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ions lower than 75 mg l and 50 mg l in the drinking water respectively rabeh et al 2019 it was reported that the increase in the total hardness ca2 mg2 was associated with numerous environmental health and economic side effects it commonly causes scaling in the pipes as well as the water heaters which resulted in operational complications and adverse effects on machine performance the over deposition of ca2 and mg2 as carbonate layers with thickness more than 1 mm within the machines causing an increase in the consumption of the energy by 12 and a significant declination in its efficiency alghamdi et al 2019 szymanek et al 2020 regarding the health side effects the ca2 and mg2 hardness can cause diarrheal disease dermatitis pancreatic cancer cerebrovascular mortality cardiovascular disease alzheimer s disease diabetes malformations of the central nervous system childhood atopic dermatitis kidney stones digestive health constipation reproductive health and bone mineral density ghadamnan et al 2019 this problem was reported extensively in several localities in egypt including beni suef city the presence of the main groundwater aquifers in the carbonate rocks causes over increases in the ca2 and mg2 and the related hardness effect causes several health problems for the population in this area as reported in beba city rabeh et al 2019 accordingly great focus has been drawn toward the softening of the hard water from the ca2 and mg2 hardness therefore the researchers introduced various softening technologies includes evaporation chemical precipitation chemical reduction flocculation solvent extraction filtration ion exchange and adsorption szymanek et al 2020 el nahasa et al 2020 innovative adsorbents and ion exchangers based on the natural aluminosilicate structure were assessed as promising products that are of high affinity for the different metal ions abukhadra and mostafa 2019 pourshadlou et al 2020 alshameri et al 2018 the zeolitic materials either the natural or the synthetic species are promising types of aluminosilicate structures that showed exceptional results in decontamination of different metal ions and the total hardness tang et al 2019 they are of distinguished nanoporous structure significant surface area ion exchange capacity mechanical stability chemical flexibility surface reactivity and eco friendly properties shaban et al 2017 manto et al 2018 liu et al 2018 numerous species of synthetic zeolites were produced from different natural aluminosilicate structures especially the clay minerals of kaolinite and bentonite in addition to other chemical precursors kankrej et al 2018 xue et al 2014 malonda et al 2019 the incorporated raw materials as well as the synthetic conditions are of strong impact in controlling the technical properties of the resulted zeolite especially the porous structure the surface area the adsorption capacity and the ion exchange properties shaban et al 2017 abukhadra et al 2019b the synthetic zeolite phases from clay minerals were recommended for the commercial and availability considerations however other forms of layered aluminosilicate structure of lower cost and different technical properties can be investigated to enhance the properties of the synthetic zeolite abukhadra and mostafa 2019 muscovite is a known phyllosilicate natural mineral of hydrous aluminosilicate composition the layered structure of muscovite is saturated with potassium ions in its structure either as free or occupying the inter unit spaces jia et al 2015 selim et al 2018 muscovite in the raw form is of excellent adsorption capacity in the decontamination of arsenite arsenate and ammonia from water chakraborty et al 2007 bentabol and cruz 2016 recently muscovite proved promising qualification as a precursor in the production of novel forms of cancrinite and phillipsite as synthetic zeolites by the alkaline hydrothermal transformation of its crystals selim et al 2018 abukhadra and mostafa 2019 the adsorption of ca2 as well as mg2 by zeolite involved the operation of two controlling processes the first process is the ion exchange process or the outer surface complexation mechanism this process involved replacement reactions for the ca2 and mg2 ions with the free ions within the structural channels of sodalite in addition to partial substitution reactions with some of the exchangeable ions within the structural units abukhadra and mohamed 2019 doula and ioannou 2003 this occurs rapidly and characterizes the initiation stages of the reactions and sometimes of reversible properties morali 2006 after that the influence of the ion exchange process in inducing the capturing of both ca2 and mg2 ions declined systematically demonstrating the dominance of another uptake mechanism that is known as inner complexation normal adsorption the adsorption processes might include electrostatic attraction coulombic attractive forces chemical complexation and chemical binding morali 2006 shaban and abukhadra 2017 there are other mechanisms that were reported as a secondary or assistant process that is of considerable effect during the uptake reactions shaban and abukhadra 2017 the precipitation was detected as a secondary mechanism during the adsorption of both ca2 and mg2 as a common assistant mechanism for zeolite especially at high concentrations this mechanism is of an effective role after the complete saturation of all the present active receptors of sodalite by the ca2 and mg2 ions inglezakis et al 2005 the systematic studies about the synthesis of innovative forms of synthetic zeolite from muscovite as potential adsorbents and ion exchangers for the different water pollutants were not covered by satisfying studies yet therefore the introduced study involved the synthesis of new forms of muscovite based sodalite as a potential adsorbent in the softening of hard real groundwater samples enriched in both ca2 and mg2 ions the synthetic sodalite was assessed as a novel fixed bed in column system for the softening of groundwater from ca2 and mg2 total hardness the column performances as well as the adsorption mechanism were evaluated deeply in the study 2 hydro geochemical properties of beni suef area the collected groundwater samples were collected from beni suef governorate located at the intersection of 28 45 and 29 25 n as latitudes and 30 45 and 31 15 e as longitudes fig 1 it is of a total surface area of 10 950 km2 form it about 85 is an agricultural area the drinking water demand in the area covered essentially by surface ware supplies nile river bahr youssef and el ibrahimia canal 66 and the groundwater wells 34 lithologically the surface of the beni suef area covered with sedimentary rock units of middle eocene upper eocene pliocene pleistocene and holocene ages the rock units of the eocene age are of carbonate compositions essentially karstified limestone abdel mageed 1997 the studied groundwater aquifers in the eocene rocks suffer from high salinity 4500 ppm to 6600 ppm rabeh et al 2019 additionally the tds mg2 ca2 na pb2 fe nitrate sulfate and bicarbonates pollutants were detected at high concentrations especially in the explored groundwater wells near beba city rabeh et al 2019 the previous studies demonstrated a strong effect on the leached and seepage elements from the quaternary aquifers the present rock units drainage water and industrial wastewater el kashouty 2013 melegy et al 2014 the detected concentrations of mg2 and ca2 ions are higher than the recommended limits by the who which makes the suitability of such water resources for the drinking water additionally the qualification of the sample for further agricultural use in the future will be declined regularly with time rabeh et al 2019 the studied groundwater sample in this manuscript is a representative sample for 5 groundwater wells in the beni suef area with ca2 and mg2 concentrations of 233 mg l and 114 mg l respectively 3 experimental work 3 1 materials muscovite was obtained as a raw mineral from wadi mubarak mine of feldspars in the eastern desert egypt and naoh pellets 97 alfa aesar company was applied in the production of sodalite raw groundwater samples were collected from some closed groundwater wells in beni suef governorate egypt the collected water samples from the wells were preserved using polypropylene bottles after the acidification of them using diluted nitric acid to avoid the possible precipitation of the dissolved ions finally the water samples were kept in a refrigerator at 2 c for further studies 3 2 synthesis of the sodalite the muscovite sample was ground using a home blender to reduce the size to size range from 20 μm to 100 μm the ground product was thermally activated at 950 c for 4 h and then mixed 3 g with an alkaline aqueous solution 6 g naoh 100 ml distilled water for 180 min after that the mixture was inserted in a hydrothermal system composed of teflon lined with stainless and heated for 72 h at 150 c then the final product was washed extensively with distilled water to remove the excess naoh content finally the synthetic sodalite was dried for 12 h at 80 c and labeled as m sd 3 3 characterization the used muscovite and the synthetic sodalite were identified by their xrd patterns using a panalytical x ray diffractometer empyrean scanning electron microscope sem gemini zeiss ultra 55 was used in the investigation of the morphological features at 30 kv accelerating voltage the elemental composition and the essential functional groups were followed using energy dispersive x ray edx and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir 8400s respectively the surface area and the porous structure were inspected using a surface area analyzer sa3100 type considering the obtained n2 adsorption desorption curve the change in the ion exchange capacity was followed by the bacl2 technique method according to dardir et al 2018 3 4 fixed bed column adsorption studies the adsorption of ca2 and mg2 ions from the groundwater sample was addressed using a column system composed of a borosilicate cylinder 15 cm length 2 cm internal diameter containing a fixed bed of sodalite the sodalite powder was packed carefully using a sheet of polyethylene wool and a sheet of plastic mesh which were used to avoid the expected leaching of the sodalite powder with the influent water a peristaltic pump was applied to control the flow rate of the effluent water in the system the performance of the sodalite bed was followed by the chemical analysis of the treated water effluent after regular intervals of 60 min the ph was considered at the same value of the groundwater sample without modification ph 7 6 and the other factors were studied within the range from 1 cm to 4 cm for the thickness of the sodalite bed and from 5 ml min to 20 ml min for the studied flow rates the performance of the sodalite based column system in the softening of the water from both ca2 and mg2 hardness was assessed based on the values of the breakthrough time the exhausted or saturation time the removal percentages and the shapes of the plotted curves the values of the breakthrough interval and the exhausted interval were considered after achieving removal percentages of 10 and 95 respectively the mathematical parameters which control the efficiency of the column system as the volume of the

were performed during the regeneration of the used m sd bed during the decontamination of ca2 and mg2 hardness involved careful rinsing of the sodalite particles with a diluted alkaline solution 2 5 naoh the alkaline solution was delivered to the column system at an adjusted flow rate of 1 5 ml min and this step was triplicated to confirm the successful rinsing of the sodalite bed then the sd bed was reused again in new decontamination runs for the ca2 and mg2 hardness and its recyclability properties were assessed as a function of the obtained breakthrough parameters the addressed regeneration tests were completed considering the previously estimated conditions of the sodalite bed thickness as well as the studied flow rate 3 6 batch adsorption studies the batch tests were completed based on two essential factors of the sodalite dosage in g l and the contact time in min the concentration was fixed at its natural value 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 and the ph was fixed at its detected value in the field ph 7 4 the tests were investigated in triplicate form considering the average results as the used values in the plotted curves with standard deviations lower than 4 2 the procedures of the experiments involved homogenous mixing of sodalite 0 02 g l with 500 ml of the groundwater sample for certain time intervals from 30 min to 720 min after equilibration the treated water samples were filtrated acidified by nitric acid 2 and the rest ions ca2 and mg2 were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry perkin elmer ca2 and mg2 certified

considerable deviation in their positions of the muscovite peaks 8 75o 17 56o 26 49o 35 59o and 44 92o in addition to observable declination in their intensities fig 2a b the pattern of the synthetic

03o 330 identify the cubic crystals of sodalite that was formed with an average crystallite size of 47 2 nm fig 2a c morphologically the well developed flakey habits of the muscovite grains fig 2b were completely converted into the octahedron habit of sodalite fig 2c the sodalite crystals also appeared in twinning form in which prismatic sodalite grains intersect with each other producing flower like shapes fig 2c as a result of the significant changes in the structural and morphological features the formation of sodalite associated with noticeable changes in the textural properties table 1 the surface area and pore volume increased from 6 2 m2 g and 0 173 cm3 g for muscovite to 105 m2 g and 0 220 cm3 g for sodalite respectively table 1 the average diameter of the pores declined from 18 3 nm for the muscovite flakes to 8 3 nm for the sodalite crystals additionally the ion exchange capacities increased strongly from 3 12 meq 100 g for muscovite to 87 3 meq 100 g for the synthetic sodalite table 1 chemically the alteration from muscovite to sodalite resulted in considerable changes in the chemical composition based on the edx analysis the raw muscovite composed of 16

both al and si after the transformation reaction which might be related to the expected leaching or substitution of them by the na ion of the naoh solution which was supported by the increase in the sodium content of sodalite abukhadra et al 2020a this also is of a noticeable effect on the structural chemical groups the functional groups of muscovite were identified at 3620 1 cm oh 1650 1 cm

into sodalite the ft ir spectrum showed the same peaks but at deviated sites reflected significant changes in the essential structural units fig 3b b moreover the oh related bands appeared with higher intensification than muscovite this revealed the role of the naoh solution in exposing the siloxane groups by its etching effect shaban et al 2018 fig 3b b 4 2 fixed bed column studies 4 2 1 effect of the column s parameters 4 2 1 1 influence of m sd bed height the direct influence of the thickness of the used m sd bed in the adsorption performance of the designed column systems for both ca2 and mg2 was assessed within a studied range from 1 cm up to 4 cm fig 4 the controlling factors of the column were considered at the real ph value ph 7 6 the real concentration of the ions 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 and the adjusted flow rate of 5 ml min for total flow interval of 1620 min the incorporation of the m sd bed at high thickness is of strong positive effect in inducing the lifetime of the column as well as its performance during the decontamination of both ca2 and mg2 ions from the groundwater sample fig 4a and b table 2 during the decontamination of the ca2 hardness the recognized time intervals of breakthrough induced by 660 min 1080 min 1200 min and 1380 min after incorporating the m sd bed at adjusted thicknesses of 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm respectively fig 4a table 2 moreover the ca2 exhausted or the saturated time interval expanded significantly by 1200 min 1440 min 1560 min and 1620 min with testing the previously reported thicknesses for the m sd bed in order fig 4a table 2 this associated with strong enhancement in the achieved ca2 removal percentages by 32 1 cm 58 5 2 cm 69 7 3 cm and 90 5 4 cm the estimated parameters for the column during the reduction of ca2 hardness using m sd bed of 4 cm thickness declared achieving total removal percentage r of 90 5 after treating about 8 liter of the groundwater sample fig 4a table 2 the total pumped ca2 ions at this test is 47 854 8 m total mg and the total adsorbed calcium during the test is 43 330 1 mg q total and this associated with 10 784 6 as adsorption capacity for m sd as a bed cad table 2 the maximum ca2 adsorption capacity of the m sd particles in the bed is 12 782 3 mg g qeq considering the experimental conditions this was reported also for the reduction of the mg2 hardness from the studied groundwater sample fig 4b table 2 the lifetime as well as the saturation time was expanded by testing the m sd bed at a high thickness from 1 cm up to 4 cm fig 4b table 2 they achieved breakthrough time increased from 900 min up to 1440 min with the regular increase in the m sd thickness from 1 cm to 4 cm also the saturation time also was induced from 1260 min to more than 1620 min with increasing the thickness of the testing bed from 1 cm to 4 cm table 2 such positive effects in enhancing the removal performances of m sd bed for mg2 prompted by 43 2 1 cm 69 2 2 cm 76 7 3 cm and 92 2 4 cm fig 4b table 2 the used m sd bed of 4 cm thickness achieved a total mg2 removal percentage of 92 2 after treating about 8 7 liter of the groundwater sample fig 4b table 2 the total pumped mg2 ions at this condition is 18 790 4 mg m total and the total adsorbed mg2 ions during the test is 17 322 mg q total this associated with 4277 5 mg l cad as adsorption capacity for m sd as a bed table 2 the maximum mg2 adsorption capacity of the m sd particles in the bed is 6771 mg g qeq considering the experimental conditions table 2 the observed improvement in the performance of the n sd bed as a function of its lifetime saturated time and the reduction percentages of both ca2 and mg2 was credited essentially to the expected declination in the occurred axial dispersion of the mass transfer which is of strong positive influence in inducing the diffusion rate of the ca2 and mg2 ions within the particles of the m sd bed mohan et al 2017 additionally the presence of the sodalite particles in high thickness provides the diffused ions high residence interval for ca2 and mg2 in contact with the active sites of the m sd grains which will induce the capturing performances of them abukhadra et al 2019c using the m sd bed at the thickness of 3 cm and 4 cm resulted in a significant reduction in the concentrations of ca2 from 233 mg l in the raw sample to 70 59 mg l and 22 mg l respectively which are within the acceptable limit for its concentration in water according to who 75 mg l for mg 2 the incorporation of the m sd bed at the thicknesses of 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm reduced its concentration from 114 mg l in the water sample to 35 mg l 26 5 mg l and 8 9 mg l respectively which are acceptable concentrations according to the standards of who 50 mg l 4 2 1 2 influence of flow rate the predicted impact of the adjusted flow rates on the technical performance of the m sd based column system was inspected within an experimental range from 5 ml min to 20 ml min fig 4c and d table 2 the controlling factors of the column were considered at the real ph value ph 7 6 the real concentration of the ions 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 adjusted m sd thickness of 4 cm and total flow interval of 1620 min based on the ca2 and mg2 breakthrough curves and the estimated parameters the flow rates of the pumped water is of strong influence in reducing the efficiency of the m sd bed as well as its lifetime fig 4c and d table 2 the required interval to attend the breakthrough point during the decontamination of ca2 hardness declined to 1380 min 1080 min 780 min and 600 min after inducing the flow rates of the pumped groundwater by 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively fig 4c table 2 also the saturation points for these flow rates were obtained at descending values of more than 1620 min 1500 min 1140 min and 1020 min in order fig 4c table 2 however there is a noticeable increment in the volumes of the treated water with pumping the polluted water at high rates the recognized parameters for the performance of the column declared negative effect of such high flow rates the percentages of the total declination in the present ca2 ions decrease by 90 5 59 2 33 7 and 25 3 for the studied flow rates of 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively table 2 also the adsorption capacity of m sd as a fixed bed cad declined regularly to 10 784 6 mg l 8629 9 mg l 6426 2 mg l 6426 2 mg l and 5484 7 mg l for the previous flow rates in order table 2 this was observed also for the decontamination of mg2 hardness the recorded breakthrough points are of strong declination to 1440 min 960 min 780 min and 600 min with raising the flow rates to 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively fig 4d table 2 also the saturation points were observed in descending values of more than 1620 min 1370 min 1140 min and 1020 min for the previously studied flow rates in order fig 4d table 2 also the recognized mg2 removal percentage declined strongly by 92 2 45 9 33 3 and 23 by inducing the flow rates of the pumped water to 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively fig 4d table 2 this was reported also in the significant declination in the capacity of m sd bed cad as its mg2 adsorption capacity at these values of the flow rates are 4277 5 mg l 2981 7 mg l 2519 5 mg l and 2064 6 mg l in order table 2 such observations and the followed behaviour of the m sd bed as a function of the flow rates related to the strong impact of the high flow rates in reducing the satisfy residence time which provides the adsorbent the required interval for effective capturing of the pumped ions in the water sample abukhadra et al 2019c this in turn affects negatively the performance of the column system as the used bed cannot attend to its uptake capacity nazari et al 2016 abdolali et al 2017 additionally the higher flow rates associated with a strong increase in the quantities of the pumped ions into the system causing fast saturation of the particles of the sodalite bed 4 2 1 3 regeneration properties of m sd bed the performance of the m sd bed in the three regeneration or reusing cycles was assessed considering the thickness of the sodalite bed at 4 cm the flow rate at 5 ml min and the other factors at their natural values of ph 7 6 the real concentration of the ions 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 respectively and total flow interval of 1620 min fig 4e and f table 2 based on the plotted curves as well as the calculated parameters the synthetic muscovite based sodalite as fixed bed in a continuous column system is of promising recyclability properties either in the decontamination of ca2 and mg2 ions fig 4e and f table 2 during the regeneration tests for the removal of ca2 ions the observed total removal percentages at cycle 1 cycle 2 and cycle 3 are 90 5 50 79 and 25 74 respectively fig 4e table 2 for the decontamination of mg2 hardness the observed removal percentages on the three regeneration cycles are 92 4 cycle 1 49 6 cycle 2 and 26 9 cycle 3 fig 4f table 2 such declination in the removal percentages associated with a decrease in the saturation time to 1620 min cycle 1 1380 min cycle 2 and 1020 min cycle 3 for ca2 also the treated volumes declined to 1200 ml cycle 1 1000 ml cycle 2 and 800 ml cycle 3 fig 4e table 2 for mg2 the saturation time declined to 1620 min cycle 1 1320 min cycle 2 and 1080 min cycle 3 for ca2 and the treated volumes also declined to 1200 ml cycle 1 1000 ml cycle 2 and 800 ml cycle 3 fig 4f table 2 the observed declination in the performance of the sodalite fixed bed as well as its lifetime with repeating the regeneration cycles was assigned to several reasons including a the predicted leaching of m sd grains with the water effluents b the continuous complexing between the adsorbed ca2 as well as mg2 ions and the active functional groups of sodalite reduce the performance of the bed with repeating the test and c the continuous replacement of the exchangeable ions by ca2 and mg2 ions reduce the role of this mechanism during the adsorption processes abukhadra and mohamed 2019 4 2 2 modeling of the m sd column system the study involved three kinetic models to describe the dynamic properties of the sodalite based column system including the performance as well the breakthrough adsorption behaviour the studied models are thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson kinetic models generally the theoretical assumption of both adam bohart and yoon nelson kinetic models applied in the prediction of the breakthrough activity of the incorporated fixed bed and its adsorption affinity toward the dissolved pollutants in the groundwater influents especially at the initial stages of the decontamination process mohan et al 2017 negrea et al 2020 the determined parameters of these kinetic models are of promising scientific indications about the actual performance of the bed based on the calculated saturation concentration the bed adsorption capacity and the required interval to attend 50 of the breakthrough value abukhadra et al 2020b the kinetic properties of the m sd bed were evaluated considering the nonlinear fitting processes with thomas adams bohart and yoon nelson kinetic models the three models were described by their linear equations of eq 7 eq 8 and eq 9 respectively 7 ln c

ions within the m sd bed according to second order adsorption kinetic the column systems which can be described by this model involved adsorption reactions of reversible properties with the langmuir equilibrium behaviour without observable effect for the dispersion axial and without limitation for the effect of the internal and or the external diffusion of the ca2 and mg2 ions nazari et al 2016 soto et al 2017 the obtained determination coefficient values either for the effect of the sd thickness or for the applied flow rates reflected strong agreement between the occurred adsorption reactions within the bed and the assumption of this model for both ca2 and mg2 ions fig 5a b c and d table 3 the presented parameters demonstrated a reduction in the m sd equilibrium capacities with raising its thickness as a fixed bed from 1 cm to 4 cm for both ca2 and mg2 ions the applied flow rate resulted in inducing the m sd equilibrium capacity from 5 ml min to 20 ml min table 3 the obtained values for ca2 are 747 8 mg g 5 ml min 1072 mg g 10 ml min 1179 mg g 15 ml min and 1356 mg g 20 ml min table 3 for mg2 the recognized values are 291 mg g 5 ml min 370 mg g 10 ml min 468 3 mg g 15 ml min and 512 87 mg g 20 ml min table 3 4 2 2 2 adams bohart model adams bohart s model as a kinetic model is of valuable contribution in explaining the transport behaviours of the ca2 and mg2 ions within the m sd fixed bed of the column the assumption of this model suggests constant adsorption capacities for the ca2 and mg2 ions within the m sd bed by adsorption processes of stepping isotherm properties de franco et al 2017 the breakthrough data are of observable agreement with the assumption of the adams bohart model either at the different studied m sd thicknesses or the different flow rates fig 5e f g and h table 3 as theoretical parameters the saturation concentrations no of both ca2 and mg2 ions declined regularly with increasing the thickness of the sodalite bed this behaviour shows reversible properties with upgrading the applied flow rates the theoretical values of the saturation concentrations no increased noticeably with pumping the water at high flow rates table 3 4 2 2 3 yoon nelson model the yoon nelson model used essentially to predict the saturation interval of the m sd bed during the decontamination of both ca2 and mg2 ions as well as the nature of their adsorption reactions considering the experimental concentrations at certain values abukhadra et al 2020a the column systems that are of yoon nelson kinetic behaviour the breakthrough properties of the m sd fixed bed controlled the uptake rates of both ca2 and mg2 ions mohan et al 2017 generally the reported determination coefficient values r2 demonstrate the agreement between the m sd column data and the yoon nelson kinetic properties fig 5i j k and l table 3 as a theoretical parameter the m sd bed can attend 50 of its saturation capacity after 897 min 1206 min 1347 min and 1704 min reflecting a significant increase with increasing the bed thickness by 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm respectively for ca2 for mg2 the obtained values increased to 1019 min 1338 min 1432 min and 1686 8 min in order table 3 this reflects the possible enhancement in the column lifetime by incorporating the m sd bed at a high thickness table 3 the higher flow rates appeared to be of negative effect on the lifetime of the m sd based column as the required time to achieve 50 of the saturation capacity declined to 1604 min 1212 min 894 min and 722 min with testing the flow rates at 5 ml min 10 ml min 15 ml min and 20 ml min respectively for ca2 ions table 3 also this was observed for mg2 the values were reduced to 1686 8 min 1081 6 min 910 min and 669 min in order table 3 adjusting both the thickness and the flow rate at suitable values can result in promising decontamination values for both ca2 and mg2 ions with significant volumes 4 3 batch adsorption studies 4 3 1 kinetic studies 4 3 1 1 influence of time the influence of the contact time on the batch uptake behaviours of both ca2 and mg2 ions by m sd was assessed from 30 min to 720 min considering the experimental factors at 0 02 g l as m sd dosage 500 ml as volume ph 7 6 233 mg l and 114 mg l as the natural concentrations of ca2 and mg2 respectively fig 6a generally the reported capacities of m sd for both ca2 and mg2 ions display curves of two segments fig 6a these two segments identify two different uptake rates for them by the receptors of m sd firstly the uptake of both ca2 and mg2 ions occurred at a very fast rate and abrupt changes in the values which were categorized as the first segment fig 6a then the uptake rates declined significantly and the changes in the ca2 and mg2 uptake capacities appeared to be limited or of negligible values declaring stages of equilibration fig 6a this behaviour is common in the adsorption systems and related to the extensive availability of the free receptors with starting the reactions with time such receptors occupied regularly by the ca2 and mg2 ions which reduce their uptake rates as the adsorption reactions became restricted to the residual receptors jiang et al 2020 the identified equilibration intervals of ca2 and mg2 ions are 240 in and 360 min respectively and the obtained equilibrium capacities are 522 mg g ca2 and 360 mg g mg2 4 3 1 2 kinetic modeling the kinetic properties of m sd during the realistic uptake of ca2 and mg2 ions were described based on the assumption of intra particle diffusion pseudo first order and pseudo second order models and their equations were presented in table s1 the intra particle diffusion curves for both ca2 and mg2 ions are of segmental properties demonstrating different mechanisms rather than the diffusion effect of the ions salam et al 2020 fig 6b these three observable segments the first segment which is the dominant segment and cover the initial stages of the reactions related to external adsorption processes by surficial receptors abukhadra et al 2020b fig 6b the kinetic properties of m sd during the realistic uptake of ca2 and mg2 ions were described based on the assumption of intra particle diffusion pseudo first order and pseudo second order models and their equations were presented in table s1 the intra particle diffusion curves for both ca2 and mg2 ions are of segmental properties demonstrating different mechanisms rather than the diffusion effect of the ions salam et al 2020 fig 6b these three observable segments the first segment which is the dominant segment and cover the initial stages of the reactions related to external adsorption processes by surficial receptors abukhadra et al 2020b fig 6b the second segment declares diminishing for the role of the external receptors after their occupation with the ca2 and mg2 ions and all the uptake reactions controlled by layered adsorption processes huang et al 2014 fig 6b this process is of assistant effect during the capturing of ca2 as well as mg2 ions finally the third segment was detected after the equilibration interval and of negligible effect on the efficiency of the reactions fig 6b the recognizing of this segment reveals the creation of thick ca2 and mg2 layers on the surface of m sd by interionic attraction and or molecular association processes huang et al 2014 the fitting degrees between the ca2 and mg2 adsorption results and the other kinetic models of pseudo first order and pseudo second order were assessed based on chi squared χ2 and determination coefficient r2 of the nonlinear fitting table 4 fig 6c and d the ca2 and mg2 adsorption behaviours using m sd follow the kinetic assumption of the pseudo first order fig 6c table 4 model that suggests physisorption properties tu et al 2019 the observed very good fitting with the pseudo second order model fig 6d table 4 emphasizes the presence of some chemical mechanisms during the uptake reactions that might be involved in electron exchange surface complexation electron sharing and ion exchange process abukhadra et al 2021 sherlala et al 2019 4 3 2 equilibrium studies 4 3 2 1 effect of concentration the influence of the ca2 and mg2 concentrations were asses as an essential step to understanding the equilibrium behaviour of the m sd as an adsorbent for them the concentration influence was studied by the systematic dilution of the ca2 and mg2 concentrations the ca2 concentration was studied within the range from 35 mg l to 245 mg l and the mg2 concentration was studied from 25 mg l to 125 mg l fig 6e and f the other factors were inspected at 720 min as the time of equilibration ph 7 6 as natural ph 500 ml as volume and 0 02 g l of m sd as dosage the reported ca2 and mg2 uptake capacities using m sd induced strongly with addressing the higher concentrations of them fig 6e and f the high driving forces which can be acquired by the ca2 and mg2 ions under the saturation of the solutions by them prompt the interaction probabilities with the m sd surface and in turn the capturing efficiency jiang et al 2020 shaban et al 2018 at 210 mg l and 100 mg l the adsorption equilibrium of m sd was attended for ca2 and mg2 ions respectively declaring its maximum capacities for them ca2 522 mg g and mg2 360 mg g fig 6e and f 4 3 2 2 isotherm modeling the isotherm properties of the ca2 and mg2 uptake system using the synthetic sodalite were followed considering three equilibrium models of langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich d r based on the obtained nonlinear fitting degree table s1 the estimated values of both correlation coefficients r2 and chi squared x2 were presented to evaluate the fitting degree table 4 based on the fitting parameters the equilibrium behaviours of the m sd adsorption systems for both ca2 and mg2 ions follow the langmuir behaviour rather than the freundlich equilibrium behaviour fig 6g and h table 4 this suggested the uptake of them homogeneously by the receptor sites in a monolayer form abukhadra and mostafa 2019 also the rl values as a parameter for the langmuir fitting declared the favorable properties for the occurred adsorption reactions table 4 moreover based on the model the expected maximum adsorption capacities of m sd for ca2 and mg2 ions in the batch studies are 630 mg g and 427 mg g respectively table 4 the fitting parameters of the d r model were used to describe the nature of the ca2 and mg2 adsorption reactions by m sd fig 6g and h table 4 the calculated gaussian energies for the uptake of ca2 and mg2 ions are 0 77 kj mol and 1 36 kj mol respectively these values are within the range of reported gaussian energies for the physical adsorption processes less than 8 kj mol as well as the reported values for the zeolitic ion exchange reactions uğurlu and karaoğlu 2011 salam et al 2020 fig 6g and h table 4 4 3 3 thermodynamic properties the thermodynamic properties of m sd adsorption systems for ca2 and mg2 ions were assessed within a temperature range from 20 c to 50 c the experimental parameters were adjusted at 720 min contact time 500 ml studied volume 0 02 g l sodalite dosage the real concentration of the ions 233 mg l ca2 and 114 mg l mg2 and ph 7 6 the main parameters which were used to describe the thermodynamics of the m sd adsorption systems are gibbs free energy go which was obtained from eq 10 in addition to the enthalpy δh and entropy δs the values of both δh and δs were obtained as fitting parameters with van t hof formula eq 11 abukhadra et al 2019d fig 6i 10 g 0 rtin k c 11 in k c s o r h o rt the free energies for both ca2 and mg2 ions are of negative values declaring spontaneous and favorable uptake of them by m sd salam et al 2020 table 4 their enthalpies also were estimated as negative values which suggest the exothermic behaviour of their adsorption reactions by m sd table 4 detecting the entropy at positive values reflects a significant increment in the randomness of the reactions with the regular rising temperature salam et al 2020 moreover the presented values of both go and δh related to reactions of more physical properties 4 4 comparison study the adsorption capacities of the m sd for both ca2 and mg2 at different concentrations of them were investigated without the existence of other competitive ions the obtained maximum capacities for ca2 and mg2 as experimental values are 732 4 mg g and 563 6 mg g respectively these values in addition to the obtained adsorption capacity for the real groundwater in the batch and the column studies were compared with other studied adsorbents in literature table 5 the synthetic muscovite based sodalite m sd is of higher capacities than several studied adsorbents including natural zeolite different species of synthetic zeolite zeolite a and mfi type zeolite modified bentonite and sugarcane bagasse 5 conclusion flowerlike sodalite was synthesized from muscovite with significant surface area 105 m2 g and ion exchange capacity 87 3 meq 100 g to be applied effectively in the decontamination of ca2 233 mg l and mg2 114 mg l ions from groundwater the m sd as a bed 4 cm in the column system achieved decontamination percentages of 90 5 and 92 2 for ca2 and mg2 respectively at ph 7 6 the achieved removal percentages declared declination in the ca2 and mg2 concentrations to the accepted limits by who 75 mg l for ca2 and 50 mg l for mg2 these values were obtained after the purification of 8 1 l and 8 7 l breakthrough intervals of 1380 min and 1440 min and saturation interval more than 1620 min for ca2 and mg2 respectively which reflect significant lifetime for the used beds the m sd columns performances were described considering the assumption of the thomas model adams bohart model and yoon nelson model for the batch studies the uptake of ca2 and mg2 ions follows the pseudo first order kinetics properties and the langmuir equilibrium behaviour demonstrating monolayer uptake forms of
