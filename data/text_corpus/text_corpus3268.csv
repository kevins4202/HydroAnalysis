16340,identifying the key processes and primary sources of water and nutrient losses is essential for water quantity and quality management in watersheds this is especially true in the u s corn belt which has been recognized as the primary region contributing nutrient loads to the great lakes and the gulf of mexico a swat soil and water assessment tool model simulation was set up in an agricultural watershed with about 50 tile drainage area in the u s corn belt to study the water and nutrient balance components for the whole watershed and the corn soybean rotation system the swat model was improved to consider additional nitrogen and phosphorus loss paths from the soil the model was comprehensively calibrated and validated for simulating monthly stream flow total suspended solids tss nutrient loads including total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrate and nitrite nitrogen nox n total phosphorus tp and orthophosphate phosphorus orthop actual evapotranspiration eta leaf area index lai and annual crop yields in the watershed from 2011 to 2019 results showed the model performance was very good for simulating the stream flow tss and eta and acceptable for nutrient loads lai and crop yields eta surface runoff lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation respectively accounted for 65 15 2 8 and 9 of the precipitation fertilizer was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus input to the watershed and harvested crops were the main paths removing nutrients surface runoff tile drainage and percolation each contributed about 30 of total nitrogen losses to water with surface runoff being dominated by organic nitrogen while tile drainage and percolation were dominated by nitrate nitrogen phosphorus losses were mainly through surface runoff which resulted in 66 of the total losses and was dominated by organic phosphorus and soluble phosphorus representing about 49 of the watershed area the corn soybean rotation system contributed 83 and 88 of the total nitrogen and phosphorus inputs respectively to the watershed as well as 64 and 46 of the nitrogen and phosphorus losses to the water system respectively the non growing season october to the next april was identified as the critical period resulting in water and nutrient losses due to low evapotranspiration and plant uptake targeted management strategies for reducing nutrient loads in key hydrological paths were suggested graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords swat nitrogen phosphorus corn soybean rotation system water quality crop growth 1 introduction the u s corn belt produces nearly a third of the world s corn and soybeans fao 2018 and thus plays a critical role in global food security and the local economy green et al 2018 it is dominated by large commercial farms under corn and soybean rotation subsurface tile drainage is widely used to enable poorly drained soil to be productive cropland due to the intensive agricultural activities in the u s corn belt excessive nutrient loads e g nitrogen and phosphorus discharge to stream networks which have caused serious water quality and ecological issues in downstream rivers and estuaries such as the harmful algal blooms in the western basin of lake erie national science and technology council 2017 and hypoxia in the gulf of mexico rabalais and turner 2019 in addition excess losses of nutrients are also a waste of resources available for crop and natural vegetation growth even though the sources of agriculturally derived nonpoint source pollution nps were studied and best management practices bmps were implemented to reduce nps water quality problems persist in agricultural watersheds more targeted and efficient measures are needed to improve water quality by reducing nutrient losses at the source while maintaining agricultural productivity therefore it is imperative to clarify the key processes in water and nutrient balances in the watershed to identify the critical areas and time periods for taking appropriate measures water and nutrient balances identify the flows of water and nutrients into and out of an area such as a watershed prior studies on nutrient balances have usually been conducted at the field scale since nutrient input and output components are easily obtained at this scale salo and turtola 2006 tunney et al 2003 woli et al 2010 xin et al 2017 at the regional scale studies tend to indicate that some regions have nutrient accumulation or depletion based on statistics and do not pay much attention to the hydrological and nutritional processes inside the region engel et al 2013 slaton et al 2004 some studies mainly focus on one or several processes of the balance components david et al 1997 jaworski et al 1992 liu et al 2020 due to the complexity of hydrologic and nutrient cycles at the regional scale it is difficult to take into account all the water and nutrient input and export processes in a large watershed hydrological models with calibration and validation provide a feasible option for quantifying the water and nutrient transports through various paths within a watershed the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed and process based river basin model which includes modules of weather hydrology plant growth nutrients and land management arnold et al 2012 swat has been widely used for modeling hydrologic water quality processes costa et al 2019 francesconi et al 2016 wang et al 2019 even though swat hydrological simulation represents many processes due to data availability and research interests most studies have only calibrated the stream flow processes before model application this may result in inaccurate quantification of other processes and the distortion of some key parameters studies have shown that the calibration of actual evapotranspiration eta is very important in watershed hydrological simulation abbaspour et al 2019 parajuli et al 2018 plant growth variables relating to leaf area index lai and crop yields can affect plant water nutrient uptakes and water quantity quality simulation significantly cibin et al 2016 however comprehensive calibration and validation of all these processes in swat simulation have seldom been achieved the most active part of a watershed is the soil layer where precipitation and management operations are directly applied evapotranspiration plant growth and nutrient cycling take place and surface runoff lateral soil flow percolation and nutrient losses are generated therefore in swat the soil layer is the direct source for generating water and nutrient losses to groundwater and streams in tile drained areas such as the u s corn belt subsurface drainage tiles are placed in the soil layer tile drainage greatly influences the soil water balance and nutrient losses boles et al 2015 guo et al 2018 to better consider tile drainage process the drainmod drainage routines have been incorporated into swat moriasi et al 2012 however these routines in swat have not been widely verified guo et al 2018 in addition the current model is still incomplete for simulating nitrogen and phosphorus losses through tile drainage and percolation bauwe et al 2019 therefore improvements are needed for these modules in swat to close the nutrient balances in soil for these reasons a tile drained agricultural watershed in the u s corn belt was selected as a case study area fig 1 to investigate the key processes and primary sources of water and nutrient losses the swat model was improved to take into account all nutrient loss paths from soil the specific objectives of the research were to 1 set up a comprehensively calibrated and validated swat model for simulating monthly stream flow nutrient loads eta lai and crop yields in the watershed 2 evaluate the water and nutrient i e nitrogen and phosphorus balances of the entire watershed and the corn soybean rotation system based on the improved swat model and 3 provide implications for water and nutrient management and bmp implementation in the u s corn belt 2 materials and methods 2 1 water and nutrient balance method and swat improvement the swat model was selected for the present study because of its advantage for fully considering water and nutrient balance components from the field scale to the watershed scale its physically based computationally efficient and open source characteristics make it one of the most widely used hydrological models based on user specific inputs the basic spatial unit for model operation hydrologic response unit hru can represent areas with similar soils land uses and slopes within a subbasin arnold 2012 this study was conducted based on the swat 2012 revision 681 source code as this study aimed to identify the main sinks and sources of water and nutrients in the land phase the spatial domain boundary for water and nutrient balances was set from the canopy surface to the bottom of the soil profile identified by swat for the entire watershed or certain land uses groundwater and stream routing processes were also simulated by swat but not included in the balance calculation the water balance equation during a specified period can be expressed as 1 δ s w p e t a q s u r f q l a t q t i l e p e r c where δsw is the soil water content change mm p is precipitation mm eta is actual evapotranspiration mm qsurf is the amount of surface runoff mm qlat is the amount of lateral soil flow mm qtile is the amount of water drains through subsurface tile systems mm and perc is the amount of water that percolates past the bottom of soil profile mm and a negative value indicates water moving into the soil zone through capillary rise in response to water deficiencies all the above water balance components can be calculated from current swat outputs for nutrient balances nitrogen and phosphorus were considered the nitrogen balance can be described as 2 δ n n a p p n d e p n f i x n s u r f n l a t n t i l e n p e r c n v o l n d n i t n y i e l d where δn is the change of soil nitrogen content kg n ha 1 napp is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied kg n ha 1 ndep is the amount of nitrogen deposition from atmosphere kg n ha 1 nfix is the amount of nitrogen fixed by legumes kg n ha 1 nsurf is the amount of nitrogen transported by surface runoff into the reach kg n ha 1 nlat is the amount of nitrogen transported by lateral flow into the reach kg n ha 1 ntile is the amount of nitrogen transported by tile flow into the reach kg n ha 1 nperc is the amount of nitrogen leached past the bottom of the soil profile with water percolation kg n ha 1 nvol is the amount of nitrogen loss by ammonia volatilization kg n ha 1 ndnit is the amount of nitrogen removed from soil through the transformation of nitrate to gaseous compounds kg n ha 1 and nyield is the amount of nitrogen removed through yield harvest kg n ha 1 all the above nitrogen balance components should refer to the total nitrogen including all possible nitrogen forms as nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and organic nitrogen organic n however some forms in a certain balance component may be very small and unstable e g no2 n and nh3 n these forms were ignored in some processes in this study in the swat framework ndep includes nitrate and ammonia from both wet deposition absorption of compounds by precipitation and dry deposition direct adsorption of compounds to water or land surfaces the amount of wet deposition can be obtained from the national atmospheric deposition program national trends network arnold et al 2012 and the dry deposition can be obtained from holland et al 2005 nsurf nlat ntile and nperc include no3 n and organic n for nsurf swat already provides the calculation of the two forms of nitrogen for nlat ntile and nperc only no3 n is simulated while organic n is ignored in the current version of swat however many previous studies have shown that organic n losses in nlat ntile and nperc are also significant and should be considered in nitrogen balance calculation cuadra and vidon 2011 van kessel et al 2009 therefore the calculation of the organic n losses through lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation were added to the current swat model because lateral soil flow tile drainage percolation together with shallow groundwater are all related to base flow to avoid introducing more parameters the existing groundwater parameter gw lat orgn organic n concentration in shallow groundwater contribution to stream flow mg l 1 was also specified as the organic n concentration parameter in the three subsurface nitrogen loss paths for calibration the original and newly added nitrogen forms considered in each balance component are summarized in table 1 to quantify ammonia volatilization from different land use types outputs for nvol were added to the hru and subbasin output files output hru and output sub respectively phosphorus balance can be described as 3 δ p p a p p p s u r f p l a t p t i l e p p e r c p y i e l d where δp is the change of soil phosphorus content kg p ha 1 papp is the amount of phosphorus fertilizer applied kg p ha 1 psurf is the amount of phosphorus transported by surface runoff into the reach kg p ha 1 plat is the amount of phosphorus transported by lateral flow into the reach kg p ha 1 ptile is the amount of phosphorus transported by tile flow into the reach kg p ha 1 pperc is the amount of phosphorus leached past the bottom of the soil profile kg p ha 1 and pyield is the amount of phosphorus removed through yield harvest generally speaking all the above phosphorus balance components refer to the total phosphorus the natural soil and water system includes three major forms of phosphorus soluble mineral phosphorus soluble p insoluble forms of mineral phosphorus sediment p and organic phosphorus organic p in swat soluble p is used as a proxy for orthophosphate for simulating solution phosphorus transport sediment p i e the mineral phosphorus attached to sediment sedp used in swat and organic p may also be transported by water to the main channel when they are attached to soil particles through soil erosion however except for psurf in which the three forms of phosphorus are simulated in the current version of swat only soluble p is considered for ptile kalcic et al 2016 and none of the three are considered for the other phosphorus loss components plat and pperc this may be acceptable for sedp as its losses through tile drainage lateral flow and percolation are much smaller than that through surface runoff however it is better to take into account other phosphorus balance components and forms to have a relatively complete phosphorus balance calculation bauwe et al 2019 beauchemin et al 1998 williams et al 2016 therefore in this study the current swat model was improved to further consider the organic p in lateral flow tile flow and percolation and the soluble p in lateral flow and percolation to avoid introducing more parameters similar to nitrogen the parameter lat orgp organic p concentration in shallow groundwater contribution to stream flow mg l 1 to be calibrated was also specified as the organic p concentration in the tile lateral and percolation flow to calculate the organic p loads in ptile plat and pperc the parameter gwsolp soluble p concentration in groundwater contribution to stream flow was also specified as the soluble p concentration in lateral flow and percolation for calibration in this way the soluble p load in plat and pperc was also calculated the original and newly added phosphorus forms considered in each balance component are shown in table 1 in addition even though tile drained areas have long been recognized as the main source of nitrogen pollution to water the nutrient loss characteristics under different crops have not been fully identified therefore in this study the water and nitrogen balance results for the corn soybean rotation system were separated as corn and soybean to identify their differences 2 2 site description the st joseph river watershed sjrw 41 05 41 55 n 84 22 85 19 w is part of the lake erie basin and located in northeast indiana northwest ohio and south central michigan fig 1 it has a total drainage area of approximately 2815 km2 as delineated by swat the st joseph river joins st mary s river to form the maumee river which flows into lake erie the sjrw is predominantly an agricultural watershed 51 with approximately 20 pasture 22 forest and 6 urban the main crops are corn and soybean which occupy more than 95 of the agricultural land crops are mainly grown in rainfed conditions thanks to the humid continental climate the average annual precipitation is 992 mm and about 49 occurs during the main crop growing season may to september for the period of 2008 2019 the annual average temperature is 9 6 with monthly averages ranging from 5 1 in january to 22 3 in july the sjrw is flat to hilly terrain with 52 of the area having less than 2 slope 35 with 2 5 slope and the remaining 13 with larger than 5 slope the elevation ranges between 226 and 380 m and averages 281 m above sea level soil associations in sjrw include miami morley morley glynwood blount and blount pewamo and the main soil textures are silt loam silty clay loam and clay loam vazquez amabile et al 2006 the soils of the watershed are generally somewhat poorly drained with about 35 and 42 belonging to hydrologic soil groups c and d respectively according to the soil survey geographic database ssurgo tile drainage systems are widely used in the agricultural areas which significantly influence the watershed hydrology and transport of nutrients across the landscape boles et al 2015 guo et al 2018 2 3 data preparation and model setup the arcswat version 2012 10 2 19 interface was used to develop swat model configurations for sjrw the study period was set from january 2008 to december 2019 the 10 m resolution digital elevation model dem data 2017 from the u s geological survey usgs the national map viewer http apps nationalmap gov downloader were used to delineate the watershed and calculate topographic parameters thirty subbasins within sjrw were created with 5700 ha 2 of the watershed area as the minimum stream threshold value land use data from 2008 to 2019 were downloaded from the national agricultural statistics service nass cropland data layer cdl https nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape and analyzed to find the most representative year for model input as a result the cdl 2015 was selected because the proportions of the main land use types e g soybean pasture corn and forest in 2015 were closest to that of the multi year average during the study period soil data were obtained from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo https websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov hrus were delineated in the arcswat interface by overlaying land use soil and slope maps three slope classes 0 2 2 5 and 5 were used for the delineation due to the need to capture low medium and high slopes liu et al 2019 the number of hrus was reduced using the threshold of 5 for land use 5 for soil type and 5 for slope to improve modeling efficiency while keeping most details her et al 2015 as a result sjrw was divided into 2047 hrus in which the corn soybean rotation system constituted 659 hrus and accounted for 48 7 of the total area the penman monteith equation was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration and transpiration requiring climate inputs including precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed that were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national centers for environmental information website https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web solar radiation data were downloaded from the national solar radiation database nsrdb https nsrdb nrel gov all the meteorological data were processed at a daily time scale from 2008 to 2019 with missing data less than 2 replaced by measurements from adjacent stations since swat assumes wind speed information is collected from gauges positioned 1 7 m above the ground surface wind speed data obtained from instruments placed at elevations other than this height were adjusted based on a power wind speed profile neitsch et al 2011 as a result the numbers of gage stations with effective data for model input were 7 for precipitation 7 for air temperature 4 for relative humidity 4 for wind speed and 8 for solar radiation fig s 1 crop management operations have a significant effect on water and nutrient balances in the watershed however it is difficult to obtain the exact management operations for all fields therefore the crop management operations in this study were synthesized from previous studies conducted in this region and representative countywide averages a few simplifications and estimates were also made on the management practices for swat input as shown in table s 1 the 2 year corn soybean rotation system was assumed for all the corn and soybean fields cibin et al 2012 winter wheat was assumed to grow in the same field year by year without rotation the planting harvesting dates fertilizer application dates and amounts pesticide application rates and tillage were averages from literature boles et al 2015 cibin et al 2016 her et al 2016 wallace et al 2017 grazing operations were applied to the pasture area as described by cibin et al 2016 forest areas i e deciduous forest and wetland forest were represented in the model as already growing with mature tree stands however the measured 140 mg ha 1 aboveground dry biomass in indiana forests gormanson and kurtz 2017 was not used as model input this was because under the current swat evaporation algorithm such a large biomass amount will result in near zero soil evaporation and unreasonably low evapotranspiration in forest areas instead zero initial aboveground biomass was set in swat and the actual forest biomass can be obtained by summing the model simulated value with the initially measured one tile drainage was assumed in hrus having land uses of corn soybean or wheat with slopes less than 5 and hydrologic soil groups of c or d boles et al 2015 liu et al 2019 pignotti et al 2017 as a result about 50 of the total watershed and 92 of the corn soybean rotation system were estimated as tile drained areas the newly added drainmod drainage routines were selected to simulate subsurface drainage moriasi et al 2007a moriasi et al 2012 this method is more physically based and has worked well in simulating tile flow and nitrate nitrogen in several regions boles et al 2015 guo et al 2018 moriasi et al 2013 tile drainage flux is computed using the hooghoudt steady state equation when the water table is below the soil surface or ponded depressional depth is below a threshold hooghoudt 1940 using the kirkham equation when the water table completely fills the surface and the water is ponded for a relatively long period kirkham 1957 and using the drainage coefficient when the simulated tile drainage flux is greater than the maximum tile drainage capacity skaggs 1978 2 4 model calibration and validation model simulation was conducted from 2008 to 2019 in which three years 2008 2010 were used for model warm up five years 2011 2015 for calibration and four years 2016 2019 for validation data sets including stream flow water quality actual evapotranspiration eta leaf area index lai and crop yield were used for model calibration and validation daily and monthly stream flow data m3 s 1 were obtained from the st joseph river usgs gaging station id 04 180 500 near fort wayne in i e near the watershed outlet based on this the monthly water pollutant concentration data total suspended solids tss total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrate and nitrite nitrogen nox n total phosphorus tp and orthophosphate phosphorus orthop mg l 1 obtained from the nearby water quality station instor wqx 15 053 were converted to monthly pollutant loads tons mon 1 using a web version of load estimator loadest tool https engineering purdue edu mapserve loadest park et al 2015 runkel et al 2004 the web based hydrograph analysis tool what lim et al 2005 was used to estimate the base flow index bfi the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis et product mod16a2gf which is a year end gap filled 8 day composite dataset produced at 500 m pixel resolution was converted to monthly scale et products running et al 2019 the modis lai product mcd15a2h with a temporal spatial resolution of 8 day and 500 m for the sjrw was also obtained myneni et al 2015 county level annual crop yield data were collected from the usda national agricultural statistics service nass database https www nass usda gov data and statistics the county level statistical yield kg ha 1 of a given crop was apportioned to the watershed based on the proportions of corresponding crop area within the county that was also within the watershed to the area of the crop in the entire watershed the average yield of a crop for the watershed was calculated by summing all the yield apportionments of the counties that intersected with the sjrw in order to compare with the observed yield the swat output crop yield dry weight was converted to the nass standard yield with moisture content being respectively 15 5 and 13 0 for corn and soybean the workflow for swat model calibration is shown in fig s 2 swat cup abbaspour 2015 was used for preliminary sensitivity analysis sensitive parameters identified for model calibration validation are shown in table s 2 initial values and ranges of these parameters were determined based on model defaults literature and their physical meanings the model was calibrated and validated first for vegetation growth then a second time for hydrology and finally for water quality engel et al 2007 guo et al 2018 swat cup auto calibration and manual calibration were both used for vegetation growth manual calibration was conducted first for remote sensing lai of the entire watershed and then for the observed yields of corn and soybean for hydrology auto calibration was conducted for the monthly stream flow then manual calibration was conducted for remote sensing et tile flow and base flow ratio for water quality auto calibration for the observed monthly loads of tss nox n and tkn orthop and tp were conducted manual calibration was further conducted to ensure the tile flow nutrient loads and nutrients removal by corn and soybean yields harvest were in reasonable ranges the calibration process was iterated for at least three times to guarantee the optimization of the entire model besides the graphical techniques three quantitative statistics including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr as recommended by moriasi et al 2007b were used for model performance evaluation the model performance can be judged as acceptable if nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 and if pbias 25 for stream flow pbias 55 for sediment and pbias 70 for nitrogen and phosphorus as very good if nse 0 75 and rsr 0 50 and if pbias 10 for stream flow pbias 15 for sediment and pbias 25 for nitrogen and phosphorus moriasi et al 2007b the relatively strict criteria for stream flow were also used for eta and lai in this study due to their significant seasonal variations since crop yields did not vary greatly between years and it was difficult for models to capture these minor interannual variations average multi year crop yields were usually used for evaluating model performance martin 1993 ren et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2010 therefore loose criteria for nse i e nse 0 and rsr i e rsr 1 0 while strict criteria for pbias i e pbias 10 were suggested for the yield simulation being judged as acceptable in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 crop growth the simulated lai and remote sensing lai matched well with nse 0 70 pbias 18 and rsr 0 54 for the calibration period and nse 0 61 pbias 26 and rsr 0 62 for the validation period some discrepancies were found during the peak lai periods in july and august when the simulated lai results were usually higher than the remote sensing results it may be caused by the consistent planting dates for crops used by the model which resulted in the maximum lai for a certain crop occurring almost at the same time in the watershed in addition many marginal lands roads and individual houses with lower lai values were eliminated when mapping land cover and generating swat hrus using a 5 land use threshold her et al 2015 lark et al 2017 the 500 m resolution remote sensing lai also has many uncertainties with unacceptable level of mixed pixels kimm et al 2020 the consistent harvest dates for crops resulted in sudden declines of lai in september due to crop harvest after this the relatively slow lai declines of forests and pastures resulted in short stable lai periods in some years e g 2013 2014 2017 and 2019 fig 2 parameters used to calibrate the watershed lai included phu blai frgrw2 laimx2 dlai t opt and t base for corn soybean pasture deciduous forest and wetlands forest table s 2 these parameters were first specified based on previous studies fransen et al 2017 qu and zhuang 2018 and then slightly adjusted to optimize the model performance on lai simulation the comparisons of swat simulated corn and soybean yields with observed yields are shown in fig 2 results showed that the model performance for corn yield simulation was much better than that of soybean the nse and rsr for corn respectively reached 0 75 and 0 48 while they were 0 17 and 0 86 for soybean it may be because corn yield is more prone to be affected by environmental factors such as drought and nitrogen stress resulting in significant yearly variation however the soybean yields were relatively stable across years for example the observed corn yield had an obvious decrease in the drought year 2012 while there was only a slight decrease for soybean studies have shown that soybean is more resistant to short term drought stress due to its overlapping development stages hoffman et al 2020 licht and archontoulis 2017 however the current model is not able to take into account this mechanism very well the multi year average yields of corn and soybean were both captured with pbias of 0 08 for corn and 0 17 for soybean the main parameters used to calibrate grain yields were phu bio e hvsti blai t opt and t base table s 2 these parameters were all within the acceptable ranges from previous studies in the region cibin et al 2016 guo et al 2018 hu et al 2007 3 1 2 hydrology results showed that the monthly stream flow and eta were well captured by the model fig 3 for stream flow the goodness of fit indicators during the calibration period nse 0 88 pbias 5 rsr 0 34 and validation period nse 0 79 pbias 5 rsr 0 45 both indicated very good model performance moriasi et al 2007b the comparison of simulated and remote sensing eta resulted in nse 0 90 pbias 0 69 and rsr 0 31 during the calibration period and nse 0 88 pbias 1 8 and rsr 0 35 during the validation period the simulated average annual eta was 652 mm accounting for 66 of precipitation this coincides with sanford and selnick 2013 which reported that the fraction of precipitation lost to evapotranspiration in this area is between 0 60 0 69 the accurate model simulation for stream flow and eta indicated that the main water output components from the watershed were captured in addition the estimated bfi by what was 0 61 and the simulated result had a similar value of 0 56 in the tile drained areas tile flow depth averaged 164 mm accounting for 17 of the annual precipitation it was within the measured range of 9 3 to 37 1 from field scale studies in similar locations as summarized by boles et al 2015 and also compared well with other case studies conducted within the sjrw liu et al 2019 wallace et al 2017 all the above results confirmed the accuracy of the model simulation for hydrological processes the calibrated parameters for hydrology are shown in table s 2 a 25 reduction in the initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 was applied to all tile drained areas to make sure that the watershed bfi and tile drainage amount were in reasonable ranges swat modeled groundwater evaporation revap was restricted to a small value in this study through the parameters gw revap revapmn and gwqmn table s 2 it was because the term revap enters the atmosphere directly and should have been classified as evapotranspiration however its calculation method is separated from the current et algorithm in swat and has been questioned in many studies abiodun et al 2018 liu et al 2015 luo et al 2008 if it is added to eta the energy balance principle used for calculating et will be broken therefore this study avoided this method and made more water in the deep soil layer be directly consumed by soil evaporation or plant transpiration through the adjustment of parameters esco and epco thus approaching the actual mechanism of shallow groundwater evaporation the maximum canopy storage canmx mm values for crops pastures and forests were respectively specified as 1 5 1 5 and 2 0 mm which were the averages of many previous studies hu et al 2007 parajuli et al 2018 white et al 2017 wu and johnston 2008 3 1 3 water quality the swat model performance for simulating tss was similar to that for hydrology resulting in nse 0 81 pbias 6 5 and rsr 0 43 during the calibration period and nse 0 75 pbias 19 and rsr 0 50 during the validation period fig 4 for nutrient loads nox n tkn orthop and tp some discrepancies were found between the simulated and loadest results especially for some peak loads in winter and early spring they may be caused by the inaccuracies of the fertilizer application schedule used in this study for example some farmers apply phosphorus fertilizer in the autumn after harvest while others may apply in the spring before planting the application dates also vary annually depending on weather conditions guo et al 2021 however this study assumed fixed application rates and dates for the entire watershed in addition the sparse observation data also bring uncertainties to the results of loadest park and engel 2015 it should be noted that the observed orthop data were only available from 2018 so just two year data were used for generating the full observed loads from 2011 to 2019 nevertheless the goodness of fit indicators for modeling the monthly nutrient loads nox n tkn orthop and tp were within the acceptable range engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007b with nse 0 51 pbias 20 and rsr 0 69 during the calibration period and nse 0 45 pbias 35 and rsr 0 71 during the validation period fig 4 the improved model had better performance in simulating tkn orthop and tp loads in stream flow fig s 3 especially for tkn the model performance was significantly improved with nse increasing from 0 46 to 0 78 and pbias and rsr decreasing from 38 and 0 73 to 10 and 0 47 respectively these model performance improvements further verified the rationality and necessity of considering additional paths and forms of soil nutrient losses in this study the parameters calibrated for water quality are shown in table s 2 besides the auto calibrated parameters some parameters were manually calibrated and determined based on their physical meanings the parameter hlife ngw half life of nitrate in the shallow aquifer was calibrated to be 110 days which was very close to the previous measured or calibrated values hoghooghi et al 2017 malagó et al 2017 the organic n concentration in base flow lat orgn was determined within the standard deviation sd of observed organic n concentrations during the base flow months as there were no observed data for organic p concentration and very few data available for orthop in the stream flow the sum of the base flow organic p concentration lat orgp and soluble p concentration gwsolp was limited to the sd of the tp concentrations observed during the base flow months the normal fractions of nitrogen and phosphorus in yield i e cnyld and cpyld used by swat should be calculated based on dry basis however the nutrient concentrations of grains reported by literature were usually expressed at certain moisture contents as a result the cnyld and cpyld were respectively specified as 0 014 and 0 0034 for corn anthony et al 2013 tenorio et al 2019 villamil et al 2019 and 0 064 and 0 0061 for soybean la menza et al 2019 nathan et al 2009 salvagiotti et al 2008 villamil et al 2019 based on the averages of literature reports and adjusted by grain moisture content the tile drainage parameters for drainmod were adjusted based on the field conditions the depth to impervious layer in the soil profile dep imp was calibrated to be 3800 mm which resulted in some water about 43 of tile drainage amount percolating to the shallow groundwater this is reasonable because there should be a considerable amount of water percolated to the shallow groundwater and then drained to the ditches or streams directly rather than all the excess soil water being drained through the subsurface tile systems 3 1 4 dynamics and interactions between crop growth hydrology and water quality variables the variation of crop growth hydrology and water quality variables were interrelated the yearly variation of crop yield fit the variation of lai with lower yield usually corresponding to a lower lai fig 2 it was because lai influenced light interception and use which ultimately affected biomass and crop yield the monthly dynamics of eta were also consistent with lai with the highest eta usually occurring in july when the largest lai occurred while the lowest eta usually occurring in february when the lai was low thus lai should be an important factor influencing the variation of eta the peak stream flow tended to occur in spring when eta had recently passed its minimum the lowest stream flow usually occurred between august and october right after the occurrence of the highest eta fig 3 this indicated that there was a lag time for stream flow to respond to the monthly eta variation for water quality variables tss and nutrient loads nox n tkn orthop and tp were all positively correlated with stream flow fig 4 correlation analysis showed that tss load was most correlated with stream flow with r2 reaching 0 96 while nox n load was least correlated with r2 being 0 70 results demonstrated that the model can reasonably reproduce the dynamics and interactions of the above variables 3 2 water balance the 9 year average 2011 2019 soil water balance components for the watershed are shown in table 2 results showed yearly eta averaged 652 mm which accounted for 66 of the precipitation surface runoff was the second largest water output equaling 15 of precipitation water percolation reached 92 mm indicating more than 9 of precipitation recharged the shallow groundwater system tile drainage played a significant role in the watershed with about 8 of precipitation drained through the tile system lateral soil flow was the smallest component only accounting for 2 of precipitation the water budgets in corn soybean rotation system csrs were significantly affected by human farming activities compared with that at the watershed scale the eta values of corn and soybean were very similar both slightly lower than the watershed average value it may be because the growth periods of corn and soybean were shorter than the other land cover types e g forests and pastures surface runoff in csrs averaged 103 mm which was about 29 lower than the watershed average it was mainly caused by the extensive subsurface tile drainage in the farmland the tile drainage depth in the csrs reached 150 mm accounting for 15 of the precipitation which was the largest water output component except for eta water percolated to the shallow groundwater system was also largely reduced because of the intense tile drainage in order to quantify the characteristics of water budgets between seasons water balance components during the growing season and the non growing season were calculated separately fig 5 the growing season of the watershed was defined as the main growth period of corn and soybean from may 1 to september 30 while the non growing season was defined as the remaining months results showed that the growing season eta represented about 70 of the yearly value both at the watershed scale and the csrs the growing season eta for corn was slightly higher than that of soybean while the non growing season eta for corn was lower than that of soybean it was because the longer growth period of corn resulted in more water consumption during the growing season while more crop residue after harvest in corn resulted in lower evaporation during the non growing season the non growing season surface runoff and percolation were about three times those of the growing season tile drainage depth during the non growing season was about twice that of the growing season it indicated that the non growing season was the main period contributing to stream flow and groundwater during a year with similar precipitation between growing season and non growing season the significant difference in surface and subsurface runoff was caused by the large gap in eta between the two seasons 3 3 nitrogen balance 3 3 1 nitrogen input and output in the watershed nitrogen input output components and their forms are summarized in table 3 of the three nitrogen inputs fertilizer provided 57 9 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and was the largest source introduced into the watershed accounting for 45 of the total nitrogen input nh3 n was the main component of nitrogen fertilizer making up 75 of the fertilizer amount the nitrogen fixed by legumes was 47 5 kg ha 1 in the watershed with only about 24 of the area planted as soybean each year this was the second largest nitrogen source into the watershed accounting for 37 of the total input nitrogen deposition from the atmosphere was also non negligible as it represented about 18 of the total input nearly 80 of the nitrogen deposition was constituted of no3 n nitrogen removed by yield was the largest sink 76 8 kg ha 1 in the watershed accounting for 64 of the total output the nitrogen emitted to the atmosphere through denitrification and ammonia volatilization reached 19 9 kg ha 1 representing 17 of the total output the remaining 19 of nitrogen was transported to stream flow and groundwater through hydrological processes the amounts of nitrogen transported by surface runoff tile drainage and percolation respectively contributed about 27 34 and 34 of the nitrogen loss through water discharge a very small proportion of nitrogen 4 was lost with the lateral soil flow the nitrogen forms in surface runoff were dominated by organic n while these were dominated by no3 n in tile flow percolation and lateral flow the nitrogen loss with water during the non growing season was significantly larger than that during the growing season fig 5 the proportions of non growing season nitrogen losses to the yearly values through surface runoff lateral flow tile drainage and water percolation were 77 50 59 and 70 respectively this was because the non growing season water discharges from these components were much larger than those of the growing season in addition vegetation uptake was negligible during the non growing season thus more no3 n may be available to be transported with tile drainage percolation and lateral soil flow 3 3 2 nitrogen input and output in the corn soybean rotation system csrs the nitrogen balance components in the corn field and soybean field were quite different the corn field nitrogen input averaged 212 3 kg ha 1 of which nearly 90 was from fertilizer however in the soybean field with similar nitrogen input of 221 9 kg ha 1 about 85 of that was from nitrogen fixation thus the annual nitrogen input to the csrs through fertilizer was around 100 kg ha 1 which was much less than the fertilizer nitrogen input to the wheat corn system in the north china plain 500 kg ha 1 michalczyk et al 2020 and the rice wheat system in the indo gangetic plains of india 300 kg ha 1 sapkota et al 2020 this was because the csrs in the u s corn belt has only one crop season per year with substantial soybean nitrogen fixation and relatively better nitrogen management nitrogen deposition from the atmosphere accounted for about 11 of the total input to the csrs the nitrogen removed by yield for corn 112 7 kg ha 1 was lower than that in soybean 175 5 kg ha 1 while all other nitrogen outputs in corn fields were higher than soybean nitrogen lost by denitrification in corn fields 31 2 kg ha 1 was a little higher than that in soybean 25 2 kg ha 1 due to the large amount of ammonia n fertilizer applied to corn fields ammonia volatilization was more than ten times higher than that of soybean fields the nitrogen loads lost to stream flow and shallow groundwater through hydrological processes surface runoff lateral soil flow tile flow and percolation in corn fields were about 27 higher than those in soybean among these components the nitrogen loads through tile flow were the largest occupying about 50 of the total nitrogen loads from the csrs this was quite different from areas without tile drainage such as the wheat corn system in the north china plain and the rice wheat system in the indo gangetic plains where nitrogen loads through percolation accounted for most nitrogen losses to the water system michalczyk et al 2020 pathak et al 2010 it is worth mentioning that the tile flow nitrogen load in corn was about 41 higher than that in the soybean field this was mainly caused by the large amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to the corn as a result the total nitrogen output was lower than input in the corn while it was higher than input for soybean overall the nitrogen input to the csrs was slightly 2 3 larger than the output which indicates that the soil nitrogen content may have an increasing trend this is consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer was applied to the u s corn belt for sustaining high productivity kim et al 2021 while a significant result of high nitrogen input was the increase of total nitrogen content in soil jagadamma et al 2008 liebig et al 2002 uncertainty of model inputs such as fertilizer and parameterization may also result in the imbalance of the nitrogen simulation 3 4 phosphorus balance 3 4 1 phosphorus input and output in the watershed the only phosphorus input to the watershed was fertilizer application in which soluble p from chemical fertilizer was the dominant component accounting for 94 of the total input table 4 phosphorus removed by yield was the dominant output component representing 91 of the total output the remaining phosphorus loss components were through hydrological processes in which surface runoff contributed 66 of the total losses reaching 0 77 kg ha 1 the main phosphorus forms lost through surface runoff were organic p and soluble p respectively accounting for 47 and 44 sediment p constituted the last 9 the amounts of phosphorus lost through tile drainage and percolation were very similar both being about 0 18 kg ha 1 however the amount of soluble p in tile flow was slightly larger than organic p while that in percolation was lower than organic p this was reasonable due to the poor sorption and rapid leaching characteristics of organic p result in relatively higher organic p proportion in deeper soils compared with upper soils mcdowell et al 2021 in this study the depth of drainage tiles was at about 1 m depth while the bottoms of soil layers were usually deeper than 1 5 m 3 4 2 phosphorus input and output in the corn soybean rotation system csrs phosphorus fertilizer application in corn averaged 31 14 kg ha 1 which was higher than that for soybean of 22 92 kg ha 1 the average annual phosphorus application rate to the csrs was 27 kg ha 1 which was around 1 5 of that to the wheat corn system in the north china plain huang et al 2017 while slightly higher than that to agricultural land in europe around 20 kg ha 1 tóth et al 2014 higher phosphorus application in corn was because corn growth needs more phosphorus than soybean as shown in table 4 the phosphorus removed by yield in corn and soybean fields were respectively 27 37 and 16 73 kg ha 1 it was the main phosphorus output component in csrs accounting for 95 of the total output corn removed much more phosphorus than soybean because corn yield 9 58 t ha 1 was about three times of soybean yield 3 14 t ha 1 while the phosphorus concentration in corn 0 0034 kg p kg 1 yield was 56 of that in soybean 0 0061 kg p kg 1 yield other phosphorus output components were all through hydrological processes surface runoff was the main hydrological process causing phosphorus loss representing about 55 of the total loss in corn and 50 of that in soybean fields phosphorus loss through surface runoff in corn was larger than that in soybean it may be because tillage was performed for corn while no till was applied to soybean the phosphorus loss through surface runoff in the csrs averaged 0 58 kg ha 1 which was very close to that in european agricultural lands kronvang et al 2007 while lower than that in the north china plain huang et al 2017 the second main path of phosphorus loss was through tile drainage accounting for about 31 and 34 of the total losses in corn and soybean respectively the average phosphorus load in tile drainage was 0 36 kg ha 1 which was comparable to the observed values in agricultural watersheds in central ohio 0 48 kg ha 1 and illinois 0 50 kg ha 1 king et al 2015 gentry et al 2007 moreover the simulated soluble p load accounted for 56 of the total phosphorus load in tile drainage which was within the range of 48 81 as reported in the above observational studies this demonstrated the rationality of considering additional forms of phosphorus loss in tile drainage as in this study phosphorus lost through tile drainage in soybean was higher than that in corn fields which was mainly contributed by soluble p table 4 the reason may also be the different tillage operations applied between the two crops in addition the soluble phosphorus removed by corn yield was 64 higher than that by soybean yield which reduced the phosphorus available for draining through the tile in corn fields due to the intensive tile drainage in csrs phosphorus lost through percolation was relatively lower than that at the watershed scale in total phosphorus inputs were larger than the outputs in both corn and soybean fields indicating that there was an excess of phosphorus application to the csrs previous studies in this region also reported that the excessive phosphorus application resulted in significant legacy phosphorus accumulation in soil dodd and mallarino 2005 mccollum 1991 which was an important cause of water quality problems muenich et al 2016 in addition the uncertainty of model inputs and parameterization may also result in the imbalance of the phosphorus simulation 3 5 insights on water quality management to reduce the nutrient loads to surface water and groundwater the water and nutrient sources available for transport through surface runoff lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation should be reduced to achieve this based on the water and nutrient balance calculation there should be a good balance between inputs and other outputs which do not contribute to the surface water or groundwater for water balance the only output component that did not contribute to the land water system was evapotranspiration eq 1 for a given amount of water input i e precipitation increasing eta will reduce the output to the water system and thus may reduce nutrient loads possible ways to increase eta include planting cover crops during the non growing season or vegetation with longer growth period and deeper rooting depth to extract more water from soil and increasing soil water holding capacity to provide more water for evapotranspiration for nutrient balance reducing nitrogen and phosphorus inputs is the most common way to reduce nutrient losses this can be implemented through precision fertilization such as formulated fertilization and splitting application time which could maintain yield with less fertilizer in addition increasing nitrogen and phosphorus removed by yield will also reduce nutrients lost through the water it means improving crop yield has the potential to improve water quality assuming additional nutrients are not applied of all the nutrient output components only the nutrients removed by yield are beneficial many measures related to crop yield improvements such as irrigation weed control and crop breeding can be applied for the nitrogen cycle denitrification and ammonia volatilization are additional paths that may reduce the nitrogen losses to the water system however they are usually considered negative factors reducing nitrogen use efficiency and need to be minimized despite this denitrification is still used in some special conditions to reduce nutrient loads to water for example managed drainage and lined denitrification beds were used to reduce tile nitrate export to streams through increased denitrification woli et al 2010 agricultural bmps e g blind inlets wetlands grade stabilization structures filter strips and grassed waterways are commonly employed to control nutrient loads to water liu et al 2017 2019 muenich et al 2016 identifying the key hydrological processes which contribute the greatest nutrient loads can make the deployment of bmps more cost effective for nitrogen surface runoff tile drainage and percolation were almost equally important in the watershed as they contributed similar loads each contributed about 30 to the water system for phosphorus surface runoff was the most important path as it contributed 66 of the total loads therefore bmps affecting surface runoff tile drainage and percolation should be considered for reducing nitrogen load while bmps affecting surface runoff should be the focus for reducing phosphorus load the csrs contributed 83 and 88 of the total nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the watershed even though it represented only about 49 of the total area for nutrients lost to the water system the csrs contributed 64 of the nitrogen and 46 of the phosphorus thus the csrs was the key area contributing nitrogen losses in the watershed while other land uses contributed more phosphorus this indicates that more bmps should be employed in the csrs for reducing nitrogen load while bmps in other land uses may be more important for reducing phosphorus load when examining nutrient outputs through water the main components causing differences of nutrient loads between csrs and other land use types were surface runoff and tile drainage the nutrient loads especially the organic form through surface runoff in the watershed were obviously larger than that in csrs therefore the best management practices that may reduce the nutrient losses through surface runoff should be emphasized in the non crop land use types such as forests and pastures for nutrient losses through tile drainage in farmland more nitrogen was found in corn fields while more phosphorus was found from soybean fields therefore specific measures can be applied to the two crops the nitrogen fertilizer application may need to be optimized for corn while the phosphorus fertilizer application needs to be optimized for soybean controlled drainage is another option to reduce the nutrient loads through tile drainage this is especially true during the non growing season when the major nutrient losses occur and excess water retained by soil will not affect crop growth the non growing season is also the critical period for reducing nutrient loads in surface runoff and percolation fig 5 planting cover crops during the non growing season can effectively fix nutrients and increase eta thus reducing water and nutrient losses 4 conclusions water and nutrient balances in an agricultural watershed in the u s corn belt from 2011 to 2019 were calculated based on swat model simulation the swat model was improved to consider additional forms of nitrogen and phosphorus lost through lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation the model was comprehensively calibrated validated at the monthly scale for simulating stream flow eta tss nutrient loads including nox n tkn orthop and tp lai and crop yields results showed that the model performance was very good for simulating stream flow eta and tss and acceptable for nutrient loads lai and crop yields for the entire watershed eta and surface runoff were the main water outputs respectively accounting for 66 and 15 of the precipitation for the nutrients lost to the water system nitrogen loss was mainly through surface runoff tile drainage and percolation each contributing about 30 phosphorus loss was mainly through surface runoff which represented 66 of the total losses nitrogen forms lost with surface runoff were dominated by organic n while losses with tile drainage and percolation were mainly no3 n organic p and soluble p almost contributed equally to losses in surface runoff lateral flow tile drainage and percolation in the csrs eta was still the largest water consumer representing 65 of precipitation while tile drainage was the second largest water output accounting for 15 of precipitation representing about 49 of the total watershed the csrs contributed 83 and 88 of the total nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the watershed meanwhile 64 of the nitrogen and 46 of the phosphorus lost to the water system were contributed by the csrs it indicated that nitrogen management should focus on csrs and phosphorus should address both csrs and other land use types in csrs corn fields lost more nitrogen than soybean fields while soybean fields lost more phosphorus than corn fields the non growing season october to the next april was recognized as the critical period resulting in water and nutrient losses due to low evapotranspiration and plant uptake based on these targeted management strategies for reducing nutrient loads to the water system were suggested

16340,identifying the key processes and primary sources of water and nutrient losses is essential for water quantity and quality management in watersheds this is especially true in the u s corn belt which has been recognized as the primary region contributing nutrient loads to the great lakes and the gulf of mexico a swat soil and water assessment tool model simulation was set up in an agricultural watershed with about 50 tile drainage area in the u s corn belt to study the water and nutrient balance components for the whole watershed and the corn soybean rotation system the swat

and crop yields eta surface runoff lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation respectively accounted for 65 15 2 8 and 9 of the precipitation fertilizer was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus input to the watershed and harvested crops were the main paths removing nutrients surface runoff tile drainage and percolation each contributed about 30 of total nitrogen losses to water with surface runoff being dominated by organic nitrogen while tile drainage and percolation were dominated by nitrate nitrogen phosphorus losses were mainly through surface runoff which resulted in 66 of the total losses and was dominated by organic phosphorus and soluble phosphorus representing about 49 of the watershed area the corn soybean rotation system contributed 83 and 88 of the total nitrogen and phosphorus inputs respectively to the watershed as well as 64 and 46 of the nitrogen and phosphorus losses to the water system respectively the non growing season october to the next april was identified as the critical period resulting in water and nutrient losses due to low evapotranspiration and plant uptake targeted management strategies for reducing nutrient loads in key hydrological paths were suggested graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords swat nitrogen phosphorus corn soybean rotation system water quality crop growth 1 introduction the u s corn belt produces nearly a third of the world s corn and soybeans fao 2018 and thus plays a critical role in global food security and the local economy green et al 2018 it is dominated by large commercial farms under corn and soybean rotation subsurface tile drainage is widely used to enable poorly drained soil to be productive cropland due to the intensive agricultural activities in the u s corn belt excessive nutrient loads e g nitrogen and phosphorus discharge to stream networks which have caused serious water quality and ecological issues in downstream rivers and estuaries such as the harmful algal blooms in the western basin of lake erie national science and technology council 2017 and hypoxia in the gulf of mexico rabalais and turner 2019 in addition excess losses of nutrients are also a waste of resources available for crop and natural vegetation growth even though the sources of agriculturally derived nonpoint source pollution nps were studied and best management practices bmps were implemented to reduce nps water quality problems persist in agricultural watersheds more targeted and efficient measures are needed to improve water quality by reducing nutrient losses at the source while maintaining agricultural productivity therefore it is imperative to clarify the key processes in water and nutrient balances in the watershed to identify the critical areas and time periods for taking appropriate measures water and nutrient balances identify the flows of water and nutrients into and out of an area such as a watershed prior studies on nutrient balances have usually been conducted at the field scale since nutrient input and output components are easily obtained at this scale salo and turtola 2006 tunney et al 2003 woli et al 2010 xin et al 2017 at the regional scale studies tend to indicate that some regions have nutrient accumulation or depletion based on statistics and do not pay much attention to the hydrological and nutritional processes inside the region engel et al 2013 slaton et al 2004 some studies mainly focus on one or several processes of the balance components david et al 1997 jaworski et al 1992 liu et al 2020 due to the complexity of hydrologic and nutrient cycles at the regional scale it is difficult to take into account all the water and nutrient input and export processes in a large watershed hydrological models with calibration and validation provide a feasible option for quantifying the water and nutrient transports through various paths within a watershed the soil and water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed and process based river basin model which includes modules of weather hydrology plant growth nutrients and land management arnold et al 2012 swat has been widely used for modeling hydrologic water quality processes costa et al 2019 francesconi et al 2016 wang et al 2019 even though swat hydrological simulation represents many processes due to data availability and research interests most studies have only calibrated the stream flow processes before model application this may result in inaccurate quantification of other processes and the distortion of some key parameters studies have shown that the calibration of actual evapotranspiration eta is very important in watershed hydrological simulation abbaspour et al 2019 parajuli et al 2018 plant growth variables relating to leaf area index lai and crop yields can affect plant water nutrient uptakes and water quantity quality simulation significantly cibin et al 2016 however comprehensive calibration and validation of all these processes in swat simulation have seldom been achieved the most active part of a watershed is the soil layer where precipitation and management operations are directly applied evapotranspiration plant growth and nutrient cycling take place and surface runoff lateral soil flow percolation and nutrient losses are generated therefore in swat the soil layer is the direct source for generating water and nutrient losses to groundwater and streams in tile drained areas such as the u s corn belt subsurface drainage tiles are placed in the soil layer tile drainage greatly influences the soil water balance and nutrient losses boles et al 2015 guo et al 2018 to better consider tile drainage process the drainmod drainage routines have been incorporated into swat moriasi et al 2012 however these routines in swat have not been widely verified guo et al 2018 in addition the current model is still incomplete for simulating nitrogen and phosphorus losses through tile drainage and percolation bauwe et al 2019 therefore improvements are needed for these modules in swat to close the nutrient balances in soil for these reasons a tile drained agricultural watershed in the u s corn belt was selected as a case study area fig 1 to investigate the key processes and primary sources of water and nutrient losses the swat model was improved to take into account all nutrient loss paths from soil the specific objectives of the research were to 1 set up a comprehensively calibrated and validated swat model for simulating monthly stream flow nutrient loads eta lai and crop yields in the watershed 2 evaluate the water and nutrient i e nitrogen and phosphorus balances of the entire watershed and the corn soybean rotation system based on the improved swat model and 3 provide implications for water and nutrient management and bmp implementation in the u s corn belt 2 materials and methods 2 1 water and nutrient balance method and swat improvement the swat model was selected for the present study because of its advantage for fully considering water and nutrient balance components from the field scale to the watershed scale its physically based computationally efficient and open source characteristics make it one of the most widely used hydrological models based on user specific inputs the basic spatial unit for model operation hydrologic response unit hru can represent areas with similar soils land uses and slopes within a subbasin arnold 2012 this study was conducted based on the swat 2012 revision 681 source code as this study aimed to identify the main sinks and sources of water and nutrients in the land phase the spatial domain boundary for water and nutrient balances was set from the canopy surface to the bottom of the soil profile identified by swat for the entire watershed or certain land uses groundwater and stream routing processes were also simulated by swat but not included in the balance calculation the water balance equation during a specified period can be expressed as 1 δ s w p e t a q s u r f q l a t q t i l e p e r c where δsw is the soil water content change mm p is precipitation mm eta is actual evapotranspiration mm qsurf is the amount of surface runoff mm qlat is the amount of lateral soil flow mm qtile is the amount of water drains through subsurface tile systems mm and perc is the amount of water that percolates past the bottom of soil profile mm and a negative value indicates water moving into the soil zone through capillary rise in response to water deficiencies all the above water balance components can be calculated from current swat outputs for nutrient balances nitrogen and phosphorus were considered the nitrogen balance can be described as 2 δ n n a p p n d e p n f i x n s u r f n l a t n t i l e n p e r c n v o l n d n i t n y i e l d where δn is the change of soil nitrogen content kg n ha 1 napp is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied kg n ha 1 ndep is the amount of nitrogen deposition from atmosphere kg n ha 1 nfix is the amount of nitrogen fixed by legumes kg n ha 1 nsurf is the amount of nitrogen transported by surface runoff into the reach kg n ha 1 nlat is the amount of nitrogen transported by lateral flow into the reach kg n ha 1 ntile is the amount of nitrogen transported by tile flow into the reach kg n ha 1 nperc is the amount of nitrogen leached past the bottom of the soil profile with water percolation kg n ha 1 nvol is the amount of nitrogen loss by ammonia volatilization kg n ha 1 ndnit is the amount of nitrogen removed from soil through the transformation of nitrate to gaseous compounds kg n ha 1 and nyield is the amount of nitrogen removed through yield harvest kg n ha 1 all the above nitrogen balance components should refer to the total nitrogen including all possible nitrogen forms as nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and organic nitrogen organic n however some forms in a certain balance component may be very small and unstable e g no2 n and nh3 n these forms were ignored in some processes in this study in the swat framework ndep includes nitrate and ammonia from both wet deposition absorption of compounds by precipitation and dry deposition direct adsorption of compounds to water or land surfaces the amount of wet deposition can be obtained from the national atmospheric deposition program national trends network arnold et al 2012 and the dry deposition can be obtained from holland et al 2005 nsurf nlat ntile and nperc include no3 n and organic n for nsurf swat already provides the calculation of the two forms of nitrogen for nlat ntile and nperc only no3 n is simulated while organic n is ignored in the current version of swat however many previous studies have shown that organic n losses in nlat ntile and nperc are also significant and should be considered in nitrogen balance calculation cuadra and vidon 2011 van kessel et al 2009 therefore the calculation of the organic n losses through lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation were added to the current swat model because lateral soil flow tile drainage percolation together with shallow groundwater are all related to base flow to avoid introducing more parameters the existing groundwater parameter gw lat orgn organic n concentration in shallow groundwater contribution to stream flow mg l 1 was also specified as the organic n concentration parameter in the three subsurface nitrogen loss paths for calibration the original and newly added nitrogen forms considered in each balance component are summarized in table 1 to quantify ammonia volatilization from different land use types outputs for nvol were added to the hru and subbasin output files output hru and output sub respectively phosphorus balance can be described as 3 δ p p a p p p s u r f p l a t p t i l e p p e r c p y i e l d where δp is the change of soil phosphorus content kg p ha 1 papp is the amount of phosphorus fertilizer applied kg p ha 1 psurf is the amount of phosphorus transported by surface runoff into the reach kg p ha 1 plat is the amount of phosphorus transported by lateral flow into the reach kg p ha 1 ptile is the amount of phosphorus transported by tile flow into the reach kg p ha 1 pperc is the amount of phosphorus leached past the bottom of the soil profile kg p ha 1 and pyield is the amount of phosphorus removed through yield harvest generally speaking all the above phosphorus balance components refer to the total phosphorus the natural soil and water system includes three major forms of phosphorus soluble mineral phosphorus soluble p insoluble forms of mineral phosphorus sediment p and organic phosphorus organic p in swat soluble p is used as a proxy for orthophosphate for simulating solution phosphorus transport sediment p i e the mineral phosphorus attached to sediment sedp used in swat and organic p may also be transported by water to the main channel when they are attached to soil particles through soil erosion however except for psurf in which the three forms of phosphorus are simulated in the current version of swat only soluble p is considered for ptile kalcic et al 2016 and none of the three are considered for the other phosphorus loss components plat and pperc this may be acceptable for sedp as its losses through tile drainage lateral flow and percolation are much smaller than that through surface runoff however it is better to take into account other phosphorus balance components and forms to have a relatively complete phosphorus balance calculation bauwe et al 2019 beauchemin et al 1998 williams et al 2016 therefore in this study the current swat model was improved to further consider the organic p in lateral flow tile flow and percolation and the soluble p in lateral flow and percolation to avoid introducing more parameters similar to nitrogen the parameter lat orgp organic p concentration in shallow groundwater contribution to stream flow mg l 1 to be calibrated was also specified as the organic p concentration in the tile lateral and percolation flow to calculate the organic p loads in ptile plat and pperc the parameter gwsolp soluble p concentration in groundwater contribution to stream flow was also specified as the soluble p concentration in lateral flow and percolation for calibration in this way the soluble p load in plat and pperc was also calculated the original and newly added phosphorus forms considered in each balance component are shown in table 1 in addition even though tile drained areas have long been recognized as the main source of nitrogen pollution to water the nutrient loss characteristics under different crops have not been fully identified therefore in this study the water and nitrogen balance results for the corn soybean rotation system were separated as corn and soybean to identify their differences 2 2 site description the st joseph river watershed

period was set from january 2008 to december 2019 the 10 m resolution digital elevation model dem data 2017 from the u s geological survey usgs the national map viewer http apps nationalmap gov downloader were used to delineate the watershed and calculate topographic parameters thirty subbasins within sjrw were created with 5700 ha 2 of the watershed area as the minimum stream threshold value land use data from 2008 to 2019 were downloaded from the national agricultural statistics service nass cropland data layer cdl https nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape and analyzed to find the most representative year for model input as a result the cdl 2015 was selected because the proportions of the main land use types e g soybean pasture corn and forest in 2015 were closest to that of the multi year average during the study period soil data were obtained from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo https websoilsurvey sc egov usda gov hrus were delineated in the arcswat interface by overlaying land use soil and slope maps three slope classes 0 2 2 5 and 5 were used for the delineation due to the need to capture low medium and high slopes liu et al 2019 the number of hrus was reduced using the threshold of 5 for land use 5 for soil type and 5 for slope to improve modeling efficiency while keeping most details her et al 2015 as a result sjrw was divided into 2047 hrus in which the corn soybean rotation system constituted 659 hrus and accounted for 48 7 of the total area the penman monteith equation was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration and transpiration requiring climate inputs including precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed that were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa national centers for environmental information website https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web solar radiation data were downloaded from the national solar radiation database nsrdb https nsrdb nrel gov all the meteorological data were processed at a daily time scale from 2008 to 2019 with missing data less than 2 replaced by measurements from adjacent stations since swat assumes wind speed information is collected from gauges positioned 1 7 m above the ground surface wind speed data obtained from instruments placed at elevations other than this height were adjusted based on a power wind speed profile neitsch et al 2011 as a result the numbers of gage stations with effective data for model input were 7 for precipitation 7 for air temperature 4 for relative humidity 4 for wind speed and 8 for solar radiation fig s 1 crop management operations have a significant effect on water and nutrient balances in the watershed however it is difficult to obtain the exact management operations for all fields therefore the crop management operations in this study were synthesized from previous studies conducted in this region and representative countywide averages a few simplifications and estimates were also made on the management practices for swat input as shown in table s 1 the 2 year corn soybean rotation system was assumed for all the corn and soybean fields cibin et al 2012 winter wheat was assumed to grow in the same field year by year without rotation the planting harvesting dates fertilizer application dates and amounts pesticide application rates and tillage were averages from literature boles et al 2015 cibin et al 2016 her et al 2016 wallace et al 2017 grazing operations were applied to the pasture area as described by cibin et al 2016 forest areas i e deciduous forest and wetland forest were represented in the model as already growing with mature tree stands however the measured 140 mg ha 1 aboveground dry biomass in indiana forests gormanson and kurtz 2017 was not used as model input this was because under the current swat evaporation algorithm such a large biomass amount will result in near zero soil evaporation and unreasonably low evapotranspiration in forest areas instead zero initial aboveground biomass was set in swat and the actual forest biomass can be obtained by summing the model simulated value with the initially measured one tile drainage was assumed in hrus having land uses of corn soybean or wheat with slopes less than 5 and hydrologic soil groups of c or d boles et al 2015 liu et al 2019 pignotti et al 2017 as a result about 50 of the total watershed and 92 of the corn soybean rotation system were estimated as tile drained areas the newly added drainmod drainage routines were selected to simulate subsurface drainage moriasi et al 2007a moriasi et al 2012 this method is more physically based and has worked well in simulating tile flow and nitrate nitrogen in several regions boles et al 2015 guo et al 2018 moriasi et al 2013 tile drainage flux is computed using the hooghoudt steady state equation when the water table is below the soil surface or ponded depressional depth is below a threshold hooghoudt 1940 using the kirkham equation when the water table completely fills the surface and the water is ponded for a relatively long period kirkham 1957 and using the drainage coefficient when the simulated tile drainage flux is greater than the maximum tile drainage capacity skaggs 1978 2 4 model calibration and validation model simulation was conducted from 2008 to 2019 in which three years 2008 2010 were used for model warm up five years 2011 2015 for calibration and four years 2016 2019 for validation data sets including stream flow water quality actual evapotranspiration eta leaf area index lai and crop yield were used for model calibration and validation daily and monthly stream flow data m3 s 1 were obtained from the st joseph river usgs gaging station id 04 180 500 near fort wayne in i e near the watershed outlet based on this the monthly water pollutant concentration data total suspended solids tss total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn nitrate and nitrite nitrogen nox n total phosphorus tp and orthophosphate phosphorus orthop mg l 1 obtained from the nearby water quality station instor wqx 15 053 were converted to monthly pollutant loads tons mon 1 using a web version of load estimator loadest tool https engineering purdue edu mapserve loadest park et al 2015 runkel et al 2004 the web based hydrograph analysis tool what lim et al 2005 was used to estimate the base flow index bfi the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis et product mod16a2gf which is a year end gap filled 8 day composite dataset produced at 500 m pixel resolution was converted to monthly scale et products running et al 2019 the modis lai product mcd15a2h with a temporal spatial resolution of 8 day and 500 m for the sjrw was also obtained myneni et al 2015 county level annual crop yield data were collected from the usda national agricultural statistics service nass database https www nass usda gov data and statistics the county level statistical yield kg ha 1 of a given crop was apportioned to the watershed based on the proportions of corresponding crop area within the county that was also within the watershed to the area of the crop in the entire watershed the average yield of a crop for the watershed was calculated by summing all the yield apportionments of the counties that intersected with the sjrw in order to compare with the observed yield the swat output crop yield dry weight was converted to the nass standard yield with moisture content being respectively 15 5 and 13 0 for corn and soybean the workflow for swat model calibration is shown in fig s 2 swat cup abbaspour 2015 was used for preliminary sensitivity analysis sensitive parameters identified for model calibration validation are shown in table s 2 initial values and ranges of these parameters were determined based on model defaults literature and their physical meanings the model was calibrated and validated first for vegetation growth then a second time for hydrology and finally for water quality engel et al 2007 guo et al 2018 swat cup auto calibration and manual calibration were both used for vegetation growth manual calibration was conducted first for remote sensing lai of the entire watershed and then for the observed yields of corn and soybean for hydrology auto calibration was conducted for the monthly stream flow then manual calibration was conducted for remote sensing et tile flow and base flow ratio for water quality auto calibration for the observed monthly loads of tss nox n and tkn orthop and tp were conducted manual calibration was further conducted to ensure the tile flow nutrient loads and nutrients removal by corn and soybean yields harvest were in reasonable ranges the calibration process was iterated for at least three times to guarantee the optimization of the entire model besides the graphical techniques three quantitative statistics including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percent bias pbias and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr as recommended by moriasi et al 2007b were used for model performance evaluation the model performance can be judged as acceptable if nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 and if pbias 25 for stream flow pbias 55 for sediment and pbias 70 for nitrogen and phosphorus as very good if nse 0 75 and rsr 0 50 and if pbias 10 for stream flow pbias 15 for sediment and pbias 25 for nitrogen and phosphorus moriasi et al 2007b the relatively strict criteria for stream flow were also used for eta and lai in this study due to their significant seasonal variations since crop yields did not vary greatly between years and it was difficult for models to capture these minor interannual variations average multi year crop yields were usually used for evaluating model performance martin 1993 ren et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2010 therefore loose criteria for nse i e nse 0 and rsr i e rsr 1 0 while strict criteria for pbias i e pbias 10 were suggested for the yield simulation being judged as acceptable in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation 3 1 1 crop growth the simulated lai and remote sensing lai matched well with nse 0 70 pbias 18 and rsr 0 54 for the calibration period and nse 0 61 pbias 26 and rsr 0 62 for the validation period some discrepancies were found during the peak lai periods in july and august when the simulated lai results were usually higher than the remote sensing results it may be caused by the consistent planting dates for crops used by the model which resulted in the maximum lai for a certain crop occurring almost at the same time in the watershed in addition many marginal lands roads and individual houses with lower lai values were eliminated when mapping land cover and generating swat hrus using a 5 land use threshold her et al 2015 lark et al 2017 the 500 m resolution remote sensing lai also has many uncertainties with unacceptable level of mixed pixels kimm et al 2020 the consistent harvest dates for crops resulted in sudden declines of lai in september due to crop harvest after this the relatively slow lai declines of forests and pastures resulted in short stable lai periods in some years e g 2013 2014 2017 and 2019 fig 2 parameters used to calibrate the watershed lai included phu blai frgrw2 laimx2 dlai t opt and t base for corn soybean pasture deciduous forest and wetlands forest table s 2 these parameters were first specified based on previous studies fransen et al 2017 qu and zhuang 2018 and then slightly adjusted to optimize the model performance on lai simulation the comparisons of swat simulated corn and soybean yields with observed yields are shown in fig 2 results showed that the model performance for corn yield simulation was much better than that of soybean the nse and rsr for corn respectively reached 0 75 and 0 48 while they were 0 17 and 0 86 for soybean it may be because corn yield is more prone to be affected by environmental factors such as drought and nitrogen stress resulting in significant yearly variation however the soybean yields were relatively stable across years for example the observed corn yield had an obvious decrease in the drought year 2012 while there was only a slight decrease for soybean studies have shown that soybean is more resistant to short term drought stress due to its overlapping development stages hoffman et al 2020 licht and archontoulis 2017 however the current model is not able to take into account this mechanism very well the multi year average yields of corn and soybean were both captured with pbias of 0 08 for corn and 0 17 for soybean the main parameters used to calibrate grain yields were phu bio e hvsti blai t opt and t base table s 2 these parameters were all within the acceptable ranges from previous studies in the region cibin et al 2016 guo et al 2018 hu et al 2007 3 1 2 hydrology results showed that the monthly stream flow and eta were well captured by the model fig 3 for stream flow the goodness of fit indicators during the calibration period nse 0 88 pbias 5 rsr 0 34 and validation period nse 0 79 pbias 5 rsr 0 45 both indicated very good model performance moriasi et al 2007b the comparison of simulated and remote sensing eta resulted in nse 0 90 pbias 0 69 and rsr 0 31 during the calibration period and nse 0 88 pbias 1 8 and rsr 0 35 during the validation period the simulated average annual eta was 652 mm accounting for 66 of precipitation this coincides with sanford and selnick 2013 which reported that the fraction of precipitation lost to evapotranspiration in this area is between 0 60 0 69 the accurate model simulation for stream flow and eta indicated that the main water output components from the watershed were captured in addition the estimated bfi by what was 0 61 and the simulated result had a similar value of 0 56 in the tile drained areas tile flow depth averaged 164 mm accounting for 17 of the annual precipitation it was within the measured range of 9 3 to 37 1 from field scale studies in similar locations as summarized by boles et al 2015 and also compared well with other case studies conducted within the sjrw liu et al 2019 wallace et al 2017 all the above results confirmed the accuracy of the model simulation for hydrological processes the calibrated parameters for hydrology are shown in table s 2 a 25 reduction in the initial scs runoff curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 was applied to all tile drained areas to make sure that the watershed bfi and tile drainage amount were in reasonable ranges swat modeled groundwater evaporation revap was restricted to a small value in this study through the parameters gw revap revapmn and gwqmn table s 2 it was because the term revap enters the atmosphere directly and should have been classified as evapotranspiration however its calculation method is separated from the current et algorithm in swat and has been questioned in many studies abiodun et al 2018 liu et al 2015 luo et al 2008 if it is added to eta the energy balance principle used for calculating et will be broken therefore this study avoided this method and made more water in the deep soil layer be directly consumed by soil evaporation or plant transpiration through the adjustment of parameters esco and epco thus approaching the actual mechanism of shallow groundwater evaporation the maximum canopy storage canmx mm values for crops pastures and forests were respectively specified as 1 5 1 5 and 2 0 mm which were the averages of many previous studies hu et al 2007 parajuli et al 2018 white et al 2017 wu and johnston 2008 3 1 3 water quality the swat model performance for simulating tss was similar to that for hydrology resulting in nse 0 81 pbias 6 5 and rsr 0 43 during the calibration period and nse 0 75 pbias 19 and rsr 0 50 during the validation period fig 4 for nutrient loads nox n tkn orthop and tp some discrepancies were found between the simulated and loadest results especially for some peak loads in winter and early spring they may be caused by the inaccuracies of the fertilizer application schedule used in this study for example some farmers apply phosphorus fertilizer in the autumn after harvest while others may apply in the spring before planting the application dates also vary annually depending on weather conditions guo et al 2021 however this study assumed fixed application rates and dates for the entire watershed in addition the sparse observation data also bring uncertainties to the results of loadest park and engel 2015 it should be noted that the observed orthop data were only available from 2018 so just two year data were used for generating the full observed loads from 2011 to 2019 nevertheless the goodness of fit indicators for modeling the monthly nutrient loads nox n tkn orthop and tp were within the acceptable range engel et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007b with nse 0 51 pbias 20 and rsr 0 69 during the calibration period and nse 0 45 pbias 35 and rsr 0 71 during the validation period fig 4 the improved model had better performance in simulating tkn orthop and tp loads in stream flow fig s 3 especially for tkn the model performance was significantly improved with nse increasing from 0 46 to 0 78 and pbias and rsr decreasing from 38 and 0 73 to 10 and 0 47 respectively these model performance improvements further verified the rationality and necessity of considering additional paths and forms of soil nutrient losses in this study the parameters calibrated for water quality are shown in table s 2 besides the auto calibrated parameters some parameters were manually calibrated and determined based on their physical meanings the parameter hlife ngw half life of nitrate in the shallow aquifer was calibrated to be 110 days which was very close to the previous measured or calibrated values hoghooghi et al 2017 malagó et al 2017 the organic n concentration in base flow lat orgn was determined within the standard deviation sd of observed organic n concentrations during the base flow months as there were no observed data for organic p concentration and very few data available for orthop in the stream flow the sum of the base flow organic p concentration lat orgp and soluble p concentration gwsolp was limited to the sd of the tp concentrations observed during the base flow months the normal fractions of nitrogen and phosphorus in yield i e cnyld and cpyld used by swat should be calculated based on dry basis however the nutrient concentrations of grains reported by literature were usually expressed at certain moisture contents as a result the cnyld and cpyld were respectively specified as 0 014 and 0 0034 for corn anthony et al 2013 tenorio et al 2019 villamil et al 2019 and 0 064 and 0 0061 for soybean la menza et al 2019 nathan et al 2009 salvagiotti et al 2008 villamil et al 2019 based on the averages of literature reports and adjusted by grain moisture content the tile drainage parameters for drainmod were adjusted based on the field conditions the depth to impervious layer in the soil profile dep imp was calibrated to be 3800 mm which resulted in some water about 43 of tile drainage amount percolating to the shallow groundwater this is reasonable because there should be a considerable amount of water percolated to the shallow groundwater and then drained to the ditches or streams directly rather than all the excess soil water being drained through the subsurface tile systems 3 1 4 dynamics and interactions between crop growth hydrology and water quality variables the variation of crop growth hydrology and water quality variables were interrelated the yearly variation of crop yield fit the variation of lai with lower yield usually corresponding to a lower lai fig 2 it was because lai influenced light interception and use which ultimately affected biomass and crop yield the monthly dynamics of eta were also consistent with lai with the highest eta usually occurring in july when the largest lai occurred while the lowest eta usually occurring in february when the lai was low thus lai should be an important factor influencing the variation of eta the peak stream flow tended to occur in spring when eta had recently passed its minimum the lowest stream flow usually occurred between august and october right after the occurrence of the highest eta fig 3 this indicated that there was a lag time for stream flow to respond to the monthly eta variation for water quality variables tss and nutrient loads nox n tkn orthop and tp were all positively correlated with stream flow fig 4 correlation analysis showed that tss load was most correlated with stream flow with r2 reaching 0 96 while nox n load was least correlated with r2 being 0 70 results demonstrated that the model can reasonably reproduce the dynamics and interactions of the above variables 3 2 water balance the 9 year average 2011 2019 soil water balance components for the watershed are shown in table 2 results showed yearly eta averaged 652 mm which accounted for 66 of the precipitation surface runoff was the second largest water output equaling 15 of precipitation water percolation reached 92 mm indicating more than 9 of precipitation recharged the shallow groundwater system tile drainage played a significant role in the watershed with about 8 of precipitation drained through the tile system lateral soil flow was the smallest component only accounting for 2 of precipitation the water budgets in corn soybean rotation system csrs were significantly affected by human farming activities compared with that at the watershed scale the eta values of corn and soybean were very similar both slightly lower than the watershed average value it may be because the growth periods of corn and soybean were shorter than the other land cover types e g forests and pastures surface runoff in csrs averaged 103 mm which was about 29 lower than the watershed average it was mainly caused by the extensive subsurface tile drainage in the farmland the tile drainage depth in the csrs reached 150 mm accounting for 15 of the precipitation which was the largest water output component except for eta water percolated to the shallow groundwater system was also largely reduced because of the intense tile drainage in order to quantify the characteristics of water budgets between seasons water balance components during the growing season and the non growing season were calculated separately fig 5 the growing season of the watershed was defined as the main growth period of corn and soybean from may 1 to september 30 while the non growing season was defined as the remaining months results showed that the growing season eta represented about 70 of the yearly value both at the watershed scale and the csrs the growing season eta for corn was slightly higher than that of soybean while the non growing season eta for corn was lower than that of soybean it was because the longer growth period of corn resulted in more water consumption during the growing season while more crop residue after harvest in corn resulted in lower evaporation during the non growing season the non growing season surface runoff and percolation were about three times those of the growing season tile drainage depth during the non growing season was about twice that of the growing season it indicated that the non growing season was the main period contributing to stream flow and groundwater during a year with similar precipitation between growing season and non growing season the significant difference in surface and subsurface runoff was caused by the large gap in eta between the two seasons 3 3 nitrogen balance 3 3 1 nitrogen input and output in the watershed nitrogen input output components and their forms are summarized in table 3 of the three nitrogen inputs fertilizer provided 57 9 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and was the largest source introduced into the watershed accounting for 45 of the total nitrogen input nh3 n was the main component of nitrogen fertilizer making up 75 of the fertilizer amount the nitrogen fixed by legumes was 47 5 kg ha 1 in the watershed with only about 24 of the area planted as soybean each year this was the second largest nitrogen source into the watershed accounting for 37 of the total input nitrogen deposition from the atmosphere was also non negligible as it represented about 18 of the total input nearly 80 of the nitrogen deposition was constituted of no3 n nitrogen removed by yield was the largest sink 76 8 kg ha 1 in the watershed accounting for 64 of the total output the nitrogen emitted to the atmosphere through denitrification and ammonia volatilization reached 19 9 kg ha 1 representing 17 of the total output the remaining 19 of nitrogen was transported to stream flow and groundwater through hydrological processes the amounts of nitrogen transported by surface runoff tile drainage and percolation respectively contributed about 27 34 and 34 of the nitrogen loss through water discharge a very small proportion of nitrogen 4 was lost with the lateral soil flow the nitrogen forms in surface runoff were dominated by organic n while these were dominated by no3 n in tile flow percolation and lateral flow the nitrogen loss with water during the non growing season was significantly larger than that during the growing season fig 5 the proportions of non growing season nitrogen losses to the yearly values through surface runoff lateral flow tile drainage and water percolation were 77 50 59 and 70 respectively this was because the non growing season water discharges from these components were much larger than those of the growing season in addition vegetation uptake was negligible during the non growing season thus more no3 n may be available to be transported with tile drainage percolation and lateral soil flow 3 3 2 nitrogen input and output in the corn soybean rotation system csrs the nitrogen balance components in the corn field and soybean field were quite different the corn field nitrogen input averaged 212 3 kg ha 1 of which nearly 90 was from fertilizer however in the soybean field with similar nitrogen input of 221 9 kg ha 1 about 85 of that was from nitrogen fixation thus the annual nitrogen input to the csrs through fertilizer was around 100 kg ha 1 which was much less than the fertilizer nitrogen input to the wheat corn system in the north china plain 500 kg ha 1 michalczyk et al 2020 and the rice wheat system in the indo gangetic plains of india 300 kg ha 1 sapkota et al 2020 this was because the csrs in the u s corn belt has only one crop season per year with substantial soybean nitrogen fixation and relatively better nitrogen management nitrogen deposition from the atmosphere accounted for about 11 of the total input to the csrs the nitrogen removed by yield for corn 112 7 kg ha 1 was lower than that in soybean 175 5 kg ha 1 while all other nitrogen outputs in corn fields were higher than soybean nitrogen lost by denitrification in corn fields 31 2 kg ha 1 was a little higher than that in soybean 25 2 kg ha 1 due to the large amount of ammonia n fertilizer applied to corn fields ammonia volatilization was more than ten times higher than that of soybean fields the nitrogen loads lost to stream flow and shallow groundwater through hydrological processes surface runoff lateral soil flow tile flow and percolation in corn fields were about 27 higher than those in soybean among these components the nitrogen loads through tile flow were the largest occupying about 50 of the total nitrogen loads from the csrs this was quite different from areas without tile drainage such as the wheat corn system in the north china plain and the rice wheat system in the indo gangetic plains where nitrogen loads through percolation accounted for most nitrogen losses to the water system michalczyk et al 2020 pathak et al 2010 it is worth mentioning that the tile flow nitrogen load in corn was about 41 higher than that in the soybean field this was mainly caused by the large amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to the corn as a result the total nitrogen output was lower than input in the corn while it was higher than input for soybean overall the nitrogen input to the csrs was slightly 2 3 larger than the output which indicates that the soil nitrogen content may have an increasing trend this is consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer was applied to the u s corn belt for sustaining high productivity kim et al 2021 while a significant result of high nitrogen input was the increase of total nitrogen content in soil jagadamma et al 2008 liebig et al 2002 uncertainty of model inputs such as fertilizer and parameterization may also result in the imbalance of the nitrogen simulation 3 4 phosphorus balance 3 4 1 phosphorus input and output in the watershed the only phosphorus input to the watershed was fertilizer application in which soluble p from chemical fertilizer was the dominant component accounting for 94 of the total input table 4 phosphorus removed by yield was the dominant output component representing 91 of the total output the remaining phosphorus loss components were through hydrological processes in which surface runoff contributed 66 of the total losses reaching 0 77 kg ha 1 the main phosphorus forms lost through surface runoff were organic p and soluble p respectively accounting for 47 and 44 sediment p constituted the last 9 the amounts of phosphorus lost through tile drainage and percolation were very similar both being about 0 18 kg ha 1 however the amount of soluble p in tile flow was slightly larger than organic p while that in percolation was lower than organic p this was reasonable due to the poor sorption and rapid leaching characteristics of organic p result in relatively higher organic p proportion in deeper soils compared with upper soils mcdowell et al 2021 in this study the depth of drainage tiles was at about 1 m depth while the bottoms of soil layers were usually deeper than 1 5 m 3 4 2 phosphorus input and output in the corn soybean rotation system csrs phosphorus fertilizer application in corn averaged 31 14 kg ha 1 which was higher than that for soybean of 22 92 kg ha 1 the average annual phosphorus application rate to the csrs was 27 kg ha 1 which was around 1 5 of that to the wheat corn system in the north china plain huang et al 2017 while slightly higher than that to agricultural land in europe around 20 kg ha 1 tóth et al 2014 higher phosphorus application in corn was because corn growth needs more phosphorus than soybean as shown in table 4 the phosphorus removed by yield in corn and soybean fields were respectively 27 37 and 16 73 kg ha 1 it was the main phosphorus output component in csrs accounting for 95 of the total output corn removed much more phosphorus than soybean because corn yield 9 58 t ha 1 was about three times of soybean yield 3 14 t ha 1 while the phosphorus concentration in corn 0 0034 kg p kg 1 yield was 56 of that in soybean 0 0061 kg p kg 1 yield other phosphorus output components were all through hydrological processes surface runoff was the main hydrological process causing phosphorus loss representing about 55 of the total loss in corn and 50 of that in soybean fields phosphorus loss through surface runoff in corn was larger than that in soybean it may be because tillage was performed for corn while no till was applied to soybean the phosphorus loss through surface runoff in the csrs averaged 0 58 kg ha 1 which was very close to that in european agricultural lands kronvang et al 2007 while lower than that in the north china plain huang et al 2017 the second main path of phosphorus loss was through tile drainage accounting for about 31 and 34 of the total losses in corn and soybean respectively the average phosphorus load in tile drainage was 0 36 kg ha 1 which was comparable to the observed values in agricultural watersheds in central ohio 0 48 kg ha 1 and illinois 0 50 kg ha 1 king et al 2015 gentry et al 2007 moreover the simulated soluble p load accounted for 56 of the total phosphorus load in tile drainage which was within the range of 48 81 as reported in the above observational studies this demonstrated the rationality of considering additional forms of phosphorus loss in tile drainage as in this study phosphorus lost through tile drainage in soybean was higher than that in corn fields which was mainly contributed by soluble p table 4 the reason may also be the different tillage operations applied between the two crops in addition the soluble phosphorus removed by corn yield was 64 higher than that by soybean yield which reduced the phosphorus available for draining through the tile in corn fields due to the intensive tile drainage in csrs phosphorus lost through percolation was relatively lower than that at the watershed scale in total phosphorus inputs were larger than the outputs in both corn and soybean fields indicating that there was an excess of phosphorus application to the csrs previous studies in this region also reported that the excessive phosphorus application resulted in significant legacy phosphorus accumulation in soil dodd and mallarino 2005 mccollum 1991 which was an important cause of water quality problems muenich et al 2016 in addition the uncertainty of model inputs and parameterization may also result in the imbalance of the phosphorus simulation 3 5 insights on water quality management to reduce the nutrient loads to surface water and groundwater the water and nutrient sources available for transport through surface runoff lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation should be reduced to achieve this based on the water and nutrient balance calculation there should be a good balance between inputs and other outputs which do not contribute to the surface water or groundwater for water balance the only output component that did not contribute to the land water system was evapotranspiration eq 1 for a given amount of water input i e precipitation increasing eta will reduce the output to the water system and thus may reduce nutrient loads possible ways to increase eta include planting cover crops during the non growing season or vegetation with longer growth period and deeper rooting depth to extract more water from soil and increasing soil water holding capacity to provide more water for evapotranspiration for nutrient balance reducing nitrogen and phosphorus inputs is the most common way to reduce nutrient losses this can be implemented through precision fertilization such as formulated fertilization and splitting application time which could maintain yield with less fertilizer in addition increasing nitrogen and phosphorus removed by yield will also reduce nutrients lost through the water it means improving crop yield has the potential to improve water quality assuming additional nutrients are not applied of all the nutrient output components only the nutrients removed by yield are beneficial many measures related to crop yield improvements such as irrigation weed control and crop breeding can be applied for the nitrogen cycle denitrification and ammonia volatilization are additional paths that may reduce the nitrogen losses to the water system however they are usually considered negative factors reducing nitrogen use efficiency and need to be minimized despite this denitrification is still used in some special conditions to reduce nutrient loads to water for example managed drainage and lined denitrification beds were used to reduce tile nitrate export to streams through increased denitrification woli et al 2010 agricultural bmps e g blind inlets wetlands grade stabilization structures filter strips and grassed waterways are commonly employed to control nutrient loads to water liu et al 2017 2019 muenich et al 2016 identifying the key hydrological processes which contribute the greatest nutrient loads can make the deployment of bmps more cost effective for nitrogen surface runoff tile drainage and percolation were almost equally important in the watershed as they contributed similar loads each contributed about 30 to the water system for phosphorus surface runoff was the most important path as it contributed 66 of the total loads therefore bmps affecting surface runoff tile drainage and percolation should be considered for reducing nitrogen load while bmps affecting surface runoff should be the focus for reducing phosphorus load the csrs contributed 83 and 88 of the total nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the watershed even though it represented only about 49 of the total area for nutrients lost to the water system the csrs contributed 64 of the nitrogen and 46 of the phosphorus thus the csrs was the key area contributing nitrogen losses in the watershed while other land uses contributed more phosphorus this indicates that more bmps should be employed in the csrs for reducing nitrogen load while bmps in other land uses may be more important for reducing phosphorus load when examining nutrient outputs through water the main components causing differences of nutrient loads between csrs and other land use types were surface runoff and tile drainage the nutrient loads especially the organic form through surface runoff in the watershed were obviously larger than that in csrs therefore the best management practices that may reduce the nutrient losses through surface runoff should be emphasized in the non crop land use types such as forests and pastures for nutrient losses through tile drainage in farmland more nitrogen was found in corn fields while more phosphorus was found from soybean fields therefore specific measures can be applied to the two crops the nitrogen fertilizer application may need to be optimized for corn while the phosphorus fertilizer application needs to be optimized for soybean controlled drainage is another option to reduce the nutrient loads through tile drainage this is especially true during the non growing season when the major nutrient losses occur and excess water retained by soil will not affect crop growth the non growing season is also the critical period for reducing nutrient loads in surface runoff and percolation fig 5 planting cover crops during the non growing season can effectively fix nutrients and increase eta thus reducing water and nutrient losses 4 conclusions water and nutrient balances in an agricultural watershed in the u s corn belt from 2011 to 2019 were calculated based on swat model simulation the swat model was improved to consider additional forms of nitrogen and phosphorus lost through lateral soil flow tile drainage and percolation the model was comprehensively calibrated validated at the monthly scale for simulating stream flow eta tss nutrient loads including nox n tkn orthop and tp lai and crop yields results showed that the model performance was very good for simulating stream flow eta and tss and acceptable for nutrient loads lai and crop yields for the entire watershed eta and surface runoff were the main water outputs respectively accounting for 66 and 15 of the precipitation for the nutrients lost to the water system nitrogen loss was mainly through surface runoff tile drainage and percolation each contributing about 30 phosphorus loss was mainly through surface runoff which represented 66 of the total losses nitrogen forms lost with surface runoff were dominated by organic n while losses with tile drainage and percolation were mainly no3 n organic p and soluble p almost contributed equally to losses in surface runoff lateral flow tile drainage and percolation in the csrs eta was still the largest water consumer representing 65 of precipitation while tile drainage was the second largest water output accounting for 15 of precipitation representing about 49 of the total watershed the csrs contributed 83 and 88 of the total nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the watershed meanwhile 64 of the nitrogen and 46 of the phosphorus lost to the water system were contributed by the csrs it indicated that nitrogen management should focus on csrs and phosphorus should address both csrs and other land use types in csrs corn fields lost more nitrogen than soybean fields while soybean fields lost more phosphorus than corn fields the non growing season october to the next april was recognized as the critical period resulting in water and nutrient losses due to low evapotranspiration and plant uptake based on these targeted management strategies for reducing nutrient loads to the water system were suggested

been investigated towards ion selective separations such as water softening nutrient recovery and production of irrigation water especially promising is the use of activated microporous carbon electrodes due to their low cost and wide availability at commercial scales we show here both theoretically and experimentally that sulfonated activated carbon electrodes enable the first demonstration of perfect divalent cation selectivity in cdi where we define perfect as significant removal of the divalent cation with zero removal of the competing monovalent cation for example for a feedwater of 15 mm nacl and 3 mm cacl2 and charging from 0 4 v to 1 2 v we show our cell can remove 127 μmol per gram carbon of divalent ca2 while slightly expelling competing monovalent na 13 2 μmol

carbon aerogels farmer et al 1996 xu et al 2008 one of the advantages of using intercalation materials is that they can provide the same salt adsorption capacity at a lower voltage and can allow for selective separations by designing the host material to select preferentially the desired ion kim et al 2017 singh et al 2020 however intercalation electrodes are generally more expensive and not widely available at scale as compared to activated carbons and the energy consumption of cells with intercalation electrodes has been shown to be similar to that with activated carbons in careful

long charging times due to the higher electrostatic force acting on divalent ions in the edls zhao et al 2012 at short times however the monovalent ion can be selected preferentially guyes et al 2021 seo et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 pore size can be tuned to sub nm size and physically exclude larger divalent ions thus resulting in strong monovalent selectivity avraham et al 2008 hawks et al 2019b zhang et al 2021 in cdi with redox and intercalation electrodes selectivity is achieved by specific interactions between the ion and electrode material these interactions sometimes favor divalent ions xu et al 2020 but monovalent selective materials are more common lee et al 2017a 2017b shang et al 2021 singh et al 2020 chemical functionalization of the electrode micropores has been shown to

functionalizing the cathode with negative surface charge enhances selective removal of the smaller ion guyes et al 2019 use of sulfonic groups is promising due to their electrochemical stability and strong acid behavior pk a 3 which makes them insensitive to the local ph environment sulfonated electrodes have been utilized to improve charge efficiency min et al 2018 qian et al 2015 ion adsorption

enhanced monovalent selectivity at short charging times yet increased divalent selectivity at long times guyes et al 2021 in the latter work a cdi cell was cycled 1000 times at a short charging time with coulombic efficiency 96 showing that cdi with sulfonated electrodes is highly stable under certain operating conditions we here show that by using sulfonated porous carbons a cdi cell with a feed of both monovalent and divalent cations can store the divalent ion uniquely without storing the competing monovalent ion a phenomenon we term perfect divalent cation selectivity our results extend the range of selective separations possible with cdi as perfect divalent cation selectivity has not been shown previously using cdi cells with either porous carbon electrodes or intercalation electrodes we further show that such a separation is highly efficient with a charge efficiency for storage of ca2 of above unity which is predicted theoretically and demonstrated experimentally the latter indicates that over the charging half cycle more than one ca2 ion is stored per each two electrons transferred between electrodes due to the parallel mechanisms of ion electrosorption and ion swapping in the future perfect divalent cation selectivity can be implemented towards a multitude of practical separations such as energy efficient water softening 2 theory to provide context to our experimental results we employed a model capturing equilibrium electrosorption of ca2 na and cl in a two electrode cdi cell guyes et al 2019 we utilize the modified donnan md formulation biesheuvel et

setting σ chem a 0 05 m as in a previous study with the same activated porous carbons used here guyes et al 2021 in a system with two electrodes such as a cdi cell the dimensionless cell voltage is distributed between the electrodes via 4 ϕ cell ϕ a ϕ c where ϕ a and ϕ c are the anode and cathode potentials respectively the cell voltage is related to the donnan potentials δ ϕ d j and the stern layer potentials δ ϕ s j by 5 ϕ cell δ ϕ s a δ ϕ d a δ ϕ d c δ ϕ s c where the stern layer potential is 6 δ ϕ s j f v t c s σ elec j and c s is the stern layer capacitance the dimensional cell voltage v cell ϕ cell v t can be set to the voltage during cell charging v ch or that during cell discharging v disch the charging half cycle is from v disch to v ch while the discharging half cycle is the inverse process from v ch to v disch since electrons from the anode are brought to the cathode during charging the total stored electric charge in the cathode is equal in magnitude to that in the anode assuming no faradaic side reactions and therefore the overall system charge is balanced according to 7 m a v mi a σ elec a m c v mi c σ elec c 0 where m a and m c are the electrode masses and v

mm nacl and 3 mm cacl2 which models the level of these ions found in hatzeva brackish groundwater in israel ghermandi and messalem 2009 this water falls on the upper edge of moderately hard water which can be difficult to treat with membrane based technologies as the high concentration of hardness ions in the brines can leads to membrane scaling tong et al 2019 warsinger et al 2015 dissolved oxygen in the feedwater can enhance cdi cell degradation during cycling thus prior to cdi experiments the solution was sparged with nitrogen gas n2 for 20 min until the dissolved oxygen reached 2 5 of

least three charge discharge cycles where the limit cycle was reached by the third cycle each expriment was repeated three times with fresh electrodes for each realization during the charging step of the third cycle the cell effluent was collected for 29 min for subsequent analysis to investigate ion selectivity by cdi a handful of methods for effluent ion concentration measurement have been utilized guyes et al 2021 hemmatifar et al 2017 lee et al 2013 li and zou 2011 liu et al 2013 mubita et al 2019 2018 tsai and doong 2015 yang and zou 2014 zhao et al 2012 several methods are

perform some lower infrastructure techniques have been explored such as titrations liu et al 2013 or combining ion selective electrodes and ion conductivity measurements guyes et al 2021 in this work to further develop low infrastructure techniques we relate the measured conductivity to ion concentrations by using the extended onsager fuoss model bahga et al 2010 jaroš et al 2002 onsager and fuoss 1932 a model which accounts for ionic strength and finite ion size effects based on the numerical framework used by bahga et al 2010 2 2 the buffer calculator model is available on http microfluidics stanford edu download see supplementary information section s1 prior to experiments the ionic conductivity ph and ca2 concentration of the feed solution were measured the conductivity of the solution

metrohm ag switzerland for ca2 concentration determination 5 ml of sample and 10 ml of 1 m kcl ionic strength adjuster isa were pipetted into a 25 ml glass beaker then a ca2 ion selective electrode 6

min was used for each increment the ca2 concentration was back calculated to account for the initial dilution with isa guyes et al 2021 for measurements of the cdi cell effluent the ph ionic conductivity and ca2 concentration of the collected sample were measured immediately after collection to assess the accuracy of the ca2 selective electrode and use of the extended onsager fuoss model towards obtaining na concentration an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry instrument icp oes plasmaquant pq 9000 analytik jena was used as a secondary measure of na and ca2 concentrations across three experimental conditions the icp oes instrument was operated in radial viewing mode to simultaneously detect ca2 and na at wavelengths of 422 nm and 589 nm respectively instrument gas flow settings were 12 ml min for the plasma 0 5 ml min for the auxiliary and 0 6 ml min for the nebulizer the deviation in measured ca2 concentration between the ca2 selective electrode and icp results was at most 1 3 while the deviation between our use of the extended onsager fuoss model and icp oes results for na was less than 1 8 see supplementary information sections s1 s3 the measured electrosorption of ion i γ i is defined as 10 γ i c feed i c effluent i v m here c feed i and c effluent i are the concentrations of species i in the feed and collected effluent respectively v is the collected sample volume and m is the dry mass of both electrodes cycle charge efficiency quantifies the ratio of salt removed from the feed to charge transferred between electrodes and is given by 11 λ cycle mf γ n a 2 γ c a 2 q disch where q disch is the measured charge released during cell discharge to determine how efficiently our cell stores ca2 we propose the following definition for calcium charge efficiency 12 λ c a 2 2 mf γ c a 2 q disch 4 results in fig 2 b we show the equilibrium predictions of ion electrosorption during cell charging versus the cell s discharging voltage v disch model results are for a cell charging voltage v ch of 1 2 v and a feedwater of 15 mm nacl and 3 mm cacl2 additional model parameters are given in table s1 the predicted cl storage is 252 9 μmol g carbon at v disch 0 v and decreases to 195 5 μmol g at v disch 0 4 v due to a narrowing voltage window ca2 storage is also significant at about 142 5 μmol g at v disch 0 v and likewise decreases slightly as v disch is increased na is predicted to be slightly desorbed from the micropores during cell charging for all discharge voltages plotted with decreasing desorption as v disch is increased to validate the model predictions we ran experiments with our custom built cdi cell using a sulfonated cathode as was measured via direct titrations by guyes et al 2021 the chemical charge of the sulfonated cathode is about 1 5 m at ph 7 it has been previously shown that achieving cell equilibrium and such high divalent selectivity can require long timescales for example zhao et al 2012 showed 5 h charging was required for their cdi cell here we do not charge experimentally to equilibrium to avoid excessively long charge times which can significantly degrade the electrode surface but instead fix charging time to 30 min a time where our cell nears equilibrium uwayid et al 2020 as can be seen in fig 2b for cl the experimental electrosorption is slightly higher than the predictions with cl storage during charging averaging 284 8 μmol g at v disch 0 v and decreasing with increasing v disch to 240 3 μmol g at v disch 0 4 v measured ca2 storage was nearly constant at all discharge voltages averaging about 127 μmol g na storage at v disch 0 v averaged 52 2 μmol g but then na decreased to 7 9 μmol g at v disch 0 2 v and na desorption of 13 2 μmol g was measured at 0 4 v interpolating between our experimental measurements suggests that at v disch 0 25 v we would achieve approximately zero na desorption yet 127 μmol g ca2 adsorption slight discrepancies between equilibrium model and experiment fig 2b for example the difference in na desorption trends with increasing v disch are potentially because the experimental cell did not reach complete equilibrium after 30 min of charging overall the model and experiment both demonstrate that perfect divalent cation selectivity can be achieved using a cell with a suitably functionalized cathode where we define perfect selectivity as when the target ion alone is removed significantly with no adsorption of competing ions we here define significant removal as on the order of magnitude of 10 µmol gcarbon per charge or larger which ensures only practically applicable separations will be reported as perfect the na desorption seen in fig 2b can be attributed the δ μ n a c ex term in eq 1 without this term the model predicts adsorption of na during charging instead of the observed desorption illustrating the importance of an excess repulsive potential to this phenomenon here modeled by ion volume exclusion interactions fig 2a to further probe the underlying causes of na desorption during charging observed in fig 2b in fig 2c we plot predictions for the difference in the electrostatic potential in the cathode between the charged and discharged states δ z i δ ϕ d c z i δ ϕ d c ch z i δ ϕ d c disch and the difference in repulsive excess potentials for these two states δ δ μ i c ex δ μ i c ex ch δ μ i c ex disch for the same model conditions used in fig 2b fig 2c shows these quantities for na and ca2 where we observe that for na repulsion δ δ μ n a c ex is greater than attraction δ δ ϕ d c for all v disch therefore na experiences a net repulsion from the cathode during charging for all v disch values furthermore the value of δ δ μ n a c ex δ δ ϕ d c increases with decreasing v disch causing increasing na desorption from the cathode as v disch is lowered the strong repulsive effect acting on the na is due to dense ion packing in cathode micropores where the packing is enhanced by the presence of sulfonic groups by contrast for ca2 the stronger electrostatic potential δ 2 δ ϕ d c is greater than δ δ μ c a 2 c ex for all v disch indicating net ca2 adsorption in the cathode for all discharging voltages when v disch 0 2 v na and ca2 expulsion from the anode during charging becomes significant which limits the net ca2 adsorption by the cell and enhances overall na desorption in fig 2b nearly identical behavior is predicted to occur if we replace ca2 with a slightly larger divalent cation mg2 to translate ion electrosorption into a quantifiable measure of selectivity we utilize the separation factor 13 β y x 2 c feed y c feed x 2 γ x 2 ads γ y ads where x2 is a divalent cation and y is a competing monovalent cation in eq 13 a cdi system is divalent selective when β y x 2 1 monovalent selective when β y x 2 1 and nonselective when β y x 2 1 furthermore in eq 13 we set γ i ads 0 for ions which are desorbed during charging or in other words for ions with negative electrosorption values from eq 10 this definition prevents negative β y x 2 values which can lead to difficulties in comparing achieved selectivity between systems this also means that β y x 2 for a cell with perfect cation selectivity fig 3 shows a historical evolution of achieved separation factors by a cdi cell with competing monovalent and divalent cations calculated using eq 13 we include here eighteen works covering selectivity factors achieved with cdi cells with porous carbon electrodes cdi cells with intercalation electrodes and membrane cdi mcdi cells while many cdi cells have previously been able to achieve strong divalent selectivity notably zhao et al 2012 achieved β n a c a 2 24 to our knowledge no previous cdi cell has shown perfect divalent cation selectivity with β n a c a 2 either with porous carbons electrodes intercalation electrodes or mcdi until this work the perfect ca2 selectivity achieved by our experimental cell is further remarkable as it required inexpensive commercial activated carbon materials with a simple sulfonation pretreatment rather than specialized intercalation materials or materials with carefully controlled sub nanoscale pore structure cerón et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in fig 4 we show equilibrium model predictions for both cycle and ca2 charge efficiencies λ cycle and λ c a 2 respectively versus v disch here cycle charge efficiency improves with increasing v disch and asymptotes to unity behavior consistent with previous works on voltage windowing in cdi cells as windowing reduces parasitic co ion desorption kim et al 2015 predictions for calcium charge efficiency show similar trends with v disch except the asymptote is above unity reaching about 1 02 thus the model predicts that during charging on average more than one ca2 is removed per every two electrons transferred between the electrodes this surprising result is due to ca2 being stored in micropore edls by both electrosorption and also by ion swapping fig 2a the latter is the exchange during cell charging of a ca2 ion from the feed with two na ions which were in the cathode micropore at the beginning of the charge step such an exchange is energetically preferred at late charging times approaching equilibrium guyes et al 2021 zhao et al 2012 experimentally measured cycle and calcium charge efficiency with our cdi cell with sulfonated cathode is shown in fig 4 at v disch 0 4 v we attain an average calcium charge efficiency of 1 11 validating the model prediction that an above unity calcium charge efficiency is possible as with ion electrosorption fig 2 discrepancies between model and experiment for charge efficiency are seen this is likely due to the experimental cell not reaching complete equilibrium which results in lower measured than predicted charge efficiency interestingly at v disch 0 4 v the experimentally achieved calcium charge efficiency does not follow this trend as it is slightly higher than that predicted overall to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of an above unity charge efficiency achieved by a competing ion in any cdi cell high charge efficiencies also enable low specific energy consumption as at v disch 0 4 v our experimental cdi cell required a very low electrical energy input of approximately 0 064 kwh m3 of desalinated water and 0 081 kwh m3 when assuming 100 energy recovery during discharge and 0 energy recovery respectively demonstrating the high promise of this technique for applications such as water softening we expect that energy requirements can be further lowered for a perfectly divalent selective separation by cdi via future cell engineering optimizations 5 conclusions we here demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that perfect cation selectivity is achievable by capacitive deionization cells with porous carbon electrodes the term perfect selectivity refers to the target ion being significantly removed from the feed with zero removal of the competing ions in the future the known limits of ion selectivity by cdi with porous carbon electrodes can be similarly extended with combined theory and experimental approaches to further expand the array of separations possible with cdi cells leveraging inexpensive electrodes further divalent selectivity should be tested with other competing ions and potential foulants such as natural organic matter nom the effect of nom may be minor as wang et al 2020 showed that the nom effect can be mitigated by electrode pretreatment and liu et al 2018 showed that nom entering the cell

al 2015 zhang et al 2020 there are two major classes of cdi electrodes with the most widely used being microporous carbon electrodes and the emerging class of intercalation type electrodes chang et al

cathode micropore electric double layers edls while anions migrate to the anode micropore edls to regenerate the electrodes the cell is discharged by either shorting the electrodes modifying the applied potential window or application of a reverse current which releases the stored ions into a brine stream while often allowing the stored energy to be recovered oren 2008 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 common carbon based electrodes include microporous activated carbons ac cohen et al 2013 gao et al 2016 lu et al 2017 oyarzun et al 2018 wu et al 2015 carbon nanotubes yang et al 2013 and carbon aerogels farmer et al 1996 xu et al 2008 one of the advantages of using intercalation materials is that they can provide the same salt adsorption capacity at a lower voltage and can allow for selective separations by designing the host material to select preferentially the desired ion kim et al 2017 singh et al 2020 however intercalation electrodes are generally more expensive and not widely available at scale as compared to activated carbons and the energy consumption of cells with intercalation electrodes has been shown to be similar to that with activated carbons in careful experimental comparisons pothanamkandathil et al 2020 cdi with porous carbons can provide highly versatile ion selective separations due to a multitude of separation mechanisms including those

long charging times due to the higher electrostatic force acting on divalent ions in the edls zhao et al 2012 at short times however the monovalent ion can be selected preferentially guyes et al 2021 seo et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 pore size can be tuned to sub nm size and physically exclude larger divalent ions thus resulting in strong monovalent selectivity avraham et al 2008 hawks et al 2019b zhang et al 2021 in cdi with redox and intercalation electrodes selectivity is achieved by specific interactions between the ion and electrode material these interactions sometimes favor divalent ions xu et al 2020 but monovalent selective materials are more common lee et al 2017a 2017b shang et al 2021 singh et al 2020 chemical functionalization of the electrode micropores has been shown to increase selectivity dong et al 2019 guyes et al 2021 2019 oyarzun et al 2018 prior work showed that in an environment containing li and k cations with identical valence but differing hydrated sizes functionalizing the cathode with negative surface charge enhances selective removal of the smaller ion guyes et al 2019 use of sulfonic groups is promising due to their electrochemical stability and strong acid behavior pk a 3 which makes them insensitive to the local ph environment sulfonated electrodes have been utilized to improve charge efficiency min et al 2018 qian et al 2015 ion adsorption

enhanced monovalent selectivity at short charging times yet increased divalent selectivity at long times guyes et al 2021 in the latter work a cdi cell was cycled 1000 times at a short charging time with coulombic efficiency 96 showing that cdi with sulfonated electrodes is highly stable under certain operating conditions we here show that by using sulfonated porous carbons a cdi cell with a feed of both monovalent and divalent cations can store the divalent ion uniquely without storing the competing monovalent ion a phenomenon we term perfect divalent cation selectivity our results extend the range of selective separations possible with cdi as perfect divalent cation selectivity has not been shown previously using cdi cells with either porous carbon electrodes or intercalation electrodes we further show that such a separation is highly efficient with a charge efficiency for storage of ca2 of above unity which is predicted theoretically and demonstrated experimentally the latter indicates that over the charging half cycle more than one ca2 ion is stored per each two electrons transferred between electrodes due to the parallel mechanisms of ion electrosorption and ion swapping in the future perfect divalent cation selectivity can be implemented towards a multitude of practical separations such as energy efficient water softening 2 theory to provide context to our experimental results we employed a model capturing equilibrium electrosorption of ca2 na and cl in a two electrode cdi cell guyes et al 2019 we utilize the modified donnan md formulation biesheuvel et

of spheres with differing diameters and has been successfully to describe integrated properties of ion mixtures in planar edls avraham et al 2008 lee et al 2017a qian et al 2015 as well as to the study of size based ion selectivity in highly overlapped micropore edls guyes et al 2019 suss 2017 in the micropores the ionic charge is balanced by the electric and chemical charge present on the

functional groups behave as weak acids or bases the chemical charge σ chem j depends on local micropore ph guyes et al 2019 uwayid et al 2020 instead we here consider strong acid sulfonic functional groups with relatively ph independent chemical charge guyes et al 2021 and thus use the constant value of σ chem c 1 5 m for the cathode for the anode we account for a small native chemical charge by setting σ chem a 0 05 m as in a previous study with the same activated porous carbons used here guyes et al 2021 in a system with two electrodes such as a cdi cell the dimensionless cell voltage is distributed between the electrodes via 4 ϕ cell ϕ a ϕ c where ϕ a and ϕ c are the anode and cathode potentials respectively the cell voltage is related to the donnan potentials δ ϕ d j and the stern layer potentials δ ϕ s j by 5 ϕ cell δ ϕ s a δ ϕ d a δ ϕ d c δ ϕ s c where the stern layer potential is 6 δ ϕ s j f v t c s σ elec j and c s is the stern layer capacitance the dimensional cell voltage v cell ϕ cell v t can be set to the voltage during cell charging v ch or that during cell discharging v disch the charging half cycle is from v disch to v ch while the discharging half cycle is the inverse process from v ch to v disch since electrons from the anode are brought to the cathode during charging the total stored electric charge in the cathode is equal in magnitude to that in the anode assuming no faradaic side reactions and therefore the overall system charge is balanced according to 7 m a v mi a σ elec a m c v mi c σ elec c 0 where m a and m c are the electrode masses and v mi a and v mi c are the specific micropore volumes in the electrodes it is reasonable to assume m a m c m 2 and v mi a v mi c v mi see materials and methods and so eq 7 simplifies to σ elec a σ elec c

beaker to let the h2so4 sink to the bottom and separate out afterward the material was immersed in 500 ml of ice water for 30 min then soaked with 200 ml of di three times each time for 30 min then the electrodes were dried in the oven at 60 c overnight the material was cut into pieces of 2 25 2 25 cm2 and used as the cathode the specific micropore volume of the cathode is 0 55 cm3 g as determined by nitrogen adsorption analysis the cdi cell utilized a flow through electrodes fte architecture in which the feed stream flows directly through electrode macropores as shown in fig 1 and

2400 sourcemeter keithley instruments united states the cell terminates with a pvdf upstream endplate and abs downstream endplate cdi experiments were carried out with a feed solution comprised of 15 mm nacl and 3 mm cacl2 which models the level of these ions found in hatzeva brackish groundwater in israel ghermandi and messalem 2009 this water falls on the upper edge of moderately hard water which can be difficult to treat with membrane based technologies as the high concentration of hardness ions in the brines can leads to membrane scaling tong et al 2019 warsinger et al 2015 dissolved oxygen in the feedwater can enhance cdi cell degradation during cycling thus prior to cdi experiments the solution was sparged with nitrogen gas n2 for 20 min until the dissolved oxygen reached 2 5 of saturation orion star a213 thermo fisher scioentific usa and then a lower rate of n2 bubbling was maintained for the duration of the experiment the feed solution was pumped at flow rate 1 ml min using a peristaltic pump masterflex 07551 30 cole parmer usa the cell was charged for 30 min at 1 2 v and discharged for 30 min at various discharge voltages 0 0 2 and 0 4 v each experiment consisted of at least three charge discharge cycles where the limit cycle was reached by the third cycle each expriment was repeated three times with fresh electrodes for each realization during the charging step of the third cycle the cell effluent was collected for 29 min for subsequent analysis to investigate ion selectivity by cdi a handful of methods for effluent ion concentration measurement have been utilized guyes et al 2021 hemmatifar et al 2017 lee et al 2013 li and zou 2011 liu et al 2013 mubita et al 2019 2018 tsai and doong 2015 yang and zou 2014 zhao et al 2012 several methods are considered very accurate including ic lee et al 2013 mubita et al 2019 icp oes tsai and doong 2015 zhao et al 2012 and icp ms hemmatifar et al 2017 but generally require significant infrastructure to perform some lower infrastructure techniques have been explored such as titrations liu et al 2013 or combining ion selective electrodes and ion conductivity measurements guyes et al 2021 in this work to further develop low infrastructure techniques we relate the measured conductivity to ion concentrations by using the extended onsager fuoss model bahga et al 2010 jaroš et al 2002 onsager and fuoss 1932 a model which accounts for ionic strength and finite ion size effects based on the numerical framework used by bahga et al 2010 2 2 the buffer calculator model is available on http microfluidics stanford edu download see supplementary information section s1 prior to experiments the ionic conductivity ph and ca2 concentration of the feed solution were measured the conductivity of the solution was measured using a flow through conductivity sensor tracedec 390 50 innovative sensor technologies gmbh austria the ph of the solution was measured using a ph sensor iaquatrode plus and 904 titrando metrohm ag switzerland for ca2 concentration determination 5 ml of sample and 10 ml of 1 m kcl ionic strength adjuster isa were pipetted into a 25 ml glass beaker then a ca2 ion selective electrode 6 0510 100 metrohm was immersed in the prepared solution 0 1 m cacl2 standard 21059 sigma aldrich usa was manually pipetted in increments of 0 2 0 5 and 1 5 ml under stirring a drift criterion of 1 mv min was used for each increment the ca2 concentration was back calculated to account for the initial dilution with isa guyes et al 2021 for measurements of the cdi cell effluent the ph ionic conductivity and ca2 concentration of the collected sample were measured immediately after collection to assess the accuracy of the ca2 selective electrode and use of the extended onsager fuoss model towards obtaining na concentration an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry instrument icp oes plasmaquant pq 9000 analytik jena was used as a secondary measure of na and ca2 concentrations across three experimental conditions the icp oes instrument was operated in radial viewing mode to simultaneously detect ca2 and na at wavelengths of 422 nm and 589 nm respectively instrument gas flow settings were 12 ml min for the plasma 0 5 ml min for the auxiliary and 0 6 ml min for the nebulizer the deviation in measured ca2 concentration between the ca2 selective electrode and icp results was at most 1 3 while the deviation between our use of the extended onsager fuoss model and icp oes results for na was less than 1 8 see supplementary information sections s1 s3 the measured electrosorption of ion i γ i is defined as 10 γ i c feed i c effluent i v m here c feed i and c effluent i are the concentrations of species i in the feed and collected effluent respectively v is the collected sample volume and m is the dry mass of both electrodes cycle charge efficiency quantifies the ratio of salt removed from the feed to charge transferred between electrodes and is given by 11 λ cycle mf γ n a 2 γ c a 2 q disch where q disch is the measured charge released during cell discharge to determine how efficiently our cell stores ca2 we propose the following definition for calcium charge efficiency 12 λ c a 2 2 mf γ c a 2 q disch 4 results in fig 2 b we show the equilibrium predictions of ion electrosorption during cell charging versus the cell s discharging voltage v disch model results are for a cell charging voltage v ch of 1 2 v and a feedwater of 15 mm nacl and 3 mm cacl2 additional model parameters are given in table s1 the predicted cl storage is 252 9 μmol g carbon at v disch 0 v and decreases to 195 5 μmol g at v disch 0 4 v due to a narrowing voltage window ca2 storage is also significant at about 142 5 μmol g at v disch 0 v and likewise decreases slightly as v disch is increased na is predicted to be slightly desorbed from the micropores during cell charging for all discharge voltages plotted with decreasing desorption as v disch is increased to validate the model predictions we ran experiments with our custom built cdi cell using a sulfonated cathode as was measured via direct titrations by guyes et al 2021 the chemical charge of the sulfonated cathode is about 1 5 m at ph 7 it has been previously shown that achieving cell equilibrium and such high divalent selectivity can require long timescales for example zhao et al 2012 showed 5 h charging was required for their cdi cell here we do not charge experimentally to equilibrium to avoid excessively long charge times which can significantly degrade the electrode surface but instead fix charging time to 30 min a time where our cell nears equilibrium uwayid et al 2020 as can be seen in fig 2b for cl the experimental electrosorption is slightly higher than the predictions with cl storage during charging averaging 284 8 μmol g at v disch 0 v and decreasing with increasing v disch to 240 3 μmol g at v disch 0 4 v measured ca2 storage was nearly constant at all discharge voltages averaging about 127 μmol g na storage at v disch 0 v averaged 52 2 μmol g but then na decreased to 7 9 μmol g at v disch 0 2 v and na desorption of 13 2 μmol g was measured at 0 4 v interpolating between our experimental measurements suggests that at v disch 0 25 v we would achieve approximately zero na desorption yet 127 μmol g ca2 adsorption slight discrepancies between equilibrium model and experiment fig 2b for example the difference in na desorption trends with increasing v disch are potentially because the experimental cell did not reach complete equilibrium after 30 min of charging overall the model and experiment both demonstrate that perfect divalent cation selectivity can be achieved using a cell with a suitably functionalized cathode where we define perfect selectivity as when the target ion alone is removed significantly with no adsorption of competing ions we here define significant removal as on the order of magnitude of 10 µmol gcarbon per charge or larger which ensures only practically applicable separations will be reported as perfect the na desorption seen in fig 2b can be attributed the δ μ n a c ex term in eq 1 without this term the model predicts adsorption of na during charging instead of the observed desorption illustrating the importance of an excess repulsive potential to this phenomenon here modeled by ion volume exclusion interactions fig 2a to further probe the underlying causes of na desorption during charging observed in fig 2b in fig 2c we plot predictions for the difference in the electrostatic potential in the cathode between the charged and discharged states δ z i δ ϕ d c z i δ ϕ d c ch z i δ ϕ d c disch and the difference in repulsive excess potentials for these two states δ δ μ i c ex δ μ i c ex ch δ μ i c ex disch for the same model conditions used in fig 2b fig 2c shows these quantities for na and ca2 where we observe that for na repulsion δ δ μ n a c ex is greater than attraction δ δ ϕ d c for all v disch therefore na experiences a net repulsion from the cathode during charging for all v disch values furthermore the value of δ δ μ n a c ex δ δ ϕ d c increases with decreasing v disch causing increasing na desorption from the cathode as v disch is lowered the strong repulsive effect acting on the na is due to dense ion packing in cathode micropores where the packing is enhanced by the presence of sulfonic groups by contrast for ca2 the stronger electrostatic potential δ 2 δ ϕ d c is greater than δ δ μ c a 2 c ex for all v disch indicating net ca2 adsorption in the cathode for all discharging voltages when v disch 0 2 v na and ca2 expulsion from the anode during charging becomes significant which limits the net ca2 adsorption by the cell and enhances overall na desorption in fig 2b nearly identical behavior is predicted to occur if we replace ca2 with a slightly larger divalent cation mg2 to translate ion electrosorption into a quantifiable measure of selectivity we utilize the separation factor 13 β y x 2 c feed y c feed x 2 γ x 2 ads γ y ads where x2 is a divalent cation and y is a competing monovalent cation in eq 13 a cdi system is divalent selective when β y x 2 1 monovalent selective when β y x 2 1 and nonselective when β y x 2 1 furthermore in eq 13 we set γ i ads 0 for ions which are desorbed during charging or in other words for ions with negative electrosorption values from eq 10 this definition prevents negative β y x 2 values which can lead to difficulties in comparing achieved selectivity between systems this also means that β y x 2 for a cell with perfect cation selectivity fig 3 shows a historical evolution of achieved separation factors by a cdi cell with competing monovalent and divalent cations calculated using eq 13 we include here eighteen works covering selectivity factors achieved with cdi cells with porous carbon electrodes cdi cells with intercalation electrodes and membrane cdi mcdi cells while many cdi cells have previously been able to achieve strong divalent selectivity notably zhao et al 2012 achieved β n a c a 2 24 to our knowledge no previous cdi cell has shown perfect divalent cation selectivity with β n a c a 2 either with porous carbons electrodes intercalation electrodes or mcdi until this work the perfect ca2 selectivity achieved by our experimental cell is further remarkable as it required inexpensive commercial activated carbon materials with a simple sulfonation pretreatment rather than specialized intercalation materials or materials with carefully controlled sub nanoscale pore structure cerón et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in fig 4 we show equilibrium model predictions for both cycle and ca2 charge efficiencies λ cycle and λ c a 2 respectively versus v disch here cycle charge efficiency improves with increasing v disch and asymptotes to unity behavior consistent with previous works on voltage windowing in cdi cells as windowing reduces parasitic co ion desorption kim et al 2015 predictions for calcium charge efficiency show similar trends with v disch except the asymptote is above unity reaching about 1 02 thus the model predicts that during charging on average more than one ca2 is removed per every two electrons transferred between the electrodes this surprising result is due to ca2 being stored in micropore edls by both electrosorption and also by ion swapping fig 2a the latter is the exchange during cell charging of a ca2 ion from the feed with two na ions which were in the cathode micropore at the beginning of the charge step such an exchange is energetically preferred at late charging times approaching equilibrium guyes et al 2021 zhao et al 2012 experimentally measured cycle and calcium charge efficiency with our cdi cell with sulfonated cathode is shown in fig 4 at v disch 0 4 v we attain an average calcium charge efficiency of 1 11 validating the model prediction that an above unity calcium charge efficiency is possible as with ion electrosorption fig 2 discrepancies between model and experiment for charge efficiency are seen this is likely due to the experimental cell not reaching complete equilibrium which results in lower measured than predicted charge efficiency interestingly at v disch 0 4 v the experimentally achieved calcium charge efficiency does not follow this trend as it is slightly higher than that predicted overall to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of an above unity charge efficiency achieved by a competing ion in any cdi cell high charge efficiencies also enable low specific energy consumption as at v disch 0 4 v our experimental cdi cell required a very low electrical energy input of approximately 0 064 kwh m3 of desalinated water and 0 081 kwh m3 when assuming 100 energy recovery during discharge and 0 energy recovery respectively demonstrating the high promise of this technique for applications such as water softening we expect that energy requirements can be further lowered for a perfectly divalent selective separation by cdi via future cell engineering optimizations 5 conclusions we here demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that perfect cation selectivity is achievable by capacitive deionization cells with porous carbon electrodes the term perfect selectivity refers to the target ion being significantly removed from the feed with zero removal of the competing ions in the future the known limits of ion selectivity by cdi with porous carbon electrodes can be similarly extended with combined theory and experimental approaches to further expand the array of separations possible with cdi cells leveraging inexpensive electrodes further divalent selectivity should be tested with other competing ions and potential foulants such as natural organic matter nom the effect of nom may be minor as wang et al 2020 showed that the nom effect can be mitigated by electrode pretreatment and liu et al 2018 showed that nom entering the cell

16342,the formation of anammox hydroxyapatite hap coupled granules has been shown to be an approach to efficient nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery in the anammox egsb reactor however the granulation cycle mechanism of anammox hap coupled granules for sustainable regeneration and growth is still not well understood in this study the microstructure chemical composition and microbial structure of a total of six different sized granules from 0 25 mm to 2 8 mm was determined an sem eds analysis indicated that the small granules 0 5 mm were composed of poly pellet clusters with anammox biofilms attached to the hap cores and the large granules 0 5 mm consisted of a three layer structure a surface anammox biofilm layer a middle connection layer and a hap mineral inner core the analysis of elemental composition and microbial structure suggested homogenous granular characteristics regardless of granule size the dominant microorganisms were anammox bacteria of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria based on these results a granulation cycle mechanism for anammox hap coupled granules was proposed for the first time the growth of the small granules with the simultaneous enlargement of anammox biofilms and hap cores results in the formation of large granules large granules regenerate new small granules in a two step procedure the first step is the separation of embryo hap crystals from the mother core via heterogeneous growth and the second step is the separation of the biofilms due to biodegradation and shear stress graphical

2018 zhang et al 2018 this excellent settleability overcomes the floatation problem which has been shown to cause granular sludge wash outs and an unstable anammox performance for nitrogen removal

al 2018 to achieve higher granule stability filamentous bacteria were reported to connect with each other into an entity chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 vlaeminck et al 2010 specifically the hydraulic shear force is considered a critical physical factor in some studies bioaggregated particles have been compressed into balls to enrich specific microorganisms allowing granulation even at a high upflow velocity tang et al 2009 wang et al 2019 among the many studies on granulation the role of inorganic minerals in the granulation process has not been considered however in the anammox hap egsb reactor the vss ss ratio of anammox hap coupled granules was found to be as low as 20 suggesting inorganic minerals are the main components of the granules it is reasonable to assume that inorganic minerals play an essential role in granulation xue et al 2021 proposed that the hap formation in anammox hap coupled granules depended on three factors 1 the chemical crystallization into hap cores as crystal seeds 2 biomineralization controlled by eps binding ca2 and 3 the increase in ph due to alkalinity production from the anammox reaction however the study on the mechanism did not explore the hap based growth of the microstructure or the granulation cycle in addition to apply granular sludge to large scale operations it is necessary to overcome the difficulty of successfully forming granules and to prevent granule disintegration nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 further understanding of the mechanism of a granulation cycle is required to support the sustainable multiplication of granules to sustain large scale operations and ensure the stability of the anammox granule process in long term applications however while the granulation cycle mechanism is of reference value to the design and control of anammox hap coupled processes for stable operation it is still not fully understood during the granulation cycle mechanism the growth and regeneration of anammox hap coupled structures are yet to be understood and the properties and performances of granules of different sizes need to be determined in addition the roles of anammox bacteria and other heterotrophic bacteria in the granulation cycle need to be clarified the objectives of this investigation are as follows 1 analyze the microstructure of granules and hap skeletons 2 determine the chemical compositions nitrogen and phosphorus removal performances and the microbial communities of granules at different sizes 3 clarify the mechanism of the granulation cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor of an effective volume of 5 l was inoculated with anammox biomass using a recirculation ratio of 2 5 for a continuous experiment

elements ma et al 2020 under nlr of 10 kgn m 3 d 1 the stable total nitrogen removal efficiency of 89 2 and the total phosphorus removal efficiency of 64 8 were maintained during 240 days of the continuous experiments video 1 2 2 analyses of liquid samples nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were analyzed by an agilent 7100 capillary electrophoresis system agilent technologies wilmington usa and total phosphorus was analyzed by an agilent 720 inductively coupled a plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes system agilent technologies wilmington usa after the digestion process xue et al 2020 2 3 analytical methods of granules 2 3 1 sieving procedure of granules to represent the granule variation granular sludge was taken from the egsb reactor on the 60th 150th and 240th days the granules were then sieved by a wet method for the effective isolation of different size granules using various screens tokyo screen co ltd zhu et al 2018 and divided into six groups 0 25 mm 0 25 0 5 mm 0 5 1 mm 1 2 mm 2 2 8 mm and 2 8 mm 2 3 2 morphology of granules the morphology of the sieved granules was recorded by taking photographs with a camera on a smartphone two different pretreatments procedures were used to allow the morphology of the outer biofilm and hap core to be investigated fully in both methods 2 5 glutaraldehyde was used for 8 h then the samples were either dehydrated with a gradient of ethanol 20 40 60 80 100 guo and li 2020 for 20 min or they were heated to 600 to remove biofilm until there was no further change in the quality it has been reported that the organic phase was removed under 600 but that the morphology of the hap core was not affected for 50 hours ramirez gutierrez et al 2017 the granules dehydrated by ethanol were sliced under a microscope sz 8000 to investigate the spatial morphology after pretreatment all of the samples were sputter coated with gold for sem observation ma et al 2018 the microcosmic morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy

volumetric and mass distribution of sieved granules were measured by the graduated cylinder and the electronic balance the vss volatile suspended solids ss suspended solids and svi sludge volume index were determined according to apha standard methods apha awwa wef 2012 the settling velocity and water content of sieved granules were analyzed in the same procedure outlined in previous work xue et al 2020 because water could not be filtered out from sludge below 0 25 mm the supernatant was removed from the sludge three times after allowing it to sit for 30 minutes each time elemental analysis of heated and unheated sieved granules was carried out by wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence wdxrf bruker s8 tiger after grinding and tableting the hydroxyapatite phase was analyzed according to a method explained in previous studies ma et al 2018 xue et al 2021 soluble eps loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps were extracted and measured more details can be found in supplementary information 1 2 xue et al 2021 2 3 4 batch test for performance assessment the batch test estimated the performance of the nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates for different size granules sieved granules of various sizes with the same biomass concentration in 4 g of wet sludge were added to 120 ml serum flasks with a liquid volume of 100 ml the liquid with an initial concentration of 22 8 mgp l 1 100 mgnh4 n l 1 and 120 mgno2 n l 1 was purged with 99 9 n2 gas for 20 min to remove oxygen kong et al 2021 xue et al 2020 four serum flasks were used for each sample the serum flasks were sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum cap and were purged with 99 9 n2 gas for 10 min to remove oxygen in the gaseous phase and then placed in a thermostatic shaker at 35 at 120 rpm bt300 yamato japan specific anammox activity saa was determined by measuring the accumulated nitrogen gas every hour and imputing the results into a modified gompertz equation to define the maximum nitrogen production rate xue et al 2020 the specific phosphorus removal rate sprr was determined by measuring phosphorus removal in liquid samples every hour and used in a modified gompertz equation which defined the maximum phosphorus removal rate the contribution of n removal in the reactor was calculated based on the saa and vss concentrations in the reactor at different sizes the contribution of p recovery in the reactor was calculated based on the sprr and ss concentrations in the reactor for different sizes more details are presented in supplementary information 1 1 2 4 sludge sample preparation dna extraction sequencing and data processing the sludge samples were collected from the egsb reactor during the stable phase and sieved into six groups according to granule size 0 25 mm 0 25 0 5 mm 0 5 1 mm 1 2 mm 2 2 8 mm and 2 8 mm they were then stored in a refrigerator at 80 c for dna extraction after dna extraction using the mpure bacterial dna extraction kit mp bio from the mpure 12 system the concentration was determined by synergy lx bio tek from the quantifluor dsdna system promega the primer 515f and reverse primer 806r were used for the pcr amplification of v3 v4 fragments in the 16s rrna gene chen et al 2019 dna sequencing was performed using the miseq reagent kit v3 illumina usa from the miseq system the raw data were analyzed using qiime2 software version 2020 8 to obtain a 97 identity of the operation taxonomic units otus the details are described in an earlier study li et al 2020 the α diversity including chao1 the shannon index the simpson index good s coverage observed species and singles are shown in supporting information table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 investigation of biomineralization based granules this study focused on the microstructure of granular sludge to reveal the formation mechanism of the outer biofilms layer and the hap core the investigation also compared large granules with a diameter larger than 0 5 mm and small granules with a diameter less than 0 5 mm flocs like to predict the granulation cycle procedures 3 1 1 poly pellets hap cores with anammox biofilms attached with gradual amplification a wrinkled biofilm composed of microbial cells was observed fig 1 a and b an edx analysis revealed that the elemental composition of the biofilm was 27 2 c 39 2 ca and 12 4 p after heating the regular pellets which formed the inorganic core were around 10 μm fig 1f edx results confirmed the formation of calcium phosphate the elemental composition of the core was 5 1 c 33 5 ca and 18 8 p fig 1i a mass of shallow dents covered the surface of the hap core and the orbicular shape of the dents is likely the trail of anammox bacteria and other microorganisms after heating treatment see fig 1f since these dents are similar to the profile of cells guo and li 2020 fig 1c showed that the small granules were aggregated by poly pellets and this finding is consistent with the results of a previous study guo and li 2020 however anammox biofilm with eps remained on the surface of the poly pellet clusters and unlike the large granules no biofilm encapsulation was observed for small granules after heating an inorganic skeleton with the shape of poly pellets appeared fig 1g and fig s6 similarly the skeleton was covered by dents an element analysis in small granules by edx revealed the composition was similar to that of the granules 3 1 2 a three layered structure of large granules no orbicular structures were observed on the surface of large granules fig 1b like those observed on the large granules after biofilm removal fig 1f to further understand the structure of large granules the granules were sliced for more detailed observations fig 2 c showed that the external surface of these granules was completely covered by a biofilm with dense anammox cells for biological nitrogen removal fig 2d showed a mass of collective hap clusters in the connection layer between the biofilm and crystals cells were attached to their surface forming a dual layer structure as the connection layer for the poly pellets fig 2e showed the cores in the large granules were minerals with cavities and porous pellets were observed in the magnified image it has been reported that the porous surface of hap clusters constrained the transport of substrate resulting in cell death after biomineralization guo et al 2020 the large granules were found to consist of three main regions the surface layer of the whole anammox biofilm the connection layer of the anammox hap coupled bilayer pellets and the inner layer of the hap mineral with hollows the formation of this three layered structure can be attributed to the substrate distribution this affects the accumulation rates of bacteria between the biofilm and the core nh4 and no2 were utilized by outer anammox to enhance biofilm growth interrupting mass transport into the core consequently the growth rate of the biofilm was higher than the crystallization rate at the core however as the substrate started to infiltrate the interior layers the crystallization rate began to exceed the biofilm growth rate increasing the proportion of crystals toward 100 the outer two layers the biofilm layer and the connection layer were responsible for the anammox reaction and the biomineralization of the hap core the thickness of the outer two layers could be around 100 μm using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish reported by ma et al 2021 biomineralization from the core outwards led to size enlargement meanwhile an inward extinction of microorganisms occurred along with biomineralization resulting in the formation of three layers fig 2a this biomineralization procedure is similar to that of coral reef builders 3 1 3 coral stone like poly pellets skeleton the skeletons of the hap core resemble microorganisms graves after biofilm removal as can be seen in fig 3 the unique microstructures of the cores result from several different factors as shown in fig 3a and d the cores were spherical due to the homogenous nucleation of the spherical pellets at a crystal core size below 10 μm with identical crystallization rates in all directions de yoreo 2003 when the core size reached around 10 μm heterogeneous growth occurred creating new cores in a growth process at a foreign core rather than homogeneous nucleation inside the crystals vekilov 2010 this is because these cores maintain minimum surface energy at around the 10 μm size and can be concurrently altered by crystallization and other biological factors de yoreo 2003 regardless of the granule size the morphology of the hap cores suggests the accumulation of poriferous crystal nuclei and the formation of a skeleton for nuclei clusters as shown in fig 3e the pores in the pellets suggest there was biofilm coverage and that these biofilms played a more significant role in biomineralization than abiotic chemical crystallization the morphology of abiotic chemical crystallization is visibly different from the hap cores in anammox granules ginebra et al 1995 lower et al 1998 finally the hap cores became porous poly pellets suggesting that the crystal nuclei worked synergistically with the anammox biofilm to encapsulate the hap surface and create a coral like structure in the hap cores 3 2 homogenous characteristics of granules with different sizes with regular granule discharge in the long term operation little change was observed in the characteristics of the granules in the reactor this suggested that a stable state of granule growth and regeneration has been reached more details can be found in fig s5 the results from the 60th 150th and 240th days were represented by mean values as shown in fig 4 3 2 1 stabilized size distribution the mass proportions of size distribution over the 240 day period for the increased sizes were 8 1 11 2 24 1 46 2 7 2 and 5 1 are shown in fig 4b in fig 4c the volumetric proportions of size distribution for the increased sizes can be seen at 25 3 18 2 16 2 30 2 7 1 and 5 1 3 2 2 elemental compositions settling velocity svi vss ss and water content the elemental compositions and ratios of ca and p are similar and the vss ss ratios at different sizes were at around 20 24 fig 4e and g suggesting the homogeneity of various granules however the settling velocity of granules with a hap core dropped from 330 4 4 7 m h 1 to 38 5 9 m h 1 as their size decreased fig 4f the sludge volume index svi decreased from 65 2 6 1 ml gvss 1 to 16 7 1 0 ml gvss 1 as the granule size increased fig 4d one of the main reasons was that water content in the granules rose from 75 1 to 94 1 as the granules became smaller as shown in fig 4g therefore the water content can be considered a convenient indicator for the settleability of granular sludge as shown by fig s4 nevertheless the settling velocity of anammox hap coupled granules is higher than the settling velocity of anammox granules without hap at around 30 100 m h 1 lv et al 2020 ma et al 2020 3 2 3 eps for bioaggregation since the soluble eps and loosely bound eps detected in the total eps was less than 1 neither was considered in this study fig s3 the focus of this study was on the tightly bound eps t eps in granules of different sizes the protein concentration in t eps increased from 90 0 4 3 mg vssg 1 to 159 1 4 3 mg vssg 1 as the granule size increased to 1 mm but decreased to 90 8 4 1 mg vssg 1 when the granule size increased further to over 2 8 mm in granules over 2 mm the decrease in eps concentration with increased size suggests that bigger granules with less eps maintain granule structures zhu et al 2018 on the other hand granules smaller than 1 mm and small granules required more eps for granule growth vlaeminck et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 but protein concentrations of t eps in different sizes were still up to 90 mg vssg 1 for bioaggregation the polysaccharide ratio of the total eps was less than 10 for all sizes 3 2 4 simultaneous n and p removals the results described in fig 5 a showed that the saa of granules over 1 mm in size was approximately 0 81 0 84 gn vssg 1 d 1 and that it was lower in smaller granules the saa values of granules 0 0 25 mm 0 25 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 mm in diameter were 35 52 and 68 of that of granules of 1 2 mm respectively the reason for the low saa in small granule sizes was the lower abundance of anammox bacteria zhu et al 2018 based on saa and vss concentrations the contributions of nitrogen removal for granules of increased sizes in the reactor were 5 6 21 48 15 and 5 respectively the specific phosphorus removal rates for the increased sizes of granules were 0 21 0 01 gp gss 1 day 1 0 18 0 02 gp gss 1 day 1 0 18 0 01 gp gss 1 day 1 0 16 0 02 gp gss 1 day 1 0 15 0 01 gp gss 1 day 1 and 0 16 0 02 gp gss 1 day 1 based on the sprr and ss concentrations the contributions to p removal for the increased sizes were 5 5 52 20 13 and 5 fig 5b 3 2 5 simultaneous granule growth of anammox and hap for granulation the simultaneous removal of n and p suggested the simultaneous growth of the biofilm and the hap core for each size ma et al 2021 the simultaneous growth caused approximate elemental compositions and vss ss ratios at different granule sizes under the stable compositions a deceased water content with an increased size further suggested the dehydration process s growth via a hydrophobic interaction of eps to form dense and compact granules hou et al 2015 wang et al 2020 3 3 the roles of heterotrophic microorganisms in granule regeneration the overall taxonomic composition of the microbial community was investigated by high throughput sequencing on an illumina miseq platform the results revealed that candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis was the dominant species of anammox bacteria while most of the other microbial communities in the granules were identified only at the family level because according to the results of the blast tests their similarities in the genus level were low as shown in fig 6 a brocadiaceae and rhodocyclaceae were the predominant bacteria in all granule sizes with relative abundances of over 25 and 11 respectively which also suggested homogeneity of various granules additionally a mutualism relationship was observed between these two bacteria gonzalez gil et al 2015 specifically rhodocyclaceae was found to be responsible for the increase in heterotrophic denitrification by the utilization of no3 produced from the anammox reaction and organics from the eps of anammox gonzalez gil et al 2015 also the decrease in the saa in small sized granules can be attributed in part to the low relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis besides clusters of bradyrhizobiaceae cytophagaceae ignavibacteriaceae and haliangiaceae became more abundant in larger granules among these bacteria bradyrhizobiaceae could be nitrogen fixing bacteria and is capable of converting n2 into nh4 and cytophagaceae could be nitrogen fixing or carbohydrate degrading bacteria garrity et al 2015 mcbride et al 2014 xu et al 2014 in addition ignavibacteriaceae and haliangiaceae are known to degrade organic materials garcia and müller 2014 gonzalez gil et al 2015 iino et al 2010 based on genome analysis ignavibacteriaceae could reduce nitrate to nitrite because of narghij genes and reduce nitrate to ammonia using pentaheme nitrite reductase nrfha chen et al 2021 mardanov et al 2019 however a significant decrease in the relative abundance of fimbriimonadaceae cryomorphaceae and saprospiraceae was found in larger granules these microorganisms consume organic acids amino acids and complex organic compounds bowman 2014 mcilroy and nielsen 2014 in this study fig 6d and table 2 showed that the biological nitrogen cycle involved the input of hco3 nh4 and no2 which were utilized by anammox bacteria to produce organics n2 and no3 organics like eps were responsible for bioaggregation zhao et al 2018 heterotrophic denitrifiers used extracellular organics which were secreted by anammox bacteria as electron donors and no3 to synthesize n2 after that the n2 produced by anammox and denitrification reactions was absorbed by nitrogen fixing bacteria to synthesize nh4 akaboci et al 2018 kuypers et al 2018 the increased abundance in nitrogen fixing bacteria in larger granules could be attributed to a large number of gas pockets in bigger granules chen et al 2010 lu et al 2012 these bubbles contain more n2 bubbles therefore nitrogen fixing bacteria in large granules could obtain sufficient nitrogen gas for metabolism in addition small granules were considered regenerated granules there were two main reasons 1 various granules were homogeneous 2 the small granules have lower saa lower abundance of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and higher abundances of heterotrophic microorganisms than that of large granules it was considered that heterotrophic microorganisms grew in the local region of granules consumed eps of granules and facilitated the separation of small granules therefore heterotrophic microorganisms were fundamentally affected by the size and regeneration of granules 3 4 proposed granulation cycle mechanisms anammox hap coupled granules under the regular granule discharge have been shown to update themselves over several generations in a granulation cycle which continues long term ma et al 2018 it is assumed that small granules were shown to be newly generated from large granules and large granules were developed from small granules 3 4 1 granule growth based on biomineralization based on the results of the unique structures with hap cores the main elements and the dominant microorganisms at different sizes it is possible that anammox hap coupled granulation could be a growth process the following is the four stage granule growth hypothesis proposed for the first time from the results in this study fig 7 firstly the biofilm secreted alkalinity from the anammox reaction elevating the ph and the adsorption of ca and p ions from the solution facilitated the formation of a spherical core diameter 10 μm on the surface of biofilm or cells as shown in fig 7a secondly the enlargement of the core was due to the poly pellet structure by heterogeneous growth the biofilm formed a core by biomineralization causing a strong linkage between them this restricted the growth of the anammox biofilm along with the structure of the poly pellets diameter 100 μm as shown in fig 7b in the case of the small granules below 0 5 mm the aggregated pellets had a double structure and were not encapsulated by a biofilm thirdly the anammox biofilm and hap crystal core underwent synchronous enlargement the small granules increased in size becoming large granules of around 1 mm at the same time with the decrease of water content and svi of granules as well as the increase of settling velocity compact granules with excellent settleability formed fourthly a three layered structure was created by the encapsulation process the anammox biofilm may need to be integrated with the granulation process in fig 7b and fig 7c a thin layer of anammox biofilm is shown to encapsulate the poly pellet structure concealing the structure of the granules also shear stress played a role in balling this process indicated that granulation is promoted by the growth of small granules however the source of these small components needs to be investigated to determine the granule cycle when granulation has been achieved in the reactor in the long term 3 4 2 two step separation for regeneration since a dual pellet structure is present in the anammox biofilm and the hap core granule regeneration is necessary for separation in both the biofilm and the core with hap crystallization various degrees of linkages were formed between the embryo crystals and the surface of the mother core as a result of heterogeneous crystallization as shown in fig 8 b first the embryo crystals were isolated from the mother core but they were still inlaid by the outer anammox biofilm as shown in fig 8c therefore the formation of embryo crystals with anammox biofilms by heterogeneous growth could be a driving force for regeneration after the embryo crystals with anammox biofilms became separated the biofilm separated from the granule surface along with the embryo crystals two factors are likely to be involved in the separation of the biofilm biodegradation and shear forces the decomposition of the extracellular matrix by heterotrophic microorganisms is shown in fig s2 with denitrifiers and fermentative bacteria likely contributing to segregation the microbial communities may consume specific eps causing the biofilm to fissure and become small granules hulshoff pol et al 2004 vlaeminck et al 2010 strong gaseous and hydraulic shear forces originating from biogas production and recirculation induced up flows also likely contribute to biofilm separation 3 4 3 regeneration the separated embryo granule contained a connected two layer structure with a fragmental anammox biofilm attached to hap cores to form new small granules fig 8a this likely facilitated the growth of the biofilm so that it covered the hap cores setting the foundation for sustainable diameter growth and regeneration 4 implications of this work 4 1 advantages of the anammox hap coupled granules compared with anammox granules without hap cores the surface area of the anammox reaction was also enlarged via the poly pellets structure ensuring that their outer layer was attached by numerous cells and this contributed to a high nitrogen loading at 50 kgn m 3 d 1 zhang et al 2018 in addition anammox biofilms attached in hap cores form structural compactness of granules at a low svi of 16 20 ml gvss 1 size 0 5 mm which is lower than that for non hap anammox granules at 36 39 ml gvss 1 wang et al 2021 compared with carrier based processes such as those in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr processes engaging anammox hap coupled granules do not require the addition of carriers and newborn granules with hap cores keep the structural features of the previous ones lackner et al 2014 this reduces the cost and promotes the stability of the operations ma et al 2020 apart from promoting settleability in granules growing hap cores are also sustainable carriers for bacteria that continuously multiply 4 2 significance of granulation the results of this study show that the pattern for the granulation of hap based granules is different from other types of granules and that it can be easily controlled by the addition of ca and p to form hap crystals since granulation without hap cores is mainly controlled by microbial factors when treating complex wastewaters or encountering unfavorable environmental factors e g low temperature or varying ph the functional microorganisms and eps based structures can be damaged or destroyed leading to lower granulation nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 this biomineralization based pattern may achieve granulation in unfavorable situations table 1 such as under unsuitable shear forces or a lack of functional microorganisms and does not require specific eps adav et al 2008 moreover since both aerobic and anaerobic granular sludge with the precipitation of calcium phosphate has been found in lab scale trials angela et al 2011 tervahauta et al 2014 biomineralization based granulation has clear potential to widen the applications of various granular sludges however the granulation mechanism of non anammox granular sludge with high contents of calcium and phosphorus needs further investigation angela et al 2011 tervahauta et al 2014 4 3 application of granulation cycle in future 4 3 1 increase in granule size the growth rates of biofilms and the hap cores play a crucial role in controlling the nitrogen removal rate and the phosphorus removal rate during the operation of anammox systems ma et al 2020 xue et al 2021 rapid granulation can be achieved by the addition of ca and p which increases the growth rate of the hap core this is an efficient approach to increasing the size of small granules especially in the start up period guo and li 2020 ma et al 2020 subsequently to improve the anammox concentration maintaining a high nitrogen loading rates a ratio of nitrogen removal rate nrr and phosphorus removal rate prr is increased for a further increase in thickness of biofilms simultaneously the process could decrease shear forces to avoid regeneration that results in lots of small granules enrich in the reactor 4 3 2 regeneration of granules lots of oversized granules with large hap cores in the reactor reduce biomass concentrations besides n2o emission of greenhouse gas significantly increased with increased sizes zhu et al 2018 since the properties and anammox activities of granules over 0 5 mm are similar as shown in figs 4 and 5 it is beneficial to break the large granules and regenerate small granules to achieve stable nitrogen removal performance and improve the efficiency of volume utilization in the reactor ma et al 2020 because the biodegradation procedure is difficult to control it is necessary to improve shear forces by increasing liquid recirculation and adding gaseous recirculation for the regeneration process 5 conclusions in this study anammox hap coupled granules were investigated to determine the mechanism of the granulation cycle some of the key findings are as follows the results of the sem eds analysis revealed that anammox biofilms comprised of small granules 0 5 mm were attached to the skeleton of poly pellet clusters when the granules were over 0 5 mm in diameter a three layer structure was formed that encapsulated a biofilm layer a connection layer of a hybrid layer attached hap poly pellets as a middle connection layer and a porous hap core hap based structures in granules of different sizes improved properties the stabilized chemical compositions and the removal performances of n and p and resulted in a high relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis a hypothesis for the granulation cycle mechanism was proposed an embryo crystal is separated from the hap core by heterogeneous nucleation and subsequently the biofilm is also separated by microbial degradation and shear stress to form small granules biomineralization was proposed as the granule growth model allowing the simultaneous enlargement of biofilm and hap cores which results in an increase in granule size at the end of granulation growth the granules are encapsulated by the anammox biofilm research data raw sequencing data were deposited in the ncbi database

16342,the formation of anammox hydroxyapatite hap coupled granules has been shown to be an approach to efficient nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery in the anammox egsb reactor however the granulation cycle mechanism of anammox hap coupled granules for sustainable regeneration and growth is still not well understood in this study the microstructure chemical composition and microbial structure of a total of six different sized granules from 0 25 mm to 2 8 mm was determined an sem eds analysis indicated that the small granules 0 5 mm were composed of poly pellet clusters with anammox biofilms attached to the hap cores and the large granules 0 5 mm consisted of a three layer structure a surface anammox biofilm layer a middle connection layer and a hap mineral inner core the analysis of elemental composition and microbial structure suggested homogenous granular characteristics regardless of granule size the dominant microorganisms were anammox bacteria of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria based on these results a granulation cycle mechanism for anammox hap coupled granules was proposed for the first time the growth of the small granules with the simultaneous enlargement of anammox biofilms and hap cores results in the formation of large granules large granules regenerate new small granules in a two step procedure the first step is the separation of embryo hap crystals from the mother core via heterogeneous growth and the second step is the separation of the biofilms due to biodegradation and shear stress graphical

phosphate and enhances the crystallization of hap in anammox granules which increases the density of the anammox granules and also increases the settling velocity to higher than 200 m h 1 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 this excellent settleability overcomes the floatation problem which has been shown to cause granular sludge wash outs and an unstable anammox performance for nitrogen removal chen et al 2010 xue et al 2020 besides it has been reported that anammox hap coupled granules enriching dense anammox bacteria improve the stable operation at a nitrogen loading rate nlr of up to 50 kgn m 3 d 1 ma et al 2021 xue et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 the high nlr capacity and good settleability of the anammox hap coupled granules are associated with other benefits such as a low carbon footprint and low investment and operation cost for actual applications chen et al 2019 2020 previous studies on granulation considered microbial eps and physical aspects as summarized in table 1 adav et al 2008 hulshoff pol et al 2004 sengar et al 2018 eps secreted by microorganisms has been shown to facilitate the bioaggregation of flocs strong eps adhesion contributes to the formation of aggregates and the adsorption of flocs due to hydrophobic interactions in accordance with the thermodynamic dlvo derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek theory in surface science guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 to achieve higher granule stability filamentous bacteria were reported to connect with each other into an entity chamchoi and nitisoravut 2007 vlaeminck et al 2010 specifically the hydraulic shear force is considered a critical physical factor in some studies bioaggregated particles have been compressed into balls to enrich specific microorganisms allowing granulation even at a high upflow velocity tang et al 2009 wang et al 2019 among the many studies on granulation the role of inorganic minerals in the granulation process has not been considered however in the anammox hap egsb reactor the vss ss ratio of anammox hap coupled granules was found to be as low as 20 suggesting inorganic minerals are the main components of the granules it is reasonable to assume that inorganic minerals play an essential role in granulation xue et al 2021 proposed that the hap formation in anammox hap coupled granules depended on three factors 1 the chemical crystallization into hap cores as crystal seeds 2 biomineralization controlled by eps binding ca2 and 3 the increase in ph due to alkalinity production from the anammox reaction however the study on the mechanism did not explore the hap based growth of the microstructure or the granulation cycle in addition to apply granular sludge to large scale operations it is necessary to overcome the difficulty of successfully forming granules and to prevent granule disintegration nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 further understanding of the mechanism of a granulation cycle is required to support the sustainable multiplication of granules to sustain large scale operations and ensure the stability of the anammox granule process in long term applications however while the granulation cycle mechanism is of reference value to the design and control of anammox hap coupled processes for stable operation it is still not fully understood during the granulation cycle mechanism the growth and regeneration of anammox hap coupled structures are yet to be understood and the properties and performances of granules of different sizes need to be determined in addition the roles of anammox bacteria and other heterotrophic bacteria in the granulation cycle need to be clarified the objectives of this investigation are as follows 1 analyze the microstructure of granules and hap skeletons 2 determine the chemical compositions nitrogen and phosphorus removal performances and the microbial communities of granules at different sizes 3 clarify the mechanism of the granulation cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor of an effective volume of 5 l was inoculated with anammox biomass using a recirculation ratio of 2 5 for a continuous experiment under 25 1 fig s1a the synthetic wastewater consisted of nh4 2so4 1 34 g l 1 nh4 n 284 mg l 1 nano2 1 68 g l 1 no2 n 341 mg l 1 kh2po4 0 057 g l 1 cacl2 2h2o 0 3 g l 1 nahco3 0 5 g l 1 and other trace elements ma et al 2020 under nlr of 10 kgn m 3 d 1 the stable total nitrogen removal efficiency of 89 2 and the total phosphorus removal efficiency of 64 8 were maintained during 240 days of the continuous experiments video 1 2 2 analyses of liquid samples nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were analyzed by an agilent 7100 capillary electrophoresis system agilent technologies wilmington usa and total phosphorus was analyzed by an agilent 720 inductively coupled a plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes system agilent technologies wilmington usa after the digestion process xue et al 2020 2 3 analytical methods of granules 2 3 1 sieving procedure of granules to represent the granule variation granular sludge was taken from the egsb reactor on the 60th 150th and 240th days the granules were then sieved by a wet method for the effective isolation of different size granules using various screens tokyo screen co ltd zhu et al 2018 and divided into six groups 0 25 mm 0 25 0 5 mm 0 5 1 mm 1 2 mm 2 2 8 mm and 2 8 mm 2 3 2 morphology of granules the morphology of the sieved granules was recorded by taking photographs with a camera on a smartphone two different pretreatments procedures were used to allow the morphology of the outer biofilm and hap core to be investigated fully in both methods 2 5 glutaraldehyde was used for 8 h then the samples were either dehydrated with a gradient of ethanol 20 40 60 80 100 guo and li 2020 for 20 min or they were heated to 600 to remove biofilm until there was no further change in the quality it has been reported that the organic phase was removed under 600 but that the morphology of the hap core was not affected for 50 hours ramirez gutierrez et al 2017 the granules dehydrated by ethanol were sliced under a microscope sz 8000 to investigate the spatial morphology after pretreatment all of the samples were sputter coated with gold for sem observation ma et al 2018 the microcosmic morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds jeol jsm 6500f the microstructure size was analyzed by imagej software caizán juanarena et al 2019 2 3 3 sludge characteristics the volumetric and mass distribution of sieved granules were measured by the graduated cylinder and the electronic balance the vss volatile suspended solids ss suspended solids and svi sludge volume index were determined according to apha standard methods apha awwa wef 2012 the settling velocity and water content of sieved granules were analyzed in the same procedure outlined in previous work xue et al 2020 because water could not be filtered out from sludge below 0 25 mm the supernatant was removed from the sludge three times after allowing it to sit for 30 minutes each time elemental analysis of heated and unheated sieved granules was carried out by wavelength dispersive x ray fluorescence wdxrf bruker s8 tiger after grinding and tableting the hydroxyapatite phase was analyzed according to a method explained in previous studies ma et al 2018 xue et al 2021 soluble eps loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps were extracted and measured more details can be found in supplementary information 1 2 xue et al 2021 2 3 4 batch test for performance assessment the batch test estimated the performance of the nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates for different size granules sieved granules of various sizes with the same biomass concentration in 4 g of wet sludge were added to 120 ml serum flasks with a liquid volume of 100 ml the liquid with an initial concentration of 22 8 mgp l 1 100 mgnh4 n l 1 and 120 mgno2 n l 1 was purged with 99 9 n2 gas for 20 min to remove oxygen kong et al 2021 xue et al 2020 four serum flasks were used for each sample the serum flasks were sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum cap and were purged with 99 9 n2 gas for 10 min to remove oxygen in the gaseous phase and then placed in a thermostatic shaker at 35 at 120 rpm bt300 yamato japan specific anammox activity saa was determined by measuring the accumulated nitrogen gas every hour and imputing the results into a modified gompertz equation to define the maximum nitrogen production rate xue et al 2020 the specific phosphorus removal rate sprr was determined by measuring phosphorus removal in liquid samples every hour and used in a modified gompertz equation which defined the maximum phosphorus removal rate the contribution of n removal in the reactor was calculated based on the saa and vss concentrations in the reactor at different sizes the contribution of p recovery in the reactor was calculated based on the sprr and ss concentrations in the reactor for different sizes more details are presented in supplementary information 1 1 2 4 sludge sample preparation dna extraction sequencing and data processing the sludge samples were collected from the egsb reactor during the stable phase and sieved into six groups according to granule size 0 25 mm 0 25 0 5 mm 0 5 1 mm 1 2 mm 2 2 8 mm and 2 8 mm they were then stored in a refrigerator at 80 c for dna extraction after dna extraction using the mpure bacterial dna extraction kit mp bio from the mpure 12 system the concentration was determined by synergy lx bio tek from the quantifluor dsdna system promega the primer 515f and reverse primer 806r were used for the pcr amplification of v3 v4 fragments in the 16s rrna gene chen et al 2019 dna sequencing was performed using the miseq reagent kit v3 illumina usa from the miseq system the raw data were analyzed using qiime2 software version 2020 8 to obtain a 97 identity of the operation taxonomic units otus the details are described in an earlier study li et al 2020 the α diversity including chao1 the shannon index the simpson index good s coverage observed species and singles are shown in supporting information table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 investigation of biomineralization based granules this study focused on the microstructure of granular sludge to reveal the formation mechanism of the outer biofilms layer and the hap core the investigation also compared large granules with a diameter larger than 0 5 mm and small granules with a diameter less than 0 5 mm flocs like to predict the granulation cycle procedures 3 1 1 poly pellets hap cores with anammox biofilms attached with gradual amplification a wrinkled biofilm composed of microbial cells was observed fig 1 a and b an edx analysis revealed that the elemental composition of the biofilm was 27 2 c 39 2 ca and 12 4 p after heating the regular pellets which formed the inorganic core were around 10 μm fig 1f edx results confirmed the formation of calcium phosphate the elemental composition of the core was 5 1 c 33 5 ca and 18 8 p fig 1i a mass of shallow dents covered the surface of the hap core and the orbicular shape of the dents is likely the trail of anammox bacteria and other microorganisms after heating treatment see fig 1f since these dents are similar to the profile of cells guo and li 2020 fig 1c showed that the small granules were aggregated by poly pellets and this finding is consistent with the results of a previous study guo and li 2020 however anammox biofilm with eps remained on the surface of the poly pellet clusters and unlike the large granules no biofilm encapsulation was observed for small granules after heating an inorganic skeleton with the shape of poly pellets appeared fig 1g and fig s6 similarly the skeleton was covered by dents an element analysis in small granules by edx revealed the composition was similar to that of the granules 3 1 2 a three layered structure of large granules no orbicular structures were observed on the surface of large granules fig 1b like those observed on the large granules after biofilm removal fig 1f to further understand the structure of large granules the granules were sliced for more detailed observations fig 2 c showed that the external surface of these granules was completely covered by a biofilm with dense anammox cells for biological nitrogen removal fig 2d showed a mass of collective hap clusters in the connection layer between the biofilm and crystals cells were attached to their surface forming a dual layer structure as the connection layer for the poly pellets fig 2e showed the cores in the large granules were minerals with cavities and porous pellets were observed in the magnified image it has been reported that the porous surface of hap clusters constrained the transport of substrate resulting in cell death after biomineralization guo et al 2020 the large granules were found to consist of three main regions the surface layer of the whole anammox biofilm the connection layer of the anammox hap coupled bilayer pellets and the inner layer of the hap mineral with hollows the formation of this three layered structure can be attributed to the substrate distribution this affects the accumulation rates of bacteria between the biofilm and the core nh4 and no2 were utilized by outer anammox to enhance biofilm growth interrupting mass transport into the core consequently the growth rate of the biofilm was higher than the crystallization rate at the core however as the substrate started to infiltrate the interior layers the crystallization rate began to exceed the biofilm growth rate increasing the proportion of crystals toward 100 the outer two layers the biofilm layer and the connection layer were responsible for the anammox reaction and the biomineralization of the hap core the thickness of the outer two layers could be around 100 μm using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish reported by ma et al 2021 biomineralization from the core outwards led to size enlargement meanwhile an inward extinction of microorganisms occurred along with biomineralization resulting in the formation of three layers fig 2a this biomineralization procedure is similar to that of coral reef builders 3 1 3 coral stone like poly pellets skeleton the skeletons of the hap core resemble microorganisms graves after biofilm removal as can be seen in fig 3 the unique microstructures of the cores result from several different factors as shown in fig 3a and d the cores were spherical due to the homogenous nucleation of the spherical pellets at a crystal core size below 10 μm with identical crystallization rates in all directions de yoreo 2003 when the core size reached around 10 μm heterogeneous growth occurred creating new cores in a growth process at a foreign core rather than homogeneous nucleation inside the crystals vekilov 2010 this is because these cores maintain minimum surface energy at around the 10 μm size and can be concurrently altered by crystallization and other biological factors de yoreo 2003 regardless of the granule size the morphology of the hap cores suggests the accumulation of poriferous crystal nuclei and the formation of a skeleton for nuclei clusters as shown in fig 3e the pores in the pellets suggest there was biofilm coverage and that these biofilms played a more significant role in biomineralization than abiotic chemical crystallization the morphology of abiotic chemical crystallization is visibly different from the hap cores in anammox granules ginebra et al 1995 lower et al 1998 finally the hap cores became porous poly pellets suggesting that the crystal nuclei worked synergistically with the anammox biofilm to encapsulate the hap surface and create a coral like structure in the hap cores 3 2 homogenous characteristics of granules with different sizes with regular granule discharge in the long term operation little change was observed in the characteristics of the granules in the reactor this suggested that a stable state of granule growth and regeneration has been reached more details can be found in fig s5 the results from the 60th 150th and 240th days were represented by mean values as shown in fig 4 3 2 1 stabilized size distribution the mass proportions of size distribution over the 240 day period for the increased sizes were 8 1 11 2 24 1 46 2 7 2 and 5 1 are shown in fig 4b in fig 4c the volumetric proportions of size distribution for the increased sizes can be seen at 25 3 18 2 16 2 30 2 7 1 and 5 1 3 2 2 elemental compositions settling velocity svi vss ss and water content the elemental compositions and ratios of ca and p are similar and the vss ss ratios at different sizes were at around 20 24 fig 4e and g suggesting the homogeneity of various granules however the settling velocity of granules with a hap core dropped from 330 4 4 7 m h 1 to 38 5 9 m h 1 as their size decreased fig 4f the sludge volume index svi decreased from 65 2 6 1 ml gvss 1 to 16 7 1 0 ml gvss 1 as the granule size increased fig 4d one of the main reasons was that water content in the granules rose from 75 1 to 94 1 as the granules became smaller as shown in fig 4g therefore the water content can be considered a convenient indicator for the settleability of granular sludge as shown by fig s4 nevertheless the settling velocity of anammox hap coupled granules is higher than the settling velocity of anammox granules without hap at around 30 100 m h 1 lv et al 2020 ma et al 2020 3 2 3 eps for bioaggregation since the soluble eps and loosely bound eps detected in the total eps was less than 1 neither was considered in this study fig s3 the focus of this study was on the tightly bound eps t eps in granules of different sizes the protein concentration in t eps increased from 90 0 4 3 mg vssg 1 to 159 1 4 3 mg vssg 1 as the granule size increased to 1 mm but decreased to 90 8 4 1 mg vssg 1 when the granule size increased further to over 2 8 mm in granules over 2 mm the decrease in eps concentration with increased size suggests that bigger granules with less eps maintain granule structures zhu et al 2018 on the other hand granules smaller than 1 mm and small granules required more eps for granule growth vlaeminck et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 but protein concentrations of t eps in different sizes were still up to 90 mg vssg 1 for bioaggregation the polysaccharide ratio of the total eps was less than 10 for all sizes 3 2 4 simultaneous n and p removals the results described in fig 5 a showed that the saa of granules over 1 mm in size was approximately 0 81 0 84 gn vssg 1 d 1 and that it was lower in smaller granules the saa values of granules 0 0 25 mm 0 25 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 mm in diameter were 35 52 and 68 of that of granules of 1 2 mm respectively the reason for the low saa in small granule sizes was the lower abundance of anammox bacteria zhu et al 2018 based on saa and vss concentrations the contributions of nitrogen removal for granules of increased sizes in the reactor were 5 6 21 48 15 and 5 respectively the specific phosphorus removal rates for the increased sizes of granules were 0 21 0 01 gp gss 1 day 1 0 18 0 02 gp gss 1 day 1 0 18 0 01 gp gss 1 day 1 0 16 0 02 gp gss 1 day 1 0 15 0 01 gp gss 1 day 1 and 0 16 0 02 gp gss 1 day 1 based on the sprr and ss concentrations the contributions to p removal for the increased sizes were 5 5 52 20 13 and 5 fig 5b 3 2 5 simultaneous granule growth of anammox and hap for granulation the simultaneous removal of n and p suggested the simultaneous growth of the biofilm and the hap core for each size ma et al 2021 the simultaneous growth caused approximate elemental compositions and vss ss ratios at different granule sizes under the stable compositions a deceased water content with an increased size further suggested the dehydration process s growth via a hydrophobic interaction of eps to form dense and compact granules hou et al 2015 wang et al 2020 3 3 the roles of heterotrophic microorganisms in granule regeneration the overall taxonomic composition of the microbial community was investigated by high throughput sequencing on an illumina miseq platform the results revealed that candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis was the dominant species of anammox bacteria while most of the other microbial communities in the granules were identified only at the family level because according to the results of the blast tests their similarities in the genus level were low as shown in fig 6 a brocadiaceae and rhodocyclaceae were the predominant bacteria in all granule sizes with relative abundances of over 25 and 11 respectively which also suggested homogeneity of various granules additionally a mutualism relationship was observed between these two bacteria gonzalez gil et al 2015 specifically rhodocyclaceae was found to be responsible for the increase in heterotrophic denitrification by the utilization of no3 produced from the anammox reaction and organics from the eps of anammox gonzalez gil et al 2015 also the decrease in the saa in small sized granules can be attributed in part to the low relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis besides clusters of bradyrhizobiaceae cytophagaceae ignavibacteriaceae and haliangiaceae became more abundant in larger granules among these bacteria bradyrhizobiaceae could be nitrogen fixing bacteria and is capable of converting n2 into nh4 and cytophagaceae could be nitrogen fixing or carbohydrate degrading bacteria garrity et al 2015 mcbride et al 2014 xu et al 2014 in addition ignavibacteriaceae and haliangiaceae are known to degrade organic materials garcia and müller 2014 gonzalez gil et al 2015 iino et al 2010 based on genome analysis ignavibacteriaceae could reduce nitrate to nitrite because of narghij genes and reduce nitrate to ammonia using pentaheme nitrite reductase nrfha chen et al 2021 mardanov et al 2019 however a significant decrease in the relative abundance of fimbriimonadaceae cryomorphaceae and saprospiraceae was found in larger granules these microorganisms consume organic acids amino acids and complex organic compounds bowman 2014 mcilroy and nielsen 2014 in this study fig 6d and table 2 showed that the biological nitrogen cycle involved the input of hco3 nh4 and no2 which were utilized by anammox bacteria to produce organics n2 and no3 organics like eps were responsible for bioaggregation zhao et al 2018 heterotrophic denitrifiers used extracellular organics which were secreted by anammox bacteria as electron donors and no3 to synthesize n2 after that the n2 produced by anammox and denitrification reactions was absorbed by nitrogen fixing bacteria to synthesize nh4 akaboci et al 2018 kuypers et al 2018 the increased abundance in nitrogen fixing bacteria in larger granules could be attributed to a large number of gas pockets in bigger granules chen et al 2010 lu et al 2012 these bubbles contain more n2 bubbles therefore nitrogen fixing bacteria in large granules could obtain sufficient nitrogen gas for metabolism in addition small granules were considered regenerated granules there were two main reasons 1 various granules were homogeneous 2 the small granules have lower saa lower abundance of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and higher abundances of heterotrophic microorganisms than that of large granules it was considered that heterotrophic microorganisms grew in the local region of granules consumed eps of granules and facilitated the separation of small granules therefore heterotrophic microorganisms were fundamentally affected by the size and regeneration of granules 3 4 proposed granulation cycle mechanisms anammox hap coupled granules under the regular granule discharge have been shown to update themselves over several generations in a granulation cycle which continues long term ma et al 2018 it is assumed that small granules were shown to be newly generated from large granules and large granules were developed from small granules 3 4 1 granule growth based on biomineralization based on the results of the unique structures with hap cores the main elements and the dominant microorganisms at different sizes it is possible that anammox hap coupled granulation could be a growth process the following is the four stage granule growth hypothesis proposed for the first time from the results in this study fig 7 firstly the biofilm secreted alkalinity from the anammox reaction elevating the ph and the adsorption of ca and p ions from the solution facilitated the formation of a spherical core diameter 10 μm on the surface of biofilm or cells as shown in fig 7a secondly the enlargement of the core was due to the poly pellet structure by heterogeneous growth the biofilm formed a core by biomineralization causing a strong linkage between them this restricted the growth of the anammox biofilm along with the structure of the poly pellets diameter 100 μm as shown in fig 7b in the case of the small granules below 0 5 mm the aggregated pellets had a double structure and were not encapsulated by a biofilm thirdly the anammox biofilm and hap crystal core underwent synchronous enlargement the small granules increased in size becoming large granules of around 1 mm at the same time with the decrease of water content and svi of granules as well as the increase of settling velocity compact granules with excellent settleability formed fourthly a three layered structure was created by the encapsulation process the anammox biofilm may need to be integrated with the granulation process in fig 7b and fig 7c a thin layer of anammox biofilm is shown to encapsulate the poly pellet structure concealing the structure of the granules also shear stress played a role in balling this process indicated that granulation is promoted by the growth of small granules however the source of these small components needs to be investigated to determine the granule cycle when granulation has been achieved in the reactor in the long term 3 4 2 two step separation for regeneration since a dual pellet structure is present in the anammox biofilm and the hap core granule regeneration is necessary for separation in both the biofilm and the core with hap crystallization various degrees of linkages were formed between the embryo crystals and the surface of the mother core as a result of heterogeneous crystallization as shown in fig 8 b first the embryo crystals were isolated from the mother core but they were still inlaid by the outer anammox biofilm as shown in fig 8c therefore the formation of embryo crystals with anammox biofilms by heterogeneous growth could be a driving force for regeneration after the embryo crystals with anammox biofilms became separated the biofilm separated from the granule surface along with the embryo crystals two factors are likely to be involved in the separation of the biofilm biodegradation and shear forces the decomposition of the extracellular matrix by heterotrophic microorganisms is shown in fig s2 with denitrifiers and fermentative bacteria likely contributing to segregation the microbial communities may consume specific eps causing the biofilm to fissure and become small granules hulshoff pol et al 2004 vlaeminck et al 2010 strong gaseous and hydraulic shear forces originating from biogas production and recirculation induced up flows also likely contribute to biofilm separation 3 4 3 regeneration the separated embryo granule contained a connected two layer structure with a fragmental anammox biofilm attached to hap cores to form new small granules fig 8a this likely facilitated the growth of the biofilm so that it covered the hap cores setting the foundation for sustainable diameter growth and regeneration 4 implications of this work 4 1 advantages of the anammox hap coupled granules compared with anammox granules without hap cores the surface area of the anammox reaction was also enlarged via the poly pellets structure ensuring that their outer layer was attached by numerous cells and this contributed to a high nitrogen loading at 50 kgn m 3 d 1 zhang et al 2018 in addition anammox biofilms attached in hap cores form structural compactness of granules at a low svi of 16 20 ml gvss 1 size 0 5 mm which is lower than that for non hap anammox granules at 36 39 ml gvss 1 wang et al 2021 compared with carrier based processes such as those in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr processes engaging anammox hap coupled granules do not require the addition of carriers and newborn granules with hap cores keep the structural features of the previous ones lackner et al 2014 this reduces the cost and promotes the stability of the operations ma et al 2020 apart from promoting settleability in granules growing hap cores are also sustainable carriers for bacteria that continuously multiply 4 2 significance of granulation the results of this study show that the pattern for the granulation of hap based granules is different from other types of granules and that it can be easily controlled by the addition of ca and p to form hap crystals since granulation without hap cores is mainly controlled by microbial factors when treating complex wastewaters or encountering unfavorable environmental factors e g low temperature or varying ph the functional microorganisms and eps based structures can be damaged or destroyed leading to lower granulation nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 this biomineralization based pattern may achieve granulation in unfavorable situations table 1 such as under unsuitable shear forces or a lack of functional microorganisms and does not require specific eps adav et al 2008 moreover since both aerobic and anaerobic granular sludge with the precipitation of calcium phosphate has been found in lab scale trials angela et al 2011 tervahauta et al 2014 biomineralization based granulation has clear potential to widen the applications of various granular sludges however the granulation mechanism of non anammox granular sludge with high contents of calcium and phosphorus needs further investigation angela et al 2011 tervahauta et al 2014 4 3 application of granulation cycle in future 4 3 1 increase in granule size the growth rates of biofilms and the hap cores play a crucial role in controlling the nitrogen removal rate and the phosphorus removal rate during the operation of anammox systems ma et al 2020 xue et al 2021 rapid granulation can be achieved by the addition of ca and p which increases the growth rate of the hap core this is an efficient approach to increasing the size of small granules especially in the start up period guo and li 2020 ma et al 2020 subsequently to improve the anammox concentration maintaining a high nitrogen loading rates a ratio of nitrogen removal rate nrr and phosphorus removal rate prr is increased for a further increase in thickness of biofilms simultaneously the process could decrease shear forces to avoid regeneration that results in lots of small granules enrich in the reactor 4 3 2 regeneration of granules lots of oversized granules with large hap cores in the reactor reduce biomass concentrations besides n2o emission of greenhouse gas significantly increased with increased sizes zhu et al 2018 since the properties and anammox activities of granules over 0 5 mm are similar as shown in figs 4 and 5 it is beneficial to break the large granules and regenerate small granules to achieve stable nitrogen removal performance and improve the efficiency of volume utilization in the reactor ma et al 2020 because the biodegradation procedure is difficult to control it is necessary to improve shear forces by increasing liquid recirculation and adding gaseous recirculation for the regeneration process 5 conclusions in this study anammox hap coupled granules were investigated to determine the mechanism of the granulation cycle some of the key findings are as follows the results of the sem eds analysis revealed that anammox biofilms comprised of small granules 0 5 mm were attached to the skeleton of poly pellet clusters when the granules were over 0 5 mm in diameter a three layer structure was formed that encapsulated a biofilm layer a connection layer of a hybrid layer attached hap poly pellets as a middle connection layer and a porous hap core hap based structures in granules of different sizes improved properties the stabilized chemical compositions and the removal performances of n and p and resulted in a high relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis a hypothesis for the granulation cycle mechanism was proposed an embryo crystal is separated from the hap core by heterogeneous nucleation and subsequently the biofilm is also separated by microbial degradation and shear stress to form small granules biomineralization was proposed as the granule growth model allowing the simultaneous enlargement of biofilm and hap cores which results in an increase in granule size at the end of granulation growth the granules are encapsulated by the anammox biofilm research data raw sequencing data were deposited in the ncbi database

electricigens in this study a structural parameter s integrating the size the position and the spacing of the anode and the cathode was proposed and the electrogenesis and biosensing performances of the vertical flow cw mfc biosensors were evaluated at different s values the results showed that all the three biosensors could achieve good monitoring for cod r 2 0 97 and the coulombic yield was more suitable for the response signal than output voltage but different biosensing properties including detection signal detection range detection time correlation fitting degree and sensitivity were also displayed further in order to optimize the biosensing performance the coulombic yield in stable voltage stage qs was proposed which can shorten the detection time by 70 at most on the anodes abundant nitrogen transforming bacteria ntb were enriched as well as electrochemically active bacteria eab the competition of ntb for substrates and electrons with eab disturbed the output voltage signal but not affect the stability of coulombic yield signal moreover the significant linear correlation between the s values and the ratios of eab to ntb colonized both on anodes and on cathodes

has attracted much attention during the last twenty years chaudhuri and lovley 2003 schroder et al 2003 the electrochemically active bacteria eab enriched in anode can degrade organic matter and directly convert chemical energy into electricity without an external transducer jiang et al 2018 logan et al 2006 by establishing the correlation between the electricity and organic matter mfc biosensors have been widely studied in the field of bod monitoring for the feature that mfc can generate electricity in real time jiang et al 2018 traditional mfc biosensors are relatively expensive and need to create an anaerobic environment for the anode as well as simultaneously providing suitable electron acceptors for the cathode chouler and lorenzo 2015 in addition due to its small size mfc failures to resist the shock loading as a consequence of limited eab enriched in electrodes liu et al 2014 thus the application of mfc biosensor was restricted greatly coupled system of mfc and vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw mfc is more appropriate for application in practice because of the natural bottom up redox gradient in constructed wetland and the suitable environment for eab doherty et al 2015b and the eab amplification by granular electrode such as active carbon and graphite xu et al 2018 and the feasibility of the cw mfc based biosensor for cod monitoring has been confirmed xu et al 2017b and the accuracy of biosensing has been gradually improving corbella et al 2019 the process of cw mfc converts the organic matter in sewage into electrical signals involves two main steps first eab utilize the organic matter to generate electrons and transfer them to the electrode outside the cell and second the electrons on the electrode are obtained as an output through an external circuit which in turn generate electrical signals therefore parameters such as the electrode type electrode size electrode spacing electrode position and wetland filler have direct or indirect effects on the electrical signals among them easy adjustable structural parameters like the position spacing and size of electrodes are often prior considered the position of anodes and cathodes directly affects electrons generation and protons transfer most of eab have been found to be more suitable for anoxic and anaerobic environment logan 2009 thus the anode is usually buried in the middle or bottom of vfcw with low oxygen redox potential orp doherty et al 2015a correspondingly in order to keep the steady potential difference the cathode is usually set on the surface of wetland or near the plant roots using oxygen from air or plant roots as electrons acceptors but due to the influence of light dark cycles and plant growth rhythm yang et al 2021 the cathode is more often placed on the surface of wetland when the cathode position is determined the electrode spacing will change with anode position oon et al 2015 found that keeping cathode in wetland surface and adjusting the anode burial depth which caused the electrode spacing to increase the electric power density of the cw mfc decreased doherty et al 2015a found that the internal resistance of the cw mfc system reduced from 500 to 300 ω by reducing electrodes gap and maintaining the anoxic anode and the aerobic cathode thereby producing high power density in addition the electrode spacing is closely related also affected by the anode size when the size or volume of the granular anode changes the overall position of the anode changes and leads to the change of spacing with the cathode accordingly in di lorenzo et al 2009 research three anode volumes of 3 75 12 5 and 37 5 cm3 were set by controlling the thickness of anode layer 0 3 1and 3 cm when adjusting the thickness of anode layer to 4 3 and 1 cm the internal resistance of the device changes to 128 104 and 5 ω respectively and the maximum current power density and coulombic efficiency were achieved at the anode volume of 37 5 cm3 it is difficult to say that significant change in the performance of mfc only by adjusting the electrode size obviously the electrode position spacing and size of vfcw mfc are actually interrelated and influential each other considering the structures of vfcw mfc systems the layers from the bottom to up include the conductive filler lb anodic conductive filler layer la non conductive isolation layer ls and cathode conductive filler lc the volume of la layer is the anode size and the thickness of ls layer is the spacing of the anode and the cathode the new structural parameter s was proposed as shown in eq 1 which is the ratio between the thickness of the anode conductive filler layer and the thickness of the non conductive isolation layer also reflecting the ratio between the volumes of the anode and electrode spacing it can be further understood as the ratio between the volume percent of anode conductive filler layer to the total device and the volume percent of electrode spacing to the total device 1 s l a l s v a v s v a v 0 v s l 0 where la ls is the thickness of the anode conductive filler and non conductive filler layer for cw mfc respectively va vs and vo is the volume of anode the electrode spacing and the whole cw mfc therefore the aim of this study is to analyze the influence mechanisms of s on the output signal of the vfcw mfc as well as the biosensing performance of the correlation sensitivity detection limit and detection time to cod in order to provide valuable data support and accelerate its application in practical engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 cw mfc setup three groups two replicates for each group of vfcw mfc experimental devices with corresponding s values of 0 75 cm1 1 cm2 and 1 5 cm3 were constructed by setting the different thickness of the lb la and ls layers respectively as shown in fig 1 each vfcw mfc comprised a pvc cylinder filled with a quartz sand layer height lb diameter 8 10 mm anodic granular activated carbon layer height la diameter 3 5 mm quartz sand isolation layer height ls diameter 8 10 mm and cathode ring graphite felt layer lc thickness 6 mm from bottom to top in the anode layer a cylindrical rolled graphite felt was embedded in the granular activated carbon as a current collector the anode and cathode were connected with a titanium wire the external resistance was set to 1000 ω and a digital multimeter was used to monitor the voltage at both ends of the electrical resistor every 10 min cm1 and cm3 have the identical size the total volumes and the effective water storage capacities were 3 925 and 1 2 l respectively the total volume and the effective water storage capacity of cm2 were 5 298 and 1 8 l respectively the volumes of the anode granular activated carbon layers in cm1 cm2 and cm3 were 1 18 1 86 and 1 18 l respectively the areas of the cathode graphite felt were 7 85 10 3 17 66 10 3 and 7 85 10 3 m2 before filling the graphite felt and granular activated carbon were rinsed with tap water several times and then soaked with 1 mol l hcl and 1 mol l naoh to improve the hydrophilicity of the material surface and remove metal impurities finally the graphite felt and granular activated carbon were rinsed with distilled water till a neutral ph 2 2 experimental design during the acclimation stage the inoculated sludge is the anaerobic activated sludge from a local sewage treatment plant wuhan china anodic graphite felt was immersed in anaerobic sludge for 48 h and then rolled into a cylinder and embedded in granular activated carbon after the installation each vfcw mfc was inoculated with activated sludge and synthetic wastewater in a volume ratio of 3 to 7 per liter the synthetic wastewater contained 0 642 g ch3coona 0 0573 g nh4cl 0 011 g kh2po4 1 0 g nacl 0 0068 g cacl2 6h2o 0 1 g mgso4 7h2o and 1 ml trace elements the main components of the trace elements in g l included 1 546 h3bo3 0 338 mnso4 h2o 0 576 znso4 7h2o 0 124 cuso4 5h2o 0 08 h2moo4 0 132 niso4 6h2o and 19 6 nafedtpa these reactors were operated in batch mode a draft tube was set up at the top of each reactor to guide the influent into the bottom and then overflow from down to up the influent was not replaced until the output voltage dropped to 0 v once a stable voltage appears the acclimation is completed during the formal experiment stage cod concentration gradients of 50 100 150 200 250 300 400 600 750 and 1000 mg l were set successively and each concentration sustained till the voltage was 0 v keep the influent pumped into the three cw mfc devices consistent in composition and

theoretical electric quantity of the oxidation transformation for the influent organic matter the cw mfc operated in fed batch mode in this experiment so ce was calculated as formula 2 logan et al

after discretization s the ibm spss statistics 25 software package was used for statistical analysis the shapiro wilk test was used to evaluate whether the data conformed to a normal distribution supplementary table s1 the t test was used to analyze the significant difference in the physicochemical parameters of the anode effluent pearson correlation was used to analyze the physicochemical index of the effluent as well as the relationship between the cod concentration of the influent and output charge of the unit a total of six microbial samples were collected from the graphite felt both on cathode and anode of the three groups at the end of the experiment cm1a cm2a and cm3a represent the anode sample respectively from the three groups cm1c cm2c and cm3c represent corresponding cathode samples respectively all samples extraction dna and high throughput sequencing at shanghai sangon biotech co ltd according to the method described in our previous study xu et al 2017a after the sequences obtained by high throughput sequencing were classified the operational taxonomic units otu sequences were compared with the corresponding database using blast to screen the best comparison result of the otu sequences thereafter the results were filtered by comparison by default sequences satisfying the criteria of similarity and coverage of more than 90 were regarded as unclassified 3 results 3 1 physicochemical properties of anolyte as shown in fig 2 the change of the ph do and orp in the anolyte of the three devices under different cod concentrations the ph of the anolyte after each cycle of electrogenesis almost dropped below 7 0 and fluctuated in the ranges of 6 67 6 89 6 48 6 82 and 6 61 7 06 for cm1 cm2 and cm3 respectively the significantly lower ph values than that of the influent indicate the normal electricity generation process in each anode different from ph the do and orp in the anolyte expressed the significant difference among the three groups in the anolyte of cm1 the do and orp ranged from 0 20 to 0 30 mg l and from 335 9 to 204 7 mv respectively implying an anaerobic environment oon et al 2015 while in the anolyte of both cm2 and cm3 the higher do 0 62 0 93 mg l as well as orp 110 to 28 5 mv suggested the anoxic environment watson and logan 2010 the do of the anolyte in each device was consistent with the distribution of aerobic zone anoxic zone anaerobic zone from top to bottom in the conventional vfcw saeed and sun 2017 moreover the results of t test supplementary material table s2 showed that there were significant differences p 0 01 in do and orp between the cm1 and cm2 or cm3 but not between cm2 and cm3 and the difference in do and orp among the three devices is notably related to the position of the anode 3 2 electrical generation performance 3 2 1 bioelectricity generation as shown in fig 3 the output electrical signals of the three devices displayed evident discrepancy the voltage curve displayed similar three stages including a sharp rising a peak lasting and a slow falling for every cod concentration there were shorter peak lasting and slow falling at lower cod but longer ones at higher cod the maximum output voltages of cm1 cm2 and cm3 ranged from 96 to 329 182 462 and 26 208 mv respectively correspondingly the coulombic yield was 2 54 85 74 1 87 64 65 and 0 11 7 49 c respectively the durations of the electrical signal were 3 81 38 8 5 8 63 5 and 2 2 17 8 h respectively unlike the fluctuation voltage curve the coulombic yield was almost an oblique line and the higher the cod the greater the slope of the oblique line in addition it is obvious that the maximum output voltage coulombic yield and signal duration of each device increased all with the increase of the cod cm1 achieved the maximum coulombic yield 85 74 c and the longest signal 63 5 h at the cod of 1000 mg l cm2 harvested the maximum voltage 462 mv at the cod of 750 mg l cm3 obtained the lowest output voltage 26 mv coulombic yield 0 11 c and duration 1 17 h at the cod of 50 mg l 3 2 2 polarization and power density curves the maximum volume power densities of cm1 cm2 and cm3 were 0 042 0 221 and 0 052 w m3 respectively fig 4 a and the corresponding current density was 0 345 1 405 and 0 662 a m3 respectively which corresponds to internal resistances of 306 62 and 178 ω respectively cm2 presented the minimum internal resistance and the maximum volume power density cm1 presented the maximum internal resistance and the minimum volume power density the internal resistance and the volume power density of cm3 were both in the middle of cm2 and cm1 thus it can be inferred that the smaller electrode spacing or the larger anode volume correspondingly the smaller internal resistance and the greater volume power density 3 2 3 coulombic efficiency as shown in fig 4 b the ce of cm1 cm2 and cm3 ranged from 0 52 to 1 65 0 30 to 1 04 and 0 15 to 0 38 respectively which were all not more than 2 overall for every device with the gradual increase of cod the ce dramatically drop by 50 70 from 50 to 200 mg l and then descended slowly with small fluctuation under the condition of same cod concentration the ce varied with different group of devices for example when cod 50 mg l the difference of ce between cm1 and cm3 was almost four times when cod 250 mg l the difference of ce between cm1 and cm2 was only 25 among the three structural devices the ce of cm1 was the largest for all the cod concentrations and that of cm3 was the lowest 3 3 electrode microbiome the six samples produced a total of 453 054 valid sequences each of which produced more than 70 000 sequences for subsequent analysis table s3 supplementary materials listed the sequence information and microbial diversity index of the samples at a similarity level of 97 the six samples had a total of 12 012 otus the otu values of each sample ranged from 1592 to 2408 which indicated a rich variety of microorganisms a coverage index 0 99 indicates that the otus of each microbiome sample were representative the greater chao1 index and shannon index of the anode samples than that of the cathode samples denote the higher microbial abundance and the greater microbial diversity in the anode region the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis showed two clear clusters samples of cm1a and cm2a were clustered together whereas that of cm2c and cm3c were assembled fig s1 supplementary materials at the phylum level the dominant bacteria colonized in the anode samples were relatively similar fig 5 a the top three phyla in sequence were proteobacteria planctomycetes and acidobacteria which collectively accounted for more than 60 of the total sample sequences among them the relative abundance of proteobacteria in all samples exceeded 35 but in the cathodes the top three phyla changed to proteobacteria planctomycetes and bacteroidetes proteobacteria were still the absolute dominant bacteria accounting for more than 70 of the relative abundance in each sample it is clear that the core community composition remained relative steady and the dominant position of proteobacteria in cathodes was more prominent although the relative abundance fluctuated according to the different devices at the class level fig s2 supplementary materials alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the dominant in the cathodes among which the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria in the three devices was the highest exceeding 30 in addition the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria on the three devices was 12 47 17 23 and 21 02 respectively increasing with the increase of structural parameter s however the dominant bacteria classes colonized on the anodes were significantly different with the structural parameter s when s was 0 75 betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the dominant when s was 1 0 planctomycetia and betaproteobacteria became the dominant and when s was 1 5 the leading position was dominated by deltaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria planctomycetia and alphaproteobacteria what s more different bacterial classes showed different preference with the structural parameter s for instance the relative abundance of deltaproteobacteria was 3 51 6 53 and 14 36 increasing with an increase in s whereas the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria was 15 66 9 28 and 3 87 decreasing with an increase in s significant differences at the class level began to appear in the electrode microbiome of the three devices furthermore the top 50 genera were selected according to the species annotation and abundance information for all samples and a heat map was drawn in fig 5 b the microbial composition and relative abundance both for anodes and cathodes changed considerably with s values in the anode samples the top four genera were gp7 2 66 acinetobacter 1 74 aridibacter 1 74 and ralstonia 1 52 at the s of 0 75 and changed to geobacter 3 36 geothrix 3 17 gp7 3 13 and thermogutta 3 11 at the s of 1 0 and converted to geobacter 12 geothrix 7 22 thermogutta 3 65 and gemmobacter 2 92 at the s of 1 5 obviously the dominant genera were notably similar at the s values of 1 0 and 1 5 and geobacter and geothrix were more likely to be dominant at a higher s value but when s is 0 75 gp7 is the only genus over 2 relative abundance in the cathodes the top four genera in relative abundance of cm1 cm2 and cm3 were gemmobacter 13 46 pseudofulvimonas 9 48 flavobacterium 8 72 and roseovarius 8 38 gemmobacter 20 02 paracoccus 7 07 hydrogenophaga 5 34 and hyphomicrobium 4 2 gemmobacter 6 87 hydrogenophaga 5 28 hyphomicrobium 3 6 and rhizobium 3 28 respectively it is evident that gemmobacter was conspicuously dominant in all the cathodes and present absolute advantage with s value of 1 0 moreover the relative abundance of hydrogenophaga which was 6 13 5 34 and 5 28 respectively decreased slightly with an increase in s which was 0 75 1 0 and 1 5 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 influence of s on anolyte physicochemical properties a correlation analysis table 1 showed that the coulombic yield of each device is related to the orp of the anolyte but weak correlation with do it was in significant correlation with the output charge p 0 05 at the s of 1 0 and 1 5 and even in highly significant correlation p 0 01 at the s of 0 75 the research results of oon et al 2015 also found that the orp of the anolyte decreased with the increase of the anode embedding depth in upstream vfcw mfcs in fact the orp in the anode directly affects the enrichment of electricigens in geng et al s 2020 research on an mfc system driven directly by orp the output power density could reach 2 0 mw m2 they concluded that maintaining the steady state of intracellular reoxidation for the electricigens was the prerequisite for achieving high output voltage as for ph it presented the correlation with the output coulombic yield only in the s of 1 5 implying the susceptibility of electricity generation with the structure of cm3 jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 found that the output current of the anode chamber at a ph of 6 5 was higher than that over 7 and within 6 suggesting the dependence on the ph to some degree in the vfcw mfc system of this study the cathodes were always located on the surface so the increase of s value represented the increase volumes of the anode and the decrease in electrode spacing in other words the anode volume changed with the position of the anode in the vfcw the change of the anode position results in different redox habitats for the eab which may greatly affect the electrical signal output and biosensing of cod hence it is necessary to further discuss the differences in the microbial functional communities with different structural parameters s 4 2 influence of s on the electrode microbiome the enrichment of the functional microbiome on the electrode especially the eab is a direct factor affecting the electrical signal output in general the more eab enrichment on the electrode the more electrons transfer and the stronger the electrical signal output logan 2009 however some other functional bacteria which are not able to generate electricity but do adapt to the electricity producing environment also colonized on the electrodes xu et al 2017a such as nitrogen transforming bacteria ntb and hydrogen producing functional bacteria which were all frequently reported to play important roles in bioelectrochemical systems xu et al 2018 4 2 1 effects on eab potential eab only relative abundances 1 enriched on both the anode and cathode of the three devices were listed and changes of relative abundance with s value were plotted in fig 6 a it is clear that the total relative abundance of the eab expanded on the anode but diminished on the cathode with the increase of s on the anodes the major potential eab included geobacter geothrix and exiguobacterium both geobacter and geothrix showed similar increase with the increase of s value geobacter a kind of widely studied eab and often appeared in the mfcs with sodium acetate as the substrate lovley 2006 have robust electron transport capability and easily accumulate in a strong electrical current environment but do not produce electron shuttles nevin and lovley 2000 meanwhile geothrix was reported to be able to produce electron shuttles bond and lovley 2005 the electron shuttles would consume more energy from microorganisms mahadevan et al 2006 and easily disappear from the release site in an open environment therefore the eab that produce electricity via electron shuttles are often at a disadvantaged competition compared to those without electron shuttles nevin and lovley 2002 which could explain the fact that geobacter have a higher relative abundance than geothrix in this study similar phenomena also appeared in sediment mfcs holmes et al 2004 exiguobacterium belonging to class bacilli firmicutes phylum is also a typical eab in the facultative anaerobic environment as a member exiguobacterium aestuarii yc211 is often considered as an eab inoculated in an mfc biosensor to monitor cr ⅵ due to its good tolerance to large fluctuations in temperature 20 35 salinity 0 15 g l and ph 5 9 wu et al 2019 on the cathodes eab also significantly contribute to electricity generation in the device because the electron acceptors such as oxygen and nitrate would accelerate the electron transfer and reduce the internal resistance huang et al 2011 the main genera including flavobacterium hydrogenophaga pseudomonas rhodobacter paracoccus and geobacter quite differed from those on the anode flavobacterium subordinated to flavobacteria class bacteroidetes phylum are strictly aerobic and often found colonized in the cathode of the cw mfcs with a high abundance fang et al 2017 hydrogenophaga betaproteobacteria as a facultative hydrogenotrophic bacteria can oxidatively metabolize glucose with oxygen as the terminal electron receptor and was supposed to be associated with electron transfer vanden hoven and santini 2004 it was also found to perform heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification in the cathode chamber of the mfcs feng et al 2015 pseudomonas also typically facultative anaerobic and often found in the biocathode to reduce nitrate and produce electricity simultaneously virdis et al 2011 can secrete compounds such as pyocyanin and phenazine and function as an intermediary to assist itself or other eab to transfer electrons from cells to electrodes rabaey et al 2005 rhodobacter and paracoccus both belonging to the rhodobacteraceae family became dominant 68 78 relative abundance with current but subsidiary 13 20 relative abundance without current in the cathode of smfcs nevin and lovley 2002 reflecting their preference to electricity current environment to some degree and paracoccus was also observed to achieve electricity production and denitrification at the cathode of the mfcs rabaey et al 2006 among them the aerobic hydrogenophaga and flavobacterium decreased with the increase in s especial for flavobacterium the relative abundance decreased from 8 75 s 0 75 to 1 08 s 1 5 hydrogenophaga kept the highest relative abundance when s was 1 0 and 1 5 although the three devices were all air cathodes the different sizes and spacing of anodes caused different eab enrichment and thus produced different amount of electrons transferred to cathode the mismatch between the relative abundance of eab in the electrodes and the electrical generation performance is likely related to the ce of the three devices in general the higher the value of ce the higher the efficiency of the anolyte organic matter conversion into electric energy but in this study the ce achieved the highest at a lower s of 0 75 fig 4 whereas the total relative abundance of eab at the anode was the lowest fig 6 a in contrast the ce obtained the lowest at a higher s of 1 5 while the total relative abundance of eab at the anode was the highest it is thus clear that the enrichment of eab on the anode is not the decisive factor affecting the electrical generation performance of the cw mfcs in fact some non electricigens also adapt to the current environment in anaerobic and anoxic environment of anolytes even in the device using mixed bacteria inoculation jiang et al 2010 the non electricigens outperformed the eab and lead to a decrease in electricity generation on the other side some genera with both electricity generation and denitrification function as mentioned above are not recognized to perform which function on earth therefore it is necessary to analyze further the functional non electricigens in the electrode biofilm 4 2 2 effect on ntb heterotrophic non electricigens with the function of denitrification would compete for substrate with eab and while autotrophic bacteria may compete for electrons generated by eab both ways are adverse to the electrogenesis and exact reflection of influent cod of the cw mfc biosensor as shown in fig 6 a the ntb consisted of bacteria functioning with denitrifying dn dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox were much different between the anode and the corresponding cathode on anodes the main dn bacteria consisted of denitratisoma pseudomonas hydrogenophaga ralstonia ornatilinea longilinea thermogutta aridibacter exiguobacterium and clostridium sensu stricto anammox bacteria mainly include gemmata and holophaga xia et al 2019 anaeromyxobacter has the function of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium wan et al 2020 most of them could use nitrates and nitrites as electron receptors for anaerobic respiration denitratisoma betaproteobacteria class was suitable for growing in the substrate using sodium acetate as the carbon source and cause nitrite accumulation in the process of denitrification lyu et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that clostridium sensu stricto is regarded as an anoxic autotrophic denitrifying bacterium xu et al 2017a the presence of gemmata and holophaga illustrates the anammox process on anodic biofilms xia et al 2019 in addition anaeromyxobacter can convert no3 n to nh4 n directly from 5 to 3 valency wan et al 2020 the total relative abundance of dn dnra and anammox bacteria in the anodes was 11 91 15 88 and 18 91 respectively which increased with the increase of the s value implying the significant effect on the enrichment of functional bacteria however on cathodes the highest relative abundance 35 48 of total ntb appeared at the s of 1 0 which was almost 1 2 and 1 5 times of the s value with 0 75 and 1 5 respectively and compared with the anode the composition and abundance of the ntb bacteria were quite different there existed only dn bacteria involving gemmobacter hyphomicrobium thauera hydrogenophaga pseudomonas exiguobacterium and aridibacter probably because of the aeration environment gemmobacter and hyphomicrobium all belonging to alphaproteobacteria had different enrichment on the three devices gemmobacter occupied the absolutely dominant with 13 46 and 20 02 relative abundance in the cm1 and cm2 previous studies have found that gemmobacter is a heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification bacterium tan et al 2020 and its appearance at the cathode often indicates better denitrification compared with gemmobacter hyphomicrobium was slightly lower and had much relative abundance in the cm2 and cm3 it was reported to facilitate denitrification when the relative abundance ranged from 1 62 to 4 2 song et al 2020 thauera subordinated to betaproteobacteria is a common facultative heterotrophic denitrifying bacterium whose relative abundance in the anode of the cm3 was similar to that of the cathode furthermore it is clear that some genera like pseudomonas hydrogenophaga and exiguobacterium appeared both on eab and ntb histogram meaning the double function of electricity generation and nitrate reducrion however the specific role of these bacteria on the electrode is still unclear and requires further discussion 4 2 3 homeostasis of eab and ntb from the perspective of the relative abundance of enrichment eab and ntb both in anodes and cathodes were in a different competitive situation in this study for instance the eab was in a losing position total relative abundance 3 17 in the anode of cm1 s 0 75 but gained advantages total relative abundance 20 71 in the anode of cm3 s 1 5 similarly in the cathode the eab was in a competitive position 21 05 in cm1 but became uncompetitive 10 84 in cm3 therefore eab ntb the relative abundance ratio of eab and ntb both in the anode and in the cathode with different s values was proposed as the steady state coefficient to denote the competition between eab and ntb when the ratio is higher than 1 meaning the dominant of eab and vice versa pseudomonas hydrogenophaga and exiguobacterium existing both in the anodes and cathodes have electricity generation rabaey et al 2004 wu et al 2019 and nitrogen conversion functions xu et al 2017a and their roles in anodes and cathodes were uncertain so when they were distinguished as eab ntb and neither eab nor ntb respectively the corresponding eab ntb values were plotted against s value in the fig 6 b and c results showed that the linear correlations were 0 9559 line a1 0 9999 line a2 and 0 9994 line a3 in anodes and only 0 4824 line c1 0 9998 line c2 and 0 8692 line c3 in corresponding cathodes respectively it is distinct that there is little effect on the competitive situation of eab and ntb in all anodes no matter what responsibility these three genera take but there was great effect on the cathode of cm1 when these three genera were regarded only as eab the competitive situation of eab changed from weakness to strength additionally the ratios of eab excluding these three genera in anode to that in cathode were calculated and analyzed using a linear regression in the fig 6 d similar operation was conducted to eab including these three genera ntb excluding these three genera and ntb including these three genera it showed a good linear relationship in all cases implying different steady state between anodes and cathodes 4 3 influence of s on biosensing performance regardless of the type of mfc and its hybrid biosensors the main detection signals are still voltage coulombic yield and potential jia et al 2016 xu et al 2017b and the biosensing performance is mainly characterized by the coefficient of determination r2 detection time and sensitivity the linear relationship between the maximum output voltage or coulombic yield against cod was established using the least squares method as shown in fig 7 a and b when the maximum output voltage was used as the detection signal r 2 was greater than 0 9 only at cm1 and cm3 correspondingly cod ranged from 50 to 250 mg l and 50 to 400 mg l respectively the goodness of fit is not sufficiently high both at cm1 and cm2 with 400 1000 mg l cod when the coulombic yield was used as the detection signal all the r2 values of the three devices were all above 0 97 obviously the coulombic yield is more suitable as a detection signal in this study detection time defined as the time to output electrical signals within a concentration period is affected by the total volume of the biosensor and the type of electrical signal compare mfc with cw mfc all with acetate as the carbon source the smaller volume 2 cm3 of mfc biosensor can finish monitoring cod in 2 8 min taking current as signal lorenzo et al 2014 while the larger volume 1 8 l of cw mfc biosensor need 2 h using voltage as signal xu et al 2017b when using coulombic yield as detection signal the detection time of mfc biosensor with volume of 12 6 cm3 was 20 h modin and wilen 2012 actually as transient signals current and voltage are easily disturbed resulting in relatively low accuracy the coulombic yield however expressing persistent signals in a period can more completely and accurately reflect the overall situation of the detection index despite the longer detection time fig 8 b showed the corresponding detection time taking the coulombic yield as the signal within a cod range of 50 400 mg l the detection time of cm1 cm2 and cm3 is 3 8 43 2 5 8 31 and 2 2 17 8 h respectively when the concentration gets 400 1000 mg l the detection time of cm1 and cm2 is 43 2 138 8 and 31 63 5 h respectively and the detection time decreased with an increase in s for the same cod it is clear that the higher the cod concentration is the longer the required detection time becomes which is consistent with previous studies do et al 2020 gao et al 2020 when the coulombic yield of the three devices is equal the detection time become shorter with an increase in the current density and when the current density is equal the detection time correspondingly shorten with the reduction of coulombic yield the results from chang et al 2004 showed that the detection time for a bod of 100 mg l was 60 min when the current density was 968 ma m2 but the detection time for a bod of 78 mg l reached 10 h when the current density was 222 ma m2 peixoto et al 2011 modin and wilen 2012 found in the research on bod sensor it had taken 5 and 20 h to obtain coulombic yield of approximately 20 and 40 c respectively even further the lower ce suggests the less coulombic yield generated by the conversion of cod correspondingly the power density increases and the detection time decreases for example when the cod was 200 mg l in this study the coulombic yield of cm3 3 68 c was approximately one third that of cm2 9 81 c and cm3 10 96 c meanwhile the current density of cm3 0 662 a m3 was about twice that of cm1 0 345 a m3 and half that of cm2 1 405 a m3 therefore the detection time of cm3 was the shortest followed by cm2 and cm1 sensitivity refers to the change in the electrical signal caused by a cod change in device volume di lorenzo et al 2014 as formula 3 3 s e n s i t i v i t y δ q δ c v where δq c is the change in the coulombic yield δc mg l is the change in the anolyte content and v l is the volume of the anode biosensors should show suitable sensitivity to avoid the risk of false positives caused by too high or too low sensitivities chouler and lorenzo 2015 as shown in fig 8 a the sensitivity decreases from 0 056 or 0 160 to 0 020 c mg with the increase of s from 0 75 to 1 5 the core principle of improving the sensitivity is to improve the efficiency of eab in capturing electrons from organic matter jiang et al 2018 which is consistent with ce as the indicator of mfc electron recovery efficiency so the sensitivity has the same change with ce that decreases with increasing s value furthermore ce is influenced by eab and ntb both on the anode and the cathode in anode area ce increase with higher eab and decrease with higher ntb for competing the substrate and electron with eab it is clear that when s equals to 0 75 1 and 1 5 the eab ntb is 0 1 0 4 and 1 1 respectively which indicates the dominant position of ntb hence it is supposed that ce is more susceptible to ntb in the cathode aera the higher ntb and eab means more effective extracellular electron transport smaller internal resistance and higher current hence ce increases with higher ntb and eab and the relative of ntb and eab decreases with the increase of s therefore ce decreases with the increase of s consequently the different steady state of eab and ntb under different structural parameters s reflected in the sensitivity some additional results could be found by comparing the cw mfc biosensor in this study with other biosensors in the table 2 firstly the larger detection ranges in this study were found than the mfc biosensors that also use coulombic yield as the detection signal mainly because of much smaller volume and limit eab enrichment on anodes of the latter secondly the detection time were shorter than biosensors using the voltage and potential signals at the cod concentrations of 50 200 mg l thirdly in terms of accuracy higher r 2 demonstrated that coulombic yield is more comprehensive to reflect the influent organic matter concentration than voltage and potential finally higher sensitivity were also found when compared with the study by modin and wilen 2012 which may be due to the difference of eab biomass 4 4 biosensing performance optimization as the accumulation of time scales coulombic yield also covers unstable stages such as initial ascent stage in which microorganisms gradually adapt and organic matter rapidly diffuse or adsorbed and gradual decay stages in which microorganisms get into the endogenous respiration gao et al 2020 except for the stable period of the electrical output it is necessary to optimize the electrical signals and limit them to stable stages thus the concept of stable voltage coulombic yield qs was proposed which is defined as the cumulative coulombic yield during the period from initial stability to initial decline in output voltage the cutoff point for qs is set as δu δt 1 mv min and δu δt 0 5 mv min according to the variation trend of voltage take cm1 as the example fig s3 the voltage of cm1 was 211 mv at 200 mg l cod correspondingly the δu δt equals to 0 6 mv min which is lower than 1 mv min meaning the stable output voltage and the time point could be as the starting time of the record when the voltage was 107 mv the δu δt equals to 8 mv min meaning unstable output voltage and the time point could be as the end recording the coulombic yield during this two time points is qs and the time in this period is the stable detection time the regression equation fig 7 c of qs and the cod concentration variable showed that all the r 2 optimized were higher than 0 9 and maintained a good response effect after optimization the detection time of the three groups of devices was reduced by almost half and even down to 1 17 h s 1 5 within the concentration range of 0 200 mg l similarly the sensitivity and r 2 decreased by approximately 20 and 2 respectively in general the biosensing performance of the three structures could be put to good use according to the different requirements of cod detection to be specific cm1 s 0 75 or cm2 s 1 structures would be recommended when the cod concentration of the influent is high 400 1000 mg l the cm2 structure is more appropriate for the limited depth of the cw and while cm1 structure is highly recommended if higher sensitivity is desired but for the lower cod concentration 400 mg l the cm3 s 1 5 structure is the better choice with shorter detection time and lower risk of false positives while in practical application when the waste water enters the cw mfc for a span time the generated electrical signals like coulombic yield were recorded and calculated and then was taken into the calibration curve to obtain cod this is the case the cw mfc is a monitoring tool to reflect the real time cod also the cw mfc is able to be used as an alarm tool the alarm will be activated when the real time coulombic yield exceeds the values reflecting the cod threshold setting in advance 5 conclusion the cw mfc biosensor with different structural parameters s can achieve good electrical signal response to the cod stable voltage coulombic yield was proposed to be an optimized electrical signal and able to shorten the detection time by 70 without affecting the detection effect ntb on the anodes would fight for substrate with eab and compete for electrons with anode thus decreased the ce and disturbed the stability of the output voltage which is the reason that using the coulombic yield as the detection signal is better and a linear correlation between the structural parameter s and the steady state coefficient eab ntb both on the anode and cathode was supposed to explain the differences in the electricity generation and sensing performance of different structural devices the practical application of the cw mfc biosensor need to be further verified for the real complex wastewater due to the single carbon source used in this study in addition big data analysis and cloud computing technology including corresponding data processing and cloud

16343,the hybrid system of constructed wetland and microbial fuel cell cw mfc used as a biosensor is becoming a new research focus with the advantage of resisting the shock loading and enriching more electricigens in this study a structural parameter s integrating the size the position and the spacing of the anode and the cathode was proposed and the electrogenesis and biosensing performances of the vertical flow cw mfc biosensors were evaluated at different s values the results showed that all the three biosensors could achieve good monitoring for cod r 2 0 97 and the coulombic yield was more suitable for the response signal than output voltage but different biosensing properties including detection signal detection range detection time correlation fitting degree and sensitivity were also displayed further in order to optimize the biosensing performance the coulombic yield in stable voltage stage qs was proposed which can shorten the detection time by 70 at most on the anodes abundant nitrogen transforming bacteria ntb were enriched as well as electrochemically active bacteria eab the competition of ntb for substrates and electrons with eab disturbed the output voltage signal but not affect the stability of coulombic yield signal moreover the significant linear correlation between the s values and the ratios of eab to ntb colonized both on anodes and on cathodes indicated the differences of the electricity generation and biosensing performance at the different structural parameters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biosensor constructed wetland microbial fuel cell structural parameters electrochemically active bacteria eab nitrogen transforming bacteria ntb 1 introduction microbial fuel cell mfc is a bio electrochemical device that has attracted much attention during the last twenty years chaudhuri and lovley 2003 schroder et al 2003 the electrochemically active bacteria eab enriched in anode can degrade organic matter and directly convert chemical energy into electricity without an external transducer jiang et al 2018 logan et al 2006 by establishing the correlation between the electricity and organic matter mfc biosensors have been widely studied in the field of bod monitoring for the feature that mfc can generate electricity in real time jiang et al 2018 traditional mfc biosensors are relatively expensive and need to create an anaerobic environment for the anode as well as simultaneously providing suitable electron acceptors for the cathode chouler and lorenzo 2015 in addition due to its small size mfc failures to resist the shock loading as a consequence of limited eab enriched in electrodes liu et al 2014 thus the application of mfc biosensor was restricted greatly coupled system of mfc and vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw mfc is more appropriate for application in practice because of the natural bottom up redox gradient in constructed wetland and the suitable environment for eab doherty et al 2015b and the eab amplification by granular electrode such as active carbon and graphite xu et al 2018 and the feasibility of the cw mfc based biosensor for cod monitoring has been confirmed xu et al 2017b and the accuracy of biosensing has been gradually improving corbella et al 2019 the process of cw mfc converts the organic matter in sewage into electrical signals involves two main steps first eab utilize the organic matter to generate electrons and transfer them to the electrode outside the cell and second the electrons on the electrode are obtained as an output through an external circuit which in turn generate electrical signals therefore parameters such as the electrode type electrode size electrode spacing electrode position and wetland filler have direct or indirect effects on the electrical signals among them easy adjustable structural parameters like the position spacing and size of electrodes are often prior considered the position of anodes and cathodes directly affects electrons generation and protons transfer most of eab have been found to be more suitable for anoxic and anaerobic environment logan 2009 thus the anode is usually buried in the middle or bottom of vfcw with low oxygen redox potential orp doherty et al 2015a correspondingly in order to keep the steady potential difference the cathode is usually set on the surface of wetland or near the plant roots using oxygen from air or plant roots as electrons acceptors but due to the influence of light dark cycles and plant growth rhythm yang et al 2021 the cathode is more often placed on the surface of wetland when the cathode position is determined the electrode spacing will change with anode position oon et al 2015 found that keeping cathode in wetland surface and adjusting the anode burial depth which caused the electrode spacing to increase the electric power density of the cw mfc decreased doherty et al 2015a found that the internal resistance of the cw mfc system reduced from 500 to 300 ω by reducing electrodes gap and maintaining the anoxic anode and the aerobic cathode thereby producing high power density in addition the electrode spacing is closely related also affected by the anode size when the size or volume of the granular anode changes the overall position of the anode changes and leads to the change of spacing with the cathode accordingly in di lorenzo et al 2009 research three anode volumes of 3 75 12 5 and 37 5 cm3 were set by controlling the thickness of anode layer 0 3 1and 3 cm when adjusting the thickness of anode layer to 4 3 and 1 cm the internal resistance of the device changes to 128 104 and 5 ω respectively and the maximum current power density and coulombic efficiency were achieved at the anode volume of 37 5 cm3 it is difficult to say that significant change in the performance of mfc only by adjusting the electrode size obviously the electrode position spacing and size of vfcw mfc are actually interrelated and influential each other considering the structures of vfcw mfc systems the layers from the bottom to up include the conductive filler lb anodic conductive filler layer la non conductive isolation layer ls and cathode conductive filler lc the volume of la layer is the anode size and the thickness of ls layer is the spacing of the anode and the cathode the new structural parameter s was proposed as shown in eq 1 which is the ratio between the thickness of the anode conductive filler layer and the thickness of the non conductive isolation layer also reflecting the ratio between the volumes of the anode and electrode spacing it can be further understood as the ratio between the volume percent of anode conductive filler layer to the total device and the volume percent of electrode spacing to the total device 1 s l a l s v a v s v a v 0 v s l 0 where la ls is the thickness of the anode conductive filler and non conductive filler layer for cw mfc respectively va vs and vo is the volume of anode the electrode spacing and the whole cw mfc therefore the aim of this study is to analyze the influence mechanisms of s on the output signal of the vfcw mfc as well as the biosensing performance of the correlation sensitivity detection limit and detection time to cod in order to provide valuable data support and accelerate its application in practical engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 cw mfc setup three groups two replicates for each group of vfcw mfc experimental devices with corresponding s values of 0 75 cm1 1 cm2 and 1 5 cm3 were constructed by setting the different thickness of the lb la and ls layers respectively as shown in fig 1 each vfcw mfc comprised a pvc cylinder filled with a quartz sand layer height lb diameter 8 10 mm anodic granular activated carbon layer height la diameter 3 5 mm quartz sand isolation layer height ls diameter 8 10 mm and cathode ring graphite felt layer lc thickness 6 mm from bottom to top in the anode layer a cylindrical rolled graphite felt was embedded in the granular activated carbon as a current collector the anode and cathode were connected with a titanium wire the external resistance was set to 1000 ω and a digital multimeter was used to monitor the voltage at both ends of the electrical resistor every 10 min cm1 and cm3 have the identical size the total volumes and the effective water storage capacities were 3 925 and 1 2 l respectively the total volume and the effective water storage capacity of cm2 were 5 298 and 1 8 l respectively the volumes of the anode granular activated carbon layers in cm1 cm2 and cm3 were 1 18 1 86 and 1 18 l respectively the areas of the cathode graphite felt were 7 85 10 3 17 66 10 3 and 7 85 10 3 m2 before filling the graphite felt and granular activated carbon were rinsed with tap water several times and then soaked with 1 mol l hcl and 1 mol l naoh to improve the hydrophilicity of the material surface and remove metal impurities finally the graphite felt and granular activated carbon were rinsed with distilled water till a neutral ph 2 2 experimental design during the acclimation stage the inoculated sludge is the anaerobic activated sludge from a local sewage treatment plant wuhan china anodic graphite felt was immersed in anaerobic sludge for 48 h and then rolled into a cylinder and embedded in granular activated carbon after the installation each vfcw mfc was inoculated with activated sludge and synthetic wastewater in a volume ratio of 3 to 7 per liter the synthetic wastewater contained 0 642 g ch3coona 0 0573 g nh4cl 0 011 g kh2po4 1 0 g nacl 0 0068 g cacl2 6h2o 0 1 g mgso4 7h2o and 1 ml trace elements the main components of the trace elements in g l included 1 546 h3bo3 0 338 mnso4 h2o 0 576 znso4 7h2o 0 124 cuso4 5h2o 0 08 h2moo4 0 132 niso4 6h2o and 19 6 nafedtpa these reactors were operated in batch mode a draft tube was set up at the top of each reactor to guide the influent into the bottom and then overflow from down to up the influent was not replaced until the output voltage dropped to 0 v once a stable voltage appears the acclimation is completed during the formal experiment stage cod concentration gradients of 50 100 150 200 250 300 400 600 750 and 1000 mg l were set successively and each concentration sustained till the voltage was 0 v keep the influent pumped into the three cw mfc devices consistent in composition and concentration 2 3 analysis the temperature ph redox potential orp and do were determined by a ysi pro plus multi parameter water quality meter ysi incorporated yellow springs ohio u s a the cod was

after discretization s the ibm spss statistics 25 software package was used for statistical analysis the shapiro wilk test was used to evaluate whether the data conformed to a normal distribution supplementary table s1 the t test was used to analyze the significant difference in the physicochemical parameters of the anode effluent pearson correlation was used to analyze the physicochemical index of the effluent as well as the relationship between the cod concentration of the influent and output charge of the unit a total of six microbial samples were collected from the graphite felt both on cathode and anode of the three groups at the end of the experiment cm1a cm2a and cm3a represent the anode sample respectively from the three groups cm1c cm2c and cm3c represent corresponding cathode samples respectively all samples extraction dna and high throughput sequencing at shanghai sangon biotech co ltd according to the method described in our previous study xu et al 2017a after the sequences obtained by high throughput sequencing were classified the operational taxonomic units otu sequences were compared with the corresponding database using blast to screen the best comparison result of the otu sequences thereafter the results were filtered by comparison by default sequences satisfying the criteria of similarity and coverage of more than 90 were regarded as unclassified 3 results 3 1 physicochemical properties of anolyte as shown in fig 2 the change of the ph do and orp in the anolyte of the three devices under different cod concentrations the ph of the anolyte after each cycle of electrogenesis almost dropped below 7 0 and fluctuated in the ranges of 6 67 6 89 6 48 6 82 and 6 61 7 06 for cm1 cm2 and cm3 respectively the significantly lower ph values than that of the influent indicate the normal electricity generation process in each anode different from ph the do and orp in the anolyte expressed the significant difference among the three groups in the anolyte of cm1 the do and orp ranged from 0 20 to 0 30 mg l and from 335 9 to 204 7 mv respectively implying an anaerobic environment oon et al 2015 while in the anolyte of both cm2 and cm3 the higher do 0 62 0 93 mg l as well as orp 110 to 28 5 mv suggested the anoxic environment watson and logan 2010 the do of the anolyte in each device was consistent with the distribution of aerobic zone anoxic zone anaerobic zone from top to bottom in the conventional vfcw saeed and sun 2017 moreover the results of t test supplementary material table s2 showed that there were significant differences p 0 01 in do and orp between the cm1 and cm2 or cm3 but not between cm2 and cm3 and the difference in do and orp among the three devices is notably related to the position of the anode 3 2 electrical generation performance 3 2 1 bioelectricity generation as shown in fig 3 the output electrical signals of the three devices displayed evident discrepancy the voltage curve displayed similar three stages including a sharp rising a peak lasting and a slow falling for every cod concentration there were shorter peak lasting and slow falling at lower cod but longer ones at higher cod the maximum output voltages of cm1 cm2 and cm3 ranged from 96 to 329 182 462 and 26 208 mv respectively correspondingly the coulombic yield was 2 54 85 74 1 87 64 65 and 0 11 7 49 c respectively the durations of the electrical signal were 3 81 38 8 5 8 63 5 and 2 2 17 8 h respectively unlike the fluctuation voltage curve the coulombic yield was almost an oblique line and the higher the cod the greater the slope of the oblique line in addition it is obvious that the maximum output voltage coulombic yield and signal duration of each device increased all with the increase of the cod cm1 achieved the maximum coulombic yield 85 74 c and the longest signal 63 5 h at the cod of 1000 mg l cm2 harvested the maximum voltage 462 mv at the cod of 750 mg l cm3 obtained the lowest output voltage 26 mv coulombic yield 0 11 c and duration 1 17 h at the cod of 50 mg l 3 2 2 polarization and power density curves the maximum volume power densities of cm1 cm2 and cm3 were 0 042 0 221 and 0 052 w m3 respectively fig 4 a and the corresponding current density was 0 345 1 405 and 0 662 a m3 respectively which corresponds to internal resistances of 306 62 and 178 ω respectively cm2 presented the minimum internal resistance and the maximum volume power density cm1 presented the maximum internal resistance and the minimum volume power density the internal resistance and the volume power density of cm3 were both in the middle of cm2 and cm1 thus it can be inferred that the smaller electrode spacing or the larger anode volume correspondingly the smaller internal resistance and the greater volume power density 3 2 3 coulombic efficiency as shown in fig 4 b the ce of cm1 cm2 and cm3 ranged from 0 52 to 1 65 0 30 to 1 04 and 0 15 to 0 38 respectively which were all not more than 2 overall for every device with the gradual increase of cod the ce dramatically drop by 50 70 from 50 to 200 mg l and then descended slowly with small fluctuation under the condition of same cod concentration the ce varied with different group of devices for example when cod 50 mg l the difference of ce between cm1 and cm3 was almost four times when cod 250 mg l the difference of ce between cm1 and cm2 was only 25 among the three structural devices the ce of cm1 was the largest for all the cod concentrations and that of cm3 was the lowest 3 3 electrode microbiome the six samples produced a total of 453 054 valid sequences each of which produced more than 70 000 sequences for subsequent analysis table s3 supplementary materials listed the sequence information and microbial diversity index of the samples at a similarity level of 97 the six samples had a total of 12 012 otus the otu values of each sample ranged from 1592 to 2408 which indicated a rich variety of microorganisms a coverage index 0 99 indicates that the otus of each microbiome sample were representative the greater chao1 index and shannon index of the anode samples than that of the cathode samples denote the higher microbial abundance and the greater microbial diversity in the anode region the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis showed two clear clusters samples of cm1a and cm2a were clustered together whereas that of cm2c and cm3c were assembled fig s1 supplementary materials at the phylum level the dominant bacteria colonized in the anode samples were relatively similar fig 5 a the top three phyla in sequence were proteobacteria planctomycetes and acidobacteria which collectively accounted for more than 60 of the total sample sequences among them the relative abundance of proteobacteria in all samples exceeded 35 but in the cathodes the top three phyla changed to proteobacteria planctomycetes and bacteroidetes proteobacteria were still the absolute dominant bacteria accounting for more than 70 of the relative abundance in each sample it is clear that the core community composition remained relative steady and the dominant position of proteobacteria in cathodes was more prominent although the relative abundance fluctuated according to the different devices at the class level fig s2 supplementary materials alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the dominant in the cathodes among which the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria in the three devices was the highest exceeding 30 in addition the relative abundance of betaproteobacteria on the three devices was 12 47 17 23 and 21 02 respectively increasing with the increase of structural parameter s however the dominant bacteria classes colonized on the anodes were significantly different with the structural parameter s when s was 0 75 betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the dominant when s was 1 0 planctomycetia and betaproteobacteria became the dominant and when s was 1 5 the leading position was dominated by deltaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria planctomycetia and alphaproteobacteria what s more different bacterial classes showed different preference with the structural parameter s for instance the relative abundance of deltaproteobacteria was 3 51 6 53 and 14 36 increasing with an increase in s whereas the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria was 15 66 9 28 and 3 87 decreasing with an increase in s significant differences at the class level began to appear in the electrode microbiome of the three devices furthermore the top 50 genera were selected according to the species annotation and abundance information for all samples and a heat map was drawn in fig 5 b the microbial composition and relative abundance both for anodes and cathodes changed considerably with s values in the anode samples the top four genera were gp7 2 66 acinetobacter 1 74 aridibacter 1 74 and ralstonia 1 52 at the s of 0 75 and changed to geobacter 3 36 geothrix 3 17 gp7 3 13 and thermogutta 3 11 at the s of 1 0 and converted to geobacter 12 geothrix 7 22 thermogutta 3 65 and gemmobacter 2 92 at the s of 1 5 obviously the dominant genera were notably similar at the s values of 1 0 and 1 5 and geobacter and geothrix were more likely to be dominant at a higher s value but when s is 0 75 gp7 is the only genus over 2 relative abundance in the cathodes the top four genera in relative abundance of cm1 cm2 and cm3 were gemmobacter 13 46 pseudofulvimonas 9 48 flavobacterium 8 72 and roseovarius 8 38 gemmobacter 20 02 paracoccus 7 07 hydrogenophaga 5 34 and hyphomicrobium 4 2 gemmobacter 6 87 hydrogenophaga 5 28 hyphomicrobium 3 6 and rhizobium 3 28 respectively it is evident that gemmobacter was conspicuously dominant in all the cathodes and present absolute advantage with s value of 1 0 moreover the relative abundance of hydrogenophaga which was 6 13 5 34 and 5 28 respectively decreased slightly with an increase in s which was 0 75 1 0 and 1 5 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 influence of s on anolyte physicochemical properties a correlation analysis table 1 showed that the coulombic yield of each device is related to the orp of the anolyte but weak correlation with do it was in significant correlation with the output charge p 0 05 at the s of 1 0 and 1 5 and even in highly significant correlation p 0 01 at the s of 0 75 the research results of oon et al 2015 also found that the orp of the anolyte decreased with the increase of the anode embedding depth in upstream vfcw mfcs in fact the orp in the anode directly affects the enrichment of electricigens in geng et al s 2020 research on an mfc system driven directly by orp the output power density could reach 2 0 mw m2 they concluded that maintaining the steady state of intracellular reoxidation for the electricigens was the prerequisite for achieving high output voltage as for ph it presented the correlation with the output coulombic yield only in the s of 1 5 implying the susceptibility of electricity generation with the structure of cm3 jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 found that the output current of the anode chamber at a ph of 6 5 was higher than that over 7 and within 6 suggesting the dependence on the ph to some degree in the vfcw mfc system of this study the cathodes were always located on the surface so the increase of s value represented the increase volumes of the anode and the decrease in electrode spacing in other words the anode volume changed with the position of the anode in the vfcw the change of the anode position results in different redox habitats for the eab which may greatly affect the electrical signal output and biosensing of cod hence it is necessary to further discuss the differences in the microbial functional communities with different structural parameters s 4 2 influence of s on the electrode microbiome the enrichment of the functional microbiome on the electrode especially the eab is a direct factor affecting the electrical signal output in general the more eab enrichment on the electrode the more electrons transfer and the stronger the electrical signal output logan 2009 however some other functional bacteria which are not able to generate electricity but do adapt to the electricity producing environment also colonized on the electrodes xu et al 2017a such as nitrogen transforming bacteria ntb and hydrogen producing functional bacteria which were all frequently reported to play important roles in bioelectrochemical systems xu et al 2018 4 2 1 effects on eab potential eab only relative abundances 1 enriched on both the anode and cathode of the three devices were listed and changes of relative abundance with s value were plotted in fig 6 a it is clear that the total relative abundance of the eab expanded on the anode but diminished on the cathode with the increase of s on the anodes the major potential eab included geobacter geothrix and exiguobacterium both geobacter and geothrix showed similar increase with the increase of s value geobacter a kind of widely studied eab and often appeared in the mfcs with sodium acetate as the substrate lovley 2006 have robust electron transport capability and easily accumulate in a strong electrical current environment but do not produce electron shuttles nevin and lovley 2000 meanwhile geothrix was reported to be able to produce electron shuttles bond and lovley 2005 the electron shuttles would consume more energy from microorganisms mahadevan et al 2006 and easily disappear from the release site in an open environment therefore the eab that produce electricity via electron shuttles are often at a disadvantaged competition compared to those without electron shuttles nevin and lovley 2002 which could explain the fact that geobacter have a higher relative abundance than geothrix in this study similar phenomena also appeared in sediment mfcs holmes et al 2004 exiguobacterium belonging to class bacilli firmicutes phylum is also a typical eab in the facultative anaerobic environment as a member exiguobacterium aestuarii yc211 is often considered as an eab inoculated in an mfc biosensor to monitor cr ⅵ due to its good tolerance to large fluctuations in temperature 20 35 salinity 0 15 g l and ph 5 9 wu et al 2019 on the cathodes eab also significantly contribute to electricity generation in the device because the electron acceptors such as oxygen and nitrate would accelerate the electron transfer and reduce the internal resistance huang et al 2011 the main genera including flavobacterium hydrogenophaga pseudomonas rhodobacter paracoccus and geobacter quite differed from those on the anode flavobacterium subordinated to flavobacteria class bacteroidetes phylum are strictly aerobic and often found colonized in the cathode of the cw mfcs with a high abundance fang et al 2017 hydrogenophaga betaproteobacteria as a facultative hydrogenotrophic bacteria can oxidatively metabolize glucose with oxygen as the terminal electron receptor and was supposed to be associated with electron transfer vanden hoven and santini 2004 it was also found to perform heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification in the cathode chamber of the mfcs feng et al 2015 pseudomonas also typically facultative anaerobic and often found in the biocathode to reduce nitrate and produce electricity simultaneously virdis et al 2011 can secrete compounds such as pyocyanin and phenazine and function as an intermediary to assist itself or other eab to transfer electrons from cells to electrodes rabaey et al 2005 rhodobacter and paracoccus both belonging to the rhodobacteraceae family became dominant 68 78 relative abundance with current but subsidiary 13 20 relative abundance without current in the cathode of smfcs nevin and lovley 2002 reflecting their preference to electricity current environment to some degree and paracoccus was also observed to achieve electricity production and denitrification at the cathode of the mfcs rabaey et al 2006 among them the aerobic hydrogenophaga and flavobacterium decreased with the increase in s especial for flavobacterium the relative abundance decreased from 8 75 s 0 75 to 1 08 s 1 5 hydrogenophaga kept the highest relative abundance when s was 1 0 and 1 5 although the three devices were all air cathodes the different sizes and spacing of anodes caused different eab enrichment and thus produced different amount of electrons transferred to cathode the mismatch between the relative abundance of eab in the electrodes and the electrical generation performance is likely related to the ce of the three devices in general the higher the value of ce the higher the efficiency of the anolyte organic matter conversion into electric energy but in this study the ce achieved the highest at a lower s of 0 75 fig 4 whereas the total relative abundance of eab at the anode was the lowest fig 6 a in contrast the ce obtained the lowest at a higher s of 1 5 while the total relative abundance of eab at the anode was the highest it is thus clear that the enrichment of eab on the anode is not the decisive factor affecting the electrical generation performance of the cw mfcs in fact some non electricigens also adapt to the current environment in anaerobic and anoxic environment of anolytes even in the device using mixed bacteria inoculation jiang et al 2010 the non electricigens outperformed the eab and lead to a decrease in electricity generation on the other side some genera with both electricity generation and denitrification function as mentioned above are not recognized to perform which function on earth therefore it is necessary to analyze further the functional non electricigens in the electrode biofilm 4 2 2 effect on ntb heterotrophic non electricigens with the function of denitrification would compete for substrate with eab and while autotrophic bacteria may compete for electrons generated by eab both ways are adverse to the electrogenesis and exact reflection of influent cod of the cw mfc biosensor as shown in fig 6 a the ntb consisted of bacteria functioning with denitrifying dn dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox were much different between the anode and the corresponding cathode on anodes the main dn bacteria consisted of denitratisoma pseudomonas hydrogenophaga ralstonia ornatilinea longilinea thermogutta aridibacter exiguobacterium and clostridium sensu stricto anammox bacteria mainly include gemmata and holophaga xia et al 2019 anaeromyxobacter has the function of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium wan et al 2020 most of them could use nitrates and nitrites as electron receptors for anaerobic respiration denitratisoma betaproteobacteria class was suitable for growing in the substrate using sodium acetate as the carbon source and cause nitrite accumulation in the process of denitrification lyu et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that clostridium sensu stricto is regarded as an anoxic autotrophic denitrifying bacterium xu et al 2017a the presence of gemmata and holophaga illustrates the anammox process on anodic biofilms xia et al 2019 in addition anaeromyxobacter can convert no3 n to nh4 n directly from 5 to 3 valency wan et al 2020 the total relative abundance of dn dnra and anammox bacteria in the anodes was 11 91 15 88 and 18 91 respectively which increased with the increase of the s value implying the significant effect on the enrichment of functional bacteria however on cathodes the highest relative abundance 35 48 of total ntb appeared at the s of 1 0 which was almost 1 2 and 1 5 times of the s value with 0 75 and 1 5 respectively and compared with the anode the composition and abundance of the ntb bacteria were quite different there existed only dn bacteria involving gemmobacter hyphomicrobium thauera hydrogenophaga pseudomonas exiguobacterium and aridibacter probably because of the aeration environment gemmobacter and hyphomicrobium all belonging to alphaproteobacteria had different enrichment on the three devices gemmobacter occupied the absolutely dominant with 13 46 and 20 02 relative abundance in the cm1 and cm2 previous studies have found that gemmobacter is a heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification bacterium tan et al 2020 and its appearance at the cathode often indicates better denitrification compared with gemmobacter hyphomicrobium was slightly lower and had much relative abundance in the cm2 and cm3 it was reported to facilitate denitrification when the relative abundance ranged from 1 62 to 4 2 song et al 2020 thauera subordinated to betaproteobacteria is a common facultative heterotrophic denitrifying bacterium whose relative abundance in the anode of the cm3 was similar to that of the cathode furthermore it is clear that some genera like pseudomonas hydrogenophaga and exiguobacterium appeared both on eab and ntb histogram meaning the double function of electricity generation and nitrate reducrion however the specific role of these bacteria on the electrode is still unclear and requires further discussion 4 2 3 homeostasis of eab and ntb from the perspective of the relative abundance of enrichment eab and ntb both in anodes and cathodes were in a different competitive situation in this study for instance the eab was in a losing position total relative abundance 3 17 in the anode of cm1 s 0 75 but gained advantages total relative abundance 20 71 in the anode of cm3 s 1 5 similarly in the cathode the eab was in a competitive position 21 05 in cm1 but became uncompetitive 10 84 in cm3 therefore eab ntb the relative abundance ratio of eab and ntb both in the anode and in the cathode with different s values was proposed as the steady state coefficient to denote the competition between eab and ntb when the ratio is higher than 1 meaning the dominant of eab and vice versa pseudomonas hydrogenophaga and exiguobacterium existing both in the anodes and cathodes have electricity generation rabaey et al 2004 wu et al 2019 and nitrogen conversion functions xu et al 2017a and their roles in anodes and cathodes were uncertain so when they were distinguished as eab ntb and neither eab nor ntb respectively the corresponding eab ntb values were plotted against s value in the fig 6 b and c results showed that the linear correlations were 0 9559 line a1 0 9999 line a2 and 0 9994 line a3 in anodes and only 0 4824 line c1 0 9998 line c2 and 0 8692 line c3 in corresponding cathodes respectively it is distinct that there is little effect on the competitive situation of eab and ntb in all anodes no matter what responsibility these three genera take but there was great effect on the cathode of cm1 when these three genera were regarded only as eab the competitive situation of eab changed from weakness to strength additionally the ratios of eab excluding these three genera in anode to that in cathode were calculated and analyzed using a linear regression in the fig 6 d similar operation was conducted to eab including these three genera ntb excluding these three genera and ntb including these three genera it showed a good linear relationship in all cases implying different steady state between anodes and cathodes 4 3 influence of s on biosensing performance regardless of the type of mfc and its hybrid biosensors the main detection signals are still voltage coulombic yield and potential jia et al 2016 xu et al 2017b and the biosensing performance is mainly characterized by the coefficient of determination r2 detection time and sensitivity the linear relationship between the maximum output voltage or coulombic yield against cod was established using the least squares method as shown in fig 7 a and b when the maximum output voltage was used as the detection signal r 2 was greater than 0 9 only at cm1 and cm3 correspondingly cod ranged from 50 to 250 mg l and 50 to 400 mg l respectively the goodness of fit is not sufficiently high both at cm1 and cm2 with 400 1000 mg l cod when the coulombic yield was used as the detection signal all the r2 values of the three devices were all above 0 97 obviously the coulombic yield is more suitable as a detection signal in this study detection time defined as the time to output electrical signals within a concentration period is affected by the total volume of the biosensor and the type of electrical signal compare mfc with cw mfc all with acetate as the carbon source the smaller volume 2 cm3 of mfc biosensor can finish monitoring cod in 2 8 min taking current as signal lorenzo et al 2014 while the larger volume 1 8 l of cw mfc biosensor need 2 h using voltage as signal xu et al 2017b when using coulombic yield as detection signal the detection time of mfc biosensor with volume of 12 6 cm3 was 20 h modin and wilen 2012 actually as transient signals current and voltage are easily disturbed resulting in relatively low accuracy the coulombic yield however expressing persistent signals in a period can more completely and accurately reflect the overall situation of the detection index despite the longer detection time fig 8 b showed the corresponding detection time taking the coulombic yield as the signal within a cod range of 50 400 mg l the detection time of cm1 cm2 and cm3 is 3 8 43 2 5 8 31 and 2 2 17 8 h respectively when the concentration gets 400 1000 mg l the detection time of cm1 and cm2 is 43 2 138 8 and 31 63 5 h respectively and the detection time decreased with an increase in s for the same cod it is clear that the higher the cod concentration is the longer the required detection time becomes which is consistent with previous studies do et al 2020 gao et al 2020 when the coulombic yield of the three devices is equal the detection time become shorter with an increase in the current density and when the current density is equal the detection time correspondingly shorten with the reduction of coulombic yield the results from chang et al 2004 showed that the detection time for a bod of 100 mg l was 60 min when the current density was 968 ma m2 but the detection time for a bod of 78 mg l reached 10 h when the current density was 222 ma m2 peixoto et al 2011 modin and wilen 2012 found in the research on bod sensor it had taken 5 and 20 h to obtain coulombic yield of approximately 20 and 40 c respectively even further the lower ce suggests the less coulombic yield generated by the conversion of cod correspondingly the power density increases and the detection time decreases for example when the cod was 200 mg l in this study the coulombic yield of cm3 3 68 c was approximately one third that of cm2 9 81 c and cm3 10 96 c meanwhile the current density of cm3 0 662 a m3 was about twice that of cm1 0 345 a m3 and half that of cm2 1 405 a m3 therefore the detection time of cm3 was the shortest followed by cm2 and cm1 sensitivity refers to the change in the electrical signal caused by a cod change in device volume di lorenzo et al 2014 as formula 3 3 s e n s i t i v i t y δ q δ c v where δq c is the change in the coulombic yield δc mg l is the change in the anolyte content and v l is the volume of the anode biosensors should show suitable sensitivity to avoid the risk of false positives caused by too high or too low sensitivities chouler and lorenzo 2015 as shown in fig 8 a the sensitivity decreases from 0 056 or 0 160 to 0 020 c mg with the increase of s from 0 75 to 1 5 the core principle of improving the sensitivity is to improve the efficiency of eab in capturing electrons from organic matter jiang et al 2018 which is consistent with ce as the indicator of mfc electron recovery efficiency so the sensitivity has the same change with ce that decreases with increasing s value furthermore ce is influenced by eab and ntb both on the anode and the cathode in anode area ce increase with higher eab and decrease with higher ntb for competing the substrate and electron with eab it is clear that when s equals to 0 75 1 and 1 5 the eab ntb is 0 1 0 4 and 1 1 respectively which indicates the dominant position of ntb hence it is supposed that ce is more susceptible to ntb in the cathode aera the higher ntb and eab means more effective extracellular electron transport smaller internal resistance and higher current hence ce increases with higher ntb and eab and the relative of ntb and eab decreases with the increase of s therefore ce decreases with the increase of s consequently the different steady state of eab and ntb under different structural parameters s reflected in the sensitivity some additional results could be found by comparing the cw mfc biosensor in this study with other biosensors in the table 2 firstly the larger detection ranges in this study were found than the mfc biosensors that also use coulombic yield as the detection signal mainly because of much smaller volume and limit eab enrichment on anodes of the latter secondly the detection time were shorter than biosensors using the voltage and potential signals at the cod concentrations of 50 200 mg l thirdly in terms of accuracy higher r 2 demonstrated that coulombic yield is more comprehensive to reflect the influent organic matter concentration than voltage and potential finally higher sensitivity were also found when compared with the study by modin and wilen 2012 which may be due to the difference of eab biomass 4 4 biosensing performance optimization as the accumulation of time scales coulombic yield also covers unstable stages such as initial ascent stage in which microorganisms gradually adapt and organic matter rapidly diffuse or adsorbed and gradual decay stages in which microorganisms get into the endogenous respiration gao et al 2020 except for the stable period of the electrical output it is necessary to optimize the electrical signals and limit them to stable stages thus the concept of stable voltage coulombic yield qs was proposed which is defined as the cumulative coulombic yield during the period from initial stability to initial decline in output voltage the cutoff point for qs is set as δu δt 1 mv min and δu δt 0 5 mv min according to the variation trend of voltage take cm1 as the example fig s3 the voltage of cm1 was 211 mv at 200 mg l cod correspondingly the δu δt equals to 0 6 mv min which is lower than 1 mv min meaning the stable output voltage and the time point could be as the starting time of the record when the voltage was 107 mv the δu δt equals to 8 mv min meaning unstable output voltage and the time point could be as the end recording the coulombic yield during this two time points is qs and the time in this period is the stable detection time the regression equation fig 7 c of qs and the cod concentration variable showed that all the r 2 optimized were higher than 0 9 and maintained a good response effect after optimization the detection time of the three groups of devices was reduced by almost half and even down to 1 17 h s 1 5 within the concentration range of 0 200 mg l similarly the sensitivity and r 2 decreased by approximately 20 and 2 respectively in general the biosensing performance of the three structures could be put to good use according to the different requirements of cod detection to be specific cm1 s 0 75 or cm2 s 1 structures would be recommended when the cod concentration of the influent is high 400 1000 mg l the cm2 structure is more appropriate for the limited depth of the cw and while cm1 structure is highly recommended if higher sensitivity is desired but for the lower cod concentration 400 mg l the cm3 s 1 5 structure is the better choice with shorter detection time and lower risk of false positives while in practical application when the waste water enters the cw mfc for a span time the generated electrical signals like coulombic yield were recorded and calculated and then was taken into the calibration curve to obtain cod this is the case the cw mfc is a monitoring tool to reflect the real time cod also the cw mfc is able to be used as an alarm tool the alarm will be activated when the real time coulombic yield exceeds the values reflecting the cod threshold setting in advance 5 conclusion the cw mfc biosensor with different structural parameters s can achieve good electrical signal response to the cod stable voltage coulombic yield was proposed to be an optimized electrical signal and able to shorten the detection time by 70 without affecting the detection effect ntb on the anodes would fight for substrate with eab and compete for electrons with anode thus decreased the ce and disturbed the stability of the output voltage which is the reason that using the coulombic yield as the detection signal is better and a linear correlation between the structural parameter s and the steady state coefficient eab ntb both on the anode and cathode was supposed to explain the differences in the electricity generation and sensing performance of different structural devices the practical application of the cw mfc biosensor need to be further verified for the real complex wastewater due to the single carbon source used in this study in addition big data analysis and cloud computing technology including corresponding data processing and cloud

16344,ultrafiltration is an advanced water treatment process which performs poorly in the removal of small molecule organic pollutants and is susceptible to irreversible membrane fouling in this study a new carbon nanotube cross linked polypyrrole composite ultrafiltration membrane cnt ppy pvdf was fabricated and exhibited excellent conductivity hydrophilicity and permeability in a novel electro filtration activated peroxydisulfate pds system efap for cathodic electrochemical activation of pds the efap showed satisfactory performance in removal of series of small molecule organic pollutants i e carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole phenol diclofenac and stable removal ratio remaining above 90 after 20 operating cycles further study proved the electric field could effectively protect the cathodic cnt ppy pvdf membrane from oxidative damage through continual free electrons injection besides the efap achieved up to 95 flux recovery and 80 reduction of irreversible membrane fouling bovine serum albumin as the model foulant moreover experiments confirmed that the in situ generated oh so4 and 1o2 were the main reactive oxygen species contributing to small organics removal while the irreversible membrane fouling mitigation was mainly due to the electrical repulsion so4 and oh rather than 1o2 this new type of efap may provide a promising and sustainable approach in organic

treatment by interception of multiple contaminants from water werber 2016 ultrafiltration uf membranes are highly developed due to its satisfactory water permeability as well as efficient rejection of macromolecule substances however uf performs poorly in the removal of small molecule organic pollutants smop and is susceptible to irreversible membrane fouling kang and gao 2014 kim et al 2018 as a result various coupling technologies based on uf have been reported acero et al 2012 the integration of advanced oxidation processes aops with uf has been notable due to the capability to oxidize or even mineralize organic matter as well as mitigate membrane fouling simutaneously through the in situ generated reactive species on the surface of membrane pan et al 2019 compared with oh 2 8 v so4 2 5 3 1 v exhibits higher oxidative selectivity wider ph range and better diffusion of radicals in bulk solution due to the much longer half life of so4 30 40 μs than oh 10 3 μs wang and wang 2018 extensive studies have shown that uf coupling with so4 based advanced oxidation processes saops was a highly effective method for removing smop and mitigating membrane fouling in a coupled filtration process a surface coating or matrix doping metal on the membrane is the most common method for achieving the in situ activation of persulfate ps including peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate when water containing ps passes through the membrane wang et al 2019c wu et al 2019 although such method are very efficient for ps activation during filtration metal leakage risks may cause secondary contamination and reduce system durability li et al 2021 therefore alternative approaches are required to effectively activate ps without the risk of metal leakage meanwhile carbon based materials as metal free catalysts are environmentally friendly for activating ps cheng et al 2021 however the ps and in situ generated reactive oxygen species ros including so4 oh and 1o2 will destroy the carbon based material s surface structure as well as functional groups after several cycles service and lost it s activity our previous research proved that an electroactive ps system with activated carbon fiber as cathode could effectively generate ros for degrading organic matters while the cathodic activated carbon fiber with continuously free electron injection could be kept from surface damage through cathodic protection mechanism significantly improving the carbon materials durability liu et al 2018 therefore electroactivation of ps with cathodic carbon materials as membrane material may be a better option in oxidation filtration process due to the high electronic conductivity and efficient activation capability of ps carbon nanotubes cnt may be a suitable conductive layer for ultrafiltration membrane surfaces in an electro filtration activated persulfate efap system baughman et al 2002 in addition a conductive membrane may also be benefical for mitigating membrane fouling as electrostatic repulsion force can reduce the deposition of charged pollutants on a conductive membrane surface wang et al 2019b 2021 liu et al 2020a an efap system should theoretically be effective in removing smop and mitigating membrane fouling and thus be a good alternative for emerging organic contaminants control in water however to the best of our knowledge the integration of filtration and electrochemical acitvation of ps for the removal of smop and the mitigation of ultrafiltration membrane fouling has not been reported in this study a novel efap system was systematically investigated as follows i a hydrophilic conductive composite ultrafiltration membrane was fabricated ii the performance of the efap system for removing smop was studied iii the anti fouling property

γ f 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of membranes scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx images of pvdf and cp pvdf membranes are shown in fig 1 a the surface morphology of the pvdf membrane was relatively smooth while the cp pvdf membrane presented a cross linked porous structure of spherical particles of ca 5 µm diameter caused by the cnt ppy coating the c and n in the cp pvdf membrane are visualized in the edx images in fig 1 a and were assumed to indicate successful polymerization of ppy comparing the cross sectional images of the virgin and modified membranes the additional coating layer is clearly visible on the cp pvdf membrane surface as an discernable skin over the finger like porous layer the water contact angles ca of various membranes are shown in fig 1 b the ca of a material is associated with the material s surface energy a low ca generally indicates that it has a high surface energy and strong hydrophilicity fig 1 b shows that the ca of pristine pvdf membrane was 85 5 4 3 which was lower than the c pvdf membrane 128 2 7 1 implying that the presence of cnt decreased the hydrophilicity of the membrane p pvdf membrane reduced the ca to 46 5 5 5 suggesting the membrane became more hydrophilic than the control finally addition of conductive particles mixed ppy and cnt resulted in a cp pvdf membrane with hydrophobicity comparable to the control having a ca of 75 5 7 1 this ca is between those for c pvdf and p pvdf which is reasonable since the hydrophobic cnt and hydrophilic ppy were mixed in the final cp pvdf composite membrane sheet resistance results for the various membranes are illustrated in fig 1 b surface sheet resistance of the pristine pvdf membrane was showing that this membrane exhibited the properties of an insulator after applying the conductive materials the membranes acted as conductors with the sheet resistance of c pvdf approximating to ca 95 5 ω and p pvdf to ca 258 17 ω again the composite cp pvdf membrane had an intermediate sheet resistance of ca 198 3 28 ω thus the cnt ppy layer afforded good electrical conductivity turning the pvdf membrane coupon into a possible cathode for an efap system fig 1 c shows the pure water flux results for the various membranes the coating on the p pvdf membrane increased water flux 123 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared with the pristine pvdf control 95 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the water permeability of a membrane material is related to its surface energy a lower surface energy decreases its hydrophilicity and pure water flux due to the expected increased resistance to liquid entering the membrane pores xu et al 2019 thus water flux results can be due to differences in membrane surface hydrophilicity the flux of c pvdf composite membrane 81 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was lower than the pristine pvdf membrane loading with low hydrophilicity cnt reduced the surface energy of the composite membrane increasing its hydrophobicity moreover the nano particle cnts also physically blocked the membrane pores further decreasing the c pvdf membrane pure water flux the flux of the cp pvdf membrane 95 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was higher than the pristine pvdf membrane primarily because hydrophilicity was improved by the addition of ppy increasing the surface energy of the composite membrane thus the addition of ppy and cnt particles can improve membrane pure water flux a simple ultrafiltration test of the cp pvdf membrane coupon was carried out using pure water for 36 h the water turbidity was linearly related to the concentration of cnt ppy in a low concentration range fig s2 a which enabled to check if the problem of ppy cnt leakage existed in this system by observing the change of the permeate water turbidity fig s2 b shows the variation of permeating water turbidity as an indicator of suspended matter content in the water the turbidity of the outlet water did not change significantly when the system operated continuously for 36 h indicating that the conductive layer on the membrane surface had not leaked significantly during operation 3 2 the performance of efap system 3 2 1 organic contaminants removal performance the performance of the efap filtration system was evaluated in terms of removal rate for different organic contaminants sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac dcf nitrobenzene nb and phenol were chosen as typical pollutants representing pharmaceutical and personal care products and industrial chemical intermediates their removal rate by the efap system was evaluated fig 2 a the efap system had a significantly better removal efficiency than the simple membrane filtration system for all these pollutants suggesting it has promising applications in the removal of persistent organic matter the optimum for each of these key parameters was selected as shown in figs s3 s6 pds dosage initial cbz concentration current intensity and initial ph clearly influenced the result the cbz removal performance was systematically analyzed fig s7 toc analysis was shown in fig s8 the mineralization ability could be confirmed by comparing the toc removal among different systems the toc removal ability was significantly enhanced in efap system compared with the ef na2so4 system toc removal was 44 5 three to four times higher than the other system xie et al 2021 so the efap system achieved the high mineralization ability in addition we found that the toc removal differences were not obvious between alone pvdf cp pvdf system and pds pvdf pds cp pvdf system this result indicated that the mineralization ability was attributed to the generation of ros through the electric activation pds since sustainable performance is essential for a membrane filtration system reuse efficiency was investigated over 20 cycles fig 2 b for the pds pvdf system a constant cbz removal ratio approximating to 33 was observed suggesting pvdf could be a good candidate material for strong oxidant environments the cp pvdf membrane in the efap filtration system exhibited a constant and satisfactory removal ratio of over 95 by contrast without the electrical assistance cbz removal in the pds cp pvdf membrane system dropped from 69 to 53 at the end it was assumed this difference in pds cp pvdf performance with and without electric field was due to the cathodic protection effect of the external electric field on the membrane cathode which provided the electrons for the active layer after reacting with s2o8 2 liu et al 2020b the change of groups in raw and used membranes under different operating conditions was also explored by ft ir fig s9 the membrane used with pds showed a change in the peak at 1725 cm 1 corresponding to c o groups xu et al 2019 differing to the membrane in the efap system the latter being similar to the control this assumption was confirmed by the nearly constant membrane morphology of the conductive activation layer which exhibited no noticeable change after 20 cycles in the efap system fig s10 this suggested that the surface cnt ppy layer was oxidized to a degree in the pds system but was less so under the efap system 3 2 2 anti fouling performance membrane flux recovery ratio and fouling ratio were evaluated fig 3 a shows the normalized flux variation with feed solution containing 100 mg l 1 bsa the flux of bsa in the pvdf and cp pvdf systems decreased rapidly in the initial stages before stabilizing at ca 41 after 20 min in the ef na2so4 system na2so4 as the electrolyte the flux decline slowed and stabilized at ca 48 after 30 min possible reasons include firstly the fig s11 shows that the zeta potential of bsa was negative at the examined ph ca 7 0 during the whole fouling experiment the external electric field increased the electrical repulsion between the surface of the cp pvdf membrane and the negatively charged bsa which slowed down the initial accumulation of bsa on the membrane surface wang et al 2019a secondly the cnt ppy layer was strongly hydrophilic and a hydration layer formed on the membrane surface would be expected to slow down accumulation of bsa thirdly the tiny bubbles generated on the membrane surface following the reaction at the cathode as per eq 17 may alleviate the adsorption and deposition of bsa on the surface 17 2 h 2 e h 2 flux decline was slowest in the efap system stabilizing at 58 of the initial flux after 35 min possible reasons include i the effects of electrical repulsion ii improved hydrophilicity of the cnt ppy layer iii ros generated by activated pds oxidizing bsa into substances with smaller molecular weight bsa particle size increased due to agglomeration leading to increased giwf tot zhao et al 2020 and iv the efap system had self cleaning capability the generated ros weakening the bonds between bsa and the membrane as shown in fig s12 fig 3 b shows the anti fouling behavior and rejection of bsa in the various membrane filtration systems all four systems exhibited evidence of fouling flux recovery fr was lowest in the pvdf system 71 anti fouling performance was enhanced by the cnt ppy modification and an external electric field after a chemical cleaning of the efap system flux recovery reached 95 much higher than the 71 of the pvdf only system table s1 shows the flux recovery ratios of the different membranes suffering from bsa fouling doping modification during membrane development generally led to relatively low flux recovery and different operating conditions improved anti fouling performance the efap filtration system gave the most promising performance and is most suitable for water treatment applications furthermore the efap system reduced the total fouling ratio and was only 39 after 60 min by contrast among four systems had small differences in rr and the improvement of anti performance could be attributed to the reduction in rir in the efap system the rir was only 2 in the efap system which were significantly lower than in other systems the main reasons were firstly the membrane filtration system achieved self cleaning capability via aops wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 the strong oxidizing ros generated around the cnt ppy layer had a cleaning effect on blocked cnt pores thus reducing the rir according to fig s12 secondly under the efap system the structure of the bsa fouling layer on the membrane surface was looser and easier to remove decreasing the rr as seen in the sem images section 3 3 5 bsa rejection was improved in the efap system fig 3 b the increase from 55 2 in the pvdf only system to 72 6 in the cp pvdf system showed that the cnt layer provided enhanced interception and rejection of bsa rejection also improved to a degree in the e na2so4 cp pvdf system which can be attributed to the electrical repulsion but the greatest bsa rejection 81 was observed in the efap system in addition to the above the bsa size testing described in section 3 3 2 demonstrates that the agglomerated bsa in the efap system had significantly larger hydraulic radii than in other systems and was probably responsible for the better rejection 3 3 mechanisms analysis 3 3 1 analysis of cbz removal mechanisms the concentration of pds had a direct effect on cbz removal the concentration change of pds in feed water are shown in fig s13 a decomposition of pds reached 55 in the efap system after 40 min which was higher than the other systems this result indicated that the current had an effect on pds decomposition generating more ros and improving cbz removal ros played a vital role in the efap system they were identified using various scavengers meoh tba and ffa were used to tentatively identify the ros by comparing changes in cbz removal rate it has been reported that so4 and oh can be scavenged by meoh k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 respectively oh can be scavenged by tba k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 the ffa can act as a scavenger for 1o2 k 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 by comparing with the meoh chen et al 2020 the results of quenching experiments are shown in fig s13 b the efap system could remove over 96 cbz in 30 min the addition of meoh tba and ffa had inhibitory effects on this system efficient oxidation of cbz due to the decomposition of pds and the electrical activation of pds was inhibited in the presence of ffa and the inhibition effect of ffa 6 mm was higher than the meoh 100 mm these results indicated that the presence of so4 oh and 1o2 were possible in the efap system therefore electron paramagnetic resonance epr was further used to confirm the ros in the process of efpa as shown in fig 4 a a clear signal of dmpo so4 adducts and dmpo oh adducts were both observed demonstrating the presence of so4 and oh in the efap system in addition fig 4 b clearly reveals a 1 1 1 triplet signal characteristic peaks of temp 1o2 further ascertaining that 1o2 was indeed generated in the efap system it was speculated that the reaction process of ros was as in eqs 18 23 duan et al 2015 li et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 18 c n t p d s a b s o r b c n t p d s 19 s 2 o 8 2 e s o 4 s o 4 2 20 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 o h h 21 s o 4 o h h s o 5 22 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o h s o 5 h s o 4 23 2 h s o 5 2 o h 2 e 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 o 1 o 2 3 3 2 influence of ros on membrane fouling mitigation the production of so4 oh and 1o2 has been considered as the mechanism of cbz removal in the efap process therefore we further investigated the effects of so4 oh and 1o2 on membrane fouling mitigation by radical scavenger experiments as shown in fig 5 a the addition of nb 10 mm meoh 100 mm and ffa 6 mm aggravated the membrane fouling respectively flux decline was stabilizing at 54 50 and 49 of the initial flux after 35 min when adding nb meoh and ffa these observations suggested that the so4 and oh played a dominating role in membrane fouling mitigation while 1o2 had a smaller impact in order to further explore the effects of so4 oh and 1o2 on membrane fouling the results of membrane fouling in the radical scavenger experiments were shown in fig 5 b the scavenger experiments results showed that the scavengers had less influence of reversible and the irreversible fouling was the major factors for membrane fouling mitigation in the efap system furthermore comparison of the scavenger experiment results illustrated that the so4 and oh were the major role in the form of irreversible membrane fouling mitigation 3 3 3 influence of efap system on bsa properties fig 6 a shows the changes in bsa hydraulic radius in the feed water of different systems bsa radius did not change significantly remaining at ca 4 2 nm in the pvdf only and cp pvdf systems after filtration when dc power was applied na2so4 as electrolyte bsa hydraulic radius reached 8 9 nm this may be explained by firstly the addition of na partially neutralizing the negative charge on the surface of the bsa which reduced electrostatic repulsion and caused aggregation of bsa particles karkooti et al 2020 secondly the na promoted dehydration around the bsa reducing resistance between hydration layers and promoting bsa aggregation li et al 2020 thus the hydraulic radius of bsa was increased in the feed water compared with the filtration only system without addition of an electrolyte after adding pds the radius increased significantly to 1 6 µm which was higher than the standard particle size this may be due firstly to the pds being activated to produce so4 and oh which had a strong oxidizing effect large bsa molecules were oxidized to smaller molecules with more superficial unsaturated bonds agglomeration of these smaller molecules then led to the formation of larger bsa particles zhao et al 2020 secondly na neutralized the negative charge on the surface of bsa reducing electrostatic repulsion while the resistance of hydration layers on the bsa surface was reduced by the dehydration effect of na thus bsa particle size increased to the micron level and clearly differed from other systems possible agglomeration mechanisms are shown in fig s14 the fluorescence matter had a significant effect on membrane fouling three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra were used to observe changes in bsa under various processes fig 6 b f bsa solution exhibited two major peaks a ex em 278 340 and b ex em 224 340 attributable to tryptophan and tyrosine the intensity of a and b significantly reduced after filtration most notably under the efap system the fluorophores may have been oxidized by the so4 and oh generated in efap system resulting in partial quenching of the fluorescence cheng et al 2018 transmission electron microscopy tem images of bsa are shown in fig 7 bsa presented a thin film and sheet structure in the pvdf and cp pvdf systems while edx analysis demonstrated the presence of the elements c s n and o thus normal bsa particles exhibited no significant agglomeration however in the e na2so4 cp pvdf system bsa showed overlapping structures fig 7 c and na was observed by edx which confirmed that na was adsorbed onto the bsa during the neutralization of the negative charge on the surface the same result was observed in the efap system agglomeration of bsa in a chain configuration with clear edges was observed fig 7 d this was consistent with the hydraulic radius data and confirmed that bsa agglomeration was the main reason for the increase in hydraulic radii in summary bsa underwent significant agglomeration the hydraulic radius increased from the nanometer to micrometer range and its morphology changed from flake like to chain like due to its fluorophores being attacked by ros 3 3 4 interface free energy analysis the process of membrane fouling mainly involves the cohesion of foulant on a membrane surface and its deposition as a fouling layer according to the xdlvo theory the physico chemical interactions of bsa and membrane can be assessed by analysis of the interface free energy subhi et al 2012 the free energy between the membrane and the foulant and between foulant and foulant reflects the membrane fouling process apolar and polar surface tensions of probe liquids are shown in table s3 table s4 shows the membrane surface contact angle of various probe liquids before and after fouling in different systems membrane surface tension was also calculated under these systems table s5 the electron donor components γ of the foulant and membrane were clearly higher than the electron acceptor components γ in the various systems the interaction between membrane surface and bsa is shown in table 1 in the form of free energy the giwf ab value was higher than giwf lw in the different systems and free energy values were negative indicating that giwf ab was dominant and the interaction was attractive in the initial fouling stage when bsa was deposited on the membrane surface lee et al 2007 the giwf tot value was highest in the efap system 10 23 mj m 2 which led to a reduction in foulant adhered to the surface lw free energy values were negative and ab free energy values were positive within bsa table 1 showing that lw interactions were attractive and ab interactions were repulsive within the bsa after the fouling layer had formed the gfwf tot value was highest 17 06 mj m 2 in the efap filtration system which would weaken the aggregation effect between bsa and the surface fouling layer and reduce reversible fouling 3 4 fouling layer analysis sem images of the fouling membrane surface before and after chemical cleaning of different systems are shown in fig 8 the bsa structure of the fouling layer differed under different operating conditions in pvdf and cp pvdf systems the layer had a relatively compact structure as bsa was deposited on the membrane surface by contrast the fouling layer was looser in the filtration system with an external power supply which would be easier to remove and would give a higher flux recovery ratio the level of fouling differed between the e na2so4 cp pvdf and efap systems for reasons consistent with the principles of membrane fouling fig 8 g j show sem images of the membrane surface after a simple chemical clean the surface cnt ppy layer was cleaner under the efap system consistent with its efficient flux recovery ratio the lower rir may have made fouling easier to remove 3 5 energy consumption energy consumption is an important issue in membrane filtration coupled with sr aops the energy consumption of pvdf filtration cp pvdf filtration e na2so4 cp pvdf and efap was 0 3125 0 2978 0 1798 kwh m 3 and 0 1193 kwh m 3 respectively when using 2 3 ma cm 2 current intensity fig s15 so the efap system required less than half as much energy to mitigate membrane fouling and remove cbz demonstrating favorable energy consumption 3 6 the performance of efap system in real world water samples evaluation of the performance of the efap system in real world water samples was essential surface water was collected from the jialing river in chongqing and along with tap water water quality parameters shown in table s6 was used to prepare simulated wastewater which were passed through 0 45 µm membrane filters before use we tested if the efap system could remove the organic matter in the actual water body as shown in the fig s16 the efap system had a good removal performance on the different organic matters in the surface water and tap water moreover bsa flux decline in surface water was not noticeably different from ultrapure water in the efap system fig s17 flux decline was slower in the tap water this could be attributed to chlorine ions in tap water which may be transformed to active chlorine and oxidize the bsa surface the slightly faster flux decline observed in surface water is consistent with previous reports it can be explained by inorganic matter sio2 mitigating the deposition of bsa on the membrane surface tian et al 2013 zhao et al 2021 thus the efap system is shown to perform satisfactorily with real world water samples 4 conclusions in this study the effect of efap filtration systems on membrane fouling mitigation and organic matter removal were systematically investigated the cp pvdf membrane acted as a cathode and activated pds to generate so4 oh and 1o2 in the efap system which effectively mitigated membrane fouling and oxidized cbz and the surface active layer could be protected as cathode by electron injection the efap system was observed better than ef na2so4 system in membrane fouling mitigation in the efap system the agglomeration of bsa was caused by the attack of ros including so4 oh and 1o2 which led to an increase in hydraulic radius this attack also increased the free energies between foulant membrane and foulant foulant and resulted in adhesion and deposition being reduced total membrane fouling was thus mitigated producing a looser fouling layer which was easier to remove flux recovery ratio was significantly improved and a cleaner surface was obtained after simple chemical cleaning this coupled system will be an effective method to improve the performance and durability of membrane purification technology

16344,ultrafiltration is an advanced water treatment process which performs poorly in the removal of small molecule organic pollutants and is susceptible to irreversible membrane fouling in this study a new carbon nanotube cross linked polypyrrole composite ultrafiltration membrane cnt ppy pvdf was fabricated and exhibited excellent conductivity hydrophilicity and permeability in a novel electro filtration activated peroxydisulfate pds system efap for cathodic electrochemical activation of pds the efap showed satisfactory performance in removal of series of small molecule organic pollutants i e carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole phenol diclofenac and stable removal ratio remaining above 90 after 20 operating cycles further study proved the electric field could effectively protect the cathodic cnt ppy pvdf membrane from oxidative damage through continual free electrons injection besides the efap achieved up to 95 flux recovery and 80 reduction of irreversible membrane fouling bovine serum albumin as the model foulant moreover experiments confirmed that the in situ generated oh so4 and 1o2 were the main reactive oxygen species contributing to small organics removal while the irreversible membrane fouling mitigation was mainly due to the electrical repulsion so4 and oh rather than 1o2 this new type of efap may provide a promising and sustainable approach in organic

macromolecule substances however uf performs poorly in the removal of small molecule organic pollutants smop and is susceptible to irreversible membrane fouling kang and gao 2014 kim et al 2018 as a result various coupling technologies based on uf have been reported acero et al 2012 the integration of advanced oxidation processes aops with uf has been notable due to the capability to oxidize or even mineralize organic matter as well as mitigate membrane fouling simutaneously through the in situ generated reactive species on the surface of membrane pan et al 2019 compared with oh 2 8 v so4 2 5 3 1 v exhibits higher oxidative selectivity wider ph range and better diffusion of radicals in bulk solution due to the much longer half life of so4 30 40 μs than oh 10 3 μs wang and wang 2018 extensive studies have shown that uf coupling with so4 based advanced oxidation processes saops was a highly effective method for removing smop and mitigating membrane fouling in a coupled filtration process a surface coating or matrix doping metal on the membrane is the most common method for achieving the in situ activation of persulfate ps including peroxymonosulfate and peroxydisulfate when water containing ps passes through the membrane wang et al 2019c wu et al 2019 although such method are very efficient for ps activation during filtration metal leakage risks may cause secondary contamination and reduce system durability li et al 2021 therefore alternative approaches are required to effectively activate ps without the risk of metal leakage meanwhile carbon based materials as metal free catalysts are environmentally friendly for activating ps cheng et al 2021 however the ps and in situ generated reactive oxygen species ros including so4 oh and 1o2 will destroy the carbon based material s surface structure as well as functional groups after several cycles service and lost it s activity our previous research proved that an electroactive ps system with activated carbon fiber as cathode could effectively generate ros for degrading organic matters while the cathodic activated carbon fiber with continuously free electron injection could be kept from surface damage through cathodic protection mechanism significantly improving the carbon materials durability liu et al 2018 therefore electroactivation of ps with cathodic carbon materials as membrane material may be a better option in oxidation filtration process due to the high electronic conductivity and efficient activation capability of ps carbon nanotubes cnt may be a suitable conductive layer for ultrafiltration membrane surfaces in an electro filtration activated persulfate efap system baughman et al 2002 in addition a conductive membrane may also be benefical for mitigating membrane fouling as electrostatic repulsion force can reduce the deposition of charged pollutants on a conductive membrane surface wang et al 2019b 2021 liu et al 2020a an efap system should theoretically be effective in removing smop and mitigating membrane fouling and thus be a good alternative for emerging organic contaminants control in water however to the best of our knowledge the integration of filtration and electrochemical acitvation of ps for the removal of smop and the mitigation of ultrafiltration membrane fouling has not been reported in this study a novel efap system was systematically investigated as follows i a hydrophilic conductive composite ultrafiltration membrane was fabricated ii the performance of the efap system for removing smop was studied iii the anti fouling property

shanghai china and the positive electrode is connected to the upper titanium plate diameter 6 4 cm of the reactor the distance between the membrane surface and the upper titanium plate is 0 8 cm the system was initiated by adding pds in dc mode samples were taken from the effluent water tank in some regular time intervals the analytical methods were shown in the supplementary information for the recycle texts the pure water is filtered 5 min aimed to wash off the adsorbed cbz and salt on membrane the membrane was reused 20 times cbz as probe without any further processing the smop removal

temperature room in a refrigerator at 25 c for later use the bsa solution was filtered by 0 45 um membrane before testing the flux decay curve of the system was measured at 0 1 mpa for 60 min and the permeation flux jf was recorded then the fouling membrane was immersed in sodium dodecyl sulfonate solution 0 1 m and stirred 300 rpm for 10 min after the chemical cleaning the pure water flux of cleaned membrane was tested again and denoted as j c in order to better understand the membrane fouling situation the flux recovery ratio and fouling ratio were calculated by the following formula 3 r

the surface morphology of the pvdf membrane was relatively smooth while the cp pvdf membrane presented a cross linked porous structure of spherical particles of ca 5 µm diameter caused by the cnt ppy coating the c and n in the cp pvdf membrane are visualized in the edx images in fig 1 a and were assumed to indicate successful polymerization of ppy comparing the cross sectional images of the virgin and modified membranes the additional coating layer is clearly visible on the cp pvdf membrane surface as an discernable skin over the finger like porous layer the water contact angles ca of various membranes are shown in fig 1 b the ca of a material is associated with the material s surface energy a low ca generally indicates that it has a high surface energy and strong hydrophilicity fig 1 b shows that the ca of pristine pvdf membrane was 85 5 4 3 which was lower than the c pvdf membrane 128 2 7 1 implying that the presence of cnt decreased the hydrophilicity of the membrane p pvdf membrane reduced the ca to 46 5 5 5 suggesting the membrane became more hydrophilic than the control finally addition of conductive particles mixed ppy and cnt resulted in a cp pvdf membrane with hydrophobicity comparable to the control having a ca of 75 5 7 1 this ca is between those for c pvdf and p pvdf which is reasonable since the hydrophobic cnt and hydrophilic ppy were mixed in the final cp pvdf composite membrane sheet resistance results for the various membranes are illustrated in fig 1 b surface sheet resistance of the pristine pvdf membrane was showing that this membrane exhibited the properties of an insulator after applying the conductive materials the membranes acted as conductors with the sheet resistance of c pvdf approximating to ca 95 5 ω and p pvdf to ca 258 17 ω again the composite cp pvdf membrane had an intermediate sheet resistance of ca 198 3 28 ω thus the cnt ppy layer afforded good electrical conductivity turning the pvdf membrane coupon into a possible cathode for an efap system fig 1 c shows the pure water flux results for the various membranes the coating on the p pvdf membrane increased water flux 123 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 compared with the pristine pvdf control 95 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the water permeability of a membrane material is related to its surface energy a lower surface energy decreases its hydrophilicity and pure water flux due to the expected increased resistance to liquid entering the membrane pores xu et al 2019 thus water flux results can be due to differences in membrane surface hydrophilicity the flux of c pvdf composite membrane 81 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was lower than the pristine pvdf membrane loading with low hydrophilicity cnt reduced the surface energy of the composite membrane increasing its hydrophobicity moreover the nano particle cnts also physically blocked the membrane pores further decreasing the c pvdf membrane pure water flux the flux of the cp pvdf membrane 95 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was higher than the pristine pvdf membrane primarily because hydrophilicity was improved by the addition of ppy increasing the surface energy of the composite membrane thus the addition of ppy and cnt particles can improve membrane pure water flux a simple ultrafiltration test of the cp pvdf membrane coupon was carried out using pure water for 36 h the water turbidity was linearly related to the concentration of cnt ppy in a low concentration range fig s2 a which enabled to check if the problem of ppy cnt leakage existed in this system by observing the change of the permeate water turbidity fig s2 b shows the variation of permeating water turbidity as an indicator of suspended matter content in the water the turbidity of the outlet water did not change significantly when the system operated continuously for 36 h indicating that the conductive layer on the membrane surface had not leaked significantly during operation 3 2 the performance of efap system 3 2 1 organic contaminants removal performance the performance of the efap filtration system was evaluated in terms of removal rate for different organic contaminants sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac dcf nitrobenzene nb and phenol were chosen as typical pollutants representing pharmaceutical and personal care products and industrial chemical intermediates their removal rate by the efap system was evaluated fig 2 a the efap system had a significantly better removal efficiency than the simple membrane filtration system for all these pollutants suggesting it has promising applications in the removal of persistent organic matter the optimum for each of these key parameters was selected as shown in figs s3 s6 pds dosage initial cbz concentration current intensity and initial ph clearly influenced the result the cbz removal performance was systematically analyzed fig s7 toc analysis was shown in fig s8 the mineralization ability could be confirmed by comparing the toc removal among different systems the toc removal ability was significantly enhanced in efap system compared with the ef na2so4 system toc removal was 44 5 three to four times higher than the other system xie et al 2021 so the efap system achieved the high mineralization ability in addition we found that the toc removal differences were not obvious between alone pvdf cp pvdf system and pds pvdf pds cp pvdf system this result indicated that the mineralization ability was attributed to the generation of ros through the electric activation pds since sustainable performance is essential for a membrane filtration system reuse efficiency was investigated over 20 cycles fig 2 b for the pds pvdf system a constant cbz removal ratio approximating to 33 was observed suggesting pvdf could be a good candidate material for strong oxidant environments the cp pvdf membrane in the efap filtration system exhibited a constant and satisfactory removal ratio of over 95 by contrast without the electrical assistance cbz removal in the pds cp pvdf membrane system dropped from 69 to 53 at the end it was assumed this difference in pds cp pvdf performance with and without electric field was due to the cathodic protection effect of the external electric field on the membrane cathode which provided the electrons for the active layer after reacting with s2o8 2 liu et al 2020b the change of groups in raw and used membranes under different operating conditions was also explored by ft ir fig s9 the membrane used with pds showed a change in the peak at 1725 cm 1 corresponding to c o groups xu et al 2019 differing to the membrane in the efap system the latter being similar to the control this assumption was confirmed by the nearly constant membrane morphology of the conductive activation layer which exhibited no noticeable change after 20 cycles in the efap system fig s10 this suggested that the surface cnt ppy layer was oxidized to a degree in the pds system but was less so under the efap system 3 2 2 anti fouling performance membrane flux recovery ratio and fouling ratio were evaluated fig 3 a shows the normalized flux variation with feed solution containing 100 mg l 1 bsa the flux of bsa in the pvdf and cp pvdf systems decreased rapidly in the initial stages before stabilizing at ca 41 after 20 min in the ef na2so4 system na2so4 as the electrolyte the flux decline slowed and stabilized at ca 48 after 30 min possible reasons include firstly the fig s11 shows that the zeta potential of bsa was negative at the examined ph ca 7 0 during the whole fouling experiment the external electric field increased the electrical repulsion between the surface of the cp pvdf membrane and the negatively charged bsa which slowed down the initial accumulation of bsa on the membrane surface wang et al 2019a secondly the cnt ppy layer was strongly hydrophilic and a hydration layer formed on the membrane surface would be expected to slow down accumulation of bsa thirdly the tiny bubbles generated on the membrane surface following the reaction at the cathode as per eq 17 may alleviate the adsorption and deposition of bsa on the surface 17 2 h 2 e h 2 flux decline was slowest in the efap system stabilizing at 58 of the initial flux after 35 min possible reasons include i the effects of electrical repulsion ii improved hydrophilicity of the cnt ppy layer iii ros generated by activated pds oxidizing bsa into substances with smaller molecular weight bsa particle size increased due to agglomeration leading to increased giwf tot zhao et al 2020 and iv the efap system had self cleaning capability the generated ros weakening the bonds between bsa and the membrane as shown in fig s12 fig 3 b shows the anti fouling behavior and rejection of bsa in the various membrane filtration systems all four systems exhibited evidence of fouling flux recovery fr was lowest in the pvdf system 71 anti fouling performance was enhanced by the cnt ppy modification and an external electric field after a chemical cleaning of the efap system flux recovery reached 95 much higher than the 71 of the pvdf only system table s1 shows the flux recovery ratios of the different membranes suffering from bsa fouling doping modification during membrane development generally led to relatively low flux recovery and different operating conditions improved anti fouling performance the efap filtration system gave the most promising performance and is most suitable for water treatment applications furthermore the efap system reduced the total fouling ratio and was only 39 after 60 min by contrast among four systems had small differences in rr and the improvement of anti performance could be attributed to the reduction in rir in the efap system the rir was only 2 in the efap system which were significantly lower than in other systems the main reasons were firstly the membrane filtration system achieved self cleaning capability via aops wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 the strong oxidizing ros generated around the cnt ppy layer had a cleaning effect on blocked cnt pores thus reducing the rir according to fig s12 secondly under the efap system the structure of the bsa fouling layer on the membrane surface was looser and easier to remove decreasing the rr as seen in the sem images section 3 3 5 bsa rejection was improved in the efap system fig 3 b the increase from 55 2 in the pvdf only system to 72 6 in the cp pvdf system showed that the cnt layer provided enhanced interception and rejection of bsa rejection also improved to a degree in the e na2so4 cp pvdf system which can be attributed to the electrical repulsion but the greatest bsa rejection 81 was observed in the efap system in addition to the above the bsa size testing described in section 3 3 2 demonstrates that the agglomerated bsa in the efap system had significantly larger hydraulic radii than in other systems and was probably responsible for the better rejection 3 3 mechanisms analysis 3 3 1 analysis of cbz removal mechanisms the concentration of pds had a direct effect on cbz removal the concentration change of pds in feed water are shown in fig s13 a decomposition of pds reached 55 in the efap system after 40 min which was higher than the other systems this result indicated that the current had an effect on pds decomposition generating more ros and improving cbz removal ros played a vital role in the efap system they were identified using various scavengers meoh tba and ffa were used to tentatively identify the ros by comparing changes in cbz removal rate it has been reported that so4 and oh can be scavenged by meoh k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and 3 2 106 m 1 s 1 respectively oh can be scavenged by tba k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 the ffa can act as a scavenger for 1o2 k 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 by comparing with the meoh chen et al 2020 the results of quenching experiments are shown in fig s13 b the efap system could remove over 96 cbz in 30 min the addition of meoh tba and ffa had inhibitory effects on this system efficient oxidation of cbz due to the decomposition of pds and the electrical activation of pds was inhibited in the presence of ffa and the inhibition effect of ffa 6 mm was higher than the meoh 100 mm these results indicated that the presence of so4 oh and 1o2 were possible in the efap system therefore electron paramagnetic resonance epr was further used to confirm the ros in the process of efpa as shown in fig 4 a a clear signal of dmpo so4 adducts and dmpo oh adducts were both observed demonstrating the presence of so4 and oh in the efap system in addition fig 4 b clearly reveals a 1 1 1 triplet signal characteristic peaks of temp 1o2 further ascertaining that 1o2 was indeed generated in the efap system it was speculated that the reaction process of ros was as in eqs 18 23 duan et al 2015 li et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 18 c n t p d s a b s o r b c n t p d s 19 s 2 o 8 2 e s o 4 s o 4 2 20 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 o h h 21 s o 4 o h h s o 5 22 s 2 o 8 2 h 2 o h s o 5 h s o 4 23 2 h s o 5 2 o h 2 e 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 o 1 o 2 3 3 2 influence of ros on membrane fouling mitigation the production of so4 oh and 1o2 has been considered as the mechanism of cbz removal in the efap process therefore we further investigated the effects of so4 oh and 1o2 on membrane fouling mitigation by radical scavenger experiments as shown in fig 5 a the addition of nb 10 mm meoh 100 mm and ffa 6 mm aggravated the membrane fouling respectively flux decline was stabilizing at 54 50 and 49 of the initial flux after 35 min when adding nb meoh and ffa these observations suggested that the so4 and oh played a dominating role in membrane fouling mitigation while 1o2 had a smaller impact in order to further explore the effects of so4 oh and 1o2 on membrane fouling the results of membrane fouling in the radical scavenger experiments were shown in fig 5 b the scavenger experiments results showed that the scavengers had less influence of reversible and the irreversible fouling was the major factors for membrane fouling mitigation in the efap system furthermore comparison of the scavenger experiment results illustrated that the so4 and oh were the major role in the form of irreversible membrane fouling mitigation 3 3 3 influence of efap system on bsa properties fig 6 a shows the changes in bsa hydraulic radius in the feed water of different systems bsa radius did not change significantly remaining at ca 4 2 nm in the pvdf only and cp pvdf systems after filtration when dc power was applied na2so4 as electrolyte bsa hydraulic radius reached 8 9 nm this may be explained by firstly the addition of na partially neutralizing the negative charge on the surface of the bsa which reduced electrostatic repulsion and caused aggregation of bsa particles karkooti et al 2020 secondly the na promoted dehydration around the bsa reducing resistance between hydration layers and promoting bsa aggregation li et al 2020 thus the hydraulic radius of bsa was increased in the feed water compared with the filtration only system without addition of an electrolyte after adding pds the radius increased significantly to 1 6 µm which was higher than the standard particle size this may be due firstly to the pds being activated to produce so4 and oh which had a strong oxidizing effect large bsa molecules were oxidized to smaller molecules with more superficial unsaturated bonds agglomeration of these smaller molecules then led to the formation of larger bsa particles zhao et al 2020 secondly na neutralized the negative charge on the surface of bsa reducing electrostatic repulsion while the resistance of hydration layers on the bsa surface was reduced by the dehydration effect of na thus bsa particle size increased to the micron level and clearly differed from other systems possible agglomeration mechanisms are shown in fig s14 the fluorescence matter had a significant effect on membrane fouling three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra were used to observe changes in bsa under various processes fig 6 b f bsa solution exhibited two major peaks a ex em 278 340 and b ex em 224 340 attributable to tryptophan and tyrosine the intensity of a and b significantly reduced after filtration most notably under the efap system the fluorophores may have been oxidized by the so4 and oh generated in efap system resulting in partial quenching of the fluorescence cheng et al 2018 transmission electron microscopy tem images of bsa are shown in fig 7 bsa presented a thin film and sheet structure in the pvdf and cp pvdf systems while edx analysis demonstrated the presence of the elements c s n and o thus normal bsa particles exhibited no significant agglomeration however in the e na2so4 cp pvdf system bsa showed overlapping structures fig 7 c and na was observed by edx which confirmed that na was adsorbed onto the bsa during the neutralization of the negative charge on the surface the same result was observed in the efap system agglomeration of bsa in a chain configuration with clear edges was observed fig 7 d this was consistent with the hydraulic radius data and confirmed that bsa agglomeration was the main reason for the increase in hydraulic radii in summary bsa underwent significant agglomeration the hydraulic radius increased from the nanometer to micrometer range and its morphology changed from flake like to chain like due to its fluorophores being attacked by ros 3 3 4 interface free energy analysis the process of membrane fouling mainly involves the cohesion of foulant on a membrane surface and its deposition as a fouling layer according to the xdlvo theory the physico chemical interactions of bsa and membrane can be assessed by analysis of the interface free energy subhi et al 2012 the free energy between the membrane and the foulant and between foulant and foulant reflects the membrane fouling process apolar and polar surface tensions of probe liquids are shown in table s3 table s4 shows the membrane surface contact angle of various probe liquids before and after fouling in different systems membrane surface tension was also calculated under these systems table s5 the electron donor components γ of the foulant and membrane were clearly higher than the electron acceptor components γ in the various systems the interaction between membrane surface and bsa is shown in table 1 in the form of free energy the giwf ab value was higher than giwf lw in the different systems and free energy values were negative indicating that giwf ab was dominant and the interaction was attractive in the initial fouling stage when bsa was deposited on the membrane surface lee et al 2007 the giwf tot value was highest in the efap system 10 23 mj m 2 which led to a reduction in foulant adhered to the surface lw free energy values were negative and ab free energy values were positive within bsa table 1 showing that lw interactions were attractive and ab interactions were repulsive within the bsa after the fouling layer had formed the gfwf tot value was highest 17 06 mj m 2 in the efap filtration system which would weaken the aggregation effect between bsa and the surface fouling layer and reduce reversible fouling 3 4 fouling layer analysis sem images of the fouling membrane surface before and after chemical cleaning of different systems are shown in fig 8 the bsa structure of the fouling layer differed under different operating conditions in pvdf and cp pvdf systems the layer had a relatively compact structure as bsa was deposited on the membrane surface by contrast the fouling layer was looser in the filtration system with an external power supply which would be easier to remove and would give a higher flux recovery ratio the level of fouling differed between the e na2so4 cp pvdf and efap systems for reasons consistent with the principles of membrane fouling fig 8 g j show sem images of the membrane surface after a simple chemical clean the surface cnt ppy layer was cleaner under the efap system consistent with its efficient flux recovery ratio the lower rir may have made fouling easier to remove 3 5 energy consumption energy consumption is an important issue in membrane filtration coupled with sr aops the energy consumption of pvdf filtration cp pvdf filtration e na2so4 cp pvdf and efap was 0 3125 0 2978 0 1798 kwh m 3 and 0 1193 kwh m 3 respectively when using 2 3 ma cm 2 current intensity fig s15 so the efap system required less than half as much energy to mitigate membrane fouling and remove cbz demonstrating favorable energy consumption 3 6 the performance of efap system in real world water samples evaluation of the performance of the efap system in real world water samples was essential surface water was collected from the jialing river in chongqing and along with tap water water quality parameters shown in table s6 was used to prepare simulated wastewater which were passed through 0 45 µm membrane filters before use we tested if the efap system could remove the organic matter in the actual water body as shown in the fig s16 the efap system had a good removal performance on the different organic matters in the surface water and tap water moreover bsa flux decline in surface water was not noticeably different from ultrapure water in the efap system fig s17 flux decline was slower in the tap water this could be attributed to chlorine ions in tap water which may be transformed to active chlorine and oxidize the bsa surface the slightly faster flux decline observed in surface water is consistent with previous reports it can be explained by inorganic matter sio2 mitigating the deposition of bsa on the membrane surface tian et al 2013 zhao et al 2021 thus the efap system is shown to perform satisfactorily with real world water samples 4 conclusions in this study the effect of efap filtration systems on membrane fouling mitigation and organic matter removal were systematically investigated the cp pvdf membrane acted as a cathode and activated pds to generate so4 oh and 1o2 in the efap system which effectively mitigated membrane fouling and oxidized cbz and the surface active layer could be protected as cathode by electron injection the efap system was observed better than ef na2so4 system in membrane fouling mitigation in the efap system the agglomeration of bsa was caused by the attack of ros including so4 oh and 1o2 which led to an increase in hydraulic radius this attack also increased the free energies between foulant membrane and foulant foulant and resulted in adhesion and deposition being reduced total membrane fouling was thus mitigated producing a looser fouling layer which was easier to remove flux recovery ratio was significantly improved and a cleaner surface was obtained after simple chemical cleaning this coupled system will be an effective method to improve the performance and durability of membrane purification technology
